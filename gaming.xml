			<p>First reported on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, it's been said that Ballistic Moon, the developer behind the Until Dawn Remake, is now "effectively closed," according to unnamed sources that have knowledge of the ongoing situation. This comes after layoffs that took place in September 2024, where approximately 40 employees were let go. Those who were kept on at the company were only there so that they could provide post-launch support for Until Dawn once it was released in October.</p>
<p>After the release of Until Dawn in October, the company then laid off more staff in December 2024, albeit quietly. During this layoff period, around 20 of the developers lost their jobs. Those who are aware of the situation say that only the studio's founders remain, with the possibility of a handful of employees "at most." The sources have said that there are no employees in public relations, development, or marketing.</p>
<p>Compared to the original Until Dawn, the remake didn't perform quite as well, with a lot of people complaining about the visual changes made to the characters, including the filters and colors that the game had, with them being changed in the remake. However, the game did have a lot of positives, including a new audio score, improved feelings of dread, new endings, and new narrative for players to explore. On Metacritic, the game received a Metascore of 70 and a User Score of 6.5.</p>
<p>Since the game's release, those who have played the game have left comments and feedback for the developers about the bugs they have found in-game and <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-pc-remake-has-a-broken-ray-tracing-experience-amd-fsr-3-doesnt-work-at-all/">possible patches</a> that need to be made. However, as there are now no developers left, the game can't receive any updates. One source goes on to say, "The studio has effectively closed now."</p>
<p>So far, no one truly knows what is going on with Ballistic Moon, and whether the studio is now in some sort of hiatus, or whether it will go on to close down officially. It's been alleged that the owners of Ballistic Moon have been searching for funding and pitching new projects but without much luck in securing any funding or a publisher for new IP.</p>
<p>"Sony said after the game they might greenlight more funding for updates, but it looks like they didn't," said one source.</p>
<p>When people were asked about the working conditions at the studio, most who responded said that the studio was generally a good place to work in, with positive words spoken about the teams. However, there was an issue of unpaid overtime, with one former employee saying it was equal to "weeks" of unpaid work, where they were then "rewarded" with redundancies across the board.</p>
<p>As of yet, there has been no official comment from Ballistic Moon, and the status of the company is currently undisclosed. Should Ballistic Moon release an official statement, it will be added to this as an update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hero-forge-custom-dice-review-perfect-dice-set-for-your-favorite-miniature<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're in the market for customer player character minis for D&amp;D, Pathfinder, or any other TTRPG chances are you've heard of Hero Forge. With an in-depth character editor and recently introduced color options you can build your mini as if it was a video game character and have it 3D printed to your exact specifications. Hero Forge didn't think they had taken the level of personalization far enough and has now moved into dice making, with the added spin that you can include character elements within these resin dice.</p>

<p>This project (which will be coming to Kickstarter soon) lets a player build out their custom character, affix them with a variety of weapons and trinkets, and then take what makes that character so unique, and put it inside dice that you can then roll with them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-dice-tower.jpg?itok=HGtqGGDd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-dice-tower.jpg?itok=rgZjizGN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here you can see the Frogfolk's head, arm, and top hat encased in dice</figcaption></figure><p>For many dice hoarders out there the concept of a set of dice to match your characters aesthetic isn't new, this has just been taken to a whole new level</p>

<p>In the lead up to this Kickstarter Hero Forge sent over a character they had created (in both Medium and Large size) as well as a set of dice for that character, and an oversized D20 for us to take a look at the end result.</p>

<p>The character is a frog humanoid – perhaps a Ribbet from Daggerheart, or a Grippli in Pathfinder – with all kinds of accessories including but not limited to full armor, a top hat, a sword in it's top hat, a sack, and a frog inside it's sack is a barbarian out of a steampunk fever dream.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice.jpg?itok=EDnNn7QQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice.jpg?itok=gblBUDyR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Being so vivid in his look has made his transferral to dice quite unique though. The dice I received have the following components in them:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">The D20 and Oversized D20 contain the characters full head including it's wild mustache and flailing tongue</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D12, a barbarian's favorite dice, shows the great axe with a fun explosion effect on the blade</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D10 features the frog making an angry face with a storm cloud above it's head</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D8 contains the top hat prop</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D6 includes the frog's flexing arm and dumbbells</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D4 contains the small frog from the character's sack</li>
</ul><p>I'm a huge fan of what Hero Forge is doing here, letting you be able to truly create unique dice for your character. Things like damage dice holding the mini of what is doing the damage is also a lot of fun. A Bard could have their lute be inside a D6, ready to give inspiration to a fellow party member. There's no end to fun symbolism to add to your dice.</p>

<h2>The Idea Is Almost There But There Are Some Issues</h2>

<p>While I like the idea of the end result, I will say that at the moment it's not quite polished enough. An issue that a number of the dice I received faces, especially the smaller ones, is that instead of maintaing a clear color they end up with a tint of the object in the dice.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-d4-and-d20-color-comparison.jpg?itok=xXjdz0Aj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-d4-and-d20-color-comparison.jpg?itok=lqeZaXKx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Comparing the dice you can see how the hazyness has led to the resin seemingly shifting color</figcaption></figure><p>For my group of dice I can see this most clearly in the frog inhabited D4, which from afar has a far more intense green tint.or the murky brown/green of the D6. Of course the opposite is true for the oversized D20 which looks the clearest.</p>

<p>Talking with Hero Forge about this, as I wanted to verify the green tint on the D4 wasn't an intentional choice, they explained it's an issue with the light refraction. Not only were they able to clearly explain to me what was happening, but let me know they've already been working on a solution and seeing improved results.</p>

<p>When Hero Forge first began to show off their colored prints, I enjoyed the idea but I felt it was still a far cry from having them printed and painting them at home. Seeing their improvements from past colored minis to some I've seen at my D&amp;D table and with the Frog Barbarian is what gives me confidence that Hero Forge will continue to improve upon this.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice_0.jpg?itok=Gb7Aa8Sg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice_0.jpg?itok=yAHSIRzL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What I Didn't Get To See In The Hero Forge Dice Process</h2>

<p>While I got to get up close and personal with this strange frog guy and their perfectly matched dice there were parts of the process that I wasn't able to see. Namely the picking of the objects to go in the dice, picking the size and number of the dice, and picking the lettering.</p>

<p>I was advised that this will be similar to how you can pick and choose kitbashing elements from their current miniature maker, but now you can place those item in your dice.</p>

<p>I was pleased to learn that the lettering can also have their coloring, size, and location changed. One of my largest pet-peeves with dice is not being able to read them as they're rolled onto the table and being able to craft a set of dice for a predominantly green character and being able to make the colors a fiery red to contract will do a lot to help that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-xl-d20.jpg?itok=tWA8-0L7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-xl-d20.jpg?itok=rX1ZnM1i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This photo made me realize how much time and effort goes into taking nice photos of objects inside D20s....</figcaption></figure><h2>Hero Forge Custom Dice Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The concept of the idea here is incredible. Take Hero Forge and their incredible ability to print custom high-quality miniatures in full color or the paint at home, and then take the elements you enjoy the most about that character and put them in dice.</p>

<p>It truly makes each character and their corresponding dice feel like part of a complete set in a way that you just can't get unless you're doing it yourself (which will take a lot more time, effort, and money.)</p>

<p>The only reason for now that I would say to hold off would be if you're not just after something unique in your dice, but also clarity around those objects. The refraction definitely takes some shine off such a fantastic and unique product, but if the issue is being attacked similarly to how they've improved their color printing then I'm sure these products will just grow better with time.</p>

"This could be it."</p><p dir="ltr">It's a quite different answer from one Druckmann gave a year ago in the Grounded II: Making The Last of Us: Part II documentary. In it, Druckmann made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">The Last of Us: Part 3 sound likely</a>. He said at the time there is probably "one more chapter to this story," and that for years he had been unable to find a concept for a third game in the series. However, that had recently changed, with an idea that Druckmann said would "be its own thing" yet feature a "throughline" that would potentially connect all three games.</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't have a story," Druckmann said in the documentary. "But I do have a concept that is, to me, as exciting as [Part] 1, exciting as 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">cancelation of The Last of Us multiplayer game in December 2023</a>, Naughty Dog confirmed it was working on two single-player projects. One of those games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-the-next-very-different-naughty-dog-game/1100-6528421/" data-ref-id="1100-6528421">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, was revealed during The Game Awards</a> last year. While many fans had assumed The Last of Us: Part III was one of the two games Naughty Dog was working on, that might not be the case.</p><p dir="ltr">Even if The Last of Us: Part III doesn't come to fruition, there will still be new aspects to the story for fans to discover as part of the HBO adaptation of Part II. In the Variety interview, Druckmann said there will be a number of changes compared to the game, calling it a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-is-a-different-version-of-the-games-story-matrix-actor-joins-cast/1100-6529924/" data-ref-id="1100-6529924">"different version" of the story</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I love the changes that we've made," he said. "It's a different version of that story, but its DNA is in there. Maybe more than excited, I'm really curious what their [fans] reaction will be.</p><p dir="ltr">Druckmann previously said that even if the show should last for several more seasons, it <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-hbo-pedro-pascal-bella-ramsey-interview-1235290103/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will not go beyond the events of the games</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us Season 2 debuts April 17 on HBO and will consist of seven episodes total, with the story picking up five years later as Joel and Ellie find themselves growing apart following the events of Season 1.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently I went to <a href="https://canjamglobal.com/shows/nyc2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CanJam NYC</a>, a headphone convention that took place on the sixth floor of a Marriott in Times Square. Can Jam rocks because it’s full of old dudes and shut-ins with tons of opinions, some exceedingly arbitrary and others backed by painstaking, objective measurement. You’ll see vendors big and small, from up-and-coming dorks who 3D print accessories in their home to big players in the industry. It was in that context that I decided to compare the best the audio world has to offer to two of the most recommended headphones around: the classic Sennheiser HD 650/HD 6XX and a relatively new upstart, the Fiio FT1. It turns out that everyone is correct, and both of these headphones rock.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Can Jam time.</figcaption></figure><p>I should contextualize this by saying that there are, of course, better headphones. And unlike speakers, where the consensus is that they should have a ruler flat frequency response, how people feel about headphones can differ wildly based on personal taste and individual biology. Psychoacoustics is incredibly complicated; there are objectively bad and good headphones, and there is tons of research into what the largest percentage of people will enjoy, but people are also tremendously fickle when it comes to what “sounds good” to them.&nbsp;</p><p>A headphone convention is like a tasters’ platter for obscenely expensive gear; you wander from booth to booth sampling a bit of everything and seeing what agrees with you. Assuming that sharing floor models with a bunch of dorks (complimentary) doesn’t gross you out, it’s a fantastic opportunity to try headphones you may never buy in a million years and see exactly how far your money can go.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The Headphones.com testing rig was there if you wanted to measure your headphones. </figcaption></figure><p>There was a lot to be excited about at Can Jam. I got to try closed back headphones from French company Focal, and they were just as clean and defined as people made them out to be. Foxtex was there showing off their new T50RPmk4 RP, the latest revision to a headphone with a lineage so complex that several other companies only exist because they modded them. YouTuber turned IEM tuner Crinacle was there showing off his line of IEMs, including the new “Meta,” and they were indeed beautifully tuned, although not yet for sale. The Headphones.com booth was inviting, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DMS3TV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DMS</a> is an aggressively nice person to talk to. I even got to try a bunch of goofy 3D printed meme headphones I had seen making the rounds on reddit, and some cans from Dan Clark that were wonderful but required a very powerful amp and were too rich for my blood. There were wonderful boutique magnetic planars from severe German companies that cost more than a used car.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The BASS Medallion (and other new headphones) at CanJam NYC" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMUHDY0haCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There were countless tiny rooms and booths, so much to explore, and with all that choice I did the most basic thing I could think of: I went to the Sennheiser booth.</p><p><strong>SENNHEISER HD 650/6XX</strong></p><figure></figure><p>In that small space, Sennheiser had a significant presence, with several small tables all laid out in Apple Store fashion. I know what Sennheisers sound like; I have heard many pairs in my life and have always found their house sound to be agreeable. What I wanted to hear is what Sennheisers sounded like next to countless headphones outside of my price range.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>I listened to most of their entire range, including their new closed back HD 620S, which sounded perfectly fine to me although not life changing. I finally got to try the infamous HD 800 S, one of the most beautiful and intricate sets of cans I have ever seen at that scale. Unlike a lot of the boutique, niche headphones there, I was able to put them on and say “Yeah, I can hear that these cost $1599.” Though the sound signature is not everyone’s cup of tea, few headphones can match the gargantuan soundstage. While I listened, my girlfriend found a pair of Sennheiser HD 650s. “I like these a lot,” she told me. “Are we getting these?” She had picked one of the most popular headphones of all time.&nbsp;</p><p>If there can be any agreement on what a person’s first “real” pair of headphones should be outside of a pair of inexpensive IEMs or some Koss, it is one of Sennheiser’s Open Back HD 600 series – the Sennheiser HD 600, HD 650, HD 660 S2 and the <a href="https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/sennheiser/hd-490-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new HD 490 Pro</a> (which I count here despite <a href="https://newsroom.sennheiser.com/sonova-acquires-sennheiser-consumer-business-pnd0nr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being from the pro division</a>).&nbsp; Sennheiser has sold an untold number of these over the years, starting in 1997 with the HD 600. There are distinct differences between models and everyone has preferences. Many people prefer the HD 600 to the HD 650,&nbsp; but ultimately they are all quite close to each other. The model my girlfriend picked up was the HD 650: It’s neutral to slightly warm, comfortable, oddly durable and thoroughly agreeable.&nbsp;</p><p>Several years back Sennheiser collaborated with direct-to-consumer brand Drop on a variant of the HD 650 called the Sennheiser HD 6XX that is functionally the exact same headphone except it costs roughly $200 instead of $400. This has remained one of the single best deals in the headphone space since its introduction, to the point where dorks get nauseated by the suggestion, but they can go to hell because for most people it’s a fantastic headphone to start and perhaps even end on.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>There are, of course, caveats. The biggest Achilles heel of the HD 600 series remains the pads, which sound and feel lovely but get compressed within a year. Headphone pads are tremendously important to how a pair of cans sounds and should be refreshed every once in a while as they degrade and compress. There’s an entire industry of aftermarket headphone pads to improve the comfort and (ideally but not always) sound of a headphone. It is notoriously hard to find a pair of aftermarket pads for these headphones that last for a while without meaningfully making the beloved sound signature worse. I have heard good things about these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkDKpssVm-Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high end ZMF pads</a> and I <a href="https://audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/best-possible-replacement-pads-for-hd650%E2%80%99s-in-2022.38652/post-1362343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered these inexpensive Aliexpress pads</a> on a stranger’s recommendation, but for the most part you can’t go wrong getting legit Sennheiser pads every now and then.&nbsp;</p><p>The HD 600 series are slightly difficult to “drive” if you have never had high-quality headphones before, and they benefit from having a really nice, substantially powerful headphone amplifier. Luckily there’s no shortage of&nbsp; cheap, high quality headphone amplifiers these days. The HD 650/6XX are also open back headphones, meaning they don’t block out much external noise and sound can bleed out of the side. These are not the best pick for streaming or voiceover; they were never meant for that, although I’m pretty sure Northernlion has some Sennheisers and uses them without too much difficulty because he’s a man of refined taste. Most of the really good-sounding headphones, as a general rule, tend to be open back or semi-open because it’s way harder to make a closed back pair of headphones sound nearly as good. The HD 650 doesn’t have a particularly strong bass extension, which is fine for a pair of reference headphones. People sometimes call its sound “veiled,” but that seems to come down to personal preference and can be EQ’d. The imaging is not the greatest, and you don’t get the same sense of space as other headphones, but there are few headphones that sound so thoroughly agreeable and measure so well out of the box.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>In that small booth I went back and forth between the HD 800 S and the HD 650. Without question there was nothing quite like the gargantuan stage of those $1600 headphones. But I asked myself: were they eight times as good as the HD 6XX? I can honestly say no, but few headphones really are.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FiiO FT1</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Closed back headphones are tremendously hard to get right. Part of this is the physics of sound in an enclosed space, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_SjaprrZCI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of it is personal biology</a>. For a long time the closed back segment has remained an under-served market particularly in the midrange of around $150 to $200. There are a handful of closed backs that I enjoy with caveats, but mostly those are for studio use like tracking vocals and editing video, not for personal enjoyment. But in the last year or so, a Chinese company named FiiO that has mostly been known for their amplifiers, DACS and portable music players put out a pair of headphones that kind of blew everyone away and disrupted the market thoroughly: the FiiO FT1.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Why do closed backs suck? (but I still love them)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_SjaprrZCI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>DMS actually has a pretty good video on why closed back headphones suck a lot of the time. </figcaption></figure></div><p>The FiiO FT1 is a shockingly well-made pair of headphones with some minor flaws. It is not to be confused with the FiiO FT1 Pro, which is a totally different open back headphone.The drivers are large: 60mm and made of biocellulose. The cups are made of durable wood in two varieties, Beech and American Walnut. I don’t think either is particularly showy, and I would love to customize or paint the cups, which someone has <a href="https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/fiio-ft1.27467/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already in a beautiful shade of dark blue.</a> These cans are bass monsters, a quality which I mostly do not enjoy in headphones, but they are so well tuned and the bass they put out is so beautifully detailed that I don’t mind. The pads are plush and fit well, a hybrid of leather on the outside and velour inside, and the clamping force is perfect. FiiO use removable cables for this release, which should be mandated by law on all new headphones, and they generously come with both a balanced and unbalanced pair cable. There’s also a fairly well-made rigid carrying case, all for the fairly low price of about $150.</p><figure></figure><p>The FT1 has some imperfections. The early models have a defect with the screw connecting the headband that caused the cans to fall apart. FiiO has owned up to this and has already been addressed in new models, changing the construction, although you should still check yours if you buy one to see which version you got. The other is that the cables, though very solidly made, are slightly microphonic, meaning that if they rub against your chest you can hear it. There is no shortage of high quality microphone cables on Aliexpress and so neither of these are dealbreakers (I have heard good things about Openheart cables and put an order in after getting them). I have read that some people also find the strap uncomfortable (I don’t personally), but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FiiO/comments/1gfcwa9/capra_audio_comfort_headstrap_mod_for_fiio_ft1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s an aftermarket strap mod from Capra Audio to alleviate tension</a> that I plan on getting soon.</p><figure></figure><p>You know something is probably a good deal when you start seeing “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1h5u1dq/fiio_ft1_seem_way_overhyped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is X overhyped?</a>” on the internet, and the FT1 is no exception. The headphone reviewers I keep an eye on, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtoN_lwg3o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DMS at The Headphone Show</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/cc2pkvfhjYE?si=vov35snDWJ8vNDDJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Z Reviews</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/r8nama8l9qY?si=s7FaOKBZXP__C6ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gadegry Tech</a>, all <a href="https://unheardlab.com/2024/10/28/review-of-fiio-ft1-rightfully-hyped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sang</a> these phones’ praises. Objectively they measure well, with some pointing out they’re similar but frankly better tuned than the established AKG K361/K371 and definitely better built than those headphones at about the same price. Even the <a href="https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/measurements/fiio/ft1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harshest</a> <a href="https://boizoff.com/language/en/fiio-ft1-headphones-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews</a> could not deny that they are an incredible value for the money, which is saying a lot for any closed back headphone.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t have a B&amp;K 5128 measurement rig to test headphones, although I did pester the good people at the headphones.com booth to use theirs on some freak headphones I have a personal soft spot for. I only have the flawed tool of my ears and <a href="http://squig.link/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several online measurements</a> to go on, so I went over to the FiiO booth and tried a pair. My expectations were high and surprisingly met. Despite being bassy, I could not deny that they were beautifully tuned and felt better than many of the more expensive closed back headphones I had tried that day. The sound is somewhat V shaped and fun. There is slightly too much sharpness in the presence section, but nothing egregious that can’t be EQ’d, and fairly I have heard far worse when from closed back headphones. “You guys should be proud of this one,” I told the reps at the booth.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>A gift to myself</strong></p><p>Within a few days of leaving the show, I decided to purchase both the HD 6XX and the FT1, as both a birthday gift to myself and to commemorate a decade of not drinking. To be honest I would have gotten a pair of the Sennheisers years ago if I didn't already have a pair of Hifiman HE400i’s from 2018, but those had grown dog-eared over the last six years, and my girlfriend’s face lit up when I mentioned the Sennheisers.&nbsp; The HD 6XX often fluctuates in price between $180 and $220 on Drop.com and I had luckily hit it at the dip. A few days later both headphones arrived. The box of the HD 6XX was appropriately utilitarian, while the FT1 was replete with accessories and eager to please. I put them through their paces – it’s one thing to hear a pair of headphones in a crowded show floor, and another to live with them.&nbsp;</p><p>Living with the Sennheisers was as natural as I had always imagined it would be, and they are now the default for casual work and listening. This was an inevitability I had planned for years. They simply sound “correct,” natural, and relaxed, and require very little futzing. They can withstand abuse and have an iconic look. Meanwhile, I have grown increasingly fond of FT1s as time has gone by – they’re energetic and fun and take an EQ wonderfully. I usually dislike the exact sound signature that the FT1s are targeting, but there’s just something so satisfying and well-executed about their sound, particularly after taming some of the harsher frequencies. These are also fairly sensitive headphones, so you technically can use them with your phone and a cheap dongle without too much worry. I would probably not use them for studio work, but perhaps that’s an arbitrary distinction. Both the Sennheiser HD 6XX and the FiiO FT1 were worth every single dollar, and neither was a replacement for the other. I felt satisfied.</p><p><strong>Mid-fi and diminishing returns</strong></p><figure></figure><p>To the extent that I have a goal when I write about gear, it is never to write about the most expensive or glamorous tool in its category. Rich people are boring, and spending a lot of money on something because it is nice is almost never interesting unless there is a degree of DIY or craft to the endeavor. I always try to ask myself, “What is the best choice for the average Aftermath reader? What is an affordable object they will treasure for a long time?” Both the proven Sennheiser HD 6XX and the disruptive FiiO FT1 are that rare object. The former is classic and timeless, part of a lineage that spans decades. The latter is booming and changes the market. It has demolished everything in its specific price and category, and an entry that firmly establishes FiiO as a force to be reckoned with in the closed back headphone space.</p><p>In a hall full of beautiful headphones, including those HD 800s with their gargantuan soundstage, I came to accept the value of something being just good enough to become eternal. Headphones are a hobby you can spend an obscene amount of money on in the pursuit of perfection, but sometimes it’s nice to stop while you’re ahead. Sometimes hype and the boring wisdom of crowds is real. The sky is blue, water is wet, and the Sennheiser HD 6XX and FiiO FT1 are damn near impossible to beat for the money.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/deliver-at-all-costs-demo"><h3>Deliver At All Costs Is *CRASH* A Great *SMASH* Demo *HOUSE FALLS DOWN*</h3></a><p>Yeah yeah I'll finish the first mission, right after I *DRIVES THROUGH GAS STATION*</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/valkyrae-cinna-emiru-attacked-amouranth-robbed-twitch-kick"><h3>Three Big Twitch Streamers Attacked, Another Robbed At Gunpoint, On Same Night</h3></a><p>Multiple instances of streamers in severe peril have the Twitch community reckoning with sexism and security</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>There's a whole lot of The Last of Us coming your way next month. To begin with, PC players will finally be able to get their hands on the 2020 sequel thanks to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a>, which will be released on the platform on April 4 via Steam and the Epic Games Store. The port is being handled by Nixxes Software and Iron Galaxy.</p>
<p>Then there's the second season of the acclaimed HBO TV series featuring Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. This new season will include a portion of the story seen in Part II and start airing on April 13, giving you just enough time to experience the game's version of the story, which is said to be quite different.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Variety</a>, series creator Neil Druckmann explained:</p>
<p><em>I love the changes that we’ve made. It's a different version of that story, but its DNA is in there. Maybe more than excited, I’m really curious what their reaction will be.</em></p>
<p>Some of the changes include changing Abby's character to accommodate the difference between her character in the game, who's very powerful physically, and actress Kaitlyn Dever, who's far slimmer. On this subject, Druckmann said:</p>
<p><em>Kaitlyn Dever wanted to work with us; we wanted to work with her. It's not worth passing it up to continue a search that might never bear fruit to find someone that matches the physicality.</em></p>
<p>Truth be told, many fans had hoped to see Dever cast as Ellie before the creatives settled on Bella Ramsey. On the other hand, there was the matter of age, since Ramsey was much closer to the character than Dever. This might be why they settled on her instead but still wanted to work with an excellent actress like Dever, though that's speculation on our part.</p>
<p>There will be some additions to the plot of The Last of Us Part II. For example, the character Eugene is only named in the game, but he'll be seen (played by actor Joe Pantoliano) in this new season of the TV show. Druckmann commented:</p>
<p><em>I get excited when I see these opportunities. I'm like, ‘Oh, I don’t know Eugene that well!’ The story we told in the game was somewhat superficial. The way this character comes in really gets to the heart of Joel and Ellie and their relationship.</em></p>
<p>According to showrunner Craig Mazin, there may be space for one or two more seasons. But what about The Last of Us Part III? Well, Druckmann didn't give much hope to fans:</p>
<p><em>I was waiting for this question. I guess the only thing I would say is don't bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.</em></p>
<p>Looking at the history of Naughty Dog, it's entirely possible he's not lying. The Californian studio is known for abandoning its successful IPs over time, starting with Crash, then Jak and Daxter, and then Uncharted. At the latest The Game Awards, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> its new sci-fi franchise, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. If that game sells well enough, they might work on a sequel for it instead of going back to The Last of Us. We've prepared a little poll to gauge your opinion on what they should do. Let us know your take in the comments!</p>

First, these JRPGs still have the juice, especially <em>Suikoden II</em>. The snappy turn-based combat and open-ended collect-em-all-fest holds up 30 years later, with decent storytelling and even better character writing. </p><p>Second, both games have survived the journey from low-resolution 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9 HD <em>mostly</em> intact and looking better than ever, especially in <em>Suikoden II</em>. The character sprites remain perfectly pixelated-looking without any smoothed-over upscaling effects or muddy silhouettes. The backgrounds, never a series highlight, look crisp and get the job done. The tiling of its top-down world can feel a bit bland and repetitive, but certain scenes with more detailed shadows and lighting really pop. Most importantly, the battles still look and feel great, at least to the eyes of someone who grew up with these games back in the ‘90s. Things are less great in <em>Suikoden I</em> where some environments look weirdly flat and empty.&nbsp;</p><figure id="" data-id="d7e22e5989ceecc9e18004a394b766ee" data-recommend-id="image://d7e22e5989ceecc9e18004a394b766ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters fight a bug in battle.

The first game is about 20 hours long and focuses mainly on recruiting characters to aid you in your fight against the evil Scarlet Moon Empire, while the second is longer, much more narratively dense, and a bit more morally grey and complex. </p><p>Both are propelled along by random encounters and boss fights, toil made much better than in some other games thanks to <em>Suikoden</em>’s old-school but flashy turn-based formula and the fact that you’re always finding new characters with unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses to fight alongside. Instead of just three or four characters, you get to fight with six, with front and back rows as well as synergistic combo attacks adding to the strategy. None of it felt  revolutionary at the time like the multi-cam cinematic quality of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> battles, but it’s crunchy and well-balanced as far as conventional turn-based combat goes.</p><figure id="" data-id="ec7665b9604a75378ac2a78cc4160011" data-recommend-id="image://ec7665b9604a75378ac2a78cc4160011" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character runs across a town.

Aside from the graphical overhaul and updated script (the original localized versions were far from perfect), there are standard additions like auto-saves and a menu log that keeps a record of what people have told you. There’s no mini-map but you can sprint from the start now. You can speed up fights to auto-battle through them quickly, though weirdly the music speeds up during this as well. Plus there are optional difficulty modes now. The ability to turn off timed events is coming in a day-one update (certain characters can’t be recruited if the in-game clock ticks past a certain point). </p><p>It’s unfortunate that you can’t speed up the game outside of battle, and it feels like a missed opportunity not to have the option to turn on the game’s old graphics and aspect ratio for enthusiasts who want to revisit the original experience on PS1. The inventory systems in both games are also still a pain (though not nearly as clunky as how they were left in the recent <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>). An in-game gallery, museum, or other historical feature would have been a nice bonus as well, especially for the $50 price tag. The bar keeps rising for modern remasters of all-time classics, and it certainly feels like there was room for <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster </em>to be a more comprehensive package. </p><p>It doesn’t make any major missteps, though, which can’t be said for every PS1 JRPG that gets an HD makeover. <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</em> presents one good game and one excellent one (it’s sacrilege to say but if you’re short on time I think you should just play<em> II</em>) with everything a modern player needs to enjoy two genre classics (well, except for maybe an option to turn off random encounters). Konami has already announced an anime adaptation of <em>Suikoden II </em>and a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suikoden-star-leap-trailer-gacha-mobile-konami-date-1851767567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suikoden-star-leap-trailer-gacha-mobile-konami-date-1851767567">mobile spin-off called<em> Star Leap </em>that looks beautiful but has gacha microtransactions</a></span>. If this burgeoning <em>Suikoden</em> renaissance is successful, though, maybe we’ll finally get<em> Suikoden VI</em>, or at least <em>Suikoden III</em> as a PS2 classic on PlayStation 5.  </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So far, Ballistic Moon's only game is 2024's remake of Until Dawn, which brought the beloved PS4 choose-your-own-adventure horror adventure game to Unreal Engine 5. It featured a recomposed musical score, changed the gameplay camera to a third-person perspective rather than a fixed-camera one, and added a post-credit scene teasing a sequel.

Ballistic Moon had actually <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-lays-off-several-staff" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">laid off some developers</a> prior to the Until Dawn remake's release last October, although this report explains that many of the 20 or so remaining developers were cut in December.</p><p>If you want to play Ballistic Moon's take on Until Dawn, it's available on PC and PS5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/not-another-last-of-us-game-druckmann-ambiguous-suggest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent interview with Variety, Neil Druckmann suggested that The Last of Us might be over and done with. He said, ‘Don’t bet on there being more Last of Us.’ It’s a rather ambiguous statement, as it’s not immediately clear if he’s saying there are no more Last of Us games coming <strong>now</strong> or if The Last of Us Part III will be the final game in the series.</p>



<p>In April, the second season of the award-winning HBO series will drop, more than two years after the first season arrived.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-could-be-it">‘This Could Be It’</h2>



<p>The Last of Us was released in 2013 and has since been remastered and re-released no fewer than 743 times across multiple platforms and generations. In 2020, the follow-up title – aptly named The Last of Us Part II – was released. It was a controversial title in many ways, but it was still a masterpiece of a game that turned heads worldwide.</p>



<p>On April 3, Part II’s newest iteration, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, will be released on PC.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent segment with Variety</a>, Neil Druckmann talked about the second season of the Emmy Award-winning show. He sat down with Craig Mazin, with whom he has pioneered the creation of one of the best live-action adaptations in gaming history.</p>



<p>In one section, Druckmann answers the question about the existence of The Last of Us Part III, which has been rumoured on and off but never confirmed. When asked about the possibility of the game surfacing, he said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was waiting for this question.</p>



<p>I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us’. This could be it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s ever so slightly ambiguous. It could mean that there’s nothing more planned after a third game, or it could mean that we’re stuck with a two-game series that’ll never again see the light of day.</p>



<p>In December 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-officially-cancelled/">an online multiplayer game</a> set in The Last of Us’ universe was cancelled, but in 2024, the studio ‘teased’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-teases-new-chapter-for-the-last-of-us/">a new chapter</a> in the franchise. That was before Naughty Dog appeared at The Game Awards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/">to reveal Intergalactic</a>, an all-new IP that came completely out of left field.</p>



<p>Do you think The Last of Us should end on Part II? It’s no big secret that the team plans to drag out the television series and cover the second game across <strong>two </strong>seasons, so we’ve got Last of Us content in the pipeline for a while, but would you rather play it than watch it?</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments.</p>

			<p>It's been a while since we heard any news about Marvel 1943: Rise of the Hydra. The action/adventure game in development at Skydance New Media and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-to-be-published-by-plaion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to be published by Plaion</a> should launch this year, but there have been no further details on the release timing, and some fans have been worried about a delay.</p>
<p>According to Black Panther voice actor Khary Payton, though, the team is still doing its best to release it this Holiday season. <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to The Direct</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>We’re still working. We’re planning on 2025… We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited. To be playing him in the video game, playing his grandfather, be playing a version of Black Panther, and looking on there and seeing that it's me… It's like the most photo realistic… We want people to play this game and have the entire family, sit on the sofa and watch it like they're watching 'Game of Thrones,' or 'The Walking Dead,' or something. We’re looking for just an incredible cinematic experience for everybody, and I pinch myself.</em></p>
<p>Payton is definitely right about the game's photorealism. The developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> the impressive Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals during Epic's Unreal Engine GDC 2024 live stream.</p>
<p>The development team is helmed by none other than Amy Hennig, who's renowned in the industry for her work on Legacy of Kain, Soul Reaver, Uncharted, and Battlefield: Hardline. She was famously developing the Star Wars game codenamed Project Ragtag at Visceral Games before the studio was shut down and the project canceled.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/captain-america-black-panther-wwii-amy-hennig-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in September 2022, Marvel 1943: Rise of the Hydra is set in Nazi-occupied Paris during World War II. It involves Steve Rogers (Captain America) forming an uneasy alliance with Azzuri (Black Panther), the king of Wakanda. Other playable characters include Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones and Nanali, leader of the Wakandan Spy Network.</p>

The remarkable Hulu series is set in a world where rich and powerful people designed a utopian city called Paradise inside of a Colorado mountain in order to survive an extinction-level event that has ravaged Earth. The illusion of safety is shattered when President of the United States Cal Bradford (James Marsden) is mysteriously murdered in a place where crime isn’t supposed to exist, and it’s up to his Secret Service bodyguard Xavier Collins (Sterling K. Brown) to find out who did it. Samantha “Sinatra” Redmon (Julianne Nicholson), the brains behind the entire Paradise project, turns out to be a worthy adversary who’s trying to do the right thing in the absolute worst possible ways.</p><p><em>Paradise</em> does a lot of things well, but its shining achievement is showing how much of a badass Sterling K. Brown can be.</p><p>Known for his portrayals of stern but loving parents on his breakout show <em>This Is Us</em> and in the severely underrated film <em>Waves</em>, the Emmy-winning actor finds himself in some of the most intense situations of his illustrious career thanks to the Hulu series. Without shooting that many bullets or killing that many people, Brown channels the same emotional control that made his earlier characters feel three-dimensional to perform a role at the intersection of grief and anger. He isn’t a badass just for the sake of being one. He’s a badass because it’s the right thing to do. And these are his most badass moments from the first season of <em>Paradise</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-recommend-id="image://3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1687" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Ser Baffo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-recommend-id="image://3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1687" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a testament to how wildly the show’s character dynamics shifted by the end of the season, Agent Collins risking his life to protect the president from an assassin’s bullet in the first episode isn’t even a Top 5 most badass moment by the end of the season. While speaking to the press, Collins shields the president from a crazed boom operator who slides a gun out of his boom mic in an inventive but unsuccessful assassination attempt. In the moment, it was incredible watching Collins’ super-secret agent senses slow down time, allowing him to effectively react to the shot before it happens, and seeing him so focused on doing his job that he doesn’t realize he’s been shot until the President tells him. Unfortunately, revelations from later in the season  knock this badass moment down a few pegs, and it also suffers from not being presented from the boom operator’s perspective, which would have placed it squarely in the top 3.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-recommend-id="image://1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown standing guard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown standing guard" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-recommend-id="image://1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown standing guard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There was no sequence in <em>Paradise</em>, or arguably any other show so far this year, as nerve wracking and suffocatingly intense as the one in which everyone in the White House realizes the severity of the natural disaster they’ve been watching take out entire countries. The seventh episode is centered on the chaotic day when the president let’s everyone in America, including the shell-shocked politicians outside the Oval Office, know that he and a few others knew about the cataclysm they’ve been watching, essentially telling them that death is inevitable for most of them. A true badass can oscillate between emotions at the drop of a dime, and Brown exhibited some of his most emotionally visceral acting yet as he was frantically worrying about the safety of his wife in Atlanta while also being tasked with getting the president through the mob of his hostile colleagues ready to tear him apart for keeping them in the dark. </p><p> He runs back to grab the briefcase the president needs to launch a nuclear attack seconds after the last person holding it was shot in the back of the head, then scurries to the helicopter without a single blink, tear, or even dust from the propeller entering his eyes. That’s a stone cold badass who unfortunately did it in service of a plot he’d quickly learn may have cost him the love of his life. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-recommend-id="image://9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James Marsden (left) explaining something to Sterling K Brown (right)" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="James Marsden (left) explaining something to Sterling K Brown (right)" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-recommend-id="image://9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James Marsden (left) explaining something to Sterling K Brown (right)" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Verbally reprimanding your boss in front of his subordinates could get you fired from McDonald’s. Doing that to the President of the United States, and as a result delaying his evacuation from an extinction-level disaster, could (and probably should) get you shot before your lips formed an exclamation point. None of that matters to tearfully enraged Agent Collins after he finally realizes the President knew Collins’ wife was doomed from the beginning of the day. As he and the leader of the free world exchange barbs over the reality of the situation, Collins looks him dead in his dreamy blue eyes and mocks the president’s performative bravery for telling the American people the world was already ending before they had a chance to prepare like he did. He then makes the impossible choice to accept his wife’s death in order to be there for his children, etching this in the Sterling K. Brown badass hall of fame.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-recommend-id="image://03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown holding a gun to Sinatra's head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown holding a gun to Sinatra's head" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-recommend-id="image://03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown holding a gun to Sinatra's head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, Samantha “Sinatra” Redmon was a grieving mother who turned the grief of her son’s death into her life’s purpose to protect the ones she loved from a dying world, but she’s deserved a bullet in the head since the second episode. That quick shift from distraught to dangerous that I mentioned earlier was at its peak in the 10 seconds Collins went from a puddle of tears to a gun-toting killer after Sinatra implied that she’d accidentally had his daughter killed. This would’ve been a little higher on the list if he put the megalomaniac out of her misery. Unfortunately all he did was distract her long enough with a gun to her head for Sinatra’s own assassin, Jane Driscoll (Nicole Brydon Bloom), to put a bullet in her chest to disable her without killing her. I guess you shouldn’t come between a psycho and their Nintendo Wii.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-recommend-id="image://8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="825" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eerie message in the sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eerie message in the sky" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hulu</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-recommend-id="image://8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="825" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eerie message in the sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are certain things in life that are inherently badass simply because describing them sounds unbelievable. Once Collins was ready to finally come at Sinatra, he called in the craziest favor you can ever ask a neighbor: Leave digital messages in the sky for all to see. In episode six, Collins had the messages “THEY’RE LYING TO YOU,” “DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH?” and “WHO IS SINATRA?” displayed across the sky in crimson red. That alone was a badass move to destabilize Sinatra’s influence over the community. It became genius when the only way she could have it removed was by rebooting the sky. REBOOTING. THE. SKY. That alone accomplished everything he wanted, and she did it for him.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dd1ddb951399f549e32d8555f180c622" data-recommend-id="image://dd1ddb951399f549e32d8555f180c622" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins having an intense conversation over lunch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins having an intense conversation over lunch" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd1ddb951399f549e32d8555f180c622" data-recommend-id="image://dd1ddb951399f549e32d8555f180c622" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins having an intense conversation over lunch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>This Is Us </em>fans are well aware that if you give Brown time to speak uninterrupted about death, he’s going to rip your heart out and wash it with your tears. In the middle of his silent uprising in the sixth episode, Collins cuts through Dr. Gabriela Torabi (Sarah Shahi) trying to talk him out of his dissention with her psychobabble bullshit by vividly comparing Sinatra bringing all of these people to this idyllic city inside a mountain to the way people corral cows  into increasingly smaller spaces until the fight in them is diminished so much that they  “line up single-file and march down a chute to their death.” His delivery is bone-chilling, the analogy is sobering, and the interspersed visuals of Agent Robinson (Krys Marshall) finding Sinatra’s hidden armory during his speech are devastating. Speaking the truth is usually the most badass thing you can do, especially when it’s a matter of life or death.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-recommend-id="image://20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nicole Robinson (left) and Xavier Collins (right) taking out weapons" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nicole Robinson (left) and Xavier Collins (right) taking out weapons" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedell</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-recommend-id="image://20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nicole Robinson (left) and Xavier Collins (right) taking out weapons" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The #4 pick and #2 pick have some overlap, but they’re not quite the same. With the help of Agent Robinson and a bunch of disillusioned Secret Service colleagues, Collins organizes a multifaceted coup of the powers that be. He and his cohorts surreptitiously steal all of the guns the government said didn’t exist, and hack the sky to tell the people being governed that they’ve been lied to, leading Sinatra to initiate the shelter protocol that had all senior officials and their families corralled in a secure location like the cattle he mentioned earlier. While his ultimate plan of imprisoning Sinatra with the rest of the corrupt officials doesn’t succeed, bringing a government to its knees is A-1 badassery. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins looking at coordinates" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins looking at coordinates" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins looking at coordinates" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Guns, blood, and government destabilization require bravery, but nothing is more badass than flying a plane out of a mountain into potentially poisonous air to find your wife who may or may not be alive. After 8 episodes of Collins doing everything from organizing a coup to berating the President of the United States after taking a bullet for him,  Collins commandeered a plane and took off to find his wife based on the secret coordinates the late president left. Season 2 will undoubtedly have him venturing into the unknown while his kids and everyone else he cares for back at Paradise deal with the aftermath of his uprising. No matter where he is, you can count on Collins to be the biggest badass in the vicinity. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Until Dawn Remake developer Ballistic Moon is “effectively closed”. That’s according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that after the layoffs that were publicly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in September 2024</a> took place, roughly 40 employees or so were let go. The remaining staff was kept to offer post-launch support and development on Until Dawn after its October release. In December 2024, however, the company quietly laid off that staff as well, resulting in around 20 more developers losing their job.</p>



<p>Sources say that only the studio’s founders remain and “possibly” a handful of employees “at most”. There are no employees in public relations, marketing, or development left.</p>



<p>“People are sharing bugs they’ve found in the game to make the team aware but there is no one working on patch support for the game anymore,” one source said. “The studio has effectively closed now.”</p>



<p>As far as what happened, those who spoke on the condition of anonymity made it clear that the owners attempted to keep things at Ballistic Moon moving forward. Many said that the owners were actively looking for funding and pitching projects, but couldn’t secure funding or a new publisher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked about Sony publishing another game or future updates to Until Dawn Remake for the studio, one source said it was discussed but never came to fruition.</p>



<p>“Sony said after the game they might greenlight more funding for updates, but looks like they didn’t,” the source said.</p>



<p>Regarding working at the studio, most who spoke said that it was a generally good place to work. Many spoke highly of their teams and the work being done. What they didn’t like, though, were instances of unpaid overtime. One former employee equated it to “weeks” of unpaid work and that the internal announcement of redundancies came after the team had worked overtime.</p>



<p>“Nice reward for our hard work,” they said.</p>



<p>Ballistic Moon’s leadership has yet to put out an official statement on the status of the studio and whether or not it has been or will be closed. In technical terms, it’s remains active in name. Should a publisher sign on or funding come from elsewhere, the studio could start the hiring process again to bring in developers and other staff. Right now, however, there is no work being done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has attempted multiple times to get in contact with Ballistic Moon’s co-founders and owners as well as Sony regarding the claims of additional funding for the studio, but no responses have been received. Should any come after the publishing of this story, it will be added in an update.</p>

<p>A new leak has revealed that Minecraft: Spicewood is seemingly the sequel to Minecraft Dungeons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leak arrives from X0X_LEAK on <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1897050276374425705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, who has stated that the upcoming Minecraft Dungeons sequel is being referred to internally as “Project Spicewood” and has “been in development for at least 2 years.” The post also reveals more details about the upcoming spinoff title, including the main areas and POIs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to X0X_LEAK, Minecraft has a set of new areas and POIs for the Dungeons sequel; we now know the 3 locations and their places of interest. First up is Honeycomb Fields, which features locations such as Undermill, Farm, Island, Lake, Fields, and Forest. Next is the Desert, which includes a Cliff, Fortress, Mountain, Village and Icelagoon. Last up is Forest, which will introduce a Deep Dark entrance, an Outpost Entrance, a Witchzone, and a Shady Forest Town.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, VISLOWERKEBAB on <a href="https://x.com/VISLOWERKEBAB/status/1897049464931803317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> has also provided some work-in-progress images for the Minecraft Dungeon sequel. The first image could be the official artwork for “Project Spicewood,” and the second image is a gameplay screenshot for the upcoming title, featuring a perspective similar to that of the 2020 dungeon crawler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Minecraft Triple Bundle <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-triple-bundle-releases-tomorrow-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak has been confirmed</a>, and the new bundle is now available on the Xbox Store.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> 2 developer Colossal Order has shared an update on the city builder sequel's long-delayed console release - confirming it still has "more things we need to address" before it can launch, and that it won't be arriving before summer.
</p>
<p>
Cities: Skylines 2's Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions were originally due to launch alongside the PC release back in October 2023, but Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-release-gets-delayed">announced a last-minute delay</a> into 2024. Its release was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-launch-delayed-again">delayed indefinitely</a> following Cities: Skylines 2's disastrous launch on PC - which continues to attract <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">complaints about poor performance and simulation issues</a>, despite multiple updates over the 18 months since then.
</p>
<p>
Colossal Order's most recent news on Cities: Skylines 2 console release came last November, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-studio-blames-ongoing-console-delay-on-hardware-limitations">admitted it was struggling to overcome "hardware limitations"</a> impacting performance on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. It noted it had managed to get the game "stable and playable" on consoles by "significantly lowering the graphics quality", but said it wasn't happy with the compromise and wanted to bring graphics quality up to an "acceptable level".

<p>
Skip ahead six months and Colossal Order has addressed Cities: Skylines 2's console release once more, and while progress is apparently being made, it sounds like there's still some way to go. "We continue to make steady progress on the console version," it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665875067?l=english">wrote in an update</a>, "and our core focus has been on further improving performance and stability. However, despite these advancements, we have more things we need to address before we reach the level of quality and the experience we want for you as our players."
</p>
<p>
"We know many of you are eagerly awaiting the console release," it continued, "but to set expectations clearly: we will not have a release before summer. We want to avoid any premature estimates and instead commit to providing you with reliable information when we're closer to a launch-ready state. Our goal remains unchanged: to bring Cities: Skylines 2 to console in the best possible shape."
</p>
<p>
News isn't entirely positive on the PC front, either. Colossal Order has also admitted it's struggling with Cities: Skylines 2's custom asset editor - a modding feature it called "crucial" last September, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dlc-gets-further-delays-as-developer-priorities-assets-editor-for-mods">announced it was delaying its DLC plans</a> in order to get the asset editor finished and released. But in its latest update, the studio has said the feature is proving "more technically challenging than initially anticipated due to the hefty amounts of built-in assets affected by the changes, but it is moving forward."
</p>
<p>
"Rest assured that we're committed to solving these challenges," it wrote, "and our dedicated team is actively making progress to overcome them. We know how much custom assets mean to you and, honestly, to us, too, and we will continue to keep you informed of our progress as soon as we have something more concrete to share."
</p>
<p>
"We appreciate your patience and enthusiasm," the studio concluded, "and we will share more updates as we continue shaping the future of Cities: Skylines together." It added it'll be back next week when the original Cities: Skylines celebrates its 10th anniversary.

Here are all the nominees… along with our predictions.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="6">Best Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></p>


<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7"><strong>Prediction:</strong> A strong category, but it has to be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, the plucky PlayStation mascot who has charmed the whole planet (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/31/game-of-the-year-2024-overall-winner/">won our own Game of the Year award</a> in December)</p>
<h2 data-node-id="9">Animation</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10"><strong>Prediction:</strong> Harder to call this one, as Hellblade 2 once again comes with excellent performance capture and animation… but it’s probably going to be Astro Bot again, if only for the huge amount of incidental animations that you can trigger.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="11">Artistic Achievement</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Harold Halibut</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Neva</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12"><strong>Prediction:</strong> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/16/harold-halibut-review/">Harold Halibut’s</a> stop motion animation seems to be the perfect winner for this category. It took eleven years to complete so that must deserve an award and this is probably more fitting than lifetime achievement!</p>
<h2 data-node-id="13">Audio Achievement</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14"><strong>Prediction:</strong> Hellblade 2’s binaural recording and mixing is going to win this, no question.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="16">British Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17">•&nbsp;<em>A Highland Song</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Paper Trail</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17"><strong>Prediction:</strong> There are some <em>very</em> British games in this category, but the slapstick Yorkshire humour of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/thank-goodness-youre-here-review/">Thank Goodness You’re Here!</a> is probably going to win.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="18">Debut Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Plucky Squire</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19"><strong>Prediction:</strong> Another strong category, but you can’t ignore the behemoth that is Balatro.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="21">Evolving Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22">•&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 14</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>No Man’s Sky</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22"><strong>Prediction:</strong> This one could go anywhere, but Sea of Thieves, Final Fantasy 14 and No Man’s Sky have won this category before, so maybe it’s time for Diablo 4.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="23">Family</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Cat Quest 3</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Plucky Squire</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17"><strong>Prediction:</strong> Astro Bot. 100%.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="25">Game Beyond Entertainment</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26">•&nbsp;<em>Botany Manor</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Kind Words 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tetris Forever</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26"><strong>Prediction:</strong> Another hard one to guess, but Bafta do go for some odd choices now and then, so and if Hellblade 2 is getting wins elsewhere it might be Vampire Therapist.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="28">Game Design</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14"><strong>Prediction:</strong> While none of these games bring anything particularly new to the table they all play exceptionally well. Let’s go with Astro Bot again.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="30">Multiplayer</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31">•&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31"><strong>Prediction:</strong> Well it won’t be Lego Horizon Adventures – it’s fun, but no – and I have a feeling this will either go to Warhammer or Helldivers. I am going with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2.</a></p>

<h2 data-node-id="33">Music</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34"><strong>Prediction:</strong> A completely open field here, and it really depends on what sort of music you like really. It would be nice to see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> win something,</p>
<h2 data-node-id="35">Narrative</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36">•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36"><strong>Prediction:</strong> I am going for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes The Deep</a> in this category. There’s some great games like Metaphor: ReFantazio, but Still Wakes The Deep is a British game which gives it the edge.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="37">New Intellectual Property</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38"><strong>Prediction:</strong> This is a bit of a weird category as Still Wakes the Deep and Thank Goodness You’re Here! really don’t need to become franchises in the way that IP implies, and Balatro might be novel, but it’s card game and – no offence to creators – they didn’t invent the standard card deck or the Poker hands it uses. We think this will go to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="40">Performer in a Leading Role</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41">• Alec Newman,&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
• Humberly González,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em><br>
• Isabella Inchbald,&nbsp;<em>Indika</em><br>
• Luke Roberts,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em><br>
• Melina Juergens,&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
• Y’lan Noel,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41"><strong>Prediction:</strong> This is almost certainly a second BAFTA for Melina Juergens.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="42">Performer in a Supporting Role</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43">• Abbi Greenland and Helen Goalen,&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
• Aldís Amah Hamilton,&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
• Jon Blyth,&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
• Karen Dunbar,&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
• Matt Berry,&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
• Michael Abubakar,&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43"><strong>Prediction:</strong> This could be anyone, but let us hope it’s Matt Berry just for the acceptance speech.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="45">Technical Achievement</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tiny Glade</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46"><strong>Prediction:</strong> Given that Ninja Theory went to a lot of trouble to tell everyone they had travelled to Iceland to scan every rock and blade of grass, it’s going to be Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2. The game really does look incredible.</p>
