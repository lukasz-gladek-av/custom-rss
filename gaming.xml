Lovecraft’s body of cosmic horror writing was so prolific that his name has become synonymous with the genre. For Lovecraft, much of the horror of the unknowable evil in the universe was represented by the animalistic fear of the ocean, hence the foggy seaside fishing villages of New England constantly serving as the setting for his stories. That intrinsic link between fishing and cosmic horror is portrayed excellently in <em>Dredge.</em></p><p>In <em>Dredge </em>you control a nameless and faceless fisherman who has washed up on the shore of a remote fishing village on an island. It is one of many islands in a vast ocean teaming with life. In order to make some money and contribute to your new base of operations, the mayor of the village tasks you with fishing in order to bring in some cash. The only warning he gives is to not go out at night. During the day, you’ll roam the safe waters to fish and salvage for items that can all help you turn a profit, though you only have so many daylight hours to get things done. Eventually, night arrives and you are presented with the choice to return to safety or explore what awaits you in the dark. The game doesn’t force you to venture into that uncomfortable unknown.</p><figure id="" data-id="27a6bcdb4d86b9e0ad91bf5471f22fc8" data-recommend-id="image://27a6bcdb4d86b9e0ad91bf5471f22fc8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sea monster chases after a small fishing boat" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sea monster chases after a small fishing boat" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Team17</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="27a6bcdb4d86b9e0ad91bf5471f22fc8" data-recommend-id="image://27a6bcdb4d86b9e0ad91bf5471f22fc8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sea monster chases after a small fishing boat" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, you will eventually find yourself out past curfew on the open ocean. It might take days for it to happen, but either you’ll finally let curiosity get the better of you or just find you’ve lost track of time and are suddenly plunged into the night. Then <em>Dredge </em>turns into full-blown horror. At night, everything weird that has been hinted at happening behind your back appears: Mutilated and deformed fish infected with some mysterious disease flood your fishing lines, large creatures chase after you without the safety of the daylight, and mysterious strangers task you with finding mysterious objects that grant you dangerous powers with a cost. <em>Dredge </em>becomes much more than just a game about fishing and making money. </p><p>Like so many cosmic horror stories that have clearly inspired <em>Dredge</em>, at the end of the day (or night) there is nothing you as the player can really do to combat these unknowable horrors. <em>Dredge </em>gives you no guns or any way to protect yourself from the monsters of the deep beyond a light to keep them at bay for a while. It’s a lesson in managing your curiosity and hubris. When you inevitably push your luck too far and die, it’s because you tried to get too close to the evils in the ocean despite everything warning you to stay away. This is why <em>Dredge</em>’s horror works so well: it thrives on letting you put yourself in scary situations. </p><p>Yet even while it’s a thrilling cosmic horror showcase, <em>Dredge</em>’s management-style gameplay loop of fishing and returning to port to make a profit and upgrade your boat remains endlessly compelling. Even if you aren’t tracking down the mysteries of the deep it’s never not fun to sit in a nice fishing spot and pull up the latest catch. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I recently had the opportunity to play Atomfall at Gamescom, enjoying a lengthy playthrough of this all-new, single-player game from Rebellion. It was only this year that Atomfall was revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase, but it has already generated plenty of hype on account of the solid post-apocalyptic vibes that the game gives off – <strong>and </strong>inspired by real events.</p>



<p>Atomfall has been dubbed ‘Fallout in the UK’, and there’s some truth to that, but there’s enough meat on the bones of this game for it to stand apart from the competition that has dominated the genre for many years.</p>



<p>Read on and check out my full Atomfall preview.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-authenticity">Authenticity</h2>



<p>From the moment I stepped into Atomfall, I knew I was playing a <strong>British </strong>game. The opening sequences of my demo saw me exploring a rural (but fictional) setting in Cumbria, England. As soon as I heard the voices of enemies from across the rocky, verdant terrain, I knew exactly where I was. As I progressed, I found more characters lurking in the beautiful setting, all of them quintessentially British.</p>



<p>I even found a box of tea to consume to keep myself perked up.</p>



<p>Atomfall is inspired by true events. In 1957, the worst nuclear accident in UK history occurred at the Windscale site, causing widespread radiation to be emitted around a vast area. It was subsequently covered up by the British government – at least in part – and it took years until the full story was revealed.</p>



<p>In Atomfall, a cataclysmic event has occurred in a nuclear plant that led the government to wall off a massive area of the countryside, trapping people within and forcing them to fend for themselves, scrubbing the location from the maps. As factions rise and survivors still living in the region try to scrape through, intense mysteries emerge and an immersive story unravels.</p>



<p>I tried to question the devs on what had happened and whether we’d see anything mutated coming out of that catastrophe, but they were tight-lipped.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Atomfall - Official Gameplay Overview Trailer | gamescom 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtJAU4K23ec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-getting-to-the-game">Getting to the Game</h2>



<p>I love an apocalyptic title, and that’s what Atomfall is. It’s not a <strong>global </strong>apocalypse, but a downscaled version, with the end of times being concentrated in a small area in England. As I explored the game, I found myself appreciating the traditional survival elements. I had to become a hunter-gatherer of sorts, scrounging for one or two bullets while defending myself against enemy factions.</p>



<p>I quickly learned that in Atomfall, how you behave around others matters massively. Get too close to a faction that doesn’t trust you, and you’ll be set upon pretty quickly. In conversations, you can choose from what might be several choices, each of which can lead a different way. If you want to be stealthier, you’ll put enemies on edge, and if you go in guns blazing, you’ll quickly draw an entire force down upon you.</p>



<p>With that being said, I asked the developers how far the freedom of this game goes, and they advised me that you can kill everyone and still complete the game. It’s very open.</p>



<p>It’s a solid ‘looter’ game that requires some inventory management, and there are a few skill paths to play around with. It’s open-ended, and the map is split up into several areas, each of which is bursting with things to see and do. If you like exploring and uncovering secrets, this game is a surefire winner.</p>



<p>It’ll take anywhere between 20 and 30 hours to complete, depending on how you approach the game. I wasn’t able to learn too much about the cataclysmic event that erupted in the nuclear plant <strong>or </strong>what the long-term ramifications of it is, but I was exposed to enough intrigue and mystery to want to play more.</p>



<h2 id="h-looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>



<p>Atomfall looks brilliant on-screen and it runs well. Rebellion has put a lot of work into this game, and it feels like a living, breathing world with plenty to uncover. Everything from traversal to the stamina system feels well thought out and the voice acting is stellar from what I experienced.</p>



<p>It’ll be released in March 2025, all being well. It’s worth putting on your wishlist – take that to the bank from a die-hard post-apocalyptic gamer with a huge love for Fallout. </p>

<p>One of the longest-running turn-based strategy franchises is getting a new game for the first time in nearly a decade. Ubisoft has announced the upcoming release of Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era</p>



<p>The game will release in early access on PC via Steam in Q2 2025, and is set before the events of the first game. So while it can technically be viewed as Heroes of Might &amp; Magic 8, the game is, itself, a prequel.</p>

<h2 id="h-about-heroes-of-might-amp-magic-olden-era">About Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era</h2>



<p>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is being developed by Ubisoft partner studio Unfrozen and brings back the turn-based gameplay of the series’ past.</p>



<p>“Olden Era will introduce a number of new features: Players will have more control over how they level up heroes and their factions, for example, with faction-specific abilities, new systems for learning skills and magic spells, and artifacts that now impart bonuses if players equip more than one piece from a set,” Ubisoft said.</p>



<p>Factions for this new game include Temple, Necropolis, Sylvan, Dungeon, Hive, and a surprise sixth faction to be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>As far as modes go, there will be a new campaign, a number of stand alone maps, a random map generator, and even a custom map editor. </p>



<p>For online play, players have three different options:</p>



<p>‣ <strong>Classic: </strong>a mode where a player can play with one or more heroes, upgrade the castle and explore the map.<br>‣ <strong>One-hero mode: </strong>a blitz-like system, but you have only one hero, so their demise will become yours as well!<br>‣ <strong>Arena: </strong>a mode for those who came to battle! Draft a hero, upgrade them, pick your troops, and challenge the enemy right away.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-about-heroes-of-might-amp-magic">About Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</h2>



<p>First developed by New World Computing, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic began as a spinoff of the original Might and Magic RPG series before becoming a full side franchise itself. The original Heroes of Might &amp; Magic launched in 1995. Since New World Computing’s closure in 2003, the series has been owned by Ubisoft. Under Ubisoft, there have been three Might &amp; Magic titles: Heroes of Might &amp; Magic 5, Might &amp; Magic Heroes 6, and Might &amp; Magic Heroes 7.</p>



<p>More details on the new game will be announced at a later date as early access gets close.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-is-like-god-of-war-and-dragons-dogma-had-a-baby-gamescom-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The bosses in Crimson Desert are powerful. I mean really <em>powerful</em>. As the formidable Staglord grabbed me by the ankle and hurled me into a wall, the bone-crunching impact reminded me of how The Stranger’s blows catapulted Kratos through tree trunks and mountains in God of War. This intense, deity-like physicality lends Crimson Desert’s battles a sense of genuine spectacle – these are the gladiator battles of myths. </p><p>During an hour-long hands-on session at gamescom 2024, I was able to go toe-to-toe with three different bosses, each of which showcased a different side of this fantasy action game's approach to battle. The first, the aforementioned Staglord, is perhaps the most simple (although that does the towering, barbarian-like warrior a disservice.) He’s a relentless attacker, charging across the battlefield like a bullet train that can suplex you at its final destination. But, despite his endless strength and capacity to throw you like a baseball, he’s only human. I force distance between us, quickly firing explosive arrows to knock him out of his attack pattern and open up a window to bury my blade into his back. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Staglord proves a real challenge of a fight. Crimson Desert is not even remotely a soulslike, but it’s not afraid to make you work really hard for victory. I spend much of the lengthy fight learning the complexities of the combat system. There’s no lock-on, so I have to be mindful of where I position my character and where his sword will land. Rolling forward allows me to instantly follow up with a sweep-kick that surprises my foe, and then hitting both the light and heavy attack buttons together unleashes a wide, particle-effects spraying strike that cleaves a chunk out of the Staglord’s health bar. All this is speedy without sacrificing weight. It feels fantastic, but it’s also easy to let things run away from you – I soon realise I need to be chowing down on health-restoring food with addiction-like frequency. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Crimson Desert is not even remotely a soulslike, but it’s not afraid to make you work really hard for victory.</p></div><p>With the Staglord defeated, I take his mighty sword and shield and move on to the next fight. The demo skips ahead in the story, meaning I sadly don’t get to experience any non-boss gameplay, and throws me into snow-coated lands. Here, my gruff protagonist is looking for children who have seemingly been sacrificed to some kind of mountain god. Such a ‘god’ turns out to be the White Horn; a sort of antlered abominable snowdeer that showcases just how different each of Crimson Desert’s bosses can be. This colossal creature moves like a bucking bronco and its galloping charges cause the mountains around us to break out in miniature avalanches that leave me temporarily frozen in place. Thankfully, after striking it so much that its white fur is stained almost completely red, I’m able to clamber onto its back in the fight’s second phase and stab away at its neck. The moment had me recalling my battles with towering monsters in Dragon’s Dogma 2 earlier this year. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Each boss has three health bars, with each one eliminated increasing the intensity of the fight. But where the Staglord and White Horn scraps seemed to escalate much like many other action game boss battles – the enemy gets angrier and starts using more devastating attacks – my final battle, against the Queen Stoneback Crab, demonstrated Crimson Desert’s ambition to create memorable moments through very different mechanics. </p><p>The Queen Stoneback Crab is colossally big. It fills the screen. And, smartly, you can't fight it by just hacking away at its shins. Instead, the battle is a puzzle set piece that’s clearly inspired by Shadow of the Colossus. I clamber onto the Crab’s stony shell and grab onto the grass and flora that forms its ‘fur’, holding on for dear life while pulling myself up towards a trio of rock formations. Using a special punch skill I shatter each of the rocks to expose a weak point that I plunge my blade into. Each opened wound causes a geyser of water to blast out, which not only provides a visual spectacle but also throws me high into the air. From above I’m able to float down, almost Zelda paraglider-style, and plan how to tackle the next stage. Now I’m tasked with destroying the pottery-like crown at the peak of the Crab’s mountain-like shell – a task a Pearl Abyss employee explained to me is completed by swinging Spider-Man-style from a web and colliding with the pottery at full speed. Seriously. I’m not sure how I’d have figured that out on my own, but I’m pleased such a mechanic exists. It’s all delightfully bonkers. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>My hour-long session isn’t quite long enough to try all four bosses the demo has to offer, but a video presentation provided a quick insight into the only one I missed: the Reed Devil, a weird little guy who creates copies of himself that can only be defeated by destroying totems that are built during the battle. Along with the three I fought, all four bosses make a promise that Crimson Desert features an array of creative, unique centrepiece battles. If they’re all like this, then Pearl Abyss really could have something special on its hands. </p><p>I’m similarly impressed by the combat system’s fundamentals. Yes, it’s all quite fantasy 101 – bows, swords, shields, parries – but it’s delightfully aggressive and properly impactful. There’s a seemingly deep combo system, too, and it’s because of that I wished the demo had a section that was a little more relaxed for me to sample. The heat of a relentless boss battle isn’t quite the space to learn and perfect button sequences, but I’ve got a good feeling you can pull off some cool stuff based on the combos I did learn. </p><p>Of course, I also wish I’d seen more so I could say if Crimson Desert’s adventure chops are as strong as its boss battles. What little dialogue and story there was to introduce each boss didn’t suggest anything remotely close to, say, The Witcher 3. But, even if its writing proves lacking, a strong approach to exploration and world design could carry it far. Hopefully Pearl Abyss will showcase that soon, because so far Crimson Desert’s mix of God of War’s weighty  impact and Dragon’s Dogma’s creative spectacle has me very excited indeed.</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tom Francis and his Suspicious Developments team spent 6.5 years crafting the perfect finale to his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration">defenestration</a> trilogy, and it shows. If you liked blasting people out of windows in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/09/gunpoint-hands-on-an-intelligent-spy-thriller-with-breakable-glass/"><em>Gunpoint</em></a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2017/2/"><em>Heat Signature</em></a>—or snappy writing, endearing characters, wizards, turn-based tactical gameplay, and efficiency challenges—you are going to love <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a>.</p>
<p>The game's name is as efficient as its design, telling you a lot about its tone and distinct offerings. You play as a small team of magic wielders, each of which you can control, one at a time,&nbsp;in a world where magic use, mana, and all the rest have been militarized and corporatized. There are stasis hexes put on illegally parked cars and even a Traffic Warlock, who, after getting on his bad side, will try to mow you down with an entire ghost highway full of spectral drivers.</p>

<p>Luckily, bad guys like him can only hit you if you don't plan accordingly. Owing to the powers of your teammate Zan, you can foresee everything that will happen within a round of combat (he's a one-second clairvoyant). Move team member Jen to this square on the grid, have her chain-zap three guys, seal the door next to her, then see what that leaves Zan to do. Don't like the outcome? Rewind repeatedly until you've gotten the most out of your team's actions or maybe achieved one of the game's optional achievements. You get "Confidence" for pulling off stunts like "knock three baddies out a window with one action," but they're entirely optional because Confidence only unlocks cool outfits, not powers or gameplay. The actual perks you unlock give you delicious choices to make, deciding which way to take each character's powers to complement or offset one another.</p>

<h2>Compelling wizard banter</h2>
<p>I've cleared the first three acts, and I'm almost certainly going to get through the rest of what the developers think is a roughly 16-hour game (on Normal difficulty) in sessions on the couch or in transit. The only thing that breaks up its session-able nature is the dialogue between scenes, levels, and acts, but I mean that in a good way. My achievement-craving brain wants to skip through the banter, and that's possible, but the buddy-cop banter is just too good to pass up. While your wizards are self-conscious enough to recognize how ridiculous the events around them are, there's just enough vulnerability and actual development to keep the plot from folding under its own irony.</p>
<p>The game looks good and sounds good, too, and it runs well on pretty much any modern system with 1GB of graphics power (that's most of them). It's listed as <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1043810">"Playable" on Steam Deck</a>, and that's accurate. The Steam Deck's trackpads help a lot here, though you can use the sticks on any controller if you're willing to nudge them around a lot inside a UI that was very much meant for a cursor.</p>
<p>Like Zan, you should be able to look just a bit into <em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>($20 at launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/">on Steam</a>) and foresee just how much you're going to enjoy it. Experiences help forge friendships, and there are few bonding experiences quite like chucking one more crooked wizard cop out the window than you thought was possible.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There's something specific about Ridley Scott's 1979 movie Alien that makes it such an enduring classic. With the combination of its heavy focus on relatable, blue-collar characters, its dingy, lived-in capitalist version of space travel, and its stalking, unknowably malevolent creature, it creates a feeling that other horror movies have chased and tried to replicate again and again across the decades since its release.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest attempt to recapture what made Alien so viscerally, singularly frightening is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alien-romulus-review-structural-imperfection/1900-6418268/">Alien: Romulus</a>, a sequel to that original movie. It does a better job than some of the Alien canon of at least creating scary moments with the universe's greatest killing machine, but it relies on explosive, bombastic moments with H.R. Geiger's xenomorph, much like the rest of the series' sequels.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a solid-enough movie, but it's not frightening in the same way that Alien is frightening. Facehuggers burst from hiding and scramble over each other as they chase their prey, while xenomorphs clamber after the humans, hissing and bearing teeth, making sure to get right in the faces of the heroes as many times as possible. And at key moments, Romulus does what most of the Alien movies and games have done in the years since the original was released: It turns the creatures into cannon fodder to be blown away by machine guns.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355399-alienromulus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355399" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355399-alienromulus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355399"></a><figcaption>Alien: Romulus tries to capture what makes the xenomorph frightening up close, but it ends up just mugging for the camera a few times.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355399-alienromulus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's really only one Alien sequel that captures the essential feeling of the original film, and that sequel isn't a movie, but a video game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-isolation/" data-ref-id="5000-232868">Alien: Isolation</a> isn't a perfect Alien story, but it focuses on doing one thing incredibly well: bringing the alien to life and making it absolutely terrifying.</p><p dir="ltr">With Alien: Isolation, the focus is on moment-to-moment encounters with the creature. The game turns the final intense scenes of the original film--in which Ripley creeps around a corner, flamethrower in hand, sees the creature, and then carefully sneaks away--into the whole of the experience. It's great at this; you creep around the locales of Sevastopol station, all inspired heavily by the actual sets and concept drawings of the original film, with a single huge, unstoppable alien sneaking around in vents and stomping around corridors, searching for you.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the time in Alien: Isolation, your only means of dealing with the creature is to give it the slip, by hiding in a locker or ducking under a table, or carefully listening for and navigating around it as it does its best to find you. Every once in a while, though, the thing will sniff you out. In these moments, a gout of fire from your flamethrower might be enough to save you, and it might not.</p><p dir="ltr">If nothing else, Alien: Isolation gets the idea of just how <em>dangerous </em>the alien is. It's an intelligent hunter, using everything at its disposal to find and kill you. It will sometimes stalk around the halls looking for you, but it'll also spend its time squeezed into vents, listening and setting traps, waiting for you to stumble under an open gap so it can rip you off your feet and into darkness. Nothing can kill the alien in Isolation, and trying to shoot or fight it is mostly just an invitation for it to murder you. That makes encountering other survivors even more frightening, because if <em>they</em> start shooting at <em>you</em>, it's likely they'll get <em>everyone</em> killed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4355398-alienisolationflamethrower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355398" data-ratio="0.56458333333333" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4355398-alienisolationflamethrower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355398"></a><figcaption>Knowing that you can only ever delay the inevitable against a huge and unstoppable alien makes Alien: Isolation terrifying.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4355398-alienisolationflamethrower.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You spend most of your time alone in Alien: Isolation, just you and the alien, hoping that you're out of sight or that the improvised noisemaker you just threw will be enough to distract it so you can slip away. When it isn't hunting you, Isolation's story tracks through the usual beats of an Alien story, with various characters screwing each other over for their own gain only to get their comeuppance when the creature comes calling, and those elements of the game are serviceable, but not especially exciting.</p><p dir="ltr">What Alien: Isolation creates exceedingly well, however, are those heart-pounding moments when the creature is <em>right there</em> and you're hoping you can hold your breath long enough that it won't hear you.</p><p dir="ltr">It's this feeling that every Alien movie after the original has failed to really capture. Aliens comes close--the moment in which the Colonial Marines are decimated pulls on this thread, with Hudson screaming, "They're coming out of the walls!" hitting on the idea that what's really frightening about the alien is their comfort in the shadows and their stalker's intelligence. Alien 3 attempts to capture this same vibe but struggles to provide interesting, relatable characters for the alien to chomp on. Both the prequels, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, take the idea of a scary creature and go all-out with it, with monsters that scramble toward victims and barrel through fields to bite off heads. These movies focus on the chaos of their monsters, rather than the cold, ordered precision of the xenomorph as originally conceived.</p><p dir="ltr">And then there's Alien: Romulus, which excels at a lot of the things Alien: Isolation is also good at. It recaptures the essence of Alien's original set design and retro-future setting, creating the same dark, industrial kinds of locations that look both lived in and upsettingly uncomfortable for human beings--while being entirely <em>too </em>comfortable for something like the alien. Romulus understands the look of Alien and is great at resurrecting the feel of the movie.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355400-alienromulussetdesign.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4355400" data-ratio="0.56153846153846" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355400-alienromulussetdesign.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4355400"></a><figcaption>Alien: Romulus and Alien: Isolation share some incredible art direction and set design that perfectly capture the world of Alien and make it unsettling and beautiful.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355400-alienromulussetdesign.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But Romulus can't quite get the monsters right. It does a good job of making the facehugger more frightening as it turns it from a lurking, surprising ambusher into a fast, scuttling menace, but it does the same to the xenomorph itself. In Romulus, apart from one half-hearted attempt to use a character as bait for the others, the alien displays little interest in lying in ambush ro relying on intelligence and surprise, searching for ways to surprise the humans and ultimately carry them off to be unwilling incubators for its young. The creatures are never shadowy, instead banking on being big, slimy, and menacing.</p><p dir="ltr">Alien: Isolation also has the alien stomping around loudly and then charging straight at its prey, to be sure. But the difference is that, in Isolation, the creature is nigh unstoppable in addition to being smart and agile. The fact that you see it walking around actively looking for you makes it <em>more</em> frightening. In Romulus, though, seeing so much of the alien takes some of the bloom off the rose. Romulus's creatures are not especially huge, not especially smart, and not especially unstoppable, as the movie demonstrates toward the end when several xenos get cut down easily by Pulse Rifle fire. At that point, the most lethal thing about them becomes the splashing of their acid blood and guts on space station walls.</p><p dir="ltr">The other Alien movies are fine in their own way, each adding something different to the conversation, and that includes Alien: Romulus. Even though I'm on record as being lukewarm on the new film, it was still a pretty good time; Aliens is among my favorite movies ever, and I have some kind of love, respect, or at least awkward fascination with Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection, Prometheus, and Alien: Covenant.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355402-alienripley.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355402" data-ratio="0.5609375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355402-alienripley.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355402"></a><figcaption>Alien: Isolation knows that the feeling of these scenes from Alien is the true terror at the heart of the franchise.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355402-alienripley.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But while all of them have their own unique additions to the franchise, none of them has what Alien had--<em>that creature</em>, waiting amid the machinery to descend on a shocked Brett or hiding in the cramped darkness to ambush Dallas or tearing apart an overmatched Parker to get to a terrified Lambert. I'm still waiting for a movie to recapture that same monster: the one that has haunted my dreams since I first saw Alien. But at least I know that creature is waiting for me in the decrepit confines of Sevastopol whenever I boot up my PC and Alien: Isolation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ai-california-conde-journalism<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-journalism-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another chilling week</a> for AI and journalism, with California lawmakers rolling over to Google by tacking money for AI onto a bill that attempts to stop the tech giant from hoovering up newsrooms’ money, and Conde Nast being the latest publisher to get in bed with OpenAI. The dealmakers here call this realism and opportunity, while anyone who actually cares about journalism knows it’s anything but.</p><p>Today’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225986/google-california-newsroom-deal-cjpa-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California deal</a> earmarks $250 million for newsrooms, with $180 million being distributed among outlets, and $70 million going to a “National AI Accelerator.” AI was not part of the original proposal by Oakland Assemblymember Buffy Wicks; draft language in the new proposal, first reported by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/19/ai-california-journalism-bill-agreement-00174678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politico</a>, cited the need to “strengthen democracy and the future of work in an Artificial Intelligence future.” The deal is the culmination of conflict over the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128363/google-cjpa-news-removal-california" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Journalism Protection Act</a>, which followed in the footsteps of bills in places like Canada and Australia that sought to make tech giants like Google and Facebook give back to the newsrooms from whom they siphon money.</p><p>There’s a kind of grim fatalism around the agreement and the supposed “Artificial Intelligence future. ” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/21/google-california-newsroom-ai-00174817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politico</a> wrote that “Wicks sees the final agreement as the best way to get money into publishers’ hands quickly” and quotes Wicks as saying, “I think I’m dealing with the art of the possible… This represents, to me, the best case scenario for the moment we’re in. And I would rather take a nearly quarter of a billion dollar deal than nothing.” According to <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/capitol/2024/08/california-journalism-deal-legislature-google/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CalMatters</a>, Julie Makinen, board chairperson of the California News Publishers Association, said that the plan is “not what we had hoped for when set out… Sometimes, the political realities, they are what they are.”&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, people who work in or care about journalism are taking a more aggressive stance, with Media Guild of the West President Matt Pearce <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/21/google-california-newsroom-ai-00174817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calling</a> it “a total rout.” In a <a href="https://www.mediaguildwest.org/news/californias-journalists-do-not-consent-to-this-shakedown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, the Media Guild called the deal a “shakedown” and wrote that&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>After two years of advocacy for strong antimonopoly action to start turning around the decline of local newsrooms, we are left almost without words. The publishers who claim to represent our industry are celebrating an opaque deal involving taxpayer funds, a vague AI accelerator project that could very well destroy journalism jobs, and minimal financial commitments from Google to return the wealth this monopoly has stolen from our newsrooms.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>California tech journalist Brian Merchant wrote on <a href="https://x.com/bcmerchant/status/1825744765477966316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> that “This bill was supposed to make big tech pay its fair share after usurping advertising from news publishers and profiting from their work—instead it’s *rewarding* their market dominance by turning journos into content trainers for AI systems.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Utterly devastating for CA journalists. This bill was supposed to make big tech pay its fair share after usurping advertising from news publishers and profiting from their work—instead it’s *rewarding* their market dominance by turning journos into content trainers for AI systems <a href="https://t.co/BI2dtTY2X0">https://t.co/BI2dtTY2X0</a></p>— Brian Merchant (@bcmerchant) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcmerchant/status/1825744765477966316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Let’s pivot for a moment: also this week, <a href="https://x.com/maxwelltani/status/1825955990854053986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conde Nast</a> announced a deal with OpenAI,<a href="https://aftermath.site/openai-vox-atlantic-ai-journalism-jobs-sam-altman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> joining the likes</a> of Vox and The Atlantic in helping the job-stealing, content-degrading machine steal their jobs and degrade their content. Conde Nast CEO Roger Lynch wrote that the deal will&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>expand the reach of Conde Nast’s content. As we all know, generative AI is rapidly changing ways audiences are discovering information. It’s crucial that we meet audiences where they are and embrace new technologies while also ensuring proper attribution and compensation for use of our intellectual property. This is exactly what we have found with OpenAI.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>How have these deals been going so far? Well, <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/06/insider-union-chatgpt-hallucinating-links-business-insider-articles-openai-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nieman Lab</a> reported in July that Business Insider, who signed a deal with OpenAI last year, found, in the words of union members who investigated, that “OpenAI may be downplaying rather than elevating our works… Repeated efforts by unit members have been unable to prompt ChatGPT to link directly to our scoops, even when explicitly instructed to do so.” ChatGPT was linking to aggregation of stories Business Insider broke, and, when prompted to link to the outlet that first broke those stories, provided made-up Business Insider URLs instead of actual links.</p><p>An OpenAI spokesperson told Nieman Lab (emphasis mine) that “Together with our news publisher partners, we’re building an experience that blends conversational capabilities with their latest news content, <strong>ensuring proper attribution and linking to source material — an enhanced experience still in development and not yet available in ChatGPT</strong>.”</p><p>To recap: one of the supposed points of getting into bed with OpenAI is so it will surface your work, except that needs to be added to the long list of things AI can’t do yet but which you should totally trust that it will eventually do, despite the fact that it is running out of the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-training-data-shortage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">power</a>, and <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/to-serve-altman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">money</a> to do anything it promises to do at all. Given all that, what <em>can</em> these deals do? As Hell Gate owner Max Rivlin-Nadler wrote on <a href="https://x.com/MaxRivlinNadler/status/1825959720756380022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, all this really amounts to is “bosses literally selling you out to make up for their own failings as executives in return for a short-term cash infusion that will certainly evaporate into their own bank accounts and leave you jobless.”</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Journalists should not just go along with this nasty nasty work, bosses literally selling you out to make up for their own failings as executives in return for a short-term cash infusion that will certainly evaporate into their own banks accounts and leave you jobless <a href="https://t.co/uleZXxncE2">https://t.co/uleZXxncE2</a></p>— Max RN (@MaxRivlinNadler) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxRivlinNadler/status/1825959720756380022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>What we see in both the California agreement and the Conde Nast deal is just propping up the tiresome trope about AI’s inevitability, a desperate response to the cash-strapped present dressed up as future-planning. I can’t believe I have to keep screaming “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17989712/facebook-inaccurate-video-metrics-inflation-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook Live!</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/metaverse-dead-obituary-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-tech-fad-ai-chatgpt-2023-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The metaverse</a>! <a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-brands-are-still-going-down-with-nft-s-sinking-sh-1850908321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crypto!</a>” every time we do one of these, a repetitive exercise that might actually be the best use of AI at this point. These deals highlight the utter disregard the people calling the shots actually have for workers and readers, how few ideas they have for ensuring a future for journalism, if that’s even a motivating factor for them beyond their own salaries and valuations.&nbsp;</p><p>I worry that in one or five or ten years, we’ll look back at this moment and regret these decisions–or, best case scenario, see them as nothing more than a bit of extra runway that led us back to the same bind we’re currently in, only with even <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/05/business/ai-job-losses/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fewer jobs</a> and even <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ais-climate-impact-goes-beyond-its-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hotter summers</a>.

            <p>Ubisoft have announced Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era, a fresh instalment in the exceedingly olden turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series, which began life under New World Computing in 1984. The new game will “return to the world of Enroth and the origins of the legendary saga”, inviting “both veterans and new players” to go on a quest to Jadame, “a mysterious continent in turmoil”. Expect new factions, biomes and creatures, together with such M&amp;M standbys as castle management, army clashes, hex-based maps, and, who knows, maybe some heroes.</p><!--more-->

<p>The game includes a new solo campaign, the option to wage one-off clashes on single maps, and a map generator capable of “limitless” scenarios. I can fall over in “limitless” ways, Ubisoft, and I don’t go around writing press releases about it. Hmmm, maybe I should? 

</p><p>There’s also co-op and competitive multiplayer – each mode has its own matchmaking system, ratings and leaderboards – plus a map and campaign editor. It’s all glossily adorned with a revamped visual style that “harks back to the vibrant and magical beginnings of the saga”. The AI has also been overhauled, and you can expect difficulty settings designed for both those steeped in Might &amp; Magic and peasant newcomers like me, who are barely Mighty or Magical at all.</p>
<p>New mechanics include active abilities for heroes and creatures, plus a faction-based perk system, Faction Laws, for more granular sculpting of playstyles. The currently announced factions are the old school Knights of Temple, the teeming bloodsuckers and braineaters of Necropolis, the hipster faeriefolk of Sylvan, the surly dark elves and other subterranean stinkers of Dungeon, and the horrible demon bugs of Hive. There’s at least one more faction waiting to be revealed.</p>
<p>The Hive are this iteration’s big bads. “On Jadame, a continent in turmoil, rival factions must forge an uneasy and fragile alliance to face the Hive - a swarm of insectoids corrupted by a demon lord hell bent on subjugating the world,” comments the press release.</p>

<p>This will be the first Heroes Of Might &amp; Magic game to launch through early access. It runs on the Unity engine and is being developed by Unfrozen, creators of Iratus: Lord of the Dead, which was one of Sin’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unknown-pleasures-against-the-odds">Unknown Pleasures back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Frivolous closing note: I find "Olden Era" quite funny inasmuch as they could have subtitled it "Old Era", but that would have just made the game sound old, even though "old" is modern usage, while "olden" is an archaism. Language is a delightful beast. Perhaps this is the next conversational fallback position for people who insist that they're "middle-aged", even after they turn 60? I'm not old, you cheeky whippersnappers, I'm olden! If you're over 60, feel free to split that hair when you're next talking to a grandchild or medical professional.</p>

Some are games we’ve already heard of and have been featured in past roundups like the 2024 Day of the Devs showcases, while others were neat stuff I’d never even heard of before that will now definitely be on my radar for the rest of the year and heading into 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/an-update-on-black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is already one of the most successful video games of the year, breaking records and soaring up player charts. On PlayStation 5 and PC, players have been enjoying it with reviews praising the game. However, one segment of players haven’t been able to play Black Myth: Wukong at all, Xbox owners.</p>



<p>Now, of course they can play it if they have a PC or PS5 as well, but for those that just have either an Xbox Series X or S, the game still isn’t available. So what’s going on with it?</p>



<h2 id="h-the-latest-on-black-myth-wukong-on-xbox">The Latest On Black Myth: Wukong On Xbox</h2>



<p>The game was originally scheduled to release on the consoles alongside the PC and PlayStation before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was revealed in June</a> to not be coming at the same time. Then, later that month, Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-issues-statement-on-black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued a statement</a> on the game’s delay on the console, saying that they were “excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms”.</p>



<p>And now that the game is out, there’s a bit of an update as to what’s going on. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/20/whens-xboxs-black-myth-wukong-release-date-about-that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes’ Paul Tassi</a>, Black Myth: Wukong not being on Xbox isn’t a case of Sony snatching up any sort of console exclusive agreement with developer Game Science. Instead, it’s Microsoft’s own consoles and their policies causing the hiccups.</p>



<p>“The bad news is that once again, Xbox seems to have blundered into a Baldur’s Gate 3 situation…,” Tassi says.</p>



<p>Tassi says that the reason the game didn’t make it to Xbox at launch is because of a “tech issue”. While the specific issue isn’t mentioned in the report, it does seem to imply that the game isn’t running on Xbox Series S as well as it should. Microsoft’s policy since the console’s launch of games coming to both Xbox Series X and S seems to have backfired once again.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft on this claim, but a rep simply passed along the same statement from June that was also sent to Tassi. You can read that in full below:</p>



<p>“We’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms,” the statement reads. “We can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that.”</p>

Development on Infinity Nikki is being led by The Legend of Zelda expansion pass director Kentaro Tominaga, and the game bills itself as a cozy open-world adventure with puzzles to solve and secret areas to discover.

            <p>If you've been necromantically dreaming of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">Callisto Protocol</a> sequel, I'm afraid the monkey paw finger hasn't just curled - it's jammed itself right up your nose and scratched an FU on your hypothalamus. Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redacted">[REDACTED]</a>, a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.</p>
<p>The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game go?</p><!--more-->

<p>In [REDACTED], you are a lone security guard trying to make it out of Black Iron Prison, the original game's Jovian correctional facility. In The Callisto Protocol, you slithered and skulked through crammed and shadowy corridors, fending off squamous mutant convicts in a passable facsimile of Dead Space. In [REDACTED], you beast hordes of colourful monsters in frenetic Hades-style arena brawls. There are skills to upgrade, metas to finesse, "experiments" (mods, I guess?) to equip, weapons and suits to loot.</p>
<p>"This game is all about fighting, dying, dying again, dying some more, and adapting, taking the classic roguelike formula and cranking it to eleven," bellows the press release, because nothing says "punk rock" like unironically quoting a piece of mockumentary dialogue that was originally intended as a gag about the meaninglessness of rising numbers. At the very least, I'd like video games to start cranking it to 12. Maybe next time.</p>
<p>I'm probably being too mean. Or at least, I'm venting too much at the press release, and not saying enough about the game. Forgive the Poochie The Dog presentation and judge it purely as a genre piece with no Callisto affiliations, and [REDACTED] seems performant enough. The visuals are very Void Bastardy and hey, the melee combat certainly looks more entertaining than that of The Callisto Protocol, which admittedly is a bit like saying that running a cheesegrater over your face is more fun than sitting on a blowtorch. The game has at least one clever idea, though I don't think it's unique to [REDACTED]: when you die, your corpse revives as an enemy equipped with all the gear and upgrades you were carrying.</p>
<p>Each run is an exercise in crafting a bossfight, in other words, and I do wonder how that might affect your tactics deeper in: if you confident you're going to cop it, should you throw away all of your potent gear to make life easier for your successor? Aside from your own reanimated flesh, the game also features other human survivors locked in the same race for the very last prison escape pod. They'll either try to kill you directly or throw "unexpected challenges" into your path. Typical geezer shenanigans. When will they learn.</p>
<p>[REDACTED] is out 31st October. If you preferred the previous incarnation of Black Iron Prison, you might be interested in former Striking Distance bossman Glen Schofield's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-should-be-a-callisto-protocol-2-says-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-we-had-to-cut-two-and-a-half-bosses">thoughts about the rigours of development and their abandoned plans for a sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That means that for just six bucks, you’re probably getting hundreds of hours of entertainment as you try and develop your own civilization with any number of <em>CIv 6</em>’s available leaders.</p><p>In case you’re new here, the <em>Civilization </em>series are strategy games that allow you to develop your own nations, and, eventually, empires. You can customize the minutiae of these societies, including their values, religions, and technologies, and you can pursue a number of different paths to progress your society, hence the moniker for <em>Civ</em>’s subgenre 4X, which stands for explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate. You can come into conflict with other civilizations and famous world leaders (including a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/civilization-creator-shoots-down-our-memories-of-a-nuke-1845006305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-creator-shoots-down-our-memories-of-a-nuke-1845006305">hilariously nuke-happy Gandhi</a></span>) and can win these encounters, and the game, through various different means, including warfare or diplomacy.<br></p><p><em>Civ 6 </em>is the most recent entry, despite being released nearly ten years ago now, but it’s been thoroughly supported since then. In the intervening years, it has received at least two major expansions, and a number of smaller expansions adding new leaders, civilizations, and mechanics (like freakin’ climate change) to the game until as recently as early 2023. If you’re at all interested in getting more out of the game,<strong> you can pick up the expansions at about $5 apiece</strong>, or you could buy one of two bundles packaging the DLC.</p><p><strong>The first bundle, called <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization 6 Platinum Edition</em>, packs the two major expansions and about half of the smaller DLCs for about $12 right now on Steam.</strong> <strong>Alternatively, if you feel like you’re ready to go all in on <em>Civ 6 </em>ahead of the upcoming sequel next year, you can grab the anthology bundle that includes everything for just $25.</strong> In total, you’d be getting the base game and 18 DLCs spanning about a decade of content. I don’t think you could possibly get more out of the <em>CIv </em>series outside of playing every previous game.<br></p><p>Though you should be set with just that game, some of the other modern games in the series are also on sale. <strong><em>Civ 5 </em>is pretty cheap right now, only running you about $5</strong>, and if you want to go even further back,<strong> <em>Civ 4 </em>is going for $3</strong>. Don’t worry though, you don’t need to play <em>Civ 1-6 </em>in order to understand <em>Civ 7</em>. Common misunderstanding around these parts.<br></p><p>As someone curious about the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc-1766534236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc-1766534236">best PC strategy games</a></span>, and who’s been dipping their toes into PC gaming in general of late, it feels blasphemous to <em>not </em>have a single <em>Civ </em>game on my hard drive. Maybe today’s the day I fix that and get myself amped for the next game, which I’m sure I’ll be hearing about for the next decade following its release. We may as well all jump on board now, and who wouldn’t for these insanely low prices.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-datamining-has-changed-the-landscape-of-video-game-puzzle-and-secret-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last year, Blizzard launched a new event in World of Warcraft: Classic called Season of Discovery. The game mode offered players the chance to explore an old-school version of the MMORPG as it existed back in 2004, but with a twist. Players would be able to collect “runes” that would transform their characters into wacky new variations like mage healers or shaman tanks. New quests and other secrets were said to pepper the world, and certain dungeons were converted into larger, more challenging raids with new bosses and new loot. It was an exciting event, one that hinged on surprise and, as the title suggested, discovery. </p><p>The problem? Datamining. Through datamining, curious players were able to “discover” all the new runes, bosses, spells, and loot before they had even set foot in Azeroth.</p><p>True, not everything was spoiled out of the gate. Datamining, at its simplest, enables players to view basically any file in the game: images, text strings, locations. But none of those files are available in context. In Season of Discovery, players could see the names and uses of all the runes, but still had to find the runes in game, which often required solving puzzles or exploring areas off the beaten path. But the prevalence of spilled secrets before the event even started did <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/17s3i7k/season_of_datamining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>prompt some players</u></a> to quip on the irony of datamining in a “Season of Discovery.” Prominent World of Warcraft guide site Wowhead ended up <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/wowhead-statement-on-datamining-season-of-discovery-phase-2-337449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>backing off publishing datamined info</u></a> in response to community feedback. Even <a href="https://x.com/AggrendWoW/status/1772710836496134317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>developers commented on the issue</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While Season of Discovery is a particularly poignant example of World of Warcraft’s ongoing relationship with dataminers, the truth is that the entire game has been like this for years. Because Blizzard uses Public Test Realms (PTR) to test content before it goes live, dataminers have a ready supply of new tidbits of information to dump onto websites, guides, forums, and social media sites before the vast majority of players encounter them in regular gameplay. And Blizzard isn’t alone, either. In recent years, a number of games centering concepts such as discovery and secret-hunting have been forced to reckon with the challenges posed by dataminers. Live service games like Destiny 2 and Helldivers 2 face similar challenges as World of Warcraft, while even single-player games centered around secrets like Tunic and Animal Well have found creative ways to hide their biggest, most interesting twists.</p><p>Working against dataminers to hide secrets is a losing battle, which is why some developers are taking a different approach. Increasingly, creators are designing their games’ biggest surprises around the expectation that someone, somewhere, will crack them open and learn everything about them instantly.</p><h2>Flavor Crystals</h2><p>Jeremy Feasel is an associate game director on World of Warcraft, but he quips to me that his actual job is to add “flavor crystals” to World of Warcraft: that is, secrets or other fun little diversions. He started in the Cataclysm expansion working on rare spawns, which usually meant mounts that were difficult to obtain. But whenever he had a little time, he says, he would get up to some wacky stuff. </p><p>Which is how World of Warcraft players were introduced to Dormus, the Camel Hoarder.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Dormus is part of a fun little secret chain that ultimately rewards players with a rideable camel. To start, players come across a “Mysterious Camel Figurine” which is a very small statuette that can be found randomly in one of 50 different spots in the large, sandy region of Uldum. Most of the time, finding a figurine and clicking on it will simply cause it to crumble to dust. Only very rarely will it teleport players to Dormus to receive the camel, making the mount itself very rare, random, and time-consuming to find – even if you know exactly <em>how </em>to find it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I got WoW access and was like, what can I do with this?</p></div><p>“I got WoW access and was like, what can I do with this?” Feasel recalls. “I'm going to try adding 50 spawn points, will it let me? And then I tried to put the 51st spawn point in and I got an error and that's when I discovered there were limits to the things that I could do. So then I put it on a crazy timer so that it would still be really difficult to get. And then I was thinking, you know, what else can I do with this? I'll teleport you up to the steam pools and make you fight a guy. Why not have him carrying around camels and throwing camels at you? Because, of course, why not?</p><p>“I sent the email off to the WoW directors at that point. So proud of myself though. Very first thing that I had added to the game and I'll never forget, I got an email back from, I think our lead class designer at the time, Greg Street, saying, ‘Hey, this is exactly the kind of stuff that makes World Warcraft a great world to explore.’ And I think that was probably the thing that kicked off my desire to do more of those.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Dormus and his camels were one of World of Warcraft’s earliest efforts at deliberately hiding these kinds of secrets. Since then, Feasel and his colleagues have tried to add more secrets, and specifically ones that dataminers couldn’t find. Feasel tells me they “tried every trick in the book”, recalling hiding pages around the world in Battle for Azeroth with riddles on them. Dataminers could easily datamine all the riddles, but the riddles themselves would still have to be solved.</p><p>“We discovered that 50,000 people can go and look at everything in World of Warcraft in a week pretty effectively,” Feasel says. “It doesn't actually take them that much time to canvas the entire universe. And that was my first learning of, ‘Oh, I'm going to have to do better than this. I'm going to have to try harder to make each individual piece more difficult to figure out.’”</p><p>Over time, WoW’s penchant for riddles sparked a vibrant secret-finding community within the game. There’s a secret-finding Discord server, and communities like Wowhead routinely track and celebrate potential secrets, hints, and their eventual solutions. With so many people working constantly to solve the riddles Feasel creates, he’s had to get increasingly creative. For instance, when trying to conceal the Lucid Nightmare mount from players, he “added a bunch of items and a bunch of quests that just went nowhere and did nothing.” And more recently, Feasel worked on an in-game event focused on treasure hunting, entitled <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guide/world-events/secrets-of-azeroth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Secrets of Azeroth</u></a>. He hopes the event served as “an on-ramp” for players who loved the idea of secrets but didn’t usually have the time or interest in joining secret-finding community groups. </p><p>Like Feasel, Ben Cureton has embraced the chaos of player secret hunting in his work on Remnant 2. As the principal designer on the franchise, Cureton says he and his team’s job is to make “every toy that the player plays with,” including guns, archetypes, rings, and so forth. While Cureton loves to hide goofy breadcrumbs for players, he has also struggled with dataminers over the years. He recalls a situation years ago in the first Remnant, where dataminers uncovered an item called “Toxic Juju” that they were certain had to be <em>some</em> secret. In reality, Toxic Juju was just a leftover test item that didn’t lead to anything and never was intended to. But the brief fervor over its inclusion gave Cureton an idea. What if he hid something in Remnant 2 that <em>only</em> dataminers could find?</p><p>Which is how Cureton and his teammates ended up <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remnant-2s-wild-data-mining-puzzle-was-solved-by-someone-with-no-coding-experience-a-fridge-full-of-red-bull-and-chatgpt"><u>hiding an entire class</u></a> – the Archon – behind datamining.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Cureton recalls sitting in the “Cult of the Door” Discord, the group of secret finders trying to crack the mysterious red door that hid the class, and watching them unravel it together. It took them roughly 28 hours, he says, and he personally felt accomplished when they didn’t get it within the first hour. But he was also glad it didn’t take them days or weeks. “Our goal is never to antagonize the player,” he says. “We're not trying to do anything other than be a game, one of the games that have ridiculous secrets.” </p><p>In Remnant 2’s case, Cureton and his team’s experiment with datamining paid off. Players had a great time, and the developers were inspired to find even more creative ways to surprise their community in the future just by watching the players progress.</p><p>“We get to participate in watching somebody else play the game and watching the community come together to try to solve puzzles because we never get to experience Remnant like a player,” he says.</p><h2>Rabbit Holes</h2><p>Andrew Shouldice tells me he wasn’t thinking too hard about how to hide secrets from dataminers when he first started working on his single-player, secret-stuffed game: Tunic.</p><p>“If someone is interested in playing your game, they're probably not going to look stuff up,” he says. “Think of Ace Attorney, right? You're playing an Ace Attorney game, you start the game and you think, ‘Well, I should look up the whole script and read the solution to everything.’ No, you probably don't want to do that. If the way you want to enjoy the game is to play it and figure things out yourself, then you're probably going to do that.”</p><p>But even with that belief, Shouldice inadvertently designed a game that turned out to be pretty hard to crack. He tells me he used “a piece of technology that's part of Unity called IL2CPP, which takes the intermediate language that C# is compiled into and then mangles it a bunch and turns it into C++ code.” As a result, he says, the whole game “is a bit more opaque.”</p><p>Beyond the code, Tunic’s very design naturally evades reading files for solutions or secrets. Much of its puzzles rely on collecting manual pages throughout the game, and then solving a secret within the images themselves. A dataminer could conceivably see all the pages without collecting them, but they still needed to understand the manual’s cryptic notes and esoteric sketches. And still further beyond that, some of Tunic’s deepest puzzles rely on understanding the game’s mysterious, in-universe written language, and its even more mysterious musical language. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Tunic Screens (Nintendo Direct - Sept 2022)</h3></div></output><p>“Those assets are in the game, so people will probably find that first by blowing it open,” Shouldice says. “You have access to the music just fine, but digging around isn't going to give you what you're looking for. The puzzle is in figuring out the information that you have.”</p><p>Taken together, Shouldice and his colleagues managed to design Tunic in such a way where players could, in theory, datamine out all the scenes in the game and “experience probably some amount of joy, but I’ve never heard of someone doing that because that’s not fun.”</p><p>Still, Shouldice wanted to tease players who were determined to go the extra mile for secrets. There are a number of locations in Tunic that cannot be reached by most people playing normally, but can be snuck into via various exploits. There, Shouldice planted little signposts that produced a single word in Tunic’s in-universe text. When translated, the signpost simply read “egg.”</p><p>Billy Basso’s game, Animal Well, is often mentioned in the same breath as Tunic due to its penchant for secrets. But while Shouldice wasn’t worried about datamining in his early development, Basso recalls hearing lots of defeatist attitudes from other developers about datamining over the years that colored his impression for a while. He says he was told by others to not even bother trying to conceal elements of games he made from players. Everyone would just find it anyway.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I wanted to recreate that old school experience pre-internet of people word of mouth trading tips about a game.</p></div><p>So, naturally, Basso found a way to program his game not to allow datamining at all.</p><p>“I kind of wanted to push back against that and see what it would take to recreate that old school experience pre-internet of people word of mouth trading tips and their experiences about a game, and to recreate that sense of mystery and wonder that I feel like I remember games having growing up,” he says.</p><p>Basso explains that he programmed Animal Well in C++ in his own custom engine, for which there are no existing tools to unpack the files. “You have to get serious about really reverse engineering the machine code,” he says. “For my assets, I don't use any text or strings. If you go through the animations or the code, there's nothing you can read to make sense of it. It's all just numbers and machine instructions.</p><p>“Then for the really serious stuff, the files are actually encrypted with AES encryption, which should in theory be unbreakable. It's what you would use to encrypt network traffic or something. Typically that still shouldn't be that secure because you need the key to decrypt the files, and you have to put the key in the code so it knows how to decrypt it. But instead, the key is actually input through your actions in the game. You the player have to indirectly enter the key into the world, and then it will be able to unlock things. It's easier to just play the game and figure out the puzzles than to hack it.”</p><p>But Basso didn’t just stop at trying to prevent dataminers. Animal Well is fundamentally a game about discovering secrets, and he knew players would use any means necessary to crack its most challenging puzzles. Guides, speedrunning tricks, you name it, Basso tried to prepare for it.</p><p>For instance, one of Animal Well’s late-game treasure hunts involves <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-well-contains-a-hidden-puzzle-that-requires-at-least-50-people-to-complete"><u>finding 16 well-hidden rabbits</u></a>. But Basso hid additional bonus bunnies in completely inaccessible areas that, if the player manages to collect by tricking the game somehow, will lock them out of the actual 16-bunny reward. Elsewhere, Basso included a room that’s visible in a normal playthrough, but isn’t accessible without clipping through walls or using other tricks. When you enter, you’re rewarded with a “Cheater’s Ring” that allows your character to wallclip freely. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Basso’s efforts to prevent datamining largely succeeded, but his secrets were still cracked within a matter of days thanks to the power of jolly cooperation. When I interviewed him, Animal Well was on the cusp of release, and Basso believed his most difficult puzzles might elude the community for weeks, months, maybe even years. Then, Animal Well launched, and Basso’s weirdest secret was found roughly within a week thanks to a diligent, secret-hungry community working round the clock. He’s taking it in stride, though.</p><p>”It does let me know that, in a future game, there's kind of no limit to how obscure you can make something,” <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/animal-well-interview-billy-basso" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>he told Game File</u></a>.</p><h2>Inscrutable Quantum Devices</h2><p>Jeff Hamilton is currently a game designer at Riot Games, though when I spoke to him he was clear that we were only speaking about his past experiences working on both World of Warcraft and RIFT. Hamilton is a veteran dataminer dodger, and he’s got some theories, from a developer perspective, about why players love datamining so much. Especially in live service games, players “want to know everything as soon as they possibly can so that they can make all the best decisions about all their resources.” For them, “information is power.” </p><p>“They want to understand how they're all put together, and there's this conflict sometimes also with the games being so permanent that they want to feel like they don't make any mistakes,” he explains. “There's a need for datamining to…comfort themselves with a sort of security blanket, like an assurance that this guess they have about how they want to build their character is actually correct, defensible, playable. And that's a pattern that we've seen across many, many games over the years.”</p><p>Hamilton tells me that during his time working on World of Warcraft, there was a good rule of thumb for everyone: if you’re making something on your machine and you hit “Save,” players are going to see it. That’s been true for years, he says, going all the way back to the heyday of Everquest where fansites would just datamine and list every single thing in the entire game: every item, every spell, every location, everything. Now, those databases still exist, but players often rely on influences and theorycrafters to help them make sense of the massive dumps of information, which in turn helps it spread even further.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even with players combing over everything, Hamilton says he never felt datamining took the wind out of his sails on something he was actively making. “But I do think probably that the existence of data mining changed what I would or wouldn't make,” he adds. He tells me about working on Patch 8.2, Mechagon, and wanting to make a particular puzzle. But he recalls deciding not to do it, because the only way he could make it fun for the entire playerbase would require “six times as much time as I would have needed if I didn’t have to worry about all the pieces being datamined.”</p><p>But in another case, Hamilton was actively able to use datamining to playfully confuse secret hunters. He recalls working on an item called the “Inscrutable Quantum Device,” a trinket with a use listed in-game as “???” His hope was that players would simply try it out and see what happens, without expectations.</p><p>“So the way that I made this was to make one spell that had this tooltip with the question marks and then to make a bunch of other spells that it would determine, by some logic, which to actually cast. I was able to give it 13 different effects that kind of hinted at what the logic might be because I knew that players’ first step in figuring out how this would work would be to look up the item. And then their second step would be to look up the same name and they would see that there are 14 spells that are all named Inscrutable Quantum Device. Interesting. So we could get away with this sort of obtuseness that might otherwise be super frustrating because I knew that players had the tools to put the puzzle together.”</p><p>World of Warcraft is big enough and well-resourced enough to carefully walk the line between supporting the player desire to know everything while still concealing its biggest secrets. Over the years, the team has used a number of tactics to conceal secrets, such as waiting to implement certain items or cutscenes until launch, using techniques to mask specific dialogue from curious dataminers, or even just making statements around PTR patches indicating that content was not final. But not every game has that luxury, says Hamilton. When he worked on RIFT, for instance, there were only 40 people working on it, and there wasn’t time to build an engineering solution to datamining. They were too busy making sure matchmaking worked. Many other games are in this same predicament.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don't think there's any point in getting mad at people for following the impulses of what is interesting to them.</p></div><p>While Hamilton thinks datamining is cool and fundamentally comes from players enjoying and wanting to understand a game better, it does sometimes come into conflict with what developers want to do with said game. He describes players as effectively split into two camps: those who want to understand everything, and those who want to explore and experience new things. Sometimes, the desires of the first group conflict with the desires of the second group, especially when it comes to datamining. That’s just a reality of game development, he says, and one that game developers have to take into account.</p><p>“I don't think there's any point in getting mad at people for following the impulses of what is interesting to them and stuff like that,” he says. “...Sorry, you're making games for humans and that's just part of the deal. But I do think it would be interesting for dataminers to sort of reflect on or be introspective about the times where the thing they're making for the audience that wants categorization can ruin the experience for the audience that wants novelty and wants exploration.”</p><p>Datamining can be a frustrating reality that game developers often have to work around, especially when trying to hide interesting secrets or puzzle solutions that are intended to take extra effort to solve. And it can present interesting challenges to developers of live service games in particular, who may need to field community feedback on changes that aren’t ready for primetime.</p><p>“The Internet moves so quickly nowadays,” Feasel says. “There's a couple of things that I think that we've changed up in just our general process that I think have helped make it more of a fundamentally positive thing. Something really exciting to see is [the day a new patch gets datamined], where all this stuff shows up and all the really cool models show up and they get to see all these interesting changes and interesting systems and stuff like that. That's like one of my Christmases. I get to read the comments and see what people are liking about everything. I think it’s same thing for just about everybody on the team.” </p><p>Like Feasel, all those I spoke to gracefully accepted datamining and its challenges as a sign of a community that loves their games and wants to engage with them. That, they all say, is ultimately a positive. </p><p>“We made something for them,” Cureton says. “We love that the community enjoys finding stuff and we love people working together. So that's all we really care about in the end.” </p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?
