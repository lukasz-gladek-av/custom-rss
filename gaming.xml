            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you cannot stand video games and TV shows and would like to know what all the fuss regarding The Last of Us is about, the entire story so far will be available in book form later this year. Of course, it's also a perfectly valid option for those who already know the story through different mediums and would like to read it from the perspective of script writers Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross (the latter worked just on Part II).</p>



<p>The hardcover is already available for pre-order <a href="https://amzn.to/46WmXgE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Amazon</a>. It is estimated to be released on December 16, and the price of $69.99 is currently discounted to $66.63 (5% off). Dark Horse Books publishes the book, which is 616 pages long.</p>



<p>Here's the product overview:</p>



<p><em>Join Joel and Ellie from the very beginning of their unforgettable journey. Relive every climactic moment from The Last of Us Part I, from the duo’s time with Tess in Boston, to Ellie’s joy while petting giraffes, to Joel’s heart-wrenching decision at the Fireflies’ hospital. And dive into The Last of Us Part II’s dual-perspective story, including Abby’s shocking introduction to the story, Ellie and Dina forging a bond together, an enthralling encounter with the Rat King, and the final showdown between Ellie and Abby.</em></p>



<p><em>This volume contains the script from both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II, as well as the DLC, Left Behind, so you can experience every bottle thrown, every bad pun of Ellie’s, and every heart-pounding encounter with the Infected in a totally new way. Much like Savage Starlight was to Ellie, The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts is a must-have for any fan’s bookshelf (or survival kit).</em></p>



<p>The book also includes an art gallery featuring work by Naughty Dog principal character concept artist Hyoung Nam, a buckram-textured cover, and block printing along the pages' edges that evokes the iconic Cordyceps fungus of The Last of Us.</p>



<p>The story as-is can be considered complete. As we previously reported, creator Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-will-only-be-made-with-a-story-worthy-of-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a third game would only be produced if Naughty Dog found a worthy story. Druckmann himself recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped back</a> from his additional role as co-showrunner of the HBO series, although HBO reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbo-not-concerned-neil-druckmann-departure-the-last-of-us-show-16-emmy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn't concerned</a> about his departure. Even so, the second season <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw a large decline </a>in viewership, and fans fear the third season will be even worse without the creator's handiwork.</p>

<p>Now, we've got an update about one of the special items trainers located in Japan and Australia can get their hands on as a pre-order bonus. As highlighted by Serebii.net, it's a trench coat customisation and will be available "at certain locations" – including Amazon in Japan and from EB Games in Australia.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>While it's not known what exactly we might be seeing on the Switch 2 from Xbox, there's already been a lot of rumours about key series potentially being ported.</p>
<p>Additionally, Obsidian's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> team has recently responded to a question from <a href="https://youtu.be/o5tOD0sqfKM?t=1050">Gamertag Radio</a> about the game's sequel potentially getting a Switch 2 release at some point, and it sounds open to the idea of it – mentioning how it wants "as many people to be able to play" as possible (<a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51091-obsidian-says-we-ll-see-what-happens-in-regards-to-grounded-2-on-switch-2">via GoNintendo</a>).</p>

Super Heroes both Earth-born and cosmic must now join forces in a star-spanning adventure against the deadly Annihilation Wave. Brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat.</blockquote><blockquote>Choose and control your own team of two characters while tagging between them mid-fight with the innovative Cosmic Swap system, capitalizing on distinct superpowers and special attacks to create unique team-ups and dish out devastating damage. Unlock stellar powerups and rewards while experimenting with different duos and bash through a fantastic collection of locales and nemeses from the Marvel universe. Marvel Cosmic Invasion’s action includes a range of accessibility features, empowering the whole family to be Super Heroes (or villains), and supports four-player drop-in/drop-out local and online co-op with crossplay.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Joining the fight on Switch platforms later this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Marvel's been involved with some pretty exciting games in recent times, and hopefully, this trend continues with its upcoming arcade-style beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch on the Switch and Switch 2 later this year, Dotemu has today revealed another two playable characters joining the roster. This time we get a brief look at 'Beta Ray Bill' and 'Silver Surfer' who join the fight against the immortal super villain Annihilus.</p>
<p>Here's some PR about the latest character reveals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hammer time for Annihilus’ forces when Beta Ray Bill smashes into action! With his devastating and mighty hammer known as Stormbreaker, the son of Korbin marshals his cyborg strength to squash any bug battalion standing in his way!</p>
<p>And he won’t be joining the fight alone – from the depths of the cosmos, the Silver Surfer soars into the battle! Imbued with the Power Cosmic, the Surfer can stun any adversary. Easily gliding in the skies or close to the ground, insectoid invaders can’t escape Galactus’ former herald!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silver Surfer and Beta Ray Bill will join a cast made up of various other characters like Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Venom and She-Hulk, as they brawl their way through the streets of Marvel's New York, all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone.</p>

<p>Fans voice their frustrations online</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03dfc2db8ed2c/wwe-2k25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> has finally landed on the Switch 2 this week, and while the experience was expected to match other versions of the game, it seems this isn't <em>entirely</em> the case.</p>
<p>Although community creations are available in the Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-lacks-image-uploading-on-switch-2-and-fans-arent-happy">as highlighted by IGN</a>, this version "lacks image uploading" and it appears to have caught some wrestling enthusiasts by surprise.</p>
<p>The official game FAQ actually goes into a bit more detail about these restrictions, noting how Switch 2 players won't be able to upload or view custom images from "other platforms". The <a href="https://support.wwe2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/42408597808019-WWE-2K-Image-Uploader-Tool">same page on the game website</a> also includes the following notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 players will not see Image Uploader based Community Creations from any platform or be able to upload their own"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see below, fans and content creators within this space have shared their frustrations online – with some already speculating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1m6lovh/no_community_creations_in_nintendo_switch_2/">about the reasons behind this decision</a>.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51086-wwe-2k25-on-switch-2-blocks-access-to-user-created-content">GoNintendo</a> have also labelled this a "major disappointment" and have reached out to multiple parties to "try and get an answer".</p>

<p>Apart from this, early impressions suggest <a href="https://x.com/SMetaldave64/status/1948093777320546314">the Switch 2 version of WWE 2K25 is a respectable port</a>. We'll be delivering our Nintendo Life review soon, and if we hear any significant developments tied to this story, we'll let you know.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-sequel-recently-canceled-rumor-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-recently-canceled-a-star-wars-outlaws-sequel-%E2%80%93-rumor.1252920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This month, just days prior to the time of this writing, Ubisoft chief executive officer Yves Guillemot blamed<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/"> Star Wars Outlaws missing its sales targets on the Star Wars IP itself</a>, saying that the Star Wars brand was "<em>in choppy waters</em>" at the time of Outlaws' launch. Now, a rumor has surfaced that Ubisoft has quietly canceled a Star Wars Outlaws sequel. </p>



<p>The rumor comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bFaIYn9H3g&amp;t=2800s">Tom Henderson and Insider-Gaming</a>, who said on the website's podcast that Ubisoft "<em>recently canceled Star Wars Outlaws 2</em>," adding that it was still in its early stages and that it "<em>hadn't entered [full] production</em>," and that it was "<em>very, very, early</em>." Mike Straw, senior editor at the site, joked that we were "<em>probably seven years away</em>" from seeing it.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Is EA's Last Chance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bFaIYn9H3g?start=2800&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Henderson has <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">previously correctly reported</a> internal information about Ubisoft, but this claim remains a rumor for now. It's also arguably not the most wild speculation. You could say that Outlaws was the biggest miss for Ubisoft in 2024, a year rife with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/09/skull-and-bones-looks-like-its-doing-worse-than-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">big misses</a> for the company. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">struggled to move units out of the gate</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/">underwent significant changes from its original launch version</a> months after release due to a heavy wave of negative player feedback. The game's director even acknowledged <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/">disappointment with the response from critics</a>.</p>



<p>Its poor launch sales were also used as an excuse to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows out of 2024 and to its eventual March 2025 launch date. You could make the case that Ubisoft has had anything but negative things to say about Outlaws since it launched. It's not the craziest idea that leadership ultimately decided not to go down the road of a sequel, even if they were exploring what one would look like.</p>

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h45Sr1kafGU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>resulting video</u></a> is quite funny, showing the new Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) family as they fumble through a few matches as their in-game counterparts.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet the family! ✨Marvel Studios The Fantastic Four: First Steps cast's genuine reactions as they try out Marvel Rivals! 😄 <a href="https://t.co/sq8lwMh7pp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/sq8lwMh7pp</a></p>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1948513591134679137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's goofy and occasionally hard to watch as Pascal flails his stretchy arms at enemies, but the highlight is no doubt the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to Invisible Woman’s infamous Marvel Rivals Malice skin. Fans of the game had already taken the time to see everything the shockingly revealing outfit had to offer when it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvel-rivals/Season_1_Battle_Pass_and_New_Skins#Malice_Invisible_Woman_Skin">its debut with Season 1</a> in January. On the eve of the new Fantastic Four movie’s premiere, though, the cast is only just seeing it for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby is the first to joke about the skin: “Thank you. This is my favorite bit of her as well,” she says of the video game version of her Fantastic Four character. “This is my favorite bit. Guys, watch out, like I said, for the sequel. You better watch it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fantastic Four: First Steps, of course, has yet to receive the green light for a proper MCU sequel, though we do know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-pedro-pascals-reed-richards-lead-the-avengers-the-fantastic-four-first-steps-director-clarifies-previous-comments-insists-its-for-the-russo-brothers-to-reveal"><u>at least some of its major characters</u></a> will make an appearance in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday. Invisible Woman’s evil black-and-red Malice skin probably won’t make it into the MCU, but the slack-jawed Pascal still shared some of his thoughts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here we go,” Pascal said. “Costume designer, take notes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Loserfruit’s video also includes the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to other Marvel Rivals cosmetics, including Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman’s The Life Fantastic wedding skins. Of course, it’s how all four actors reacted to the Malice skin that has started to achieve viral status.

                <p>Epic Games apparently <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1948486101020143845" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed passive XP gains</a> from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s main Battle Royale and Zero Build modes on Thursday afternoon, in the midst of its Summer Road Trip event that will award a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-the-free-chevrolet-corvette-in-fortnite-and-rocket-league/1100-6533356/" data-ref-id="1100-6533356">free Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 car</a> body for gaining XP to complete a series of daily quests. Playing Battle Royale had awarded 550 XP per minute, or a little less than half a level per hour, just for existing in the game mode--but that's no longer the case.</p><p>While this certainly is a bit of a nerf, it's actually not typical for Battle Royale and Zero Build to give passive XP. In fact, passive XP was only just added to those modes at the beginning of the current season--before then, we lived without it. The change had made leveling the battle pass this season meaningfully faster.</p><p>Assuming the change will stick for a while, there are two fairly obvious potential reasons for the change. The Summer Road Trip event is one of them, since its quests simply require gaining XP to complete. You only need to gain eight total levels across these quests, so the lack of passive XP in BR probably won't slow anyone down very much. Another possibility is that we're approaching the end of Chapter 6 Season 4, and this change will make it a little tougher for folks who are just now getting started on the battle pass to catch up before the season ends on August 7.</p><p>When Chapter 6 Season 3 ends on August 7, it'll also mark the end of the current seasons of Fortnite OG and Lego Fortnite. In other words, it'll be a pretty eventful season launch. In fact, there's even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ogs-rocket-live-event-is-just-days-away/1100-6533279/" data-ref-id="1100-6533279">an end-of-season event</a> ahead. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The best of both worlds for backers and creators.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a surprising turn of events, Indiegogo, one of the largest global crowdfunding platforms second only to Kickstarter, has been acquired by board game crowdfunding site Gamefound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/blog/post/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo?ref=info-banner_1-152" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint announcement</a>, Gamefound revealed it will be integrating its technology to enhance the Indiegogo platform, offering creators and backers more powerful tools than ever before. These include over 20 payment options, a full-featured mobile app, built-in marketing tools, and more robust pledge management. Indiegogo will also adopt Gamefound's flat 5% fee structure, putting more money in creators' pockets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s time for crowdfunding to be a forward-facing industry again,” said Julie dePontbriand, CEO of Indiegogo in the official release. “Gamefound’s technology is unrivaled, and we’re thrilled to bring it to Indiegogo’s diverse community. Together, we’re making crowdfunding more innovative, creator-friendly, and exciting than ever before.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two sites will continue operating independently for now, with Gamefound remaining focused on tabletop games and Indiegogo continuing to promote tech, film, and other creative projects. In the near future, Gamefound campaigns will also be discoverable through Indiegogo, opening the door to a much broader audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiegogo is one of the original crowdfunding pioneers, having launched over 17 years ago. In that time, it has amassed 38 million members and raised more than $3 billion for projects across the globe. By combining Indiegogo’s global reach with Gamefound’s cutting-edge infrastructure, the partnership might finally give Kickstarter a run for its money.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What does this mean for the board game industry?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, this acquisition is a massive win for the board game industry. Gamefound will soon be cross-promoting its tabletop campaigns through Indiegogo, allowing creators to get in front of millions of new customers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With fewer fees and more native tools to help promote projects, creators may finally start shifting away from Kickstarter for new campaigns. Since Gamefound doesn't have a paid promotion feature like Kickstarter Boost, it levels the playing field for smaller creators, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Large publishers are already favoring Gamefound, with six of the ten <a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/520142/gamefound-top-10-biggest-board-game-crowdfund-campaigns" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest board game projects in 2024</a> successfully funded there, including the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-the-board-game-funded-in-10-minutes">Cyberpunk 2077 board game that reached its goal in ten minutes</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.

                <p>It seems horror fans are destined to mourn the loss of Kojima's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/" data-ref-id="5000-306236">Silent Hills</a> project until the end of time--but that doesn't mean there aren't games out there picking up the torch left behind by its playable teaser, aptly named P.T. Indeed, developer Broken Bird Games has absorbed some of Kojima's vision to craft the eerie mind-bender <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luto/" data-ref-id="5000-526997">Luto</a>. In this atmospheric horror title, you'll spend your time as a character stuck in a loop within their home, trying desperately to figure out, well, <em>why</em>.</p><p>If you're interested in checking out this chilling mystery but want to know what kind of time investment you're in for before you do, we'll fill you in on how long it takes to beat Luto and how many chapters stand between you and the finale.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mBgdXyIGsQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1mBgdXyIGsQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>How long does it take to beat Luto?</h2><p>How long it takes you to finish Luto will depend largely on your puzzle-solving abilities and how well you pay attention to your surroundings. Even with its occasionally obtuse puzzles, Luto is still a relatively brief horror experience that is focused on giving you a meaningful dose of the creeps without wearing its gimmicks too thin. With this in mind, you can expect it to take between <strong>3-5 hours to finish the campaign</strong>. Of course, if you're using a guide to assist with puzzles in Luto, you can almost certainly wrap things up even quicker. </p><h2>Luto chapter list</h2><p>Glancing at the chapter list for Luto may be confusing, with its repeated chapters and strange jumps. But it all makes sense within the bizarre, looping narrative structure of the game, which unravels to great effect as you move deeper and deeper into its twisted tale. While we don't want to ruin anything here about the way the narrative plays out in Luto, you can get a basic idea of what type of experience you're getting yourself into by surveying the chapter list below.</p><ul><li>Chapter 1 - It's Happening Again</li><li>Chapter 2 - Beyond the Noise</li><li>Chapter 3 - One More Time</li><li>Chapter 1 - It's Happening Again </li><li>Chapter 4 - Thanks for Pushing Me</li><li>Chapter 5 - Playing with the Truth</li><li>Chapter 22 - A Mouth Full of Sand Can't Scream</li><li>Chapter 3 - One More Time </li></ul><p>Luto is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Skybound and QuarterUp announced that Rex Splode would be joining Mark Invincible, Atom Eve, and more on the playable roster for Invincible Vs.--the 3v3 tag-team fighting game coming next year. Today, during Robert Kirkman's panel at San Diego Comic-Con, the Invincible creator announced another new fighter for the game, and this one is a little more beastly.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle Beast--the fearsome warrior who travels the Invincible universe looking for a fighter to give him a glorious death--is the latest entrant into the Invincible Vs roster. The reveal trailer for the giant showed off some of his smashing moveset--including one attack where he smashed his club into Bulletproof so hard, it knocked off his head and limbs.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Invincible VS - Battle Beast Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Battle Beast becomes the sixth confirmed fighter for Invincible Vs., joining the previously mentioned Invincible, Atom Eve, Bulletproof, and Rex Splode, as well as the Viltrumite Thula. Two other Viltrumites, Lucen and Omni-Man, did feature in the game's initial reveal trailer in June, but neither have been officially confirmed as playable characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible Vs. was announced during the Xbox Showcase in early June, with Skybound also announcing the creation of its development studio Quarter Up. Quarter Up is made up of industry veterans from Activision, Riot Games, Xbox, and more, and it was founded by Mike Willette, who previously worked on the Killer Instinct 2013 reboot for Xbox--as a developer and as the voice of the announcer.</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible VS is set to launch in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

The official synopsis is as follows:</p><p>“A young Earthbender discovers she’s the new Avatar after Korra – but in this dangerous era, that title marks her as humanity’s destroyer, not its savior. Hunted by both human and spirit enemies, she and her long-lost twin must uncover their mysterious origins and save the Seven Havens before civilization’s last strongholds collapse.”</p><p>The image shown at Comic Con has the new Avatar front and center, alongside a feline companion and another character named Jae, who is described as Pavi’s mentor.</p><figure id="" data-id="d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-recommend-id="image://d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="3441" data-height="1933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nickelodeon</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-recommend-id="image://d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="3441" data-height="1933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Seven Havens</em> will premiere in 2027 on Nickelodeon and span 26 episodes across two seasons.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo-greatly-expanding-tabletop-crowdfunding-platform</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo-greatly-expanding-the-tabletop-crowdfunding-platform.1252797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamefound has acquired the crowdfunding platform, Indiegogo. This is a major change for Indiegogo, which was one of the earliest pioneers of crowdfunding platforms. This acquisition will lead to new features and improvements, as well as new conveniences for users.</p>

<h2>The Gamefound Indiegogo Acquisition</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/blog/post/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Gamefound discussed the changes that would be coming to both platforms as a result of the acquisition. First, much like Roll20 and Demiplane's acquisition, you will be able to log in to Gamefound using either your Indiegogo or Gamefound credentials. In addition, Indiegogo will be adopting Gamefound's business terms and policies, which are generally friendlier to the end user.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamefound-indiegogo-campaign-metrics.jpg?itok=SgV_nrJJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamefound-indiegogo-campaign-metrics.jpg?itok=nxWZIjNB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The latter is especially impressive since Gamefound provides plenty of methods and options for users to launch and support different tabletop projects. Campaigns include both pre-launch and late pledges. The platform provides integrated tax tools, providing more transparent prices for various regional taxes and national tariffs. Lastly, users have access to stretch pay and direct currency exchange.</p>

<p>“It’s time for crowdfunding to be a forward-facing industry again,” said Julie dePontbriand, CEO of Indiegogo. “Gamefound’s technology is unrivaled, and we’re thrilled to bring it to Indiegogo’s diverse community. Together, we’re making crowdfunding more innovative, creator-friendly, and exciting than ever before.”</p>

<p>These changes aside, not much will change for either platform. Gamefound is still dedicated to providing a platform for tabletop crowdfunding projects. It has been their mission statement since it was founded in 2016, and that is still their focus. Their track record speaks for itself with successes like board game adaptations of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cyberpunk-2077-board-game-campaign-raises-over-1-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/blasphemous-board-game-brings-penitence-to-gamefound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blasphemous</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hearts-of-iron-board-game-reaches-gamefound-success-in-13-minutes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hearts of Iron</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for Indiegogo, it will continue as a platform for various tech and arts projects. Projects as diverse as Steam Deck competitors or board game projects like the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-announces-street-masters-champion-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Street Masters</em></a> board game. The difference now is that the platform's userbase of about 38 million will be enjoying some quality-of-life improvements.</p>

VShojo CEO Justin “Gunrun” Ignacio <a href="https://x.com/VShojo/status/1948442574722924778">made the announcement today on X, writing</a>, “I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us to this point.”</p><p>Earlier this week, VShojo came under fire as Ironmouse, the agency’s top-performing VTuber, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712627/ironmouse-leaves-vshojo-vtuber-twitch-youtube">announced she was leaving the company</a> over a missing $500,000 charity donation and her own unpaid funds. Her departure triggered a mass exodus of VShojo talent, with 12 of the company’s 13 creators officially announcing their own split from the company and some also claiming unpaid wages as their reason. Ignacio’s announcement alluded to VShojo’s financial difficulties.</p><p>“We raised around $11 million to pursue a bold, talent-first approach in VTubing,” the statement reads. “However, despite all our efforts, the business failed to generate the revenue we needed to sustain that model, and eventually, we ran out of money.”</p><p>Ignacio also admitted that the funds raised by Ironmouse and intended for the Immune Deficiency Foundation had been spent by the company: “Additionally I acknowledge that some of the money spent by the company was raised in connection with talent activity which I later learned was intended for a charitable initiative.” Ignacio went on to write that he was confident that he’d be able to raise enough money to cover those costs. “We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts.”</p><p>Here’s the statement in full.</p><div><blockquote><p>VShojo has failed, and I’ve mismanaged the company into the situation you’re all witnessing.</p><p>So today I am sharing the difficult news that VShojo is shutting down, and I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us to this point.</p><p>I’ve been doing everything I can to fundraise and right the ship these past few months, but despite my efforts, we are in a worse position, and those I care about are now paying the price.</p><p>Over the past few years, we raised around $11 million to pursue a bold, talent-first approach in VTubing, prioritizing creators and community over short-term profits, to achieve long-term sustainability. Our funding went directly to our creators through generous splits, debut investments, infrastructure, concerts, events, and staffing, all designed to support them. We also wanted talent to own their IP, which we knew was a unique creator-first approach for an agency. However, despite all our efforts, the business failed to generate the revenue we needed to sustain that model, and eventually, we ran out of money.</p><p>Additionally, I acknowledge that some of the money spent by the company was raised in connection with talent activity, which I later learned was intended for a charitable initiative. At the time, we were working hard to raise additional investment capital to cover our costs, and I firmly believed, based on the information available to us, that we would be able to do so and cover all expenses. We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts. I made the decision to pursue funding, and I own its consequences.</p><p>I am deeply sorry to all the talents, staff, friends, and community members who believed in our brand. You did not deserve this.</p></blockquote></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/713343/vshojo-shutting-down-ironmouse-missing-charity-donations]]></content:encoded>

This PMC will be a part of the game’s multiplayer mode, too. Despite the trailer being all about the campaign, it’s clear that this time around EA and series creator DICE—which is part of a larger group of teams working on <em>BF6 </em>known as Battlefield Studios—are aiming for a grounded, contemporary military sim. This is unlike recent <em>Battlefield</em> entries like <em>BF2042</em> and <em>BFV</em>, which either focused on the past or the future. This is good. <em>Battlefield 3 </em>and <em>4 </em>are probably the best games in the series. I just hope that after launch, <em>BF6</em> avoids becoming an IP slop shop like <em>Call of Duty </em>and other big shooters have.</p><p>These days, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973?_gl=1*52m3rn*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMzODI0MDkkbzY3JGcwJHQxNzUzMzgyNDA5JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973?_gl=1*52m3rn*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMzODI0MDkkbzY3JGcwJHQxNzUzMzgyNDA5JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">it seems like every major live-service shooter is filled with crossover skins</a></span>. I’ve been playing <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> recently, after its big update, and was shocked and horrified to be killed by a person dressed as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zRanYrbVBA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zRanYrbVBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick from <em>Rick &amp; Morty </em>during a match</a></span>. Later, I killed Master Chief and Lara Croft. The gritty, tactical aesthetic Ubisoft had spent years creating was ruined and the game felt like a joke. </p><p>A similar thing has happened to <em>Call of Duty,</em> which continues to introduce sillier and weirder skins, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjaKA57mnu8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjaKA57mnu8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beavis and Butthead</a></span>. Even <em>Destiny </em>has decided to ruin what was one of the most unique and interesting sci-fi universes in decades by shoving <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-renegades-trailer-release-date-1851779376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-renegades-trailer-release-date-1851779376"><em>Ghostbusters</em>,<em> Star Wars</em></a></span><em>, </em>and more into the game. </p><p>Look, I get it. <em>Fortnite </em>makes a lot of money. And it relies heavily on IP crossover skins with various movies, TV shows, and other games. The thing is, <em>Fortnite </em>has always been a weird cartoon playground that felt more like a toybox than a real world. So I don’t mind the Predator, Peter Griffin, Hatsune Miku, and Godzilla hanging out together. It’s a horrible, but impressive, pop culture nightmare. And it doesn’t need to be copied by every other live-service game around. </p><p>My hope for <em>Battlefield 6</em> is that EA realizes the opportunity they have with this new game. Every one of your competitors, big and small, has made a deal with the devil and added crossover cosmetics and goofy skins in the pursuit of <em>Fortnite</em>-like profits.</p><figure id="" data-id="1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-recommend-id="image://1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-recommend-id="image://1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And EA and Battlefield Studios have a chance here to go in a different direction. To take a different path with <em>Battlefield 6</em> and its cosmetics. </p><p>Don’t ruin the game’s aesthetic and grounded tone by adding Spider-Man or whatever; instead, focus on adding content that fits within the universe and doesn’t distract during battles. Add more camo options. More tactical vests and goggles. New weapon attachments and boots. It might not be as flashy as, say, adding The Thing from <em>Fantastic Four</em> into the game, but it will preserve <em>BF6</em>'s tone and look. </p><p>I think if EA goes this route, it could differentiate this new <em>Battlefield </em>game from the upcoming <em>Call of Duty</em> and all the other free-to-play live-service shooters out there in 2025. And these days, that could be the key to building a large and loyal audience. Better yet, it means I won’t have to get picked off by someone dressed as Batman or Darth Vader while trying to capture an objective. Doesn’t that sound nice? Imagine a game with a distinct and consistent art style. It’s not impossible. It could happen. And I hope EA and Battlefield Studios realize that and keep the slop out. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Nintendo and Lego have become regular collaborators in recent years. Between its Lego Mario line of toys and more recent models like an NES or Bowser, the Nintendo-specific Lego sets are plentiful enough that they take up huge sections of the aisle in toy stores. Today, the two announced their latest collaboration: a replica of Nintendo's first handheld, the Game Boy.</p><p>The set is aimed towards nostalgic adults, coming with an 18+ age recommendation. It doesn't light up, and it's (perhaps obviously) not a playable system, but the buttons are designed to be pressed, with a realistic tactile feel. The model comes with two game cartridges – Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening – which can be inserted just as you would into the real handheld. It also comes with swappable screens to simulate each game, along with a third option showing the Nintendo logo.</p><p>Take a look for yourself at the photo gallery below.</p><p>The Lego set will retail for $59.99 in the United States. It launches October 1 of this year, but you can preorder one at regular Lego retailers (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=ignlego-20&amp;ascsubtag=070hgOr7WJvqG6SJWg1FAAQ">Amazon</a>) starting today.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/a-lego-game-boy-replica-comes-out-this-october]]></content:encoded>

<p>Accompanying the short tribute video of the voice actor's many roles in the Pokémon anime — where Carter played Professor Oak, Gary Oak, Meowth, and Team Rocket's James — along with the below message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are deeply saddened by the passing of James Carter Cathcart, the voice behind Professor Oak, Gary Oak, James and Meowth of Team Rocket, and other iconic characters for the Pokémon animated series over many years</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In addition to his voice work, James provided over 700 episodes of scripts for the animated series, shaping the stories that defined generations of fans. From the very first episode to the final journeys, James brought warmth, humor, and unforgettable charm to the world of Pokémon. His talent gave life to some of our most beloved characters, and his legacy will continue to reach the hearts of Trainers everywhere.</p>
<p>James’s voice will always be part of our adventure. Our thoughts and condolences are with his family and friends."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Carter recorded voice lines for over 700 episodes of the anime, but retired from voice acting in 2023 after being diagnosed with throat cancer.</p>
<p>The video ends on a rather poignant moment from the anime where Meowth and a Glameow are riding a boat while looking at the moon.</p></section>

      <div><p>As Critical Role's San Diego Comic-Con panel continued, they debuted footage from the upcoming Season 4 of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> alongside a release window, and the confirmation that the fifth season has been greenlit, but that it will also be the last.</p>

<p>In addition to this announcement, a short clip was played from the upcoming season highlighting Vox Machina's plan to rob the Cobalt Soul with the help of Taryon Darrington. This is the first time we've seen Taryon and his construct companion, Doty, in motion for <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Executive Producers and Critical Role Co-Founders Sam Riegel and Travis Willingham had the following to say on the announcement of the final season of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It's so rare for any television series to get to tell a complete story, beginning to end, exactly as it was envisioned, we're so grateful to our fans, the critters, our partners at Prime Video, and the original Kickstarter backers for bringing this show to life, and turning the numbskulls of Vox Machina into animation legends."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What's next after <em>The Legend Of Vox Machina</em>?</h2>

<p>This wasn't the only piece of Critical Role animation news at the San Diego Comic-Con panel as a teaser animation and release date for the first season of <em>The Mighty Nein</em> was also announced.</p>

<p>Additionally, even though there is no specific announcement, fans of Critical Role are waiting with bated breath for any potential announcements of animated adaptations of their third campaign, Bells Hells, and any of the spin-off series like Calamity or Downfall.</p>
