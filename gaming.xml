            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Korean publisher <strong>Kakao Games</strong> shared its updated release schedule during the Q4 2025 earnings report, including two highly anticipated MMORPGs: <strong>ArcheAge Chronicles</strong> and <strong>Chrono Odyssey</strong>. </p>



<p>Both games have already been delayed; they were originally slated for 2025, but got pushed to 2026. Now, Chrono Odyssey has been moved even further away, to <strong>Q1 2027</strong>, whereas Archeage Chronicles is still holding fast to its <strong>Q4 2026</strong> window. This is slightly surprising, because ArcheAge Chronicles <strong>still hasn't hosted any Closed Beta Tests in Western countries</strong>, yet Kakao Games is confident it will debut globally before the end of this year. </p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-ii-gets-stunning-debut-trailer-and-first-info-confirmed-for-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> as <strong>ArcheAge 2</strong> in November 2022. However, developer <strong>XL Games</strong> (a subsidiary of Kakao following the <strong>$100 million acquisition made in February 2020</strong>) <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-archeage-2s-new-title-out-in-2025-the-pc-version-requires-an-rtx-2070-super/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> nearly two years later that they had decided to <strong>rework the project from a straight MMORPG sequel of the "sandpark" ArcheAge to a more intimate online action RPG experience</strong>. Hence, the title change. XL Games is also attempting to reach a wider global audience by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-trying-to-reach-a-wider-audience-by-focusing-on-pve-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focusing more on PvE</a></strong> (Player-versus-Environment) content, whereas the previous installment featured prominent large scale PvP features.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-qa-one-of-our-key-goals-for-the-game-is-that-it-feels-as-good-playing-solo-as-it-does-in-a-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>exclusive Wccftech interview</strong></a> we published last August, XL Games revealed that those territorial conquest features were completely removed from ArcheAge Chronicles because <strong>they didn't translate well to the action combat system and new direction</strong>. PvP is now structured, opt-in, and controlled through formats such as arenas, battlegrounds, and zone-based competitive events. <strong>Trade runs remain, but the scale and mechanics have changed</strong>, although they can still be done solo or with others.</p>



<p><strong>Housing</strong> supports shared spaces and neighborhoods where players can live alongside each other, but the focus shifted from territorial ownership toward personal expression and meaningful community-building, partly to avoid the land rush issues that were common in the first ArcheAge.</p>



<p>Endgame is now <strong>PvE-driven</strong>, focused on exploration, challenge, and meaningful progression. <strong>Instanced PvE experiences are built around teams of two to five players instead of large raid groups</strong>. Endgame includes dungeons with narrative-driven experiences, as well as crafting, trading, life skills, housing, and exploration. Overall, ArcheAge Chronicles aims to respect player time with flexible playstyles that don't feel like a second job, which was admittedly an issue in the previous title.</p>



<p>As for the other MMORPG in Kakao's schedule, Chrono Odyssey, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already hosted a limited-time Steam Closed Beta Test in June</a>. However, its reception was mixed, leading the developer, Chrono Studio, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-revamp-pretty-much-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to revamp nearly every aspect of the MMORPG</a></strong>. That's the main reason behind the new delay. <strong>Both games will be released on PC and consoles</strong>, by the way, presumably with cross-play functionality.</p>



<p>In the Kakao Games earnings call, an executive explained the reasons behind the games' long development timelines:</p>



<p><em>Regarding ArcheAge Chronicles and Chrono Odyssey, our overarching approach is to further enhance the completeness of the game build. In the process of conducting the test and going through the optimization process, we wanted to make sure that we fully reflect all the enhancements that is required. So once again, we made certain adjustments because we wanted to further expand on the validating of the development. So through these efforts, basically the timeline has been adjusted so that we could minimize the operational risk as much as possible.</em></p>

              <p><span>As rumors </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-dlc-zerrikania-expansion-rumor-2000658222"><span>continue to swirl</span></a><span> about the possibility of a new mystery DLC for </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span>, modders have </span><span>beaten CD Projekt RED to the punch with a new fan-made Ciri story quest. It’s even set in the same region as </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span>: the mountainous kingdom of Kovir and Poviss. “We got </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> before</span><i><span> The Witcher 4,” </span></i><span>as one Nexus Mods user puts it.</span></p> <p>As fans wait for news of CD Projekt Red’s next open-world RPG, <span>modder Alexander Fandera-Maslov was able to finish the unofficial </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> tie-in project called </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11831?tab=description"><i><span>Dawn over Kovir</span></i></a> (via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-extra-dlc-chat-lingers-the-witcher-3-gets-a-witcher-4-inspired-quest-mod-designed-to-give-you-a-taste-of-ciris-adventures-in-kovir"><em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em></a>). The <span>mod was “inspired by </span><i><span>The Witcher 4’s</span></i><span> Cinematic Reveal Trailer” and thus puts players into the shoes of Geralt’s surrogate daughter as she embarks on her own world-weary monster-hunting journey.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>According to Fandera, the mod will take roughly “between 45 minutes and 1.5 hours to complete,” and tasks players with a new custom-made quest in the mountainous Northern kingdom full of mines. </span><i><span>Dawn over Kovir</span></i><span> doesn’t feature English voice acting, but English subtitles are available. Fandera says that an upcoming 1.0 update “will refine animations and gameplay components, and add voice acting.” Hopefully it doesn’t use generative AI to make that happen.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It could be a nice distraction to tide fans over until CD Projekt Red releases something new in the world of <em>The Witcher</em>. </span><span>Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski claimed on January 7 via </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a> <span>that he is “100 percent certain CDPR will release significant new content this year” in order to close the gap in its current sales incentive program. Speculation based on those claims and other alleged leads have suggested that a DLC, if it ends up existing, could serve as a sort of bridge between the events of the last game and </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p>That game doesn’t sound set to come out for <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310">another year or two at the earliest</a>. Meanwhile, CD Projekt Red is currently working on bringing mods to the console versions of<em> The Witcher 3</em>. Even if the alleged mystery DLC doesn’t turn out to be real, players will still be able to give <em>Dawn over Kovir</em> a try for themselves on console soon enough.</p>

            <guid>1432120</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At the center of Rick and Morty’s early years and High on Life was Justin Roiland. He co-created the sci-show TV show and founded Squanch Games, the studio behind High on Life 2 and its predecessor. But controversy has courted Justin Roiland in recent years, making his High on Life 2 status a questionable one, to say the least.</p>



<p>Rick and Morty at its pomp was untouchable. It shifted merchandise like nobody’s business, TV numbers were great, and those first three to four seasons were gold. It made Justin Roiland a star, and he boosted his profile by founding Squanch Games and creating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life/" id="106984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life</a>.</p>



<p>In 2026, the dynamic is very different, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> makes some changes.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-justin-roiland-be-in-high-on-life-2">Will Justin Roiland Be In High on Life 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No squanching. Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s confirmed that Justin Roiland has had no involvement whatsoever in High on Life 2, whether it’s the game’s development or conception.</strong></p>



<p>Quite simply, Justin Roiland resigned from Squanch Games in 2023. He’s gone off the grid since, and it means he hasn’t been associated with the company in the meantime, ensuring the voice actor hasn’t played a part in High on Life 2.</p>

</ul>



<p>Long-time fans will know he voiced Kenny in the first game, but the Gatlian was later replaced in post-launch HOL content.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-justin-roiland-in-high-on-life-2-controversy-explained">Why Isn’t Justin Roiland In High on Life 2? Controversy, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Reports of domestic abuse, harassment, and other accusations against Justin Roiland were made public in 2023, and the voice actor and creator was subsequently dismissed or parted ways with most (if not all) companies he was associated with at the time.</strong></p>



<p>Roiland was actually arrested as early as 2020. Once everything became public knowledge in 2023, many women came forward with claims against Roiland, and it wasn’t long before he was dismissed from Adult Swim and Rick and Morty—where he voiced the titular Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith for several years.</p>

</ul>



<p>Eventually, he resigned from Squanch Games, and despite criminal charges being dropped against Roiland in 2023, new claims of assault surfaced later in the year.</p>



<p>Justin Roiland has been out of the spotlight since, and it remains to be seen if he’ll make a comeback to any of his former companies or projects. For now, he’s not associated with Rick and Morty, High on Life 2, or anything else.</p>

			<p>The <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">God of War</em> series is one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tentpole PlayStation franchises,</strong> and one that represents the <strong>brand's identity best</strong>. Moving from the <strong>character-action experiences</strong> of the first three entries in the series, the franchise starring Kratos has evolved into a compelling <strong>action-adventure series</strong> with the latest two games. Such a drastic departure in gameplay and tone is obviously making fans of the series curious about the <strong>franchise's future</strong>, but as of now, not much is known about how<em> God of War</em> will evolve in future games.</p>



<p>Before a new main entry in the series, however, it is rumored a smaller <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2.5D Metroidvania-style God of War </strong></a>will be released, possibly to bridge the gap between<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">God of War Ragnarok</strong></a></em> and its sequel. Although there's the chance this game will be revealed during tomorrow's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">State of Play</strong></a>, the game's official announcement may be accompanied by another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">surprising revelation</strong>, judging from what a known insider recently said.</p>



<p>Replying to a user's question on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2021355822207598991#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X</a></strong>, insider Nate the Hate, who has an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">excellent track record</strong>, revealing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 announcement date</strong></a> ahead of an official confirmation, among other things, said something interesting about this <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">God of War</em> spin-off.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"All I can say is this: When talk of the 2D God of War first started last year, I heard whispers that it was being considered for a multiplatform release,"</em> the insider said. Unfortunately, it is not yet known if this consideration "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">evolved into an active plan,"</em> so it remains to be seen if this project will become the first entry in the series to enjoy <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a multiplatform release</strong>.</p>



<p>As the insider did not specify what kinds of&nbsp;multiplatform whispers&nbsp;were circulating last year, the safest bet would be on&nbsp;a <strong>simultaneous PlayStation 5 and PC release</strong>, if such plans are still in the works, a strategy that was previously reserved for certain titles, such as the live service game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></strong>. At the same time, considering some <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">smaller PlayStation games</strong> did release on other consoles and PC in the past, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-horizon-adventures/">LEGO: Horizon Adventures</a></strong>, it wouldn't really be surprising to see the game launch on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> as well, whose hybrid nature would be well-suited for a Metroidvania game.</p>



<p>Without any official information on this <em>God of War</em> project, however, <strong>a multiplatform release remains pure speculation</strong>. However, if the game is finally shown this week, we won't have to <strong>wait</strong> <strong>much longer</strong> to learn what it's about and whether non-PlayStation players will be able to experience it as well.</p>

            <p>The developer behind voxel sandbox Allumeria claims Microsoft have withdrawn a DMCA takedown filed against the game over alleged copyright infringement. According to an email <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1311156281658183760/1338095872679870485/1470679686949371977">posted on Discord</a> by Allumeria developer Unomelon on February 10th, the strike accused their work of using content from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> without Microsoft's permission.</p>

<p>The section of the email from Valve notifying Unomelon of the takedown which details the claim read as follows: "Judith Woodward, on behalf of Microsoft Corporation, alleges that Microsoft is the copyright owner of the content found at https://www.minecraft.net/en-us and that your use of Minecraft content, including but not limited to gameplay and assets, without their authorization infringes their rights." A comparison between a screenshot from Allumeria's Steam page and an official screenshot of Minecraft was cited as an example of the alleged infringement. As is the procedure, Valve automatically yanked the game's Steam page in response to the takedown notice being filed.</p>
<p>That brings up to today, February 11th. In <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1311156281658183760/1338095872679870485/1471010748942516447">another post</a> to Allumeria's Discord server, Unomelon shared another email from Valve's DMCA team which notes that Microsoft have "withdrawn the copyright claim". Naturally, the developer's happy with that outcome. "This is the best case scenario," they wrote. "I just woke up from a nap so I am still not sure about the details, but whatever happened, it worked. The steam page and game has been fully restored, and I did not need to file a counter claim, meaning there will be no chance of a lawsuit!"</p><p>I've reached out to Microsoft for comment. Currently, it looks like the issuing of the takedown might have been an instance of automated flagging prompted by Allumeria's visual resemblance to Minecraft. The game certainly does look a fair bit like Minecraft, but so does every other voxel sandbox which has riffed on the premise of a blocky world players can survive or build in at will. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is a recent example. That resemblance, of course, doesn't prove actual bits of Minecraft have been used to create such games.</p>
<p>So, Allumeria's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3516590/Allumeria/">Steam page</a> is back up, with the game set for release at some point this year. Currently, it has a demo released in January you can give a go, or at least should be able to once Unomelon has managed to sort out some "license errors" which have reportedly begun popping up for some folks who've tried to grab it following Steam page's return.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill Transmission Announced for This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-transmission-announced-for-this-week/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Silent Hill Transmission is arriving later this week, focusing on Silent Hill: Townfall.</p>



<p>Silent Hill fans have been hoping for a new announcement for a very long time, especially after the movie adaptation, Return to Silent Hill, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-bombs-hard-in-early-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t score so well with reviewers</a> or the audience. Now, the developers have planned a full showcase that will provide all the latest details on their upcoming title. </p>







<h2 id="h-silent-hill-transmission-to-focus-on-townfall">Silent Hill Transmission to Focus on Townfall</h2>



<p>A new post by the official Silent Hill account on <a href="https://x.com/SilentHill/status/2021388925982416947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) confirms the upcoming Transmission event for this week. The upcoming showcase is scheduled for February 12 at 4:00 PM PT. The event will feature the developers sharing “the latest news on SILENT HILL: Townfall”. The streaming links for the event haven’t been posted at the time of writing. </p>



<p>Silent Hill Townfall is a title we have heard very little about, aside from the title. We know that it will be a horror title and a spin-off of the Silent Hill series. The game will be developed by No Code and published by Konami and Annapurna. What’s more, the Silent Hill showcase comes right after PlayStation’s State of Play event. </p>



<p>The developers had released a very cryptic trailer back in 2022, with a confusing voiceover and shots of a tape recorder and waves. Since then, this is the first time the developers will reveal more details about the game. </p>







<p>In other news, Silent Hill 2 Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrived for Xbox Series X/S consoles</a> late last year. Additionally, the release date for Townfall was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-townfall-release-date-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked last year</a>. Will you be tuning in for Silent Hill Transmission this week?

            <p>Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Ellie in Naughty Dog's The Last of Us and its sequel The Last of Us Part 2, has shared her thoughts on the divisive second season of HBO's TV adaptation.</p>
<p>While the first season of The Last of Us was met with praise, the show seemed to falter a bit with season two. There were a few quibbles, with many debating whether or not the TV team was right to reveal Abby's motivations so early in the season, among other issues with pacing, character development and so on. </p>
<p>But, season two was always going to be a tricky board to tread. Even the award-winning The Last of Us Part 2 received some very vocal pushback on its release in 2020. So, what does Johnson make of the renewed discussions around The Last of Us following season two's release last year?</p>
<p>"I feel like with The Last of Us, people really love that story, including me, and it's very, very passionate fans. And sometimes that passion feels really great, and sometimes it feels not great," Johnson told <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-ashley-johnson-backlash">The Direct</a>. "But you know, I understand it. I understand loving something so much, and wanting it to be what you want it to be."</p><p>Johnson added it "can be hard sometimes", because "when you are making these things, and on your side of things, you're passionate about it, and excited about it, and hopefully those two things can meet". However, the actor noted that sometimes "they do not", and this can be difficult.</p>
<p>"I mean, anytime you're working on anything, you want people to like it, and you want people to love it as much as you," Johnson explained. "But I love The Last of Us in every form, and I am so happy that I get to be a part of [telling] that story."</p>
<p>As well as her part in bringing the games to life, Johnson also had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-the-last-of-us-episode-nine">cameo in the first season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation</a>, as Ellie's mother.</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping back from the series after The Last of Us season two</a>, in order to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s gaming output, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">includes Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Druckmann had previously worked on The Last of Us' adaptation as a co-showrunner, director, writer and producer. While he's returned to full-time video game development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">Druckmann has since said he will remain somewhat involved in The Last of Us' adaptation at a "very high level"</a> to make sure it's "as deeply faithful" as the show's first season was.</p><p>As for the future of the series, it is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-previously-insisting-there-was-no-way-hbos-the-last-of-us-show-could-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons-it-looks-like-itll-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons">suspected the upcoming third season will be its last</a>. Since then, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-third-and-perhaps-final-season-adds-two-new-cast-members">Clea DuVall and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. will both join The Last of Us for the show's upcoming season</a>.</p>

<p>Squanch Games do be squanching around with High On Life 2, the new 2026 sequel. Another round of Gatlians and gross jokes is guaranteed in High on Life 2, and it’s time to check if there’s early access to get the laughs in now. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> looks to be more of the same outrageous content as the original, and if you do love the original, that’s hardly a bad thing. You’ll be skateboarding and doing <em>even more</em> talking, and it’s looking to capitalize on the large following amassed with the first game’s release.</p>



<p>If you’re keen on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/squanch-games/" id="2701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squanch Games</a>‘ High on Life 2, let’s check if it has early access or a demo.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-high-on-life-2-through-early-access">Can You Play High On Life 2 Through Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Booooo. Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no early access option for High on Life 2, which means you need to wait until launch to play it.</strong></p>



<p>You can only buy the standard edition of High on Life. There is no Deluxe Edition or Mega-Ludicrious Cromulon Edition designed to throw in a few digital or physical trinkets in exchange for mass sums of Schleem (one for the less-casual Rick and Morty fan there), although there is a now sold-out Collector’s Edition.</p>



<p>It’s quite a nice change of pace, and something more developers and publishers could do with.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/high-on-life-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2 Release Date Countdown, Exact Start Times &amp; All Platforms</a></li>
</ul>



<p>There’s now one universal High on Life 2 version to buy. Unfortunately, it doesn’t provide early access.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-high-on-life-2-have-a-demo">Does High On Life 2 Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>You can’t even play High on Life 2 early via a free-to-play demo from any applicable storefront.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/high-on-life-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is High on Life 2 on Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re asking Squanch Games to ‘show me what you got,’ the developer has a solid and firm answer: No.</p>

            <p>One of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">Fallout Season 2's biggest shockers</a> was having Wasteland veteran <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-veteran-ron-perlman-says-he-was-paid-40-dollars-and-a-sandwich-for-his-voiceover-work-in-the-original-game">Ron Perlman</a> (who's done voice acting for the entire game series) show up in a quick cameo role as a mysterious CGI'd super mutant.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers for Fallout's Season 2 finale ahead.</strong></p>
<p>After the last episode, which dropped last week, we didn't get any answers regarding this new player or where the teased "war" might be going. We know the Fallout universe has a lot going on beyond the current scope of the show, and while it seems we'll eventually get to see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-ending-explained-your-biggest-burning-questions-answered">even the giant mech Liberty Prime</a> one way or another, we'd be surprised if the creatives manage to cram every iconic bit of the games into the live-action adaptation.</p>
<p>That said, co-showrunner and writer Geneva Robertson-Dworet revealed during <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/fallout-season-3-ron-perlman-super-mutant-wars">an interview for The Direct</a> the plan is to have more of Ron Perlman's super mutant helper in the show: "I hope people know that he is a larger character in this world, in our minds." She also went on to underline she's always seen him "as a big role" that's part of their tendency to hint at wars happening elsewhere in the Wasteland.</p><p>It might be a while before he shows up again though, as those conflicts "maybe aren't in the region of the Wasteland where our characters currently are." Perlman's green-skinned guy has been seen helping The Ghoul near New Vegas, however, so we'd be shocked if he is nowhere to be seen in Season 3 even if the larger war the showrunners are hinting at isn't on the immediate horizon.</p>
<p>First up, Lucy and Maximus will have to deal with the Legion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-funko-pop-might-have-just-spoiled-a-fallout-season-2-plot-point">after its change in leadership</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://collider.com/fallout-season-2-finale-explained-colorado-location-geneva-robertson-dworet-frances-turner/">The Ghoul is heading to Colorado</a>... but that may also take a while to pan out.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/fallout-season-3-ron-perlman-super-mutant-wars">full chat with The Direct</a> is an interesting read that goes into more of the world-building ambitions of the team behind the show. For example, the powers that be aren't shying away from stating the Brotherhood of Steel might have a larger role moving forward and as we get to see other chapters.</p>
<p>It's a world of possibility out there, and as long as the show's ratings <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">remain healthy</a>, I'm sure both Bethesda and Amazon MGM Studios are happy to keep it going.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" id="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Contexto</a> a go if you haven’t already! </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s guessing time. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Thing</li>



<li>Person</li>



<li>Place</li>



<li>Animal</li>



<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept </li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-11-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 11, 2026</h2>

<h2 id="h-today-s-contexto-answer-for-game-1242-on-february-11-2026">Today’s Contexto Answer For Game #1242 On February 11, 2026</h2>



<p>If you’ve tried everything, and still can’t figure out today’s Contexto answer, then you can find it down below:</p>



<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Fern</p>



<p>A fern is a non-flowering, vascular plant that reproduces via spores. They’re known for their feathery leaves called fronds, which unfurl from coiled fiddleheads.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-contexto-game-after-1242">When Is The Next Contexto Game After #1242?</h2>



<p><strong>Contexto is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone, meaning the next game will start on February 12.</strong></p>



<p>The Contexto schedule is very consistent, with a new game releasing at the same time every day.</p>

            <p>Mewgenics, the latest release by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, launched yesterday. Within six hours the game sold over 150k copies, made back its development costs, and leaped to the top of Steam's Top Sellers list.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-sells-over-150k-copies-in-first-6-hours-this-is-beating-expectations-by-quite-a-lot">Speaking to IGN</a>, Glaiel revealed that the game has already a bigger release than any of the expansions for The Binding of Issac, the prior game released by the duo and itself an indie darling.</p>
<p>Mcmillen revealed that prior to Mewgenics, The Binding of Issac: Rebirth sold 40k copies on its release date, while Mewgenics sold 152k in its first five hours. He added: "Isn't that kind of insane?" The original Binding of Isaac <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-binding-of-isaac-sold-700-000-copies">managed to sell over 700k copies in less than a year</a> after launch, an impressive figure that's on track to be beaten in short order.</p>

<p>Since its release yesterday, the game<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/686060/charts/"> leaped to a peak concurrent player count of 65,962 on Steam</a>. In addition, it has beaten out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>'s big relaunch on Steam's Top Selling page. That game is no slouch by the way, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-expansion-brings-players-surging-back">itself seeing new peaks not seen in years</a>.</p><p>Mewgenics, for those unaware, is a cat-focused tactical Rogue-like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-an-infernal-machine-that-runs-on-cats">which Eurogamer previewed recently</a> with much acclaim and praise. In it, Christian Donland wrote: "If I have one point to leave you with - other than the fact that the soundtrack is rich with brilliant original songs - it's this: the core of Mewgenics may be simple and familiar, but the game that unfolds across all these runs is huge, and obviously so, even from my position about nine or ten hours in."</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch, both Mcmillen and Glaiel celebrated with a custom Mewgenics cake, which you can see below. Eurogamer has enquired what sort of cake this was, and will update this article when we receive a response.</p> <div>

            <p>The poorly-received Dino Crisis-like Code Violet has a sequel in the pipeline.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Code Violet, it's a third-person action horror game from TeamKill Media, which places you in the shoes of Violet Sinclair as she faces down "ferocious prehistoric dinosaurs and hostile forces". And, well, it hardly set the world alight on its debut earlier this year.</p>
<p>But, despite this less than enthusiastic response, TeamKill Media has revealed it's already started work on "the next chapter of Violet's story", citing the, erm, "overwhelming success" of Code Violet.</p>
<p>"We're actively progressing on several exciting projects, with more announcements and reveals coming your way very soon," the Code Violet team wrote, before stating it was now developing a sequel known as Code UltraViolet.</p>
<p>"We're incredibly excited about what's ahead and can't wait to bring you along for the journey," <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/2021293486377431222">the studio closed</a>. "Stay tuned!"</p>
<p>This is somewhat surprising to hear, given that Code Violet hardly won scores of praise from critics and players on its debut earlier this year. As noted by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/awful-ps5-dino-shooter-code-violet-will-get-a-sequel-for-some-reason">PushSquare</a>, TeamKill's latest release has an overall critic score of 29 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/code-violet/">Metacritic</a>, and a 2.6 user score. Meanwhile, over on the PS Store, it's got <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP5503-PPSA26528_00-0656994000407395">a 2.88 player rating</a> from confirmed buyers. Of those reviews, 36 percent only gave Code Violet one star (though, 31 percent awarded it the full five stars).</p><p>"Game is utter garbage. Needs to be removed from this planet, so no one else falls for this scam in purchasing it. PlayStation store should definitely refund everyone that has purchased it," reads a one star Code Violet user review on the PS Store.</p>
<p>Have you played Code Violet? And, if you have, are you keen to see a sequel?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Citadelum – Nintendo Switch 2 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/11/citadelum-nintendo-switch-2-review/</link>
            <guid>1432048</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> has a bunch of party tricks, but its mouse controls are all-too-easily overlooked. They really shouldn’t be, when it opens the console up to all sorts of new experiences, or to genres that are just fundamentally better with a mouse in your hand. Enter Citadelum, a Roman city-builder that lets you create your own corner of the Empire and fully embraces Nintendo’s latest console and its pointing-and-clicking skills.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citadelum - Official Nintendo Switch 2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvY5gE5LM7w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Citadelum offers both an open-ended Sandbox mode and an expansive single-player campaign that takes you on a historical journey beginning in 40BCE – that’s Before Common Era, not Before Consoles Existed – through the rise of the Roman Empire, the Third Punic War, and the Gallic Wars. Each period is broken down into a series of different missions and levels, giving you a steady stream of targets to judge your burgeoning society by before you can advance.</p>


<p>Whatever time period you’re focusing on, infrastructure is key. From the moment you place your Forum at the centre of your city, it becomes a race to house the plebeians, keep them gainfully employed, dig, find or grow material resources, and curry favour with the people. Leave too many unemployed or disgruntled citizens, and you’ll soon find your city beset by thieves, murderers and criminality. So… don’t let that happen?</p>


<p>Once you have the basics prepared, your city’s Prestige Level will increase, opening up new buildings and options for further expansion. This is also a good time to hop into the wider regional map and have your explorers take a gander at the nearest settlements, opening up the possibility of trade and collaboration with them. If you become a reliable trading partner, your relationship with that town will improve, and they may be able to provide you with soldiers and military support in return.</p>
<p>I was immediately impressed by how in-depth and fully featured Citadelum feels. It’s not a cut-back console port or a simplified genre entry, it’s a true city builder, with the gauges, percentages and macro-economics to prove it. It’s an interesting experience playing a game of this type on the TV and in handheld, but it’s been well optimised, with larger text, readable icons, and a tutorial that takes you through all of the most important aspects of the game before it turns you loose.</p>
<p>The Campaign steadily gives you a full understanding of all of the different multi-level resource and building trees, factoring in housing, agriculture, entertainment, combat and religion. For all that Citadelum is a fairly calm, relaxed experience, battles, and the appearance of the occasional unhappy god to smite you, bring a surprising level of chaos that’ll keep you tinkering away for hours on end.</p>

<p>There are six gods to woo with your religious fervour, and you can curry their favour to speed your technological growth or feed your nation, though equally, you can make them upset. Get it wrong, and they’ll appear to smash up your buildings or ruin your crops, setting your city back, and forcing you to rethink how you worship them. It brings a touch of Age of Mythology to Citadelum, and at first, it felt like an odd fit. After you spend more time here, though, it feels utterly authentic to the era, and whatever you might think, it’s certainly a fun addition.</p>
<p>In terms of controls, Citadelum is well optimised for controller, with the shoulder buttons cycling through your different categories, and different buttons opening up sub-categories from there. You build to a grid, and while the controller input is occasionally a little finicky, such as when you’re trying to build a road that does anything other than be straight, everything locks into position, and it’s pretty easy to parse whether playing docked or handheld. It’s just so straightforward to create a huge, but functional, city, and it’s mostly a relaxing, thoughtful experience.</p>

<p>Switching to mouse is a revelation, though. City builders and strategy games just work better with a mouse, and there’s something truly amazing about unclipping the Joy-Con 2 and using them on the sofa next to you. Citadelum feels like a perfect city-building experience in this mode, and I massively enjoyed the mostly laid-back vibes of laying my city out from the comfort of my sofa.</p>
<p>The only annoyance is that you have to manually move between mouse and controller in the options instead of having the switch auto-detected as in Metroid Prime 4, for example. That’s fine when switching to the mouse, but coming back to controller means hopping back into mouse mode. This needs to become an automatic change, and it definitely resulted in some huffing, and indeed, puffing, when I discovered I had to get back up again.</p>

<p>The ver. 1.4.0 patch is now live on Switch and Switch 2, introducing two new cherry blossom-themed gliders (the 'Ceremonial Glider' and 'Leaf Glider') alongside new deluxe bingo cards, bonus hair and eye colour options, and a couple of other tweaks and bug fixes.</p>

<p>While not a particularly long read, the ver. 1.4.0 patch notes were shared on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508780/STORY_OF_SEASONS_Grand_Bazaar/">Steam</a> page, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>

<p>We had a great time with Grand Bazaar when it launched on Switch and Switch 2 last year, calling it "a fantastic reinvention filled with smart choices and heartfelt polish" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Speculation <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already running rampant</a> on which games will be featured in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tomorrow's <strong>State of Play</strong></a>, and one of the most anticipated PlayStation games of the year is certainly <strong>Marvel's Wolverine</strong> from <strong>Insomniac Games</strong>. However, the studio has just dropped a tidbit hinting that <strong>it might not be featured at the event</strong>. <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2021332733998612529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Replying on X</a> to a user who asked when they'd release more information, <strong>the developers said it's happening at some point this Spring</strong>. Obviously, we are not in Spring yet.</p>



<p>It's possible they might still show off a brief new trailer without any further details about the game, but <strong>the more likely outcome is that they'll just save everything for a later showing</strong>. Perhaps they could even get their dedicated broadcast in April or May; after all, the <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong> franchise has done wonders for Sony, so Marvel's Wolverine could get a special spotlight.</p>



<p>It also makes sense from a schedule perspective. Marvel's Wolverine <strong>isn't due until sometime in the Fall</strong> season, whereas another game from a Sony-owned studio is coming out much sooner. I'm referring to <strong>Housemarque's Saros</strong>, which will launch on PlayStation 5 <strong>on April 30</strong>; it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally planned for March 20</a>, but the Finnish studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a <strong>slight delay</strong></a> a while ago.</p>



<p>Saros could get a deep dive at the State of Play, but it might not be the only PlayStation Studios update featured there. Insider Shinobi602 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot48-has-ot48-been-hijacked-by-ot47-ot46-and-ot45-to-the-detriment-of-48-ots-of-history.1329010/post-151107211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he wouldn't be surprised if Sony Santa Monica was ready to reveal the long-awaited game led by <strong>Cory Barlog</strong>. As a reminder, following the massively successful 2018 <strong>God of War reboot</strong>, Barlog transitioned into the role of Creative Director and Producer for <strong>God of War Ragnarök</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was directed by <strong>Eric Williams</strong></a>. We don't know a lot about this new project, except that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, <strong>it was going well as of July 2025</strong>, and it's not technically a new IP but might feel like one.</p>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. The February 11, 2026, Quordle has four new words for you to find, and this guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>

<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone and region, meaning the next game will start on February 12.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/relooted-launches-double-digits-steam-reviews/</link>
            <guid>1432030</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On social media, discussions have surfaced surrounding the recent launch of Relooted, an Africanfuturist heist game that sees players assume control of characters stealing African artifacts from Western museums. Those discussions aren’t entirely positive, as Relooted has managed to secure a peak player count of just 57 users on Steam on launch day.</p>



<p>While the bulk of users will be playing Relooted via Xbox Game Pass, on which the game dropped on day one, it’s not a strong look for just the second game from Nyamakop. It is worth stressing that the game has a review rating of ‘Mostly Positive’ on Steam, so perhaps it’s much better than the player count suggests and is just struggling with adoption.</p>







<h2 id="h-relooted-regarded-as-genuinely-bad-by-some">Relooted Regarded as ‘Genuinely Bad’ by Some</h2>



<p>If you hold any stock in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">user reviews on Steam</a>, you might baulk at the most recent recollections. One gamer wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game sucks. I’m not saying that because it’s “woke”; the game is genuinely bad. The art style is ugly, the mechanics are terrible, and it has a multitude of other issues. Avoid this game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course, the almost immediate mention of ‘woke’ does something to invalidate their opinion a little, as it’s a phrase too easily lobbied around these days by those not happy with their evaluation of a game.</p>



<p>By comparison, another user explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a fun and vibrant little platformer with a lot of interesting history driving it. Sadly, Americans struggle to think anything can be made without centering around their politics.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s <strong>extremely tough </strong>not to take a political approach to judging Relooted, and that might be what’s slowing adoption. It’s not possible to see how many people are playing the game on PC or Xbox via the Game Pass subscription service, but at the time of writing, just 15 people were playing it on Steam.</p>



<p>In June 2025, our Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-nyamakop-ceo-ben-myers-relooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sat down with Ben Myres</a>, CEO at Nyamakop, who said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We struggled with the design for quite a while – how to make an interesting mechanical adaption of heist movies was tricky (most heist games are shooters, and don’t always feel accurate to the vibe and sensibilities of say an Ocean’s 11). It was only when Teardown came out that something clicked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team also stressed that the Metroidvania-style game wasn’t influenced by games like Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown or Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, despite bearing similarities to both.</p>



<p>Time will tell how Relooted pans out, but the critics’ impressions <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/02/relooted-is-available-today-with-xbox-game-pass-and-some-early-reviews-are-now-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are mostly positive</a>. One outlet described the game as ‘unique and rewarding’, while another dubbed it ‘a fantastic premise’.</p>

            <p>A revitalised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>) is bringing players back, propelling the game to most-watched status on streaming service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and to being one of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">most played games on Steam</a> - comfortably above copycat hero-shooter Marvel Rivals. There was even a queue to log in to Overwatch when I played yesterday evening, which is something I've never seen before.</p>
<p>Currently there are <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/overwatch-2">nearly 100,000 people watching Overwatch streams on Twitch</a>, making it the most viewed game by some way, with nearly 30,000 more viewers than second-place game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>. Meanwhile on Steam, Overwatch peaked at 165,000 players, putting it briefly in the top 10. It's currently 13th, nearly 10 places ahead of genre rival Marvel Rivals, which has trumped Overwatch on Steam for a long time.</p>
<p>Note, however, that Overwatch is not only available on Steam. The predominant platform for play is Battle.net, which is presumably where the bulk of the audience lies. Should the jump in activity on Steam reflect the jump in activity on Battle.net, then, the actual number of Overwatch players is presumably much higher.</p>
<p>The renewed Overwatch activity is due to an expansion-like release, The Reign of Talon, which arrived yesterday. It's the game's first expansion and heralds <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">the beginning of a new yearly expansion-era for Overwatch</a>, which Blizzard will release in addition to more regular Season updates.</p><p>Season 1 - the kick-off season for Reign of Talon - brings five new heroes to the game at once, which is an unprecedented amount for Overwatch, and Blizzard plans to add five more new heroes over the course of the year. These aren't the only changes to the game, though, with major user interface reworks and story-related changes present as well.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1segu/so_death_chandelier/">So… Death Chandelier???</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Synodii/">u/Synodii</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/">Overwatch</a> </blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>But it's the new heroes that everyone is talking about - notably the new flying hero Jetpack Cat, who has the meta-shaking new ability to tow other characters through the air. All of the combo possibilities of this are currently being felt out. Among them, lifting a spinning, Ultimate-ing Reaper above a team to prevent them hiding behind cover; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1omoi/behold_the_jetpack_cat_reinhardt_duel/">airlifting the hammer-swinging Reinhardt through the air to duel other airlifted Reinhardts</a>; and discovering bizarre quirks such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1rsht/eliminated_someone_before_the_match_even_started/">being able to kill people before a match has officially begun</a>. People are also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1rog9/first_game_with_emre_first_potg/">getting to grips with the other new heroes, such as Emre</a>, and discovering how potent they can be. The question is how long Overwatch can keep this renewed momentum up for.</p>
<p>Not all of the new heroes have gone down well, though. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-responds-to-overwatch-anran-design-controversy">Controversy arose over the weekend around the visual appearance of new fire-wielding hero Anran</a>, whose final, cute in-game look seemed to contradict a more ferocious design used in previously-released animated shorts and comics for the game. Anran's face also appears very similar to a lot of other female characters in the game - an issue the community refers to as "same-face syndrome". Blizzard has said it's discussing her design with the intention of making changes to it.</p>

<p>Silent Hill: Townfall (my computer keeps trying to autocorrect that to Downfall, which is very annoying) is coming from Screen Burn (née No Code), the Glasgow-based developer of Stories Untold and Observation. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">first announced back in 2022</a>, though at this time not too much was revealed about the game, other than a mysterious trailer featuring a man talking over a walkie-talkie.</p><p>Soon after this reveal, some started to decode the trailer, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfalls-announcement-trailer-has-a-secret-message-hidden-inside-it">discovered an SOS signal was tucked between the 'THY FLESH IS WEAK' images</a>. There was also mention of Alessa, who is the little girl seen throughout Silent Hill during the first game and the name should be pretty familiar to anyone who's played the first or third installments, or watched the original Silent Hill movie.</p>

<p>"I'd like to keep expanding it"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a> creator Kazutaka Kodaka has been pretty open about his aspirations to expand upon the game with DLC, but thanks to a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WeebyNewz">Weeby Newz</a> on YouTube, we now have a better idea of just how far he's willing to go.</p>
<p>When asked about what he might be interested in exploring with additional DLC regarding new routes and endings, Kodaka states that he wants to keep growing The Hundred Line for "around ten years", citing the seemingly unlimited potential to tell new stories.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since the game already includes so many genres such as the Romance Route and the S.F. Route, it means we can add almost any kind of story. I'd like to keep expanding it into like 200 lines, 300 lines, or even 400 lines – as many routes as we can imagine, a game people have never seen before.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, I'd love for it to grow into something that can keep going for around ten years."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also goes on to tease the possibility of new characters, stating that "depending on the route, I think we can introduce new transfer students".</p>
<p>It does, however, sound like we'll be waiting a little while before we see any DLC expansions. Although Kodaka states that the team is working through ideas daily, he stresses that it's "not something that's fully in motion yet".</p>
<p>Still, this is all very exciting, indeed. We gave The Hundred Line a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">our review</a> last year, calling it "an excellent tactical RPG that fully showcases the strengths of the creatives behind it". If you've yet to play it, we'd urge you to give it a shot.</p>

            <p>Social media company Discord are trying their best to reassure people irked by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">recently announced global rollout of some new age verification measures</a>, which include face scans and a background “age inference” system for determining whether the user is an adult. </p>
<p>Amid predictable backlash against potential privacy violations – see, for context, last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/07/discord-data-breach-proof-of-age-id-leaked">cybersecurity breach</a> that saw a hacker get hold of personal information used for age verification via one of Discord’s customer service partners – Discord are promising that they won’t require every user to complete a face scan or upload some ID, and that the “vast majority of people can continue using Discord exactly as they do today”. Albeit, mostly because “the majority of Discord users don’t access age restricted content”.</p>
<p>“For the majority of adult users, we will be able to confirm your age group using information we already have,” the platform holders <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally#age-assurance-clarification">write in a clarification on their official blog</a>. “We use age prediction to determine, with high confidence, when a user is an adult. This allows many adults to access age-appropriate features without completing an explicit age check.”</p>
<p>If Discord feels the need to verify your age, they’re offering additional privacy protections. Firstly, any face scans you take won’t leave your device. “If you choose Facial Age Estimation, you’ll be prompted to record a short video selfie of your face,” the post notes. “The Facial Age Estimation technology runs entirely on your device in real time when you are performing the verification. That means that facial scans never leave your device, and Discord and vendors never receive it. We only get your age group.” </p><p>Discord say they will only use info from this and other ID verification processes “for safety purposes and to help us deliver age appropriate experiences”. They assure that they won’t use it to help target adverts, or sell your data to third parties. Speaking of third parties, they also promise they aren’t working with the same partners responsible for last autumn’s cybersecurity incident. “We are partnering with dedicated age assurance vendors who specialize in performing these verifications in a privacy-forward way,” the post goes on. “These vendors were not involved in the September 2025 data breach of our customer service agent.</p>
<p>“Our vendors perform these verifications in a way to minimize the data collected and stored,” it continues. “For FAE, the video selfie is processed on device and never stored. IDs are processed to get your age only and then deleted. Your identity is never associated with your Discord account.”</p>
<p>Discord have also shared a little about how their “age inference” model works. It’s a machine learning tool, as you may guess, which predicts “whether a user falls into a particular age group based on patterns of user behavior and several other signals associated with their account on Discord”. </p>
<p>The company will only use these hints to assign you to an age group “when our confidence level is high”; otherwise, they’ll ask you to confirm your age. They also say the model doesn’t base its predictions on the content of your messages, which I guess is some reassurance that “age inference” isn’t some kind of LLM chatbot ‘training’ process in disguise.</p>
<p>Discord’s new age verification model is already live in the UK and Australia, and will kick in worldwide over March. If you’re not persuaded by the above, there’s always <a href="https://www.mirc.co.uk/">internet relay chat</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Overwatch is Back’: Claims Surface Online as Game Hits New All-Time High Player Count]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-is-back-claims-game-new-peak-player-count/</link>
            <guid>1432015</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Overwatch has been ‘relaunched’, the game’s previous ‘2’ has been removed from the title, and a new season of content has brought players flooding back to the hero shooter in droves. In recent hours, Overwatch managed to hit a new all-time high peak player count on Steam, soaring and prompting many to declare that <strong>Overwatch is back!</strong></p>



<p>Of course, it’s not all good news. In the last couple of days, the community was wrestling with the voice actor for one of the newest characters, Anran, who used her position to ‘push an agenda’ regarding unrealistic beauty standards in games. She <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-anran-actor-bags-on-ozempic-chic-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dubbed them ‘Ozempic chic’</a> and drew immense flak from one half of the community.</p>



<p>So, is Overwatch back?</p>







<h2 id="h-overwatch-skyrockets-on-steam">Overwatch Skyrockets on Steam</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch</a> has hit a new all-time peak player count of 165,651 users <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/#max" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> in the hours before writing this article. That’s not just a slight climb over the previous high; it’s a <strong>120% </strong>boost. Previously, Overwatch had secured a high of around 75,000, back in 2023. Since then, it had slowly been working its way down the leaderboard.</p>



<p>Despite the arrival of a rebrand and a fresh season of content, plus the huge leap in players, Overwatch has managed to drop in review standings. It has a rating of ‘Mixed’ in recent reviews and ‘Mostly Negative’ overall, so it might be a case of users dipping back in, seeing what’s what, not being impressed, and leaving again.</p>



<p>Regardless, fans of the franchise have taken to social media platforms worldwide to declare the almighty and unstoppable return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blizzard/" id="1092">Blizzard’s</a> hero shooter, which has fallen in and out of good graces over the last few years.</p>



<p>Even Zedd, a popular music producer and DJ with millions of followers, declared Overwatch <strong>back </strong>on socials:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Whether this resurgence is a flash in the pan remains to be seen. The five new characters (which include a cat with a jetpack), the new meta event, and the countless tweaks might not pay off for long enough for Overwatch to be considered entirely renewed.</p>







<p>What do you think? Have you gone back to Overwatch following the relaunch? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CDL Teams Opt to GA Snipers Going Into Major II Qualifiers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-teams-ga-snipers-major-ii-qualifiers/</link>
            <guid>1432009</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest sweeping change to hit the Call of Duty League, the scene’s pro teams have decided to eradicate snipers from the competitive circuit, pushing for a GA that moves them firmly out of the meta pool.</p>



<p>As we go into the Major II qualifying stage, which leads up to the first CDL Major to land in the United Kingdom in <strong>many years</strong>, very few changes are being made. The map pool is expected to remain the same, rosters haven’t shifted too much (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud9-new-york-failing-to-build-new-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aside from Cloud9</a>…), but yes, snipers are now out of the picture.</p>







<h2 id="h-too-many-changes-could-harm-the-cdl-s-image">Too Many Changes Could Harm the CDL’s Image</h2>



<p>Snipers have been pulled in and out of the meta for the longest time. It seems that they’re a point of contention every single season, and we rarely go an entire year without them being kicked out of the pool. All it takes is for them to dominate for a few games and for some players to get sharper with them, and the consensus boots them from the meta.</p>



<p>That’s what’s happened this time around, with a reported <strong>nine teams </strong>agreeing to GA (Gentlemen’s Agreement) snipers and eviscerate them from the weapon pool.</p>



<p>The ever-shrinking weapon pool, we might add.</p>



<p>Many have their concerns about Call of Duty’s approach to the competitive meta, and it almost always results in the game becoming a two-gun esports title. It’s a theme not replicated in any other game, including the likes of Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six, Apex Legends, and VALORANT, all of which are much more diverse.</p>



<p>It’s now almost exclusively down to the Dravec and the M15 to determine the outcome of each match, with a few Jäger 45 clips thrown in for good measure. It’s already tough for Call of Duty to be seen as a ‘serious esport’ without this issue surfacing every season.</p>



<p>Major II welcomes the first UK-based Call of Duty esports major in more than six years, with the NEC at Birmingham welcoming both CDL Major II <strong>and </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhack-coming-to-the-uk-in-2025-call-of-duty-dota/">a wider DreamHack event</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com/">Eidos-Montréal</a> is one of those veteran game studios that constantly appear in the news cycle, but always seem to be tied to some form of drama despite their pedigree. Luckily, Embracer Group has kept it running and working away on a handful of mystery projects, most of which have been scrapped.</p>
<p>Though the current buzz points to the developer now working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rumour-has-it-a-new-alien-game-is-on-the-way-and-its-being-described-as-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-with-xenomorphs">an ambitious Alien video game</a> with heavy action-adventure elements, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-cancelled-lotr-game-by-eidos-montreal-with-a-telltale-like-story-first-look">this report from MP1st</a> deals with a cancelled Lord of the Rings project which never got too far. Late last year, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tM8RcRXnHX8?t=2132s">Insider Gaming talked about this</a> already, so it's not the first time we'd heard about it, but that noise didn't take off.</p>
<p>MP1st now claims to have gotten their hands on concept art and early tests done for the game, which apparently didn't advance much before being binned. The project joins <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/">the reported Legacy of Kain reboot</a> as games that haven't moved forward at Eidos-Montréal recently.</p>
<p>The images show painterly and colourful art depicting what's believed to be the Umbar region of Middle-earth, as pointed by recurring file names and some of the 3D screens introducing a better sense of how the game would've been structured, at least in that region. Apparently, the iconic Prancing Pony inn from the books and movies was part of the game as well, as it wouldn't have been restricted to the area south of Gondor and known for its pirates.</p><p>But perhaps the most interesting part of the report is the game would've featured card-based mechanics on top of an isometric view similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked-2024">No Rest for the Wicked</a>'s and a Telltale-like narrative approach. We lack more details, but I think it's safe to say Eidos-Montréal aimed to make a LOTR game that would've felt quite different from what we've gotten before.</p>
<p>The end of the report underlines the studio is now "deep in development" of a major project nicknamed "P11" that's third-person and open-world. Could that be the rumoured Alien title? Place your bets now.</p>

			<p>Following a recent <strong>Marathon</strong> hands-on event organized by <strong>Bungie</strong> for Chinese media, new gameplay footage and impressions are now available online. The event reportedly <strong>took place in Shanghai earlier this month</strong> and was the first held outside North America.</p>



<p>The most impressive aspect reported by attendees was the <strong>significant expansion of worldbuilding and narrative depth</strong>. The tutorial and faction introductions now provide clear origins and motivations for the playable characters, creating a more coherent story framework for the extraction shooter game. Players can discover Dr. Strauss's will; he's a pivotal figure who connects multiple narrative threads from the original Marathon trilogy.</p>



<p>The PvE experience of this Marathon build <strong>proved quite challenging</strong>, according to multiple impressions. AI enemies continuously call in reinforcements over time, and environmental hazards are aplenty, including poison gas vents, perimeter turrets, and landmines scattered throughout the maps.</p>



<p>Resource management adds an extra layer of difficulty, as <strong>medical supplies and shields are fairly expensive at vendors</strong>. By the end of the play sessions, some testers couldn't afford these items without selling all their buffs. <strong>The high-risk environment apparently discourages early combat or PvP engagements</strong>, which typically result in net losses, pushing players to focus on missions to upgrade base stats instead. At least one map confirmed support for 18 players (6 teams of 3), though there are also smaller maps that support 12 players (4 teams of 3). </p>



<p>Since the Alpha version, <strong>Marathon has received a significant visual upgrade</strong>. Environments now convey a darker, more mysterious atmosphere reminiscent of Bungie's <strong>Pathways into Darkness</strong> (1993) and the original Marathon trilogy. <strong>The UI has also undergone a major overhaul</strong>, though some aspects still feel somewhat awkward according to the event's attendees. Perhaps that's just a matter of getting used to them. </p>



<p><strong>Skill distribution across all classes appears to be well-balanced</strong>, allowing flexible team compositions. Several Shells feature movement abilities, enhancing mobility options. Each runner has six base appearances tied to their respective faction.</p>



<p><strong>The weapon arsenal includes 28 guns, each with two or more skins</strong>. Some even change the entire weapon model. Every weapon features one charm slot and three sticker slots that unlock through challenge completion. Overall, <strong>impressions of the gunplay are very good</strong>, but then again, that's an area where Bungie always excelled. The cosmetic shop and battle pass were, unfortunately, unavailable during the event.</p>



<p>The footage is <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LrFZz6EGC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 10-minute video</a> available on the Chinese video sharing website Bilibili featuring <strong>Lockdown</strong>, a large scale PvE event that can trigger on the <strong>Abyssal Swamp</strong> map. Around 15 minutes later, a Point of Interest (POI) may be locked down and surrounded by red bubbles. To trigger this event, players can use the 'HEC' consumable. This allows them to enter the red bubble without taking damage for 45 seconds, during which time they can press a switch to close it. </p>



<p>After activating the switch, <strong>three waves of enemies will appear, with the final one featuring a boss</strong>. Defeating the boss provides the first wave of loot and a keycard. The locked-down area will then move to another area (it could be 'Algae Pool', 'Isolation Zone', or 'Comprehensive Facility'), and this process will repeat up to 3 times. Each time, Marathon players will need to use a keycard from the previous level to increase the difficulty level.</p>



<p>Bungie Game Director Joe Ziegler was also <a href="https://www.ali213.net/news/html/2026-2/998177_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed by Ali123</a>. In the conversation, <strong>he shared the studio's vision for Marathon seasons</strong>: </p>



<p><em>Each season in Marathon will be a fresh start. We envision each season as a months-long "roguelike adventure ." Each season, players will start with limited resources and must gradually grow stronger through various means, forging their own unique path to growth. To implement this concept, each season will incorporate new content and systems, substantially reshaping the seasonal gameplay. That said, some content will be retained at the player account level. For example, cosmetic items acquired through unlocking or purchasing will continue to be retained across seasons.</em></p>



<p>After several delays, Marathon <strong>will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on March 5</a></strong>. In less than a month, we'll know if Bungie turned around the mild reception of the previous testing phases.</p>
