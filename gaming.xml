			<p>After several of the titles joining the <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong> and <strong>Premium</strong> game catalogues <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-premium-on-connait-les-titres-majeurs-de-janvier-2026-60850">leaked yesterday evening</a>, <strong>PlayStation</strong> has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/14/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-january-resident-evil-village-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-and-more/">officially confirmed</a> all of the games that PS Plus Extra and Premium tier subscribers will be getting access to for January 2026, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, </strong>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/darkest-dungeon-ii-full-release-owners-of-original-discount/"><strong>Darkest Dungeon</strong> <strong>II</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Once again, players paying top-dollar for the Premium subscription only get one game added to the Classics Catalog, which seems to continue a trend of Premium subscribers seemingly getting the short end of the stick. </p>



<p>That's not to say anything against Ridge Racer, more to say that while yes, Premium subscribers are also paying for the other games joining the Extra and Essential tiers each month, the Classics Catalog is one of the only key differences between Premium and the other tiers. Some months, no games enter the Classics Catalog. It simply has to leave those players wondering what they're paying for, if they can't expect the library of Classic games to actually grow at a reasonable rate.</p>



<p>Regardless, here is the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and Premium for January 2026, all of which will be available starting <strong>January 20, 2026</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Resident Evil Village (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5)</li>



<li>Darkest Dungeon II (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>The Exit 8 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Art of Rally (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>A Little to the Left (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Ridge Racer (PS5, PS4) - <strong>Premium-tier subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this month, PS Plus Essential subscribers (and every other tier of PS Plus subscribers) got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-january-2026-need-for-speed-unbound-epic-mickey-core-keeper/">add <strong>Need for Speed Unbound</strong>, <strong>Epic Mickey Rebrushed,</strong> and <strong>Core Keeper</strong> to their lineup</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/timeline-2025-refresh-and-expansion-review-timely-family-fun</link>
            <guid>1406056</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Which came first: the first cave painting or the first stone carved by humans? Did the start of the construction of the Great Wall of China happen before or after the invention of the crossbow? These are the questions you and your family will have to suss out over a game of <em>Timeline</em>, a brilliantly simple but wonderfully thought-provoking family game from <a href="https://www.dobblegame.com/en/games/#category-timeline" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Zygomatic</a>. Publisher Asmodee USA sent along a copy of the new 2025 refresh of the game, as well as the new expansion <em>Games &amp; Leisure</em>, to check out - so let's see if it's right for your family and friends.</p><h2>What Is <em>Timeline</em>?</h2><p><em>Timeline</em> is a simple family game for 2 - 6 players (though in all reality, and certainly with additional expansions to the game, you could play this with a much larger group of gamers) the is equal parts guessing game and history lesson! The core mechanic is incredibly simple: you create a growing timeline of events, and need to decide when cards in your hand happen on the timeline as it grows!</p><p>With evocative illustrations and mini-cards keeping this game portable and compact (and at a very reasonable $12.99 USD MSRP), I've found it to be one of the best "throw it in the bag" games to break out either before in between or after a more serious gaming session. It's also an absolute no-brainer for gaming with family and friends who aren't used to heavier games, along with younger kids in the fam!</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/timeline-core-box.jpeg?itok=4ANbafpz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="800">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/timeline-core-box.jpeg?itok=vqp57Rqk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="800">
                  

  </picture><h2>How Do You Play <em>Timeline</em>?</h2><p>As mentioned above, the gameplay loop of <em>Timeline </em>is wonderfully simple, but super-satisfying. The game consists of a deck of mini-cards. On one side is the name of an event, like "The Start of the Black Death" with an illustration depicting the event. On the back is the same name and illustration, but with the date that it occurred.</p><p>Players start the game with four cards in front of them, date-side down. You don't get to peek at when your events happened - that's the whole point of the game! One event from the deck is placed date-side up on the board, and that's the start of the timeline.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/timeline-cards.jpeg?itok=9eSVX1xH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="800">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/timeline-cards.jpeg?itok=8QQHeVFZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="800">
                  

  </picture><p>Now it's up to you to choose one of your cards, and decide where it landed on the timeline. This is easier in the beginning of the game, when the timeline isn't that crowded, but as the game progresses you'll find it trickier and trickier to find the right spot!</p><h2>What Does The <em>Timeline </em>2025 Refresh Bring To The Game?</h2><p>As far as I can tell, and it's a bit tricky to determine based on internet searching alone, this refresh of the game includes all-new, gorgeous illustrations for each of the cards, but updates the packaging to a small box (it originally came in a box, then a metal tin, and now it's back - thankfully - to its small-box format) and includes 96 cards.</p><p>I really like the simple, clean illustration-style on display with these new cards, and think the design feels very modern and simple without losing any personality.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/timeline-games-and-leisure.jpeg?itok=1p_zA5Wf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1500" height="1500">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/timeline-games-and-leisure.jpeg?itok=atQRzxtN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="1200">
                  

  </picture><h2>What Is <em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure</em>?</h2><p>Also included in this shipment for us to review is the all-new <em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure</em>, which serves as a standalone expansion to the game focusing on - as the title suggest - games and leisure activities. When was the serial production of the first mountain bike? When was the Kayak invented? What about six-sided dice?</p><p>It's a simple and fun spin on the classic game, but it truly is just more cards. There are no tweaks or adjustments to the rules, but why mess with a good thing? And while you don't need the original <em>Timeline</em> reviewed above to play, you <em>can</em> combine both into a more challenging experience.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/timeline-games-and-leisure-cards.jpeg?itok=jDxU_MjI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="800">

  </picture><h2><em>Timeline</em> Review - Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>Timeline </em>is, without a doubt, one of my favorite "grab-and-go" games. You can bring it just about anywhere, and get just about anyone into the action. You do <em>not</em> have to be a tabletop gamer to immediately understand how to play this game, making it perfect for Elementary School students and befuddled grandparents alike.</p><p>On the flip side, there's not a lot of tactics or strategy here (the only strategy I follow is: save your obvious ones (like the discovery of fire by man, for the end of the game when the timeline's more complicated).&nbsp;</p><p>So if you're looking for something a little meatier, look elsewhere. And player interaction is basically zero, unless you count clogging up the timeline and making it harder for your opponents to guess where their events happen as interaction. But all in all, I cannot recommend <em>Timeline</em> and <em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure</em> enough to anyone looking for some educational, family-friendly fun!</p><hr><p><em>The copies of </em>Timeline <em>and </em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure<em> used in the creation of this review were provided to us by Asmodee USA.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>I’m currently exploring, crafting and building my way through&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-like <em>Hytale</em> to find out what this long-delayed blocky survival sim does to differentiate itself from its obvious inspiration. But in the meantime, let’s take a look at what’s already happened in the game’s first 24 hours since releasing into early access.</p> <p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>very nearly didn’t happen. The cuboid sandbox game has been in production since 2015 from Hypixel Studios, with financial support from Riot Games for the first few years until the massive company bought Hypixel outright in 2020. However, big twist: in June 2025 Riot cancelled the whole project, leaving its future in serious doubt. But then another twist: in November of last year, the game’s original founder Simon Collins-Laflamme bought the entire IP back from Riot <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248">and revived development</a>. Just two months later the game is out in early access, making Riot’s decision all the more peculiar.</p>

 <p>It’s not nearly finished, it’s fair to say. If <a href="https://hytale.com/">you buy the game now</a> you’ll find its central hub area is mostly various buildings with “Under Construction” signs on them, and the game’s “Adventure” mode is yet to be added alongside Survival and Creative. However, you’ll also find a very familiar style of game if you’ve ever played <em>Minecraft</em>, but with much higher-fidelity graphics, a far more complex array of crafting tables, and the slightest touch of creature collecting. So how’s it going so far?</p>

 <p>Well, pretty well! In the first 24 hours&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> became <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/hytale-surges-to-the-most-watched-game-on-twitch-attracting-over-420-000-viewers-with-its-long-awaited-launch/">the most watched game on Twitch</a>, with 420,000 viewers across many, many streams. And perhaps more significantly, Collins-Laflamme took to X just before launch to say pre-orders have been so successful that the game has already secured a further two years of development costs.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases. Combined with my personal commitment of ten years, we are looking very strong for the future ❤️</p> <p>Thank you all for the support.</p> <p>Hytale is saved.<br>We are almost home.</p> <p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Yay Patch Notes!</h2> <p>The game <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hotfixes-13-january-2026">has already received its first hotfix</a>, aimed at fixing crashes caused by eyebrows, squelching a bug that stopped Norwegian people from launching it, and preventing buckets from breaking the game. Of course, this being early access, Hypixel are keen to communicate that the game is still going to be packed with issues and bugs. In <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here">a blog post celebrating the pre-release of the game</a>, the team asks people to keep in mind the following:</p>

 <ul> <li>Early Access – many features are still missing, and bugs are expected</li> <li>It’s only been two months since we reacquired <em>Hytale</em> – and that’s how long we’ve had to prepare the game and rebuild the team from the ground up</li> <li>Demand has exceeded our expectations, which means launch week will be bumpy, but we’ll get everyone in</li> </ul> <p>The game, which is currently only available for PC but plans to make its way to PS5 and Xbox, does already allow modding and as such, people are already getting creative. Perhaps the most stand-out example would be <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/one-modder-has-already-got-doom-running-inside-the-voxel-sandbox-hytale-and-its-not-even-out-yet-it-plays-a-bit-like-a-broken-keyboard/">someone getting&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> running in the game</a> before it even released. As <em>PC Gamer</em> spotted, it’s achieved by importing a Java version of id’s shooter, then having it rendered via color-changing blocks within <em>Hytale</em>. Or witchcraft.</p>

 <h2>Exploration Motivation</h2> <p>The Exploration mode is the “proper” way to play the game just now, where the procedurally generated collection of biomes contains really elaborate structures to discover, and also all the core ingredients for the <em>Minecraft</em> survivalist. So you can build homes (I’ve made a lovely log cabin!), grow crops, craft ever-more useful tools, and do all this solo or with chums. Digging down proves similarly elaborate, with big underground structures to explore, and of course mobs to battle. There are also the vestigial beginnings of the game’s story, with a hub area you can teleport to once you find the Forgotten Temple, speak to a couple of NPCs, and begin a task to identify as many species of creatures as you can in order to unlock new crafts.</p>

 <p>The forthcoming Adventure mode appears to promise a lot more RPG-like elements that will hopefully better distinguish the game from its inspirations, but in the meantime the focus is really on venturing far from where you spawn and discovering its much more detailed landscapes and the mobs within.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Asus TUF Gaming Desktop PC (Nvidia GPU, 512GB SSD) Is So Cheap You’ll Want to Buy It Instantly]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-asus-tuf-gaming-desktop-pc-nvidia-gpu-512gb-ssd-is-so-cheap-youll-want-to-buy-it-instantly-2000659757</link>
            <guid>1406041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Yes, you can game on most standard PCs out there, but these options aren’t designed to provide you with an immersive gaming experience that brings your favorite titles to life. If you’re looking to play better in 2026, a dedicated gaming PC is a must-have.</p>
<p>Like all nice things, the best gaming PCs on the market can cost a pretty penny, but that’s not the case today. Amazon just dropped the 2025 ASUS TUF T500 PC by 11% which <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6757/">brings its $900 price to $800 – an impressive $100 discount</a>. There are no complicated coupon codes to enter or long checkout steps to worry about, either. Just add the PC to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6757/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See offer</a></p>

<h2>Premium Look, Incredible Performance</h2>
<p>The PC flaunts a stunning, mecha-inspired design with bold lines, yellow accents, and a transparent side panel. It gives off a rugged, anime-inspired look that’s instantly going to catch the attention of anyone and is sure to turn heads. The clear side panel offers a stunning view of your rig with RGB lighting. The lights are customizable, so you can choose the color you want. Maybe go for yellow for a premium feel, or something a bit more vibrant if you want your PC to make a statement.</p>
<p>It runs on an Intel Core i5-13420H CPU that offers a great balance of performance and price. Paired with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, it can run most modern games smoothly, and even lets you work on resource-intensive creative projects with ease. There’s a modest 16GB RAM that keeps things snappy as you push through tasks. We’re talking casual gaming with friends while streaming, and juggling demanding tasks like video editing and 3D design without slowing down.</p>



<p>The 512GB PCIe Gen 4 SSD storage makes it easy to keep all your favorite gaming titles, plus other media content and projects close, in a single place. SSDs are also known to be much faster than their traditional counterparts in terms of performance. What does this mean for you? Speedy file transfers and much quicker application launches throughout the day. Despite all this performance, the PC stays cool as it works. That’s thanks to its custom copper heatpipes and a 90mm fan, both of which come together to offer optimized airflow. This keeps the temperatures in check and also prevents noisy operation, even when things get a bit intense.</p>



<p>Exceptional durability comes from the PC’s MIL-STD-810H certification against shock, vibration, heat, and altitude. Basically, it’s going to support your gaming adventures and creative projects for years to come. Speaking of long-term use, you’ll also appreciate the tool-less side panels and the spacious interior, which make it easy to upgrade and maintain your system over time. It’s built to grow with you as your needs change.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been on the lookout for a reliable, muscular gaming PC that can handle pressure well, the ASUS TUF T500 is an excellent option to consider. It’s now down to $800, after Amazon generously took $100 off its usual price. We highly recommend grabbing it as soon as you can, as the price can shoot back up at any moment now.</p>

A new demo is available now. <span id="more-1019045"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via No More Robots:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>From the desk of VValak Lizardtongue, Grand Shepherd of the <a title="Games > Tyr" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tyr">Tyr</a>ythian Empire:</p><p>Well this is just complete and utter bullshit.</p><p>Those idiotic, moronic Terranoids think they can just roll in here and take over my beautiful Tyrythian kingdom? The kingdom that I built from the ground up with my bare hands, and only sort of inherited from my dear, sweet, extremely dead father?</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Did I mention that this is bullshit?</p><p>It’s fine though, because what they don’t realize is that I am going to make them very, very dead. Along with my trusty sidekick and childhood nursing bot Milky—please do not ask me questions about that—I will whiz over to Earth, turn it into a stinking pile of rubble, and be back home in time for a warm glass of milk before bed.</p><p><em>Earth Must Die</em> is the story of my glorious rise to power (off the back of my adored father’s passing), my subsequent accidental surrender to the Terranoids, and my infamous revenge against Earth and everything it stands for.</p><p>Apparently the story is retold in the form of one of those old point and click <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,813 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a> that people gave a shit about in the 1990s, I wanna say? But in 2025. Doesn’t sound like a good idea to me, but what do I know—I’m just a benevolent, terrifying leader of worlds who everyone loves and also super respects.</p><p>I’m also not sure what the phrase “British comedy royalty” is supposed to mean, but I guess they got a bunch of “funny” fuckwits to dub over my glorious voyage to feed the Terranoids their own arseholes?

Anyway, apparently my magnificent story is told over a series of many hours, and you click a bunch and things happen and really I don’t care about any of this, I’m just here for the glory.</p><p>You’ll be able to experience my unbelievably cool story through something called “Steam,” which is apparently how you access experiences like this back in 2025.

                <p>Hytale is finally out now, after 10 years of development. If you're looking for the game on Steam, you won't find it there because developer Hypixel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/download-the-hytale-launcher-now-as-hypixel-estimates-over-1-million-players-at-launch/1100-6537319/" data-ref-id="1100-6537319">launched the game exclusively through its own app</a>. But why is Hytale not on Steam, and could it ever be released there? Here's what we know.</p><h2><strong>Why not Steam?</strong></h2><p>Executive producer Patrick Derbic said in a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> that Hypixel opted to release Hytale through its own launcher at first to allow the team to communicate more closely with its own fans and community. Derbic said bringing the game to Steam at launch might have brought a "flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game's direction."</p><p>This isn't to say that Hypixel wants to bury its head in the sand and avoid criticism, however. The studio said it does not shy away from "honest, negative criticism," going on to say the developer itself has been "very critical" of the game it's making. Releasing on Hytale's own dedicated launcher was a purposeful decision the studio made to help ensure "the first steps of our journey to be influenced by informed players rather than large-scale first impressions from those unfamiliar with the game's development background."</p><h2><strong>Hytale could come to Steam later</strong></h2><p>Derbic went on to say that Steam is a "great platform and marketing tool," but Hypixel "might never need" to put Hytale on it. Or it might. The decision hasn't been made yet.</p><p>"This doesn't mean Hytale will never be on Steam; right now, we don't see the need for it, as we want to keep our launch closer to our community," Derbic explained.</p><p>The developer added that Steam does not currently support all of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-hytale-mods/2900-7397/" data-ref-id="2900-7397">Hytale's modding features</a>, adding that the developer aims to discuss this with Valve "to see what's possible."</p><p>Hytale is also not available on console, but in that case, Hypixel confirmed it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-console-version-planned-but-developers-want-to-focus-on-making-a-good-game-first/1100-6537393/" data-ref-id="1100-6537393">will bring the game to console at some point in the future.</a></p><h2><strong>Steam is powerful</strong></h2><p>Steam is among the largest, most dominant, and ubiquitous online stores for digital PC games in the world, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-has-already-set-a-new-concurrent-player-record-clearing-42-million/1100-6537339/" data-ref-id="1100-6537339">millions upon millions of users logging in every day.</a> It's a powerful storefront for games big and small. Valve, which owns and operates Steam, takes a cut of game sales, and in bypassing Steam, Hypixel won't have to pay those fees (though it may have other platform fees and costs to pay).</p><p>Steam has so many catalog games and new releases that discoverability has been cited as an issue for some, but it's also a platform where smaller games can break through and find a massive audience.</p><p>Minecraft, the game that inspired Hytale, is also not available on Steam, while Riot's League of Legends has its own dedicated launcher as well. Companies like EA and Ubisoft pulled games from Steam, citing business reasons, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-more-ea-games-coming-t/1100-6470951/" data-ref-id="1100-6470951">relenting</a> and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-reverses-its-steam-policy-will-launch-new-games-there-on-day-one/1100-6526711/" data-ref-id="1100-6526711"> returning.</a></p><p>Rivals to Steam like the DRM-free GOG and Fortnite developer Epic's Epic Game Store have emerged, but none have come close to matching the size, scale, and importance of Steam.</p>

A position I take that is quite hard to explain in any way that is actually helpful is that for a game to catch someone's attention it must have aesthetic sensibilities that no other game has. To truly get someone's attention anyway, enough marketing budget can undo that, but for an indie game, a vibe (mysterious, unquantifiable) that I haven't felt before will pull me in quicker than listing off genre conventions it follows. This is how Hypnos, a first-person adventure and exploration game "set in a lovecraftian megastructure fever dream," got me to pay attention.
</p>
<p>
I cannot really tell you what Hypnos is about, the description for it is a touch too vague. You're wandering around the "Nameless City at the edge of Dreams," you gotta follow a trailer to a Holy Mountain embrace your destiny, yada, yada, yada, none of this tells me even what I'm doing mechanically. However! The world on display in its reveal trailer is enough to convince me. Jaggedy, mountainous dead landscapes, possible places of worship still active, but for what.

There's a quality that feels like it belongs both in the past, and in the future. At one point a gothic streetlamp glows upon two pigs and a piglet just… hanging out. It feels like it draws upon the classics like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> and Ico, and the character art over on the Steam page tickles me just so too. There are apparently different endings to the game, different dialogue paths to go down and choices to make in its "semi-open world." That use of semi has me curious too, as I like an open world that knows when to scale things down.
</p><p>
According to a press release the game is set in a world originally created for a TTRPG, so I wonder how that may come across too. A demo will also supposedly be coming in the next few weeks, so you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be checking that out whenever it arrives. In the meantime, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2861210/HYPNOS/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-deadpool-daredevil-leak-audio-voice-lines-overwatch-2-lady-gaga-2000620344"><span>Deadpool</span></a><span> is coming to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span>, and it’s fitting that the Merc with a Mouth would pretty much break every rule the hero shooter has established in its first year. He’s a flex character that is capable of swapping between the tank, damage, and support roles throughout a match, and he already looks like a pretty busted version of all three based on the first gameplay trailer. But one of the cool, less-talked-about aspects of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><span>Deadpool’s</span></a><span> kit is how it implements his status as a fourth-wall-breaking troublemaker into his ability set.</span></p>  <p><span>With all of his erratic movements and all the comic-book-style frames and other details that frequently pop up around him, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>Deadpool’s</span></a><span> moveset is one of the harder ones to read in the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> roster. I’m sure once we actually get to play as the character, we’ll all get more familiar with his arsenal of tools and develop a sense of what he’s capable of. But for now, one of the things that stands out to me is how NetEase implemented the meta element of the character into how he fights.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Throughout a match, Deadpool will level up with buffs depending on his role, and you access these by opening up a </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>comic book that Deadpool will flip through as you choose your upgrades. He also has abilities that break the fourth wall, such as one that shows a mini streamer portrait of the hero on an opponent’s screen that smacks them around with a hammer. Not sure how you avoid that or if it’s a sort of “status effect” with a set duration, but it’s appropriately obnoxious for Wade Wilson’s kit to have comic-book pop-ups and winks to the camera.</span></p>

 <p><span>Deadpool is joining the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>roster in season 6, which begins on January 16.</span></p>

In this way, thanks to traditional animation, the characters’ movements are very natural and full of life.</p><p>Distinguished by a stylized character and a wide color palette, this time, outside of Ragast, you will be able to see and discover other environments that belong to the Kingdom of Midaldus.</p><p>Morkull is back!

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red</link>
            <guid>1405978</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content" data-component="article-header">
        

        <p>"Having one single owner simplifies a lot of things."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Newly independent PC digital game shop GOG is interested in getting into publishing indie games - something it apparently couldn't do while part of CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>It's a notable change for a company that's focused primarily on restoring classic old games as well as selling some newer games - notably CD Projekt Red games - since its launch 17 years ago. But it's one of the areas Michał Kiciński, the company's new owner, told me this newly untethered company can now step into.</p>
<p>"I'm also co-owner of an indie game publishing company called Retrovibe," Kiciński said - Retrovibe being the publisher responsible for retro-styled games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/893680/Project_Warlock/">Project Warlock</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1183800/Shardpunk/">Shardpunk</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1640320/BIOTA/">BIOTA</a>. "So one of the directions which were not that much possible in the past is evolving GOG more into publishing business, and that's something we will certainly discuss.</p>
<p>"No decisions have been made yet," Kiciński added, "but this opens a whole new area of activities for GOG which was not that much possible together with CD Projekt Red as one group, because at CD Projekt Red, all publishing activities were connected with their own games, and they didn't want to spread attention into some other topics."</p><p>GOG had before now always been part of CD Projekt, the parent company of CD Projekt Red, but as the company evolved away from game distribution and more towards making its own games, CD Projekt Red grew to encompass the totality of what CD Projekt did and does. That's why GOG was put up for sale last year.</p>
<blockquote><em>"This opens a whole new area of activities for GOG which was not that much possible together with CD Projekt Red"</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/seeing-red-the-story-of-cd-projekt">Kiciński was one of the founders of GOG, coincidentally, and a co-founder of CD Projekt</a>. But he hasn't worked at the company since 2012, since before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, remaining only as a major shareholder since.</p>
<p>Leaving the safety of CD Projekt Red's orbit might seem like a challenging thing to do, given the prestige of that company and the excitement surrounding its games. GOG leveraged those games with attractive price promotions and enjoyed an elevated position courtesy of its proximity to CD Projekt Red. But the gravitational pull of that burgeoning studio worked both ways.</p><p>"It's quite a common business situation when you have two entities of very different sizes in one group, and naturally, the attention and resources goes to the bigger part and the smaller part has <em>some</em> benefits but also has some difficulties in being a much smaller brother in such an environment," Kiciński said.</p>
<p>The upside for GOG, now that it's privately owned and entirely by Kiciński, is there are no investors to worry about, so decisions can be made quickly and perhaps be riskier as result. GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski noticed the opposite thing creep in during the past 10 years he's been there, as the company grew massively following the release of The Witcher 3.</p>
<p>"CDPR, since I've joined the company, grew so much and became a much more complex organisation, stretched across continents," Gołębiewski said. "GOG is a fairly small and nimble company. Having one single owner simplifies a lot of things in terms of potential decision making or risk appetite. A big company that's listed on a public stock exchange: it's probably a little bit more complicated or complex to execute risky stuff."</p>
<p>"That's a good point," Kiciński added. "I know from the other projects I'm involved in, the decision making process is super easy. I'm super accessible and decisions can be made fast, and also, I'm not afraid of risk as a private investor."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We have a big appetite for the growth of GOG"</em></blockquote>
<p>Besides a possible move into publishing games, there aren't plans to dramatically change what GOG does. The founding principle of finding and restoring old games that no longer work remains a strong one, as does selling games with no DRM. And the close relationship with CD Projekt Red will continue, courtesy of a six-year deal that offers very favourable rates on GOG, I'm told.</p>
<p>It probably also helps that the two companies are neighbours, housed inside the same office complex, and that Kiciński is a major CD Projekt shareholder. The two companies might be separate but they're not entirely separated. Not yet.</p>
<p>But it's early days. The deal was only completed in mid-December and Kiciński wasn't sure it would go through until it did. There were rival bidders. So his first day back in the office today, 8th January when we spoke, marked the proper start of figuring out what's next.</p><p>"What we agreed already is that GOG can improve on what's doing right now," he said. "We also discussed that there is no need for any pivots or changes in philosophy or something like that. GOG has a very special place on the market, very unique values, very loyal customers, and we appreciate that, and we want to build up on that, not changing too much. So that's what was discussed. And we already started discussing the publishing activities possible with GOG.</p>
<p>"And that's it. Then we have a few weeks and months to work out the bigger strategy for the future. But for sure, we have a big appetite for the growth of GOG."</p>

<li>Features similar to <strong><em>FSR 4</em></strong> will be implemented on <strong><em>PS5 Pro</em></strong>.</li>

            <p>As someone who admittedly struggles to feel at home whenever I try to go back and play the older Elder Scrolls entries, I'm surprised how fun I've found reading through some notes from a D&amp;D game some devs on the series played around the time of Daggerfall's development. Said notes have just been made public following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-bethesda-developer-julian-lefay-known-as-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-died">recent death of Julian LeFay</a>, a key figure in the early days of Bethesda, who hosted this freshly unearthed campaign and another more well-known one.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/content/julian-lefays-dd-notes">Scans of the notes</a> have been published by the Elder Scrolls lore buffs at long-running wikis the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages and The Imperial Library. "The following documents were recovered from the estate of the late Julian LeFay with great care given to help preserve them by his family and the TES Community," a librarian at the latter wrote. "With the permission of Julian’s family and Bethesda we wish to dedicate this page to Julian Lefay and his impact on The Elder Scrolls and the wider community."</p>
<p>The lore buffs write added that both of these campaigns LeFay ran - dubbed Sumurset and Dwynnen respectively - "helped to shape much of the early lore as the history of Tamriel was being laid out". The Dwynnen one appears to have been known of for a while, but the one set in Sumurset was only discovered via these newly published notes.</p>

</span></p><p>While the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages folks plan to put up a post at some point this week delving deeper into what the notes mean, they're well worth having a scroll through as is if, like me, you've spent a not insubstantial chunk of your life elder scrolling. Among the masses of character bios you'd expect from any D&amp;D adventure, the hand-drawn maps were among the first things which caught my eye. There's one of the isles of Auridon and Alinor with major cities labelled, and I was surprised how closely it mirrors <a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/content/maps-summerset-isles">more modern Elder Scrolls maps</a> of the region, given major tweaks like <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil#cite_note-POT-5">Cyrodill no longer being full of jungle</a> have been worked into the lore in the decades since LeFay's campaign.</p><p>From a character perspective, the notes on Mages Guild founder Vanus Galerion are an intriguing read, with his role as one of the main player characters in this campaign seemingly having set a lot of his backstory in stone. There's one page which simply lays out his origins, with a single handwritten note next to that blurb asking the eternal question: "How about a witch in the wood?" There's also a list of Vanus' mates and where they live, which I'm hopeful no-one hands to would-be mage blackmailers.</p>
<p>Beyond that, a bunch of descriptions of Altmer royals and barons have reminded me how much fun could be had messing with snooty High Elven toffs if a future single-player Elder Scroll was to be set there, as I have with Oblivion's litany of potato-faced Imperial nobles. "Ill-natured and mean-spirited, absolutely everybody hates him," reads the opening line about a baron called Alastor. "He, however, doesn't care since he is very powerful." What a guy. You can almost hear the Dark Brotherhood contract being written up.</p>
<p>Then, there's Deryk. "This baron has a twin sister with whom he constantly wars for possession of the barony. For one hundred years they’ve fought, sometimes he reigns at the end and sometimes she. There is a rather lavish prison on the outskirts of the barony wherein the loser is usually held. For a period of twenty years they jointly ruled, but the result was disastrous." There's a quest you could solve by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccBQZVpVvAE">gently placing buckets</a> over each of their heads so they can no longer detect they're ruling alongside each other.</p>
<p>Even if you're not thinking about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">GTA-sized Turkey Bethesda have had in the oven</a> for ages as you read them, the notes are a really nice way of helping folks remember LeFay's contributions to the series, so it's wonderful to see them being preserved for prosperity like this.</p>

(That previous user agreement has since been “excluded from the wayback machine” and therefore can no longer be found online.)</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659827" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659827"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659827">Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span><br> </span><span>Since then, Take-Two’s legal team has been ruthless in their legal pursuits against a string of </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>mods. In 2025 alone, the mod teams behind </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-liberty-city-preservation-project-shut-down/"><span>Liberty City Preservation Project</span></a><span> (a mod which transplanted </span><i><span>GTA IV’s</span></i><span> map into </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span>), a </span><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/browser-run-copy-of-grand-theft-auto-gets-taken-down-by-dcma-take-two-says-dos-zone-infringed-companys-intellectual-property-rights-despite-disclaimers-and-requirement-to-own-original-copy-of-title-to-run-full-game-online"><span>web browser port</span></a><span> of </span><i><span>GTA: Vice City</span></i><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike"><span>Project Vice</span></a><span> (which modded </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto VI’s</span></i><span> leaked map data into </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span>) were all issued DMCA takedown notices by Take-Two Interactive.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>However, in spite of all this, Rockstar Games announced an exception to their “policy on mods” in 2022, following the ever-growing popularity of Cfx.re’s </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II</span></i><span> roleplay servers FiveM and RedM. Then, in 2023, Rockstar Games revealed </span><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update"><span>that Cfx.re was</span></a><span> “now officially a part of Rockstar Games.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Funnily enough, in 2015, Rockstar Games banned the Rockstar Social Club accounts of several of the members behind FiveM. Rockstar Games then </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-allegedly-bans-modders-for-making-alternative-1723093679"><span>issued an official statement</span></a><span> which explained that the FiveM project “is an unauthorized alternate multiplayer service that contains code designed to facilitate piracy.”</span></p>

 <h2>The <em>GTA</em>&nbsp;mods will be monetized</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rockstar-launches-official-marketplace-for-mods"><span>Earlier this week</span></a><span> on January 12, Cfx announced the </span><a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289"><span>Cfx Marketplace</span></a><span>, which they described as “a curated digital storefront where talented FiveM/RedM creators can share and sell their work.” Although the marketplace is clearly aimed at </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>RDR II</span></i><span> server owners, the official news post states that “there’s something for every server and every player,” including “purchasable props, scripts, maps, and much more.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The marketplace features a handful of mods that are free to download, as well as mods that require a </span><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6187491-onx-eup-police-ems-clothing-pack"><span>$23.99 recurring monthly fee</span></a><span> and bundles that cost </span><a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6187491-onx-eup-police-ems-clothing-pack"><span>upwards of $467.99</span></a><span>. For the time being, Cfx has only partnered with a “select group” of modders for its initial launch. It’s also not clear exactly how much of a cut Take-Two Interactive is getting from these purchases.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It could be argued that the creation of the Cfx Marketplace is Rockstar Games’ attempt at providing a space for server owners to find mods that are immune to takedown notices, as, according to commenters on Cfx’s news post, dozens of paid, non-Rockstar-authorized mods have been banned in the past for featuring third-party assets.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The timing is also somewhat suspicious, as this “initial launch” looks a lot like a trial run for a </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></i><span> mod marketplace to me. I’d also be curious to find out exactly how much of a cut, if any, Rockstar Games and Take-Two are getting from these purchases, although said information is seemingly absent from any of the official Cfx Marketplace news posts.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Can You Make Glass in Hytale? Hytale Windows, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-glass-make-windows/</link>
            <guid>1405921</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale is now available in early access, and, despite the similarities with Minecraft, there are some differences, including the process of making Windows and how to get Glass.</p>



<p>The Hypixel Studios title has plenty to discover, but for those who are used to playing Minecraft, it may be difficult to get those approaches out of their heads and learn the new mechanics.</p>



<p>This guide from Insider Gaming will make it easier, though, with a breakdown on Glass in Hytale and how to make Windows.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-make-glass-in-hytale">Can You Make Glass in Hytale?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Craft away. Screenshot bt</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Although you can create Glass objects in Hytale, you can’t create Glass blocks, or panes of Glass, like you can in Minecraft.</strong></p>



<p>The Minecraft process of gathering Sand and burning it in a furnace will result in Glass Bottles being created. While these are useful for creating items like Health Potions, it won’t give you an item you can use to fill in holes in the side of your base to allow natural light to pass through.</p>



<p>So, while Glass is in Hytale, the whole process works completely differently from Minecraft, but it’s actually much simpler.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-make-windows-in-hytale">How to Make Windows in Hytale</h2>



<p><strong>Windows in Hytale are created by using Stone block or Wood blocks and interacting with the Builder’s Workbench, which shows all the items that the selected block can be turned into.</strong></p>



<p>With a Stone  or Wood block, you can select everything from windows to doors, stairs to trapdoors, without worrying about placement across a crafting grid. Instead, it’s just the one resource you need, which means you can finalize the design of your base much quicker than you can in Minecraft.</p>



<p>The type of Windows you can create depends on the type of Stone or Wood inputted, and there are some big differences. Marble Cobblestone, for example, provide Light Temple Windows, while Softwood Planks provide Crude Windows, so it’s best to gather a variety of different materials and choose the design you like best, particularly as not every Window design even has Glass as part of it.</p>



<p>Not every type of Stone block can be used for Windows, however, as normal Cobblestone, Basalt Cobblestone, and Volcanic Cobblestone are among those that don’t offer a design for Windows when selected in the Builder’s Workbench.</p>

According to the leaks, Forza Horizon 6 will reportedly launch on May 19, while the Premium Edition of the game will allow buyers to start playing four days early on May 15.</p><p>Xbox Infinite--an Xbox news site based in Saudi Arabia--posted an image of what it claims is an in-game announcement from Forza Horizon 5, detailing the Forza Horizon 6 release date and DLC that will be available in the Premium Edition. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/forza-horizon-6s-release-date-may-have-been-revealed-early-by-an-in-game-ad/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC corroborated the claims</a>, saying that its sources had confirmed that this is the correct release date for the game. According to the image, the Premium Edition will offer early access, VIP membership, car packs, an exclusive Ferrari, and post-launch car pack DLC.</p><p>Forza Horizon 6 was officially revealed ahead of the Xbox showcase at Tokyo Game Show last year, and the next chapter in the racing series will see the Horizon Festival <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-forza-horizon-6-aims-to-get-its-japanese-details-right/1100-6535031/">move to Japan</a>. It'll launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S first, with a PS5 release date to follow. Forza Horizon 5 launched on PS5 last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-by-far-xboxs-most-successful-port-on-ps5-report/1100-6537371/">and the game proved </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-by-far-xboxs-most-successful-port-on-ps5-report/1100-6537371/">a huge success on the Sony platform,</a> selling over 5.1 million units.</p><p>At the same time, things aren't looking too good for Forza Motorsport, as developer Turn 10 Studios announced late last year that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-motorsport-content-updates-are-coming-to-an-end/1100-6537039/">ending development of new content</a> for the game. While the servers will be kept online for the foreseeable future, there will be no "new cars, tracks, features, or regular bug fixes" for the game, the studio said.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-exclusive-wild-has-reportedly-been-canceled/1100-6495395/">canceled open-world game Wild</a> may get a spiritual successor of sorts from Deus Ex: Human Revolution developer Eidos Montreal. According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/edios-montreal-aaaa-game/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>, the unannounced title is codenamed P11 and features intriguing likenesses to the canned Ubisoft game.</p><p dir="ltr">The report also states that P11 has been in development since 2019, with Unreal Engine 5 powering the project. However, Insider Gaming adds there have been "significant setbacks" for the game. In 2024, Embracer Group <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deus-ex-game-canceled-amid-embracers-ongoing-cost-cutting-report-says/1100-6520668/">canned a Deus Ex game in development and cut 97 people from Eidos Montreal</a>. The layoffs didn't stop there, either. Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-co-developer-eidos-montreal-lays-off-staff-the-latest-cuts-from-embracer/1100-6530502/">another 75 employees lost their jobs</a> at the studio.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As for P11, <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2011272772551614666" rel="nofollow ">an X user named Timur222</a> found that an Eidos Montreal employee on LinkedIn refers to the project as a "AAAA" game. Insider Gaming initially thought that Embracer may have somehow acquired the Wild rights from Ubisoft because this project looks so similar. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-beyond-good-evil-creator-reveals-a-ps4-excl/1100-6421676/">Wild was revealed in 2014</a>, showing players riding a bear and even assuming the control of an eagle and rabbit. The PlayStation exclusive was reportedly canceled in 2021.</p><p dir="ltr">The codename probably just refers to the project being the 11th game for Eidos Montreal. The studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-trailer-shows-first-gameplay-coming-2025/1100-6524087/">currently co-developing Fable</a> with Playground Games and also assisted on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grounded-2-review-little-big-planet/1900-6418390/">Grounded 2</a>. The last game that Eidos Montreal headed development on was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-shot-through-the-heart/1900-6417764/">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a> in 2021.</p>

                <p>Hytale is finally out now in early access following 10 years of development and a cancellation. Like other early-access games, Hytale isn't finished and may contain bugs and other oddities as developer Hypixel updates and improves the game over time. The studio has now <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">outlined</a> what's to come in the immediate future, and more of what's on tap on a longer-term horizon.</p><p>For the "first few months," Hypixel will release updates "quickly and frequently" to address the "backlog of obvious construction sites" that the team wants to address. For anyone just catching up, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-riot-canceled-hytale-and-how-it-came-back-to-life/1100-6537388/" data-ref-id="1100-6537388">Hypixel purchased Hytale from Riot in November 2025</a>, and in the eight weeks since, the team did what it could to get Hytale out, but this also means the team didn't get to every item it wanted to fix or address.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NNh6Dz7YpA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_NNh6Dz7YpA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Looking further out, Hypixel said it plans to release "larger, more bespoke updates" and new features for Hytale. This will include official minigames, with development set to begin on these "in the coming months." These minigames will add "systems and features that expand gameplay," Hypixel said.</p><p>Additionally, Hypixel said it's also prototyped social features for Hytale, including proximity voice chat and friends lists.</p><p>Another future update for Hytale will add an Adventure Mode, which will have "rich story and narrative elements, deeper progression systems, dungeons with boss fights, and more." </p><p>"Our roadmap isn't completely pre-planned, as we are expecting feedback within the next weeks and months from actual Hytale players, experiencing the game for the first time," Hypixel said.</p><p>Hytale is available now through the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/download-the-hytale-launcher-now-as-hypixel-estimates-over-1-million-players-at-launch/1100-6537319/" data-ref-id="1100-6537319">Hytale Launcher</a>. The game appears to be off to a good start, boasting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-is-off-to-quite-the-strong-start-with-impressive-twitch-viewership-numbers/1100-6537390/" data-ref-id="1100-6537390">impressive viewership numbers on Twitch.</a></p>
