            <p>The protagonists of two of my all time favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>s share something in common. Both (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-final-fantasy-games-pc">the best Final Fantasy game</a>) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a>’s Squall and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.</p>
<p>The set contains "over 400 cards and a playmat" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:</p>

<p>Gwent itself has seen a few iterations over the years. There was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gwent-the-witcher-card-game">standalone online game</a> that I had some fun with for a bit, even if it shattered CDProjekt’s image as the ‘No Microtransactions, Free DLC and a Back Massage’ studio by having the most nefarious loot box animation I’d ever encountered. Then there was the rather good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales">Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</a>, which wove Gwent into a single-player story. Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales-review">quite liked it</a>.</p>
<p>You can read the full press release <a href="https://www.hachetteboardgames.co.uk/gwent-announcement">here</a>, if you’d like. This one is supposed to be out Q3 of next year. In other Witchly news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> has entered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-most-intensive-phase-of-development-say-cd-projekt">"the most intensive phase of development</a>".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new game from MachineGames and Bethesda lets you step into the (I assume very muddy and warm) boots of the famous adventurer for an exciting new journey around the world. Along the way you solve ancient puzzles and riddles and, of course, fight Nazis.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,196358,195922" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386"><em>Great Circle</em> is very good</a></span>, mixing stealth, action, puzzles, and exploration into a <em>Dishonored</em>-like experience worth playing on Xbox or PC. But there are some things the game doesn’t tell you, and a few lessons I’ve learned from playing it. So here are some adventuring tips to help you succeed in Indy’s latest adventure. </p><h2 id="h112052"><a id=""></a><strong>Follow the main quest</strong></h2><p>You’ll unlock important features, outfits, and more that will help you explore the large maps more thoroughly. And don’t worry, you can return to maps and finish up exploring once the credits roll. </p><h2 id="h112053"><a id=""></a>Turn down the music and turn up the voices</h2><p>The default audio mix in <em>Great Circle</em> is very music-heavy and while I enjoy the game’s soundtrack, I had trouble hearing Troy Baker’s Indy when playing. So I dropped the in-game music down about 10 points and upped the voice acting level by around 10. </p><h2 id="h112054"><a id=""></a><strong>Always be eating!</strong></h2><p>Food is very important in <em>Great Circle</em>. Bread can give you extra health, letting you take more hits in a fight. Fruit, meanwhile, gives you extra stamina, helping you throw more punches or climb for longer, so always eat a ton of it. The game will let you know when you’re maxed out. </p><h2 id="h112055"><a id=""></a><strong>Grab lots of food, too</strong></h2><p>Don’t just eat food, grab it! Indy can carry a few fruits and bread items with him at all times. When you’ve maxed out how much you can eat, max out how much you can carry. It will help you later.</p><figure id="" data-id="942e1cb39709b77314255f95f77c58e8" data-recommend-id="image://942e1cb39709b77314255f95f77c58e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Bethesda</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="942e1cb39709b77314255f95f77c58e8" data-recommend-id="image://942e1cb39709b77314255f95f77c58e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h112056"><a id=""></a><strong>Crack that whip!</strong></h2><p>Your whip isn’t just useful for swinging around places or pulling stuff down, it’s also very handy in a fight. You can whip enemies to stun them or even remove their weapons. If you get surprised by an enemy, whip them, steal their dropped weapon, and then beat them with it. </p><h2 id="h112057"><a id=""></a><strong>Also, crack that whip to scare dogs</strong></h2><p>You don’t have to kill dogs in<em> Great Circle. </em>Instead, just crack the whip near them and they’ll run away scared. </p><h2 id="h112058"><a id=""></a>Thoroughly look at all items when solving puzzles</h2><p>There are a lot of puzzles to solve in <em>Great Circle, </em>and a few times I found myself stumped. In these instances I found the answer, or a clue at least, by checking out the notes and items associated with the puzzle a bit more thoroughly. Indy can examine these things and even spin them around. Do that! </p><p>I’ve found notes, markings, and other clues on the backs of many objects, and that helped me solve hard puzzles. </p><h2 id="h112059"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t go alone, always bring a weapon</strong></h2><p>Whenever possible, try to carry a weapon. These are very useful as you can knock out enemies with one hit if you sneak up behind them, but you can also use them in fistfights to gain an advantage. </p><figure id="" data-id="149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-recommend-id="image://149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Bethesda</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-recommend-id="image://149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h112060"><a id=""></a>Sneak around, don’t fight</h2><p>While you might want to punch and shoot your way through the game, you’re better off sneaking around. Enemies aren’t super smart and have bad peripheral vision. </p><p>Also, if you use a weapon to knock someone out with one hit nobody will hear it, even if you do it with a really loud item like a guitar. </p><h2 id="h112061"><a id=""></a>When spotted, run away for a bit</h2><p>Stealth is a big part of<em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. Sometimes you’ll make a mistake and everyone will come running to kick your ass. Don’t fight them off; instead just run away and find a bush or room to hide in. Within a few moments, they’ll give up and you can walk back out and continue adventuring. </p><h2 id="h112062"><a id=""></a><strong>Use fast-travel signs</strong></h2><p>While it’s a lot of fun to explore the big maps in the game, don’t be afraid to use fast travel when hunting around for the last few secrets or side quests. To use fast travel, look for signposts found in  the map (they sparkle a little) and click where you want to go. Keep in mind you need to have been to a spot at least once to fast-travel there.</p><h2 id="h112063"><a id=""></a><strong>Walk around with your journal out</strong></h2><p>Indy’s journal  is very useful, as when you have it open in map mode the game will put objective markers in the world. This will help you get to where you need to go. </p><h2 id="h112064"><a id=""></a>Don’t forget to actually buy those upgrades you collect</h2><p><em>Great Circle</em> lets you find books that will help improve Indy’s abilities and stats. However, remember that just picking up and collecting a book isn’t enough. You still need to open your journal, flip over to upgrades, and use Adventure Points to buy and unlock the collected upgrade. It’s a bit odd, but worth remembering. </p><h2 id="h112065"><a id=""></a>Also, use your camera to get extra Adventure Points</h2><p>While you earn upgrade points by completing missions and quests, you also score some from taking photos of important people, places, or events. Keep an eye out for the camera icon in the top left of the screen and pull yours out whenever it pops up. Then look around for whatever special thing can be photographed and snap a pic for points.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The early access launch of Path of Exile 2 has been delayed due to database</p>



<p>The game was originally scheduled to launch at 2pm EST. Just before that time, and with a larger than expected number of players eager to jump into the game, developer Grinding Gear Games decided to do “last minute database upgrades” in order to allow the game’s servers to handle the influx of players. </p>



<p>The delay comes hours after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-ii-queue-warning-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers warned of long queue times</a> for players on launch day.</p>



<p>After the database configuration was deployed, the <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865098006934229066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">team said</a> that it would only take a “half hour” to get access restored to the game. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case after another issue was found within the game.</p>



<p>First, there was a crash that “would have affected a majority of users” that was fixed and being deployed before final checks. Following stating that the release was “relatively imminent”, yet another problem arose for the game.</p>



<p>“We’ve run into a configuration problem and need to restart the realm,” they said. “The problem we ran into was due to adding more database shards in the last minute to try to support the massive player numbers. Unfortunately there was an issue which caused multiple characters to have the same character id.”</p>



<p>As of publishing, not only is the early access launch delayed but the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3594080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a> has been going offline due to players looking for updates.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide an update when Path of Exile 2 is functioning and available.</p>

These include some specific settings for PS5 Pro, as well as what differences to expect between Xbox Series X and Series S.</p><p>For PC, Warhorse Studio has provided six different PC settings, ranging from low to ultra, as well as three different settings for Xbox Series X|S and PS5. The PC requirements are fairly modest, but the highest settings will demand fairly new and high-end GPUs. The Series S is limited to 30fps, but the Series X has 30fps and 60fps options. The PS5 Pro doesn't seem to offer any different options, rather just combining the target resolution and frame rate of the two options on the base PS5.</p><h2>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 PC Specs</h2><ul><li>Average performance: 1080 @ 30fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li><li>Memory: 16GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB) / AMD Radeon RX 580</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h3>Recommended 1080p (medium)</h3><ul><li>Average performance: 1080p @ 60fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-13600K / AMD Ryzen 5 7600X</li><li>Memory: 24GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 / AMD Radeon RX 660 XT</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h3>Recommended 1440p (medium)</h3><ul><li>Average performance: 1080p @ 60fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-13600K / AMD Ryzen 5 7600X</li><li>Memory: 24GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti / AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h3>Recommended 1080p (high)</h3><ul><li>Average performance: 1080 @ 30fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-12600K / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li><li>Memory: 32GB Ram</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super / AMD Radeon RX 5700</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h3>Recommended 1440p (high)</h3><ul><li>Average performance: 1440 @ 60fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-13700K / AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D</li><li>Memory: 32GB Ram</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 / AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h3>Best (ultra)</h3><ul><li>Average performance: 1440 @ 60fps / 2160p @ 30fps</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-13700K / AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D</li><li>Memory: 32GB Ram</li><li>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 / AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT</li><li>Storage: 100GB SSD</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit or newer</li></ul><h2>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 console details</h2><h3>Xbox Series S</h3><ul><li>Resolution: 1080p</li><li>Target performance: 30fps</li><li>Upscaling technology: N/A</li></ul><h3>Xbox Series X (performance)</h3><ul><li>Resolution: Upscaled 1440p</li><li>Target performance: 60fps (unlocked with VRR)</li><li>Upscaling technology: AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution</li></ul><h3>Xbox Series X (fidelity)</h3><ul><li>Resolution: Upscaled 2160p</li><li>Target performance: 30fps</li><li>Upscaling technology: AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution</li></ul><h3>PlayStation 5 (performance)</h3><ul><li>Resolution: Upscaled 1440p</li><li>Target performance: 60fps (unlocked with VRR)</li><li>Upscaling technology: AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution</li></ul><h3>PlayStation 5 fidelity (performance)</h3><ul><li>Resolution: Upscaled 2160p</li><li>Target performance: 30fps</li><li>Upscaling technology: AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution</li></ul><h3>PlayStation 5 Pro</h3><ul><li>Resolution: Upscaled 2160p</li><li>Target performance: 60fps (unlocked with VRR)</li><li>Upscaling technology: PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preorder-guide/1100-6522984/" data-ref-id="1100-6522984" data-mce-href="/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preorder-guide/1100-6522984/">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> is a first-person action game taking place in a medieval setting, and is the follow-up to 2018's Kingdom Come Deliverance.

            <p>Where were you during the Summer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doronko-wanko">Doronko Wanko</a>? Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doronko-wanko">free game</a> about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bandai-namco-would-like-you-to-have-a-free-dog">definitely March</a>. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512840/DORONKO_WANKO/">here</a>.</p>
<p>It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.</p>

<p>There’s not much information outside that so far, I’m afraid, although it has been nice to see such a lovely reception to such a fun free offering. It shot up to ‘overwhelmingly positive’ quite quickly on Steam. My current favourite review on there describes it as a “reverse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>”.</p><p>The game was released with two other freebies as part of Bandai Namco’s 2023 New Employee Training Project, which lets new hires get experience and support releasing smaller projects before moving them up to bigger games. It felt like the rare ‘entirely depressing caveat free’ bit of gaming news, basically. Although I’m sure one of you bastards will find a way to ruin it for me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We saw how a rebellion erupted in a separate Silo—Silo 17—resulting in people defiantly venturing to the outside world only to be killed by the noxious air. Since then, we’ve seen Juliette Nichols (Rebecca Ferguson) walk through what could be the future for Silo 18, the Silo she left: dead bodies strewn outside, “Lies” scrawled across the monitor the Silo people use to see the outside world, and darkness. </p><p>Ever since the people of Silo 18 watched Juliette become the first person to successfully walk outside and survive at the end of the first season, the Silo’s mayor, Bernard Holland (Tim Robbins), has been using every manipulative tactic at his disposal to prevent an uprising among people who have been told their entire lives that life outside the Silo isn’t safe. He’s arrested individuals for painting Juliette’s initials on the walls as a sign of reverence, lied about her using new tape his team developed to block the poisonous air from entering her suit, hired actors to publicly challenge him so he can dismiss their opinions as ramblings compared to his deceitful proclamations of hope, and coerced Judge Mary Meadows (Tanya Moodie) into supporting his lies to pacify the people with false promises of this new tape ushering in a new day. </p><p>What he did in episode four might be both his most dastardly deception and his most effective one. </p><h3 id="h114218"><a id=""></a>What happened to Judge Mary Meadows?</h3><figure id="" data-id="d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-recommend-id="image://d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1606" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-recommend-id="image://d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1606" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After Bernard’s brooding enforcer Robert Sims (Common) questions Judge Meadows’ fidelity to the lie, he attempts to remove her from her place of influence with Bernard by having people call for her impeachment. While he simply wanted her sidelined, Bernard saw a more vile opportunity to both silence her and distract people from looking for the truth about the Silo.</p><p>Meadows only went along with Bernard’s plan in exchange for a suit designed to keep her safe when she exits the Silo, a promise he dangled in front of her until the end. Under the guise of a friendly dinner before handing her over her suit, Bernard poisoned the food she ate in an effort to “unite the Silo.” How her death would help accomplish that wasn’t clear until he offered Knox (Shane McRae) and Shirley (Remmie Milner), the two people leading the silent rebellion against Bernard, the chance to come see Judge Meadows. When they arrive in her office to see her dead with a knife in her chest, they quickly realize they’ve been set up to be pinned as the murderers of the Silo’s judge. </p><p>Soon after, Sims incited a manhunt for the accused killers, telling an angry mob that the two had killed Meadows for refusing to open the Silo’s air lock, and proclaiming it the duty of every Silo member to find them. That’s one way to bring people together.</p><p>With Juliette trying to assemble a suit so she can get back to Silo 18 and stop a rebellion that would lead to the deaths of its residents, the embers of fiery hatred have already been stoked, and there might not be much time left to prevent the inevitable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But there were some bad ones, too.</p><p>Light and dark. Left and right. Pepsi and Coke. One needs the other to exist. The best games are only great if we can compare them to mediocre or awful games. And 2024 had plenty of so-so or downright horrible games, too. </p><p>So let’s take a look at some of the worst-reviewed games of 2024.</p><p> But before we do that it’s worth repeating: Liking a “bad” game isn’t a <em>bad</em> thing. Numbered scores come with all sorts of asterisks and caveats, which is part of the reason we don’t use them here. And Metacritic’s aggregate isn’t perfect by any stretch. If you see a game on this list that you happen to love, it just means you have a different taste than a bunch of other critics or players. That’s fine! Enjoy what you like and don’t be an asshole about it and everything will be fine. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2020-according-to-metacritic-1845913017?_gl=1*1906hd1*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MDg3NDQuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2020-according-to-metacritic-1845913017?_gl=1*1906hd1*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MDg3NDQuNTcuMC4w">Now, as we’ve</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2021-according-to-metacritic-1848234861?_gl=1*1ij1sdw*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDU4NS44My4xLjE3MzM0Mjg3OTguNDIuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2021-according-to-metacritic-1848234861?_gl=1*1ij1sdw*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDU4NS44My4xLjE3MzM0Mjg3OTguNDIuMC4w">done</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2019-according-to-metacritic-1840668824?_gl=1*66bxk9*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MTI4MDEuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2019-according-to-metacritic-1840668824?_gl=1*66bxk9*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MTI4MDEuNjAuMC4w">before</a></span>, here are the 10 worst-rated games on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a></span> with at least seven reviews.</p></div></div><div><p>This appears to be another attempt at a small studio making a <em>CoD </em>zombies-like wave-based shooter.

Don’t play <em>Funko Fusion.</em> Save your money, buy some pizza, and watch one of the movies included in this collection instead.

Meanwhile, in the same 12 months, Konami also released <em>Silent Hill: The Short Message</em>, a first-person horror game that wasn’t very good and which most people likely forgot about within weeks of playing it. At least it was free and short. </p></div><div><p>The original <em>Test Drive Unlimited</em> was awesome and was in many ways the predecessor to <em>Forza Horizon</em>’s big open worlds.<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/test-drive-patch-notes-free-car-unlimited-solar-crown-1851689819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/test-drive-patch-notes-free-car-unlimited-solar-crown-1851689819"><em>Solar Crown</em></a></span>, on the other hand, is a buggy disaster that players don’t enjoy and which wasn’t even playable for a few days at launch due to server problems.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675#:~:text=I%20also%20want,2024.%20It%20sucks.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675#:~:text=I%20also%20want,2024.%20It%20sucks."> It also had three different release dates based on how much you paid</a></span>. Bleh. </p></div><div><p><em>TMNT Mutant Mayhem</em> is a fantastic movie with one of my favorite fight scenes from recent memory. <em>Wrath of the Mutants</em>, on the other hand, is just a quick and barebones port of the 2017 arcade game that has a title that sort-of-sounds like the popular movie.

That’s not easy. But <em>Pneumata </em>isn’t very good, with poor level design, bad enemy AI, and not many scares. </p></div><div><p>This is a very pretty-looking game that lets you drive around Barcelona as a taxi driver. Sadly, it’s not much fun to drive, offers little depth, and there are much better transportation sims out there. Also, as a <em>Crazy Taxi</em> fan, this game lacks Offspring music and big jumps. Boo. </p></div><div><p>The good: <em>Looney Tunes</em> characters are still funny and charming in <em>Wacky World of Sports</em>. The bad: Everything else. This co-op sports game plays poorly, has only four sports to choose from, and looks like it fell out of 2015. Avoid and watch some clips of Bugs and Daffy on YouTube instead. Oh hey, look, this game was also published by Game Mill. Hmmm.</p></div><div><p>If you Google<em> Jujutsu Kaisen: Cursed Clash, </em>you’ll find a lot of people calling it the worst anime game released in years and bragging about how they refunded it quickly. Others are warning people to not buy it. I’ll quote one negative Steam review: “<em>Roblox JJK</em> games are more worthy of your time.” </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Weeks before its launch, technical director Yukata Ito shared a photo of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/YutakaIto_RGG/status/1745050214476677561">game's source code</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

But he stressed the move was made with consultation from each team before showing the source code, including the programmer who wrote it. The parts he chose were "relatively clean," which he hoped would make for good reactions, and be intentionally beginner-friendly.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Like a Dragon, like a programmer">Like a Dragon, like a programmer</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like a Dragon games release on a near-yearly basis, and sometimes two games per year.

"I instruct them to...try to to be considerate towards the other party. This kind of reliable attitude makes the designers and planners more inclined to consult with the programmers, and I believe this is very beneficial for interpersonal relationships in the studio."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We require our programmers at RGG to not only work as instructed," he continued, "but to form and voice their own opinions on the game’s design and contribute towards improving the game, so we train them in this area as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To aspiring programmers, Ito said the profession is for anyone "as long as they have learned the basics of programming.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-soulframe-devstream-showcases-companions-new-social-hub-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes did a <a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/">devstream</a> that revealed some of the features that players can look forward to in Soulframe Preludes (Pre-Alpha) in December. The features contain companion summoning, a social hub for players, environmental hazard mechanics and more. For those interested in the full devstream, you can watch it below, where they go into detail about the features that you can expect in December. If you don't want to watch the whole thing, there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXOinkXxJrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small teaser trailer</a> that showcases some of the features you can expect, such as a new Omen Beast and a rideable wolf mount.</p>
<p><iframe title="Soulframe Devstream #3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvLYxzGtfNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Diving into the devstream content, they've mentioned some of the updates that will be available in December, which provides a new level of difficulty to the game, as well as some familiar content being added which was revealed at TennoCon 2024. Having a social hub in a game like this is always beneficial, and you can see them in Warframe, as well as games like Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft, for example. In Soulframe, you will be able to experience the first player social hub called Silent Rose Cave. In this social hub, players will be given the opportunity to chat with NPCs and get to know them better, accept new side quests to embark on, as well as the opportunity to meet other Envoys that you may want to party up with before you go on your next adventure.</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll be able to join the hunt in Orengall's new Fable, where you'll be given the option to forge a new pact with the wolf. If you're someone who likes to jump into group content and deal some damage in dungeons, they'll now have an extra layer of difficulty. While you may have found that the dungeons were a bit easy in the past, they will now have new environmental hazards, such as acid or poison on the floor. There will be additional challenges that you'll have to contend with in the crooked corridors, and this will change how you navigate through the dungeon.</p>
<p>Finally, the Envoy character creation, which was showcased at <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-looks-promising-in-new-tennocon-showcase-digital-extremes-will-talk-a-lot-more-about-it-in-2024/">TennoCon 2024</a>, will now be available and playable for those who want to add their own personal touch to their envoy. Of course, with such an expansive update, there will also be other quality-of-life improvements from members of the community who have already played the game. This includes fixing the combat tree UI and reworking the potion system in Soulframe Preludes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-games-announces-project-k-card-games-based-on-league-of-legends<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> is getting the card game treatment. The latest addition to the beloved franchise is called Project K, and its launch will include official organized play support.</p>

<h2>The Project K Announcement</h2>

<p>The announcement of Project K was made via an official video on Riot Games' YouTube channel. The game is a competitive experience, similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, just with characters and locations from <em>League of Legends</em>. It will support 1v1, 2v2, and four-player free-for-all games.</p>


<p>According to game director Dave Guskin and executive producer Chengran Chai, the game is being developed by a small team within Riot Games. In addition, this is not a physical version of its digital card game <em>Legends of Runeterra</em> but an original experience that draws from the deep lore and characters of the franchise.</p>

<p>The trailer shows some of the cards. There are familiar faces such as Jinx, Viktor, Volibear, and Yasuo as well as recognizable locations like Zaun. Each of the characters appear to have two different colors, but there don't appear to be any resources like <em>Magic: The Gathering's</em> mana. This is speculation since the game is still in development.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the video, Chai mentions that organized play will be supported for <em>Project K</em> at launch. This will include local play events at hobby shops, competitive events up to the national level, and even global tournaments.</p>

They already have a publishing partner for the game's release in China in early 2025. A global launch is planned, but they are currently seeking publishers for the US and EU.</p>

<p><em>Project K</em> is the latest expansion to the <em>League of Legends</em> series. The iconic MOBA has seen single-player spin-offs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mageseeker-league-of-legends-story" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mageseeker</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ruined-king-league-of-legends-story" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ruined King</em>,</a> the upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/2xko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>2XKO</em></a> fighting game, and the critically acclaimed animated series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Arcane</em></a>.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the actors with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies mode have quit the game, according to a new claim. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1865103558414340269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Call of Duty leaker GhostOfHope says that they have left the game due to a lack of protection against AI.</p>



<p>“Almost all of the actors that feature in the Zombies crew in Black Ops 6 Zombies have pulled out of working over the lack of AI protections in their contracts,” Hope said. “This has resulted in some of the disappointing recasts we are now seeing early on (Ex: SAM on Citadelle), with some likely still to be recast in future maps etc.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for comment on the report. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>Concerns of AI protection for video game actors is nothing new. SAG-AFTRA members are currently striking against game studios for that exact reason after negotiations with studios failed to deliver any sort of guarantees for actors. The strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially began</a> in July after 18 months of negotiations, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-strike-with-video-game-voice-and-performance-artists-to-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues without a deal</a>.</p>



<p>One of those studios the union is in negotiations with just happens to be Activision Blizzard as well as EA, Insomniac, Take-Two, Warner Bros. Games, and more.</p>



<p>What do you think of actors quitting Black Ops 6 Zombies over concerns regarding AI protection? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review.1054236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-review-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It only took an hour of playing Path of Exile 2’s early access version to know I’d soon be firing up an Excel spreadsheet and saying goodbye to all my loved ones for the foreseeable future. Just when I thought I was out, the heartless maniacs (in a good way) at Grinding Gears Games have pulled me back in with a sequel to one of my favorite action RPGs of all time – a game which has already consumed much of my life since it came out a decade ago. The gameplay, endgame mechanics, and insanely intricate buildcrafting all take massive steps forward, and even though it’s subject to many of the usual “early access jank” caveats and suffers from some seriously stingy loot drops right now, there’s already a lot to love about this fantastic, time-destroying ARPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per all the genre’s usual tendencies, you can expect to spend your time blasting your way through armies of enemies in search of loot, taking down big, gross-looking bosses, and teleporting back to town to sell off your spoils roughly every two minutes due to your insanely small inventory space. In its presently unfinished state, it takes about 60 hours of battling your way through the first three acts of the campaign (of a planned six) twice in a row (on a higher difficulty the second time) before you hit the impressively extensive endgame, where even more angry mobs and shiny gear waits for you. And although it has plenty of technical jank and placeholders labeled “coming soon” where features should be, the vast majority of my multi-day marathon to get there was overwhelmingly enjoyable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Needless to say, Path of Exile 2 doesn’t exactly rock the storytelling boat – it sticks with the usual tale of horrifying abominations which threaten to destroy the world and immortal beings treating mortals as pawns – but that doesn’t mean it’s boring or without the occasional twist and turn. Getting to know the cast of characters and unraveling the otherworldly culture and history featured in each act is a particular highlight. I grew quite fond of Alva, a treasure hunter who loves adventure almost as much as she loves making quick exits whenever danger shows up, and getting to know the Maraketh, a brutal group of desert survivalist nomads, was very compelling. We don’t know what the second half of that story has in store, so the jury’s still out on whether or not it’ll stick the landing, but so far it’s off to a decent, if not entirely original start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Path of Exile 2 plays it safe with the story, it swings for the fences when it comes to ambitious gameplay, and the result is one of the most irresistibly playable action-RPGs to-date. After picking one of the six classes currently available (Grinding Gear says there will be 12 eventually) you’ll start down the long, arduous path of making heads or tails of their incomprehensibly complex skill trees. They almost seem like they were designed to be sarcastically dense as you slowly piece together a build you like – it only takes one look at the main passive perk tree, which has over 1,500 perks to choose from, to realize you’re gonna be fogging up those nerd glasses quite a bit. Then you’ll bring those abilities and equipment to bear on all manner of zombies and weird lizard monsters in a relentless hunt for loot and XP that, if you’re as eager to smash the next fleshy pinata open to see what’s inside as I am, is prone to keep you up long into the night. Throw in the fact that maps are procedurally generated and offer a pretty high degree of replayability while also managing to not feel like they weren’t handcrafted, and you’re liable to lose yourself for the better part of a week like I did.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each class offers a unique way to play that dramatically mixes things.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a plethora of gameplay improvements over Path of Exile 2’s predecessor that make slashing through hordes of monsters endlessly entertaining, including dodge-rolling that adds a much-needed skill component to keeping yourself alive, WASD support that makes movement so much better, and other quality-of-life improvements that bring Path of Exile 2 much more in line with its modern peers. But in a lot of ways it surpasses them, too, with action-packed combat that feels a lot less passive than, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-review"><u>Diablo 4</u></a>, where you might find yourself hypnotically using the same combination of abilities over and over again as you plow through enemies. You can certainly get to an insane level of power eventually, but the vast majority of the time enemies will at least put up a fight, especially during boss battles where you’ll need to learn your foe’s attack patterns to survive. This ends up making combat feel a lot more like a proper action game than most action-RPGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It helps that each of the classes offers a unique way to play that dramatically mixes things up to a much greater degree than other ARPGs. For example, choosing the Dexterity-focused Ranger will have you keeping your distance, dancing around the map, and most importantly, focusing on your Evasion stat which gives you a chance to completely ignore attacks that land on you – but if you ever do manage to get hit by something big, like a boss, you’re toast. Alternatively, if you choose a Warrior, you’ll be running into close-quarters battle wearing the thickest armor you can find and focus on cleaving the enemy in two before they can whittle down your health. Meanwhile, the Mercenary trades a sword for a crossbow that effectively turns the entire adventure into a top-down shooter that feels very unlike any other character. For my part, I spent the majority of my time as a Witch focusing on a minions build that let my thrall do the fighting for me, so I often spent my time just supporting my undead homies and shouting words of encouragement. That’s a level of gameplay diversity I haven’t seen Path of Exile 2’s contemporaries achieve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the eyebrow-raisingly complex passive perk trees, your skill and support gem loadouts, the Atlas perk tree and Ascendancy tree (which are two endgame trees with even more effects to consider), and your overall equipment loadout, there are about a dozen extremely convoluted systems to learn if you hope to master your character, and in this case that’s great news. When you decide to play them more than casually, ARPGs are all about burying your face into horrifyingly complicated menus searching for the most powerful possible combination of stats, and Path of Exile 2 delivers on this front even more than its predecessors. It might take a while (okay, actually <em>quite a long</em> <em>while</em>) to figure out how each piece of the puzzle works, especially if you’re diving in early before the hardcore crowd gets hold of it and creates step-by-step recipes you can follow, but doing so makes for an awesome time if, like me, you’re into that terribly nerdy business. The only thing that’s a bit irritating about playing the early access version now is that not every skill tree has been finished, so you might want to chase a specific build or power, only to find out that power is still just a twinkle in the designers’ eyes. That could, for example, mean you aren’t able to purchase support skills to complement your build and take it in a different direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Path of Exile 2 definitely falls short, though, is with its loot. That’s not because the items you get are bad (finding a sceptre that let my Witch summon even more undead minions was quite nice, for example), but because it’s incredibly stingy with them. The first issue is that there seems to be no protection at all in ensuring the loot that drops is geared towards your chosen class – and even if you find stuff that is, it’s often not good or won’t work with your build since you’ll frequently require highly specific items to improve upon it. I didn’t even see a single Unique (a powerful, curated tier of items) drop until I had played for over 60 hours, and when I finally did it was a bow that my magic-focused character had no way of using. You can always trade with other players for gear you need, but it still feels pretty awful to grind your face off and not see anything worthwhile come of it, especially if you’d rather not interact with other people.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I hope loot gets at least a little more generous during early access.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, while there are a few options for taking middling items and leveling them up with new perks and higher rarities to improve your chances, these don’t come close to fixing how anticlimactic loot drops often feel, and you’ll likely find yourself using your best items long after you’ve leveled beyond them for sheer lack of alternatives. None of this should come as a surprise from fans of the first Path of Exile, as loot has always been hard to come by there as well, but it’s really something I thought Grinding Gear might address in this followup. Obviously it’s been a successful approach with the audience Path of Exile has built, but in my book that’s a pretty big miss for an ARPG, where cool loot can be a major selling point. I hope the loot dial gets turned at least a little toward the more rewarding side of things during the early access period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you plan to jump in at launch, hopefully you really enjoy your first playthrough of Path of Exile 2’s first three campaign acts, because right now you’ll have to give them a second go if you want to reach the endgame content. That’s because, instead of finishing all six acts for the early access build, Grinding Gear focused on the first three and wisely directed the rest of its attention to fleshing out the endgame so that it can be finely honed for the full launch. That was a smart choice generally speaking, but instead of letting you beat the first half of the story and immediately advance to the post-campaign grind, it instead makes you play through the whole thing twice – with no changes in the second run aside from scaled-up enemy levels – before finally granting you access to the endgame. Even though I enjoyed the story, playing it all again back to back just to reach an arbitrary character level left a bad taste in my mouth and makes things unnecessarily repetitive at the moment. It’s especially weird that the second run, called “Cruel Mode,” isn’t actually harder – in fact, it was a whole lot easier since I knew what was coming and had a far stronger build. That makes the whole second playthrough pretty monotonous. Couldn’t they have just boosted our characters and equipment to the proper level instead?</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Isometric Action Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, once you do manage to progress into the endgame, you’re in for a good time: Path of Exile 2 is surprisingly fleshed out on this front despite being quite unfinished. The main course is the Atlas, a massive, procedurally generated map that lets you explore nodes to reach objectives, including mysterious merchants, hidden boss fights, and more surprises lying in wait – it’s kind of like Diablo meets Super Mario World’s overworld map in the best way. While very similar to the original’s endgame, this version expands and improves on virtually every aspect and has been a complete blast to explore. I’ve likely only just scratched the surface after more than a dozen hours with it, but I could already see myself dumping another hundred hours into this thing. Beyond that, there are trials that pit you against special objectives and challenging modifiers to unlock powerful rewards and progress down your Ascendancy perk tree, as well as an endgame boss that serves as the final gauntlet for Path of Exile 2’s most dedicated adventurers. It’s an impressive amount of content and quite well thought out, especially for an early access game, but that’s hardly surprising given the first Path of Exile’s decade-plus of lessons learned while building upon its own endgame content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, a robust endgame hasn’t saved Path of Exile 2 from much of the usual jankiness that comes with early access games. I saw everything from the minor stuff, like framerate hiccups, to the extremely infuriating stuff, like that time a patch removed all of the skill gems, support gems, and the best weapon from my inventory, all but destroying my build and forcing me to grind much of it back. Per usual, I recommend waiting to hop in if you’re the type of person to throw their controller out the window when things don’t work as intended, as playing in early access isn’t for the faint of heart and your prized loot could vanish in an instant. It’s a testament to how good everything else is that these issues didn’t completely turn me off from continuing to play. It’s also worth mentioning that Path of Exile 2 already looks and sounds much better than its predecessor, even if it still doesn’t look nearly as good as a AAA cohort like Diablo 4 – so it’s a notable visual upgrade, but nothing that blew my socks off.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">At its early access launch, Path of Exile 2 is already shaping up to be the sequel we’ve been waiting for. Everything from the refined fundamental action-RPG gameplay to the surprisingly fleshed-out endgame has seen major improvements, and the half of the story we’ve got so far shows plenty of promise, even if the setting feels a little generic in the realm of dark fantasy worlds. The downside of playing in early access, though, is that you’ll have to slog through all three acts twice to reach the endgame, the loot game needs some major tweaking to more consistently reward us with usable items, and some mild-to-severe technical wonkiness might take the wind out of your sails if things go awry – but it’s nothing that makes me concerned for the future of this expansive sequel. Even while we wait for 1.0, Path of Exile 2 is already a stellar way to lose dozens of hours and a clear leap forward for the series.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of the frustration stemmed from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League <em>not</em> being another Batman game from Rocksteady, despite being set within the Arkhamverse. The developer’s single-player Arkham series is much-loved by fans, with 2011’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-city"><u>Batman: Arkham City</u></a> in particular held up as one of the greatest, if not <em>the</em> greatest, superhero video games of all time. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, on the other hand, is a live service third-person shooter in which Batman is a villain. Soon after the game's February 2024 release, publisher Warner Bros. admitted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>the failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League contributed to a $200 million hit to revenue</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In June, Warner Bros. told IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-will-complete-its-currently-announced-roadmap-but-warner-bros-quiet-on-what-happens-after"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League would see out its first year of support</u></a>, but declined to comment on what happens afterwards. Deathstroke and Season 4 are the culmination of that first year, which has also seen the release of DLC characters Joker, Mrs. Freeze, and Lawless. Is this it for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League? IGN has asked Warner Bros. for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a> reported that staff at Rocksteady were currently working on a director’s cut of the phenomenally successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy"><u>Hogwarts Legacy</u></a>, while leadership pitched a return to single-player following its live service misstep.

			<p>Over the years, Path of Exile has become the action role-playing game to play for those looking for a truly hardcore experience. The game by Grinding Gear Games grants players almost complete control over characters, providing players with tons of customization options and almost complete freedom to create their builds. As such, it wasn't surprising to see the ARPG community getting really excited about the announcement of Path of Exile 2, as right from the get-go, it looked like it would address some of the issues of its predecessor while ramping up everything that makes it such a hardcore and engaging experience.</p>
<p>A few months back, I had the chance to check out Path of Exile 2 during <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-gamescom-hands-on-preview-improvements-aplenty/">Gamescom 2024</a>, and I was thoroughly impressed by its gigantic passive skill tree, the new Mercenary class, which almost turns the experience into a top-down twin-stick shooter, the customization options that involve both the character and skills, and most of all, the versatility of these options. My demo playthrough was rather short, essentially covering the first 40 minutes or so of the first act, but it definitely left me hungering for more.</p>
<p>All my positive impressions of Path of Exile 2 were pretty much confirmed in my time, with the Early Access version now available on PC and consoles after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-date-gets-pushed-back-by-three-weeks/">three-week delay</a>. While the game is sure to change a lot until the 1.0 version release, the experience already delivers the promise of a modernized take on the original's formula.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Path-of-Exile-Screenshot-2024.12.02-17.34.14.94-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Right after selecting your character's class among Warrior, Ranger, Mercenary, Sorceress, Monk, and Witch, all featuring two Ascendancy Classes for further customization, players are thrown straight back into Wraeclast, 20 years after the events of the original campaign where the main characters went on a god-killing spree, leaving humanity alone to clean up the consequences and begin life anew. Needless to say, things haven't been going too well for humanity, as the world is far from being right. Among those who have suffered from the evil that is still being done in Wraeclast is the player-controlled exile, who was sentenced to death for an unknown reason by the Count of Ogham. After narrowly escaping their death sentence, this exile eventually travels back to their village to confront the Count, all the while meeting a variety of individuals who also suffered at his hands and at the monstrosities he had unleashed on the land in his bid for power.</p>
<p>After confronting the Count, the exile will get to learn more about the mysteries surrounding him, embarking on an adventure that, sadly, cannot yet be experienced in full as the Early Access release only features the first three of the six acts of the complete campaign. From this small portion of the entire adventure, however, it is clear how the developer is doing an excellent job expanding the lore of and history of Wraeclast, convincingly creating a dark and haunting atmosphere that permeates the world, with narration and visuals, powered by a new graphics engine which also allows the gameplay to reach new heights.</p>
<p>This new graphics engine made it possible for Grinding Gear Games to address one of the most common complaints in the original Path of Exile: combat. In Path of Exile 2, fighting both mobs and bosses is extremely satisfying, as players have way more control over their offensive and defensive options, both of them covered by certain skills such as the Warrior's Grand Slam and the Ranger's Escape Shot. Among the defensive options featured in the game is also a simple dodge roll maneuver with no cooldown that allows the exile to roll out of the way and prevent getting damaged. The introduction of this evasive maneuver was pretty much a necessity, given how much enemy design has increased in complexity, especially for bosses.</p>
<p>The battles against these powerful enemies are one of the highlights of the experience, as each boss I have encountered featured complex and varied movesets that required me to always be on my toes to avoid getting defeated and being sent back to the last checkpoint. From huge warriors armed with likewise huge weapons to worms spewing poison to ancient beings slinging elemental spells left and right, Path of Exile 2 truly seems to have it all. Better yet, the challenge level is generally pretty high, forcing players not only to hone their skills and learn to use the new mechanics appropriately but also to take a deeper look at the customization options. The original is somewhat known for being a "problem-solving" game where players must take a good look at every option the game offers to overcome obstacles, and the same can definitely be said about Path of Exile 2, which already offers a massive wealth of options even in its very first release.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Path-of-Exile-Screenshot-2024.12.02-17.36.03.76-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The aforementioned six available classes are literally only the beginning of the journey, in terms of buildcrafting. Focusing on either one or two stats, the classes only determine the starting stats, the place where the player begins on the massive skill tree, and the starting equipment and skill found in the tutorial area. Once past this small area, the game opens up in terms of customization options, allowing the exiles to use every weapon, piece of gear, and skill in the game if their stats allow for it. The flexibility of the system is well-represented not only by the ability to increase any of the core stats - Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence - by unlocking specific nodes on the skill tree but also by the overhauling of the Skill system of the original Path of Exile. Instead of requiring slots on weapons, it is now possible to equip skills obtained after carving Skill Gems in dedicated slots that are available regardless of the currently equipped gear.</p>
<p>In addition, each Skill can be further customized with Support Gems that grant different effects, such as elemental buildup, wider ranger, and so on. All these support abilities have a cost in terms of stats, so it is only possible to equip a certain number of them, which varies depending on the stat they require. A mechanic that, in conjunction with the gear system, further deepens character customization. The gear system is essentially the same as in the original, featuring all sorts of items with different rarity levels that can be a little difficult to manage due to the unchanged inventory system that fills up pretty quickly, forcing players to return to their current main base to stash items in excess.</p>
<p>Customizing characters and skills is all well and good, but it would mean nothing if classes weren't fun to play, or skills satisfying to use. Again, being in Early Access, the game balance is going to change a lot over time, but in this initial version, there's no doubt that Path of Exile 2 is a fun game to play, no matter the class, although some may be more fun to use than others, depending on personal preference. Liking to go face-to-face with enemies, I picked the Warrior first, but I wasn't exactly feeling the class at the beginning, as I did not like some of the low-level skills available. Once I learned some additional skills and some effective ways to combine them, the class became more fun to use. Other classes, like the Mercenary and the Monk, on the other hand, felt more fun to use right from the start, especially the Monk with his elemental abilities with very different ranges, which make the class pretty versatile in all sorts of situations. Experimentation will be key in Path of Exile 2 for a very long time to discover some effective builds and skill combos, and thankfully, it shouldn't be too difficult to do so, as it is possible to reset the entire passive skill tree easily a few hours into the first act.</p>
<p>While combat and customization mechanics are already extremely solid, the same cannot exactly be said for maps. While they are rather big, the biggest of them requiring more than 15 minutes to explore fully, they are a little empty as of now, only featuring enemies of the common and rare variety and the occasional treasure chest. More events and quests going beyond the fetch quest type would help the experience a lot, but as of now, there isn't anything else to do on maps other than destroy the hordes of enemies that assail the exile.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Path-of-Exile-Screenshot-2024.12.02-17.13.53.33-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As described above, Path of Exile 2 can feel a little daunting, especially for those used to much simpler ARPGs. Thankfully, players looking into getting into the series for the first time won't have to worry too much about min-maxing their characters or going for the meta builds that will surely develop in the future, as the campaign, while definitely challenging, can be completed without delving too deep into the game's customization mechanics, giving them the chance to understand all of its intricacies more before going through the first three acts of the campaign again at increased difficulty and the endgame where the possibilities of the mechanics will be stretched the furthest. The amazing controller implementation also makes the game very easy to get into.</p>
<p>Being in Early Access, every aspect of Path of Exile 2 will inevitably improve over time, but as a starting point, the first public release of the game is solid enough in terms of visuals and performance. Simply put, the game is one of the best-looking ARPGs to date, featuring incredibly diverse locations enhanced by the global illumination system which also improves its dark atmosphere greatly, and very detailed character models. Great attention has been placed on animations as well, and it shows, as all characters are smoothly animated, making using skills or dodging enemy attacks feel way more satisfying than in the original.</p>
<p>Supporting all three major upscalers - NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, Intel XeSS - as well as NIS, Path of Exile 2 provides all the options players need to get the game running decently on their machines. At 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS at the Quality setting, Frame Generation, and the settings below, the game generally ran at above 100 FPS even with multiple enemies on screen on the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM). The framerate can only be capped at up to 120 FPS as of now, so it is not possible to go beyond this target, but still, it should be more than enough for everyone for this type of game.</p>

<p>While there haven't been many technical issues on the client side in my around 20 hours with Path of Exile 2, besides some random crashes at the start of the game that forced me to boot it up a few times before finally going through the log-in process, I have experienced some server-side issues, including some performance hiccups with rubber banding issues, and inability to create a new instance, which prevented me from entering new areas unless I logged out and back in. As the servers are likely going to be hammered by players in the first few days after launch, I would expect these issues to be somewhat common, although Grinding Gear Games has promised to be ready for what is likely to be a very successful launch.</p>
<p>Featuring only the first three acts of the full campaign and only half of the classes that will be available in time for the 1.0 release, it is not possible to say at the time if Path of Exile 2 will indeed deliver all of its promises. The Early Access version, however, made it clear how Grinding Gear Games has a very strong idea of how to evolve the formula of its predecessor to deliver an experience that is, undoubtedly, very fun at all skill levels. Considering how the game manages to be both extremely welcoming and extremely deep at the same time, I have no doubt that Path of Exile 2 will only get better from here on out, having the potential to become one of the best action role-playing games ever released.</p>
