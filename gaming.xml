<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight’s reveal at Gamescom 2025 has ignited a wealth of excitement for the upcoming title from TT Games, and we’ve gathered everything we know about the release date.</p>



<p>Revealed as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next LEGO title from TT Games</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight impressed us during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, although some eyebrows have been raised with marketing stating that there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only seven playable characters</a> in the game.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty to be revealed about LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, and, if you want to begin your countdown to release, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-a-release-date">Does LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have a Release Date?</h2>

<p><strong>No, a precise release date for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has not been shared by TT Games.</strong></p>



<p>After being revealed at Gamescom, it’s understandable that players are keen to know exactly when they will be able to get their hands on the title, but there’s going to be a bit of a wait before those details become available.</p>



<p>In fact, don’t expect a precise release date to be shared this year, given the release window that has been issued is pretty broad.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-window">What is The LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Release Window?</h2>



<p><strong>TT Games announced at Gamescom, following the reveal of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, that the release window for the title is 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike many other games, no specific month or season for <a href="https://warnerbrosgames.com/article/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>‘s launch has been shared, resulting in a pretty broad window, but there are some trends that could be followed.</p>



<p>For example, Grand Theft Auto 6 is looming large in 2026 with a release date in May, and most, if not all, developers will want to avoid going head-to-head against the titan, giving it is expected to be one of the biggest gaming launches of all time.</p>



<p>Although LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was released in April 2022, that was an outlier in TT Games’ history, as, traditionally, releases have come in May/June or September/October/November.</p>



<p>In 2018, LEGO: DC Super-Villains was released in October, while in 2017, LEGO: Marvel Superheroes 2 was released in November. Going back further, LEGO Dimensions was released in September 2015, and LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham was released in November 2014.</p>



<p>Though that doesn’t clear the release window up exactly, it does mean that TT Games’ previous schedule suggests we won’t see LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight in the first half of 2026.</p>

                <p>Battlestate Games has been developing its intense first-person tactical shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov/" data-ref-id="5000-673440">Escape From Tarkov</a> since 2012. Although the closed beta debuted in 2017, players had no idea when to expect the full release. Now, Battlestate Games has shared a new live-action Escape From Tarkov trailer that confirms its exit from early access this fall.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpeLk_OJ9-M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpeLk_OJ9-M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The November 15 release date was revealed in the closing seconds of the video above.

Presumably it will have some story content as well as refined maps, weapons, and quality-of-life improvements. But absent any firm details from Battlestate Games, we can only speculate.</p><p>Battlestate Games has kept a community of Escape From Tarkov players together for over eight years. However, there have been some issues that caused friction between the studio and its fans. After releasing a $150 Edge of Darkness limited edition that was said to include all future DLC, Battlestate Games released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov-arena/" data-ref-id="5000-450666">Escape From Tarkov: Arena</a> and the game’s PvE mode as a separate $250 purchase. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-escape-from-tarkov-edition-locks-pve-behind-250-paywall/1100-6522990/" data-ref-id="1100-6522990">a backlash against the studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-boss-didnt-expect-players-to-get-mad-about-paid-pve-content/1100-6523084/" data-ref-id="1100-6523084">a subsequent apology from Battlestate Games</a> came with a promise to let Edge of Darkness owners access the PvE mode as well.</p><p>Escape From Tarkov is only available to play on PC and can be found on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/escape-from-tarkov-arena-d3e23b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

                <p>2025 has already been a banner year for Nightdive Studios, the team behind the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock-2/" data-ref-id="5000-278">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/heretic-plus-hexen/" data-ref-id="5000-689540">Heretic + Hexen</a> remaster. The studio has made its name by giving classic games a modern coat of paint. One of the titles that Nightdive Studios CEO Stephen Kick is still eager to get his hands on is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem/" data-ref-id="5000-2569">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a>, which has only ever been released on GameCube back in 2002.</p><p>Kick shared his desire to revisit Eternal Darkness during a recent appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRbxQmqRenc&amp;t=431s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shacknews </a>(via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nightdives-ceo-reiterates-desire-to-remaster-eternal-darkness" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a>). But since the rights to the game are fully owned by Nintendo, it may never get an official re-release.</p><p>"[Eternal Darkness has] been kinda locked behind the GameCube/Nintendo wall all this time, and it's something that I would personally love to see get re-released," Kick said. </p><p>Silicon Knights developed Eternal Darkness, which was the first M-rated game published by Nintendo. Although the game wasn't considered a survival-horror title, it did have horror elements and a unique way of messing with players through sanity effects that were meant to break the fourth wall.</p><p>Eternal Darkness director Denis Dyack made multiple attempts to develop a spiritual sequel called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/shadow-of-the-eternals/" data-ref-id="false">Shadow of the Eternals</a>. However, two separate crowdfunding initiatives fell short and production of the game was ultimately shut down.</p><p>Kick has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-remake-dev-is-trying-very-hard-to-rev/1100-6480003/" data-ref-id="1100-6480003">previously shared his desire</a> to revive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-operative-no-one-lives-forever/" data-ref-id="5000-2505">The Operative: No One Lives Forever</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-one-lives-forever-2-a-spy-in-harms-way/" data-ref-id="5000-3854">No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way</a>. During the Shacknews interview, Kick reiterated that those games remain a priority for him. However, the rights to that franchise have been difficult to untangle for the last two decades.</p><p>Nightdive's next release, Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster, will hit Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on November 20.</p>

                <p>Gearbox Software's Randy Pitchford has predicted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> will push the franchise's total sales numbers to a new stratosphere: 100 million units. Speaking to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Pitchford said plainly, "We will break 100 million units with this launch, easily, all in, with the franchise."</p><p>That's not actually a very bold prediction. The series currently stands at <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4caa8ce3-9cd2-45d5-b267-593e2391801f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 94 million units</a>, so Pitchford is predicting sales of at least 6 million for Borderlands 4. By comparison, Borderlands 3 sold more than 23 million copies and is 2K's fastest-selling game ever. The top-selling game of all time for 2K is Borderlands 2, which has achieved sales of more than 30 million units.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - 20 Minutes of Siren Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p>Not many video game franchises have reached 100 million units sold. If Borderlands 4 can help push the series to that level, Borderlands would join the likes of GTA, Red Dead, Pokemon, Call of Duty, Minecraft, Final Fantasy, and Assassin's Creed.</p><p>Pitchford said in the interview that when he was first trying to sell Borderlands, he had to "scream from the tallest mountain to get anyone to pay attention to it." Back then, Pitchford said "nobody cared" about Borderlands and that, "A lot of people predicted that Borderlands wasn't going to work."</p><p>Prior to Borderlands coming on the scene in 2009, Gearbox was better known for the WW2 FPS series Brothers in Arms, along with Half-Life expansion packs. Borderlands became a gigantic success, and the franchise remains strong.</p><p>"We went from an industry that predicted that we would die--that Borderlands would find no audience--to being one of the leading video game franchises in the world. And it's kind of humbling, frankly, to be a part of it," Pitchford told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-the-game-industry-once-expected-a-genre-experiment-like-borderlands-to-die-but-it-actually-became-one-of-the-leading-video-game-franchises-in-the-world-its-kind-of-humbling/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar.</a></p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with a Switch 2 edition coming in October. A major point of online discussion about Borderlands 4 has been its price--which is $70. Pitchford said the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-would-still-be-worth-it-at-5x-the-price-gearbox-boss-says/1100-6534143/" data-ref-id="1100-6534143">delivers so much value that it would still be worth it if 2K charged $350.</a></p>

<p>And it's looking gooey</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It only feels like yesterday that Bloober Team confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> would be launching on the Switch 2. Yet here we are, merely a couple of weeks from its <strong>5th September</strong> release, and the lovely Felix has gone hands-on with the title during his stint at Gamescom (yes, Felix said it's out on the 4th, but it's been a very busy week for him).</p>
<p>Despite some initial confusion around his appointment, Felix got to spend a decent chunk of time with Cronos and came away feeling pretty good about the whole thing. The demo showcased some solid survival horror gameplay in which creepy creatures would merge with corpses to form all new types of monstrosities, all of which are simply <em>begging</em> to be put out of their misery.</p>
<p>It's important to note with the Switch version that the game runs at 30fps with some key visual downgrades when compared to the likes of the PC and PS5. That said, it still looks pretty decent, and Bloober Team's fantastic work on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake gives us high hopes for this one.</p>
<p>If you're more keen on checking out some direct-feed gameplay with no commentary, then good news, because we also have that for you just below. Enjoy!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">DICE has outlined what it's learned — and what it's changing — following the open beta test for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With "tens of thousands connecting on Discord to play together, over 600,000 hours streamed, and over 30 million hours watched," the Battlefield team said it would "like to take a moment to look back at the recent Open Beta to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwddm7/battlefield_6_community_update_open_beta_debrief/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">share our key learnings</a> and in-game changes we’re making based on your feedback and in-game data," including tweaks to weapons, movement, maps, modes, player counts, and playlist options.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps one of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwdur5/movement_will_be_changed_for_the_final_release/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>biggest complaints from players</u></a> was around movement mechanics, particularly the speed of movement, and moving out of a slide into a jump. DICE says it's now "adjusting" this "to create a more balanced and traditional Battlefield experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Momentum, especially horizontal speed, carried from a slide into a jump has been reduced," the team wrote. "There is now a greater penalty for consecutive jumps, which lowers jump height when jumps are spammed. Firing while jumping or sliding will result in increased inaccuracy. These changes are designed to make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights, and will contribute to a gameplay pace that rewards skillful movement without becoming too fast or unpredictable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Parachute physics have also been re-tuned, with reduced initial acceleration when opening the parachute for more controlled aerial movement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team was also keen for you to know that it heard your "strong feedback" about larger-scale maps, and says that while the Open Beta intentionally featured smaller, more fast-paced maps, "larger-scale maps are already part of our package, delivering action-packed gameplay and memorable, unique moments for every player." As Battlefield Labs continues — that's the closed test available to select players who sign an NDA — it'll introduce two new multiplayer maps: one set in Mirak Valley, the other a remake of the fan-favorite from Battlefield 3, Operation Firestorm. These two maps "include the full complement of vehicles, like Liberation Peak, along with a more vast combat space." Details about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/much-bigger-battlefield-6-maps-leak-online-following-datamine"><u>Mirak, you may remember, leaked earlier this week</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course, the studio is looking at feedback on modes, too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-knows-you-dont-like-rush-mode-and-has-already-cut-mcom-timers-by-33"><u>DICE recently made changes to Rush mode after a negative response from fans</u></a>, noting "the conversation we observed wasn’t just about player count, but also about how maps play, and the tactical experience they offer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who aren't aware, Rush was initially known as Gold Rush in Bad Company, where matches typically ranged from 12v12 to 16v16 players. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve experimented with larger player counts over the years, such as 64- and even 128-player versions. While these matches created intense, fast-paced moments, they also led to issues: Overwhelming defenses, stalled frontlines, and too many games ending in the first sector," DICE explained. "Rush is especially sensitive to higher player counts due to its tactical and strategic requirements; when a player tries to arm the M-COM while more than 20 opponents are defending, the intended gameplay becomes less tangible. Based on feedback throughout recent titles, we’re lowering the default player count for Rush to improve the flow of combat and restore the tactical, methodical experience that defines the mode."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who enjoy a "large-scale" Rush, however, will still be able to "experiment" with different player counts via the Portal from launch. "Finding the right balance is an ongoing process as everyone gets familiar with map size, lanes, and combat spaces," the team added. "For now, we’ve found that 8v8 provides a solid starting point for small-scale, fast-paced modes like Team Death Match, Squad Death Match, Domination, and KOTH."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With the insights gathered during the Open Beta play sessions, we will be introducing in-game adjustments in upcoming Battlefield Labs events. Stay tuned for progress updates and future opportunities to get involved," the team concluded. "Lastly, thanks again for joining the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. Your feedback and participation made it an incredible experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're having a great time with what we've played so far, writing in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer"><u>Battlefield 6 review-in-progress</u></a>: "We are still in the beta period, but I’m already having an absolute blast with Battlefield 6’s multiplayer. The action is sublime, with a cinematic quality to the constantly raining debris that is enhanced by how legitimately effective it is to take strategic advantage of that destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Right now, even in beta form, Battlefield 6 might be the most fun shooter I’ve played this year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't forget that from now until October 7 — Battlefield 6's launch day — EA has a "wave of content" planned for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-2042"><u>Battlefield 2042</u></a>, including a free new pass "celebrating the legacy of Battlefield," new hardware, and a reimagining of the fan favorite Iwo Jima map. As you progress through the 'Road to Battlefield 6' pass, you can expect 50 "exclusive cross-rewards," including 20 for Battlefield 6 that will be ready for you on launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

<p>Docked and loaded</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Earlier this week, we were lucky enough to head to the Nintendo booth at Gamescom and go <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">hands-on</a> with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> on Switch 2. Bandai Namco didn't allow any footage to be recorded from our handheld session (and we quickly saw why), but it seems such recording rules are not in place at Canada's <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/">Fan Expo</a>, which kicked off yesterday and was allowing over-the-shoulder recording of the docked demos.</p>
<p>One visitor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MDee14">MDee14</a>, recorded footage of their entire play session and has quickly shared it online, giving us our first proper look at how this thing runs when the Switch 2 is up on a big screen. Fortunately, it looks better than the handheld offering seems to be.</p>
<p>The video (above) shows the attendee's entire preview session, from the opening tutorial section to some early exploration around Limgrave. The performance is far from what you'd expect to see on a PS5, but it seems to hold up <em>pretty</em> well, with the noticeable drops coming from big sequences like the opening of the Limgrave gate. Things seem okay otherwise, but let's bear in mind that this kind of over-the-shoulder footage isn't always the best way to see every little detail.</p>
<p>Our brief hands-on time with the game in handheld told a very different story. It looks like docked mode might be the way to go with this one (at least, in whatever build is being shown in expos at the moment), as our handheld play was plagued with hefty frame drops and stutters a-plenty — though no capture was allowed for these sessions, naturally.</p>
<p>We're still waiting on a release date for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, but let's hope that we don't have too long to wait before we can see the launch performance really put through its paces.</p>

<p>
Ahead of release, Glowmade has stressed the game is not pay-to-win, with all purchases being optional cosmetics, and doesn't include any form of random monetisation like loot boxes.
</p>
<p>
Future updates will also be free for those with the base game, though post-launch content is yet to be divulged.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, for those intrigued, a technical test will run this weekend from 23rd - 24th August on all three platforms - simply search for the game on your platform of choice.

            <title><![CDATA[Rogue Point Preview – When tactical shooting goes rogue…]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/22/rogue-point-preview-when-tactical-shooting-goes-rogue/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rogue-point-preview-%E2%80%93-when-tactical-shooting-goes-rogue%E2%80%A6.1278024/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s something special about tactical shooters that the more hyperactive likes of Call of Duty and Battlefield simply can’t match. The tension of knowing that every corner and doorway could hold a swift end to your mission, the close camaraderie of working through a scenario with friends, the elation of coming out on top. Now blend that, in a somewhat lightened form, with the brinksmanship of a roguelite and you’ve got Rogue Point.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rogue Point | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yy039nGgwj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coming from the team behind Black Mesa, the four player tactical action of Rogue Point is a rather different project for Crowbar Collective. To be clear, this isn’t a hard-nosed tactical shooter in the vein of classic Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon and modern Ready or Not, but it holds onto that same general tone and mission structure in a way that should appeal to the same audience, just with the need to string successful missions together and the threat of losing everything and starting over.</p>


<p>There’s some neat touches in the planning phase: as a mission map is presented to you, highlighting the objective areas that you’ll need to scour — naturally these are randomised alongside the enemy placement — and you’re able to doodle and draw to quickly plan out a mission. I’ve no doubt that, after 3 or 4 stages, these discussions could get very serious.</p>
<p>Alongside that, there’s loadout adjustments, but being a roguelite naturally imposes some restrictions here. You’ll only have a limited initial pool of cash to spend on guns and gear initially, with more kit coming through both run and metagame unlocks. You do have an option to gamble though, dropping $500 on a mystery crate that could be just what you want or force you into a different playstyle and role.</p>


<p>Naturally you want to try and have loadouts and builds that compliment one another, but there’s a great co-op feature in the form of backpack items. Instead of tucking things like health kits away in your pocket for you and only you to use and activate, here they are held in your backpack, and anyone and everyone on your squad and wander up and grab something they need.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s also that sharing spirit between missions. If you die on a mission but your teammates are able to complete it, you will have lost all the gear you took in, but they’ll be fully equipped. To try and get you back up to speed, your group can share their inventory, helping even out your builds again.</p>
<p>A lot of a tactical shooter’s vibe relies on the quality of the AI, and Rogue Point’s exhibits different characteristics and behaviours. The standard grunts will blast away and take cover where necessary, but berserker AI will just rush you and close the gap. Heavies are the more armoured foes, but the most interesting is the lookouts, who will be keen to retreat and back away from you. How you approach them is vital, and end with a face full of lead if you mess up, as kicking down a door will require three hefty kicks alerting anyone on the other side in the process.</p>

<p>There’s always a tricky balance to strike between accuracy, aggressiveness and other traits, which Crowbar Collective will tweak right up to and after release. From what we saw at Gamescom, it looks to be quite forgiving to start with, at least. Health kits will a literal lifesaver, but you can probably take a couple more hits than in Ready or Not.</p>
<p>Each mission builds up to an extraction after successfully completing the main objectives, where you have that tense wait and defensive action to hold on until you can get away. Here the game can spawn in more enemies to spice things up again, though I do wonder if this could be over-egging the pudding.</p>
<p>The challenge of each roguelite run will escalate as you complete stages and missions, and you have a set number of mission failures before it’s game over. They can break down levels into smaller areas for early missions, so perhaps just the lower floor of the oil rig, as opposed to the full complex. Add to that the player choice between what missions you take on, with a higher challenge rating promising greater bonuses at the end, and there’s some real risk and reward here.</p>
<p>Rogue Point is a really fascinating blend of tactical shooter and roguelite — two styles of game that, the more I think about it, have a lot of common ground. I’m keen to see how it all comes together as it heads to Steam Early Access later this year.</p>

<p>"I hoped it would be you, little brother"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Netflix has debuted its teaser trailer for the upcoming second season of <strong>Devil May Cry</strong>, the animated adaptation of Capcom's acclaimed action series.</p>
<p>Due for release in <strong>2026</strong>, the anime is seemingly putting the spotlight on Dante's brother, Virgil, setting up a big showdown between the two character's following the latter's last-minute appearance in the previous season.</p>
<p>It's unclear how much time has passed since the first season, but you can see that Dante himself is sporting slightly longer locks while rocking the more traditional, long-sleeved red trench coat. Pretty badass.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it's now been over six years since the last mainline game title, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/devil_may_cry_5">Devil May Cry 5</a>, launched in 2019, with a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/devil_may_cry_5_special_edition">Special Edition</a> following in 2020. We're hopeful that a Switch 2 port may crop up at some point, but with veteran director <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/capcoms-hideaki-itsuno-leaves-after-30-years-starts-new-role-in-september">Hideaki Itsuno leaving Capcom in 2024</a>, it's unclear at this stage what the future holds regarding brand new entries.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> has brought back the secret Guy Savage mode within the remake. But it turns out this mode wasn't made by Konami alone - Platinum Games (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, Astral Chain) is responsible for the surprise action minigame.</p>
<p>The Guy Savage mode can be played by saving the game and exiting to the menu directly after the torture scene deep into the game. When you re-launch the game, the Guy Savage minigame will start. Alternatively, beat the game and the minigame will be accessible.</p>
<p>Guy Savage was originally based on a <a href="https://x.com/Arc_Hound/status/1054458915851788289">cancelled prototype for Zone of the Enders 3 / Anubis 2</a> which was snuck into the original Metal Gear Solid 3. In Delta, <em>every</em> little Easter egg and trick has been recreated. The same goes for minigames, with Snake vs Monkey coming back (with a surprise appearance from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>).</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is an incredibly faithful recreation of the original game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">Eurogamer's review states</a>: "Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is faithful, it's a church dedicated to one of gaming's best stealth games. Updates to how the game plays are subtle, and in regard to the new gameplay style, totally optional. So much is left untouched, and that's for the best. Add in some original art, some obscure modes, and let her loose."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong is rapidly approaching a conclusion after a release date for the title was finally announced after years of waiting.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4</a>, bringing an end to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">years of development</a>, and the desire to get hands-on with the game is understandable, with our verdict being that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong is worth the wait</a>.</p>



<p>Now, players around the world are preparing for the launch and want to know if pre-orders are available, which we’ve got all the details for here.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-available-to-pre-order">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Available to Pre-Order?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ready? Image via Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> <strong>is not currently available to pre-order or purchase on any storefront.</strong></p>



<p>With the long-awaited release date of the title on the horizon, the desire to secure a copy of Hollow Knight: Silksong is understandable. However, for the time being at least, you’ll need to be patient for a little while longer for pre-order details to emerge.</p>



<p>None of the platforms where Hollow Knight: Silksong is currently available has pre-orders listed. However, those with an Xbox Game Pass subscription can add the title to their ‘Play Later’ section, which should pre-download the full game before release.</p>



<p>That will likely change as the release date of September 4 edges closer, so keep an eye out for pre-order details to emerge.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-preload-hollow-knight-silksong">Can You Preload Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<p><strong>Preloading Hollow Knight: Silksong is not currently available on any platform, though this will likely change as the release date approaches.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, storefronts do not currently have Hollow Knight: Silksong listed and available to purchase, which means that preloading the title is also out of the question for the time being.</p>



<p>The closest option to preloading currently available is through the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9n116v0599hb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft store</a>, which has a ‘Get Game Pass’ button beneath the title alongside a note that confirms the title is “coming soon to Game Pass.” If you already have Game Pass, clicking this option will provide details of your subscription.</p>



<p>Preloading Hollow Knight: Silksong in full should be an available option provided before the launch period, and, with less than two weeks until the title releases at the time of writing, it shouldn’t be a long wait.</p>



<p>Will Hollow Knight: Silksong live up to the hype and be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

You cannot pick a difficulty like past games. We've baked it in because you have to approach a co-op campaign differently, and we wanted to make sure the missions felt right for solo players — we're not forgetting about you, we love you — but also because it is a social experience we want to make sure it's fun, but the right amount of challenging for two, three, and four players as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, no more veteran-level runs for single-player fans in this year's Call of Duty.

And yet, I am <em>obsessed</em> with developer SCS Software's Truck Simulator series of games. And so, following the news both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> and Euro Truck Simulator 2 are at long last making their way to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, I'm here to convince you their soothing expanses of endless virtual highway might also be for you, even if you don't know your backhaul from your bill of lading.
</p>
<p>
The downside to this whole not-being-into-trucks thing is, of course, that I'm a terrible guide through the series if you're here for proper hobbyist reasons, so apologies in advance. For me, though, the appeal is not so much the allure of a Hopper Body and the promise of a lubricated Glad Hand, as it is the pure ASMR pleasures of hours spent in empty minded tranquility with naught for company but the swoosh of scenic vistas, the tick of an indicator, the quiet hum of an air-conditioned cabin, and the lulling rumble of rubber on road.
</p>
<p>
I'm being a little reductive, admittedly. Well, a lot actually. Even without delving deep into the Truck Simulator games' more specialist particulars, there's a lot to love. There's the fundamental progression system that sees you doing odd jobs in loaned trucks and then scrambling up the XP tree to unlock new missions, or stockpiling enough cash that you're able to buy your own truck, even start your own business with your own HQ. It's not necessarily a particularly flashy package, but its basic structure is sound enough that it provides an additional layer of focus to your life on the open road. Chuck in the kind of cabin customisation that lets you scatter tatty souvenirs and pizza boxes around the place (honestly, I love this kind of nonsense), occasional community events, and a multiplayer mode enabling up to eight friends to form a convoy - a wonderfully, surprisingly hilarious recipe for chaos with the right (or wrong, depending on your perspective) people - and it's brilliantly compelling, even if you don't give a truck about trailers and the like.

<p>
As for the different flavours of sim coming to Xbox and PlayStation, both - if you're not already aware - are fundamentally the same experience, just with a very obvious change of scenery between them. Personally, I'm far more partial to the big skies and breathtaking wilderness of American Truck Simulator than its European counterpart (the sheer uncanny weirdness of ETS2's deeply unconvincing UK expansion was a bit of a turn-off when I tried it a fair few years back), but your mileage - no pun intended - will almost certainly vary.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/08/in-case-you-missed-it-future-games-show.html">SCS' Truck Simulator console announcement</a> is almost completely devoid of specifics, so pretty much all we can say with certainty right now is that ATS and ETS 2 are on the way. I'd assume both will be pretty close to their PC counterparts (minus, perhaps, extended peripheral support and mod availability), especially after all the work SCS has done to improve controller support and upgrade the interface over time. It will, though, be interesting to see how the studio handles the games' years of paid cosmetic, truck, and map expansion DLC. A couple of free packs-ins to help consoles catch up? Starter bundles? Nothing of the sort? Time will reveal all.
</p>
<p>
So there you go; American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 are finally making their way to Xbox Series X/S and PS5. And if the thought of the open road and an endless shifting horizon stirs even the faintest twinge of latent yearning, you'd do well to lean in. You too might discover a love for a virtual four-wheeled life of adventure hitherto unknown.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>'s eighteenth season launches next week and is bringing a Persona 5 crossover alongside a brand new hero.
</p>
<p>
The trailer for Season 18 ends with a tease of Joker from Atlus' beloved JRPG, who will likely appear as a skin for an existing hero. No further details are known at present, but hopefully more character skins and references will make their way into Blizzard's shooter.
</p>
<p>
The new hero joining this season is Wuyang, a Chinese "aquatic prodigy" who fights with a Xuanwu Staff and various water abilities as a support character.

<p>What could it be..?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Acclaim, which was revived earlier this year after more than two decades of dormancy, is teasing some sort of announcement for next week.</p>
<p>It's tough to know exactly what this entails at this stage, and the only clue within the above tease is a very quick cut to show some sort of digital, demonic face with power symbols surrounding it. We've screenshotted this and included it below for your perusal. Any ideas..?</p>
<p>Within its PR release, Acclaim promises "big things to come" and is supposedly hard at work on its "mission to bring players unforgettable, lasting experiences that will keep them coming back for more".</p>
<p>Sounds intriguing, at least. We're not expecting big name franchises at this early stage of Acclaim's revival, but we'll be sure to keep an eye on the upcoming teaser and let you know how things shake out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals developers have lifted the lid on the matchmaking system used in the title following a wrath of criticism from players.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, NetEase confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals does not use the controversial EOMM</a> matchmaking system and promised to explain how matchmaking works in a future video.</p>



<p>That video has now been shared, detailing the process of matchmaking and explaining why larger party groups of four-to-six players have been banned in higher ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-matchmaking-explained">Marvel Rivals Matchmaking, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots of detail. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the video <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1958627668536311945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter), it was explained that several factors are taken into account when queuing for matches, including team composition and your competitive score—the latter calculated by Base Points and Performance Points.</p>



<p>Base Points depend on the outcome of the match, your current competitive score, and the average competitive score of the enemy team. Performance Points, meanwhile, reflect how well you perform in the match, but this doesn’t just tally up stats from the game due to the variety of characters.</p>



<p>The longer you wait for a match, the broader the search will become. When fighting in a part, you’ll only fight against similar-sized parties.</p>



<p>Questions have been asked on why Rivals has not introduced role-based matchmaking to the game, and the answer is that it would result in longer queue times. Similarly, that’s why four-player and six-player teams at higher ranks have also been restricted in a recent update.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> studio Team Cherry already has plans for DLC, with extra content planned in the months and years to come.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-release-date-out-next-month">release date was announced for the sequel</a> after seven years in development. Co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen spoke to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> about creating Silksong, and what's coming next.
</p>
<p>
"Launching it is obviously quite exciting," said Pellen. "What comes after for us is equally as exciting."

<p>
"The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next," added Gibson. "We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it."
</p>
<p>
Despite its lengthy development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">Silksong hasn't been in development hell</a>. Instead, hype for the sequel snowballed, resulting in sales of the original game skyrocketing. In turn, this provided the financial freedom for Team Cherry to take its time.
</p>
<p>
Hollow Knight Silksong will be released on 4th September, across PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass).

<p>The latest set coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket has leaked ahead of an official reveal, showing that the legendary beasts of Johto will be the main focus.</p>



<p>Leaks for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new set have been rather consistent and accurate, detailing what players can expect ahead of time before an official reveal takes place.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s A4a set, set to release next week, follows on from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-a4-card-set-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wisdom of Sea and Sky A4 set</a> released last month and is once again focused on the second generation of Pokémon.</p>

<p>In a leaked trailer <a href="https://x.com/UniteVids/status/1958758609996714277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter), pack art featuring Suicune was ripped open to reveal a host of new cards, including Suicune ex, before a transition to a volcano environment where Entei ex appeared. Then, Raikou ex made an appearance.</p>



<p>The legendary trio will clearly be the stars of the new set, which could be the penultimate set before a big shake-up in Pokémon TCG Pocket that introduces Mega Evolution to the game.</p>



<p>Mega Evolutions’ arrival will mark the start of the second season in the game, potentially changing the rules and pushing the sets to ‘B’, though at this stage it’s merely speculation.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has teased a “big update” later this year, though, which aligns with suggestions it could reformat the meta and transition into the next stage.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review.1277955/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Where do you draw the line with a remake? How do you balance creative freedom and remaining true to the original? Everyone's answer is somewhat different, but for Konami, staying faithful was the top priority with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake of the 2004 stealth-action game that was led by Hideo Kojima. In not being shy about crediting Kojima and his team throughout, Konami preserved Snake Eater in a way that's nearly one-to-one, other than a massive visual overhaul. So while it has definitely aged in the 21 years since, there's a certain novelty to its old-school stealth-action gameplay and spy thriller story that still hits – especially with the way Snake Eater wraps up, how can you not be romantic about Metal Gear Solid all over again?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've played Snake Eater, almost everything will be familiar to you. It's the same captivating story, delivered with the same mix of melodrama and absurdity to the backdrop of its Cold War-era historical fiction. Its penchant for long cutscenes steeped in political theater is intact, alongside over-the-top characters and cinematic stylings with a tinge of classic espionage drama; you can put it side by side with the original and they'll sync up just fine. The iconic gravelly voice of David Hayter as Snake lands with a warming familiarity – only he can get away with always asking questions that are just him repeating the last thing that was said over the Codec. Item boxes are all in the same spots, and they still pop out of guards when you hold them up at gunpoint or drop their bodies. Despite the upgrade in tech that makes everything look current-gen, the layout of each area is untouched; they remain broken up into their distinct sections separated by brief loading screens. That's all to say, Delta is Snake Eater as you remember it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Going in, I was unsure about the Unreal Engine 5 makeover, and having completed a 12-hour playthrough (and a full stealth non-lethal run) I'm still a little conflicted at times. Does that sheen atop the new photorealistic graphics take the edge off of the original's stylings? Not entirely. But there are moments when its campiness doesn't land as confidently in high fidelity. There's something uncanny about Ocelot howling to call backup or The Cobra unit's inexplicable superpowers, which don't have quite the same whimsy when punched up. However, you couldn’t cut these things out and still call this Snake Eater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tradeoff is generally worth it, because the jungles and mountain ranges look fantastic and give a density to these contained zones that wasn't as felt before. And in its prestige-level cutscenes, the revamped graphics really pay off. It's one of those rose-tinted glasses situations, where this is how I remember it looking when I was blown away by the PS2 version as a teenager playing it for the first time. But now it actually does look this good.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The spirit of Snake Eater persists.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami put in considerable effort to maintain Snake Eater's classic touches by offering the "Legacy Style" camera angle that uses the old bird's eye view, along with the original control scheme. As much as I appreciate the nostalgia, though, the "New Style" is the optimal way to play. It uses an over-the-shoulder angle gives a modern perspective that doesn't detract from the way it was meant to be played, which we already knew because the 2012 3DS version and other re-releases used this camera angle as well. I also prefer it because you get to see Delta’s newfound detail closer to the ground level, and it’s been made less rigid and more accommodating by some new accessibility options. Even little things, like being able to use the original UI elements along with New Style camera, show it isn't stubborn about letting you tailor things to your liking. Unexpectedly, the most impactful option for me was the color filters – I played the entire game with the Legacy filter and found it much better than the somewhat sterile default look. As someone very attached to the specific color palette and aesthetic of the original Snake Eater, this was close enough for me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the thing I enjoyed most about this remake was that I found the old-school stealth action to be oddly refreshing. At a time when series like Splinter Cell, Thief, and, well, Metal Gear Solid are largely absent in the modern gaming world, playing through Snake Eater tapped into that part of my brain again. Each section feels like a puzzle to be solved, where guards and terrain are your obstacles and your limited gear leaves room for creativity. I was reminded about how reactivity is a defining feature of the Metal Gear series – whether I'm dropping dirty magazines to distract guards or popping out of a cardboard box for a close-quarters takedown, that mix of deliberate decisions and adapting when plans don't exactly work out remains satisfying. The thrill of evading an alert phase while hiding within inches of patrolling guards matches the high of pulling off a perfect no-kill stealth run, and toying with the guards once you understand their behavior can be as fun as going in guns blazing. I still hold MGSV: The Phantom Pain in high regard for its "emergent gameplay," but Snake Eater's more contained scope makes for a throwback that represents what made Metal Gear Solid so much fun to begin with.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Snake Eater's camouflage system works the same here, so you can expect different uniforms and face paint to affect your camo percentage based on the terrain you're in. It was innovative back in 2004 and is still a welcome layer of depth to the tried-and-true stealth gameplay that we haven’t seen often since, especially when it has a genuine impact on what you can get away with in different environments. There’s a convenient change in that you can access camo presets by holding up on the D-pad so you don't have to always go into the menus to make a tweak. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The injury system is back, and although it's a pain to keep patching up Snake after every mistake, it's on you to be careful and stay stocked with medical supplies. The hunger system remains an interesting wrinkle that's a smart alternative to typical health meters of other games, pushing you to hunt or find rations to keep Snake fed so his health replenishes over time (and to make sure his tummy doesn't grumble too loud). This kind of mechanic is common now, but it’s interesting to remember that Snake Eater predated the survival games today, and it's good to see these mechanics have aged well.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's Top 10 Metal Gear Games Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate that the controls have been mostly modernized to align with how third-person games are typically played today, including quality of life improvements to CQC and mobility that's similar to MGSV: The Phantom Pain. But some of the annoying quirks of movement and interacting with the environment haven't really changed. Having Snake stick to cover, make miniscule movements in certain directions, and connect on melee attacks can be frustrating, even if it's the sort of friction I'm used to putting up with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The higher difficulties provide a fun challenge and replayability, but when I took a step back, Snake Eater is understandably not quite as expansive as it felt 20 years ago. Relative to modern games it feels rather small in scope, and its challenges aren't as complex as I once thought, and that comes with the territory of an stubbornly faithful remake. Enemy density is a bit sparse the gameplay dynamic doesn't evolve much the deeper you go. Even if shooting a tranq dart into every guard's head is the easiest solution, Metal Gear Solid is at its best when treating it as a playground for improvising.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Snake Eater is understandably not quite as expansive as it felt 20 years ago.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss fights are another area where Konami might’ve played it a little too safe by not sprucing them up in some way, so they’re still hit-or-miss depending on what you're asked to do. There are dull ones like The Pain or The Fear, where you're just waiting for a window to pop your shots. On the other hand, you have classics like The End's cat-and-mouse shootout and The Sorrow's novel meta-layer that remind me that Snake Eater was thinking outside the box and doing things that only Metal Gear was at the time. And if you remember any of the old tricks and secrets from the original versions, just know that they all still work in Delta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The storytelling didn’t really need changes, because to me, this one's timeless. I'm a sucker for Kojima and company’s embellished political drama, and with the backdrop of the nuclear arms race of the Cold War, inserting their flavor of government conspiracy is captivating to indulge in. For all its stone-faced goofiness, Snake Eater has a story that hit in a way I didn't expect when I was younger – and after all these years, I felt a new wave of emotions revisiting it as an adult. That's due in large part to the enigmatic relationship between Snake and The Boss; it's conveyed with a certain earnestness, leading to revelations that brought things full circle for Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid as a whole at the time it came out. This culminates in what I still consider the best moments in the entire series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even twerps like Ocelot earn his respect through a rivalry with Snake that has its own little story arc. And aside from The Boss, Eva remains one of my favorite characters in the series, stealing every scene she's in and playing an important role of an agent you can't get a read on until the very end. (I do wish the story didn't treat her so poorly at certain moments, so I can’t say Delta wouldn’t have benefitted from a couple of changes in this regard.) For as much flack as Metal Gear may get for its lengthy cinematics, Snake Eater is a focused story told at a fairly brisk pace, and it knows when to pull its far-fetched punches.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Snake Eater is a focused story told at a fairly brisk pace.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Weaving in grainy old footage from historical archives alongside Yoji Shinkawa's art direction to ground its story is still effective. These touches add texture to what's at stake for Snake: fail and be used as a scapegoat for your government, or succeed and become an unknown hero. Both are tragic in their own ways. Yet, with the inexplicable supernatural edge to its villains, this is a series best enjoyed with a particular suspension of disbelief – also for the silliness that comes with conversations about real-life movies with your remote assistant Para-Medic. That leaves room for its cinematic flair, seen in iconic moments like climbing the ladder to an acapella rendition of the Snake Eater theme song and pivotal conversations on a flower field amid conflict breaking out at the Soviet border. This is a series known for letting you infiltrate top-secret military facilities by hiding in conspicuous cardboard boxes; no one does camp like Metal Gear Solid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, for all its adherence to the original, I wondered: did we need this remake? Is there a way Delta could've been a much higher elevation of the original Snake Eater? Yeah, I'm sure, and we have faithful remakes like Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill 2 to look at, for example. That's not what Konami set out to do though, so I'm left to acknowledge the ways it doesn't quite hold up today, and appreciate the things that make it timeless. Delta didn't necessarily elevate my love for Snake Eater, but it did remind me of why I've held it in high regard all this time.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>I’m far from alone in the assertion that <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i> featured some of the best stealth mechanics of the series. Were they packaged with a story and overall level design that did them justice? I say no to that, but I can’t deny that <i>MGSV</i> plays like a dream. Oh, and the plot twist was super neat, for the record.</p> <p>When <i>Delta</i>, the remake of 2004’s <i>Snake Eater</i>, was announced, many an <i>MGS</i> fan hoped that the game would play similarly to <i>MGSV</i>, and would perhaps even run on the celebrated Fox Engine.</p> <p>Folks, I’m here to tell you that’s not the case. As I alluded to in my review of the fancy new remake, <i>Delta</i> plays much like the <i>MGS3</i> you remember from just about any of its re-releases over the years. Plus, it runs on Unreal. And in my experience, that worked out well. I experienced very few technical issues during my time with a pre-release build provided by Konami. I was not thinking about graphics engines; I was fully immersed.</p>

 <p>But let’s have a chat about how this game plays in its moment-to-moment gameplay and put <i>Delta</i> under the microscope to compare it against <i>The Phantom Pain</i> and the original <i>Snake Eater</i> as it exists in the current <i>Master Collection</i>.</p> <h2><span id="movement-and-shooting"></span>Movement and shooting<span></span></h2> <p><i>Delta </i>and <i>MGSV</i> feel very different in motion, but it does feel like there’s a similar animation framework under the hood. <i>Delta</i> has a slower pace to it. <i>MGSV</i>’s Venom Snake is a bit choppier in his movements (not choppy in a bad way, but he has a kind of rigid urgency in how he moves that doesn’t feel present in <i>Delta</i>). Play some animations next to each other and you’ll see similarities, but to me, both with what I can see and what I have felt while playing <i>Delta</i> for 30 hours, the new remake feels smoother even compared to the impressive, and somewhat speedier, gameplay of <i>MGSV</i>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619227"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619227">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Unlike <i>MGSV</i>, <i>Delta</i> does not feature a sprint option. Snake’s speed when you’re pushing forward on the analog stick (or the W key on keyboard) without using the stalking feature is his top speed. In my opinion, sprint wouldn’t have worked in the remake as the environments are just too small. They feel as dense and lush as a jungle should be, but even compared to those in <i>MGS4</i>, these environments are smaller. It’s a PS2 game after all!</p>

 <p>Snake’s forward roll from the 2000-era <i>MGS</i> games is back and it functions like you remember it. You can roll into enemies to damage them. Rolling is key to non-lethally damaging certain bosses, and is especially important when trying to beat Volgin without “killing” him.</p> <p>Snake can now hop over waist-high cover like in <i>MGSV</i>, something not possible in the original.</p> <p>A very odd, basically insignificant change for all but the most diehard <i>MGS</i> freaks (and I’m one) is that flattening yourself against an opened locker door does not close the door. Does this matter? Here, no. There aren’t many lockers in the jungle. Should we ever see a <i>Delta</i>-fied <i>MGS2</i>, however, I’ll make a case for keeping this quirk in that game.</p>

Also, <i>MGSV</i> let you upgrade weapons to improve their performance. No such mechanic exists in <i>Delta</i>. What you find is what you get.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619214"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619214">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Delta</i>’s shooting feels like it splits the difference between the over-the-shoulder standard we see in every damn third-person shooter these days and what exists in the original <i>Snake Eater</i>. You can swap camera orientation to the left or right on the fly, like in <i>MGSV</i>. And the speed of shooting feels a touch closer to <i>MGSV</i>, but only on a very superficial level. It still feels like the pacing of <i>Snake Eater</i>, and you kinda have to play it to really feel what I’m talking about here. You’ll experience this most directly if you get caught and have to shoot your way out of a situation.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619215" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619215"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619215">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>A non-animation-related change <i>Delta</i> makes from the original concerns how the tranquilizer pistol functions. There’s a distinct bullet (dart?) drop over a distance, Making this pistol dramatically less OP. To me, this is a huge win as the tranquilizer gun, while essential for the series’ meta commentary on violence, made it too easy to quickly put a number of guards to sleep, often diluting the sneaking experience. In <i>Delta</i>, you’re gonna have to get closer to the enemy if you want to put them to sleep without doing a bunch of physics in your head to calculate where that dart is going to land. This makes for a more challenging and immersive experience.</p> <h2><span id="closequarterscombat-(cqc)"></span>Close-Quarters-Combat (CQC)<span></span></h2> <p><i>MGS3</i> introduced CQC to the series, deepening the way you would enter and leave combat. Before this, Snake had a simple punch-punch-kick animation and the ability to flip an enemy or grab them in a chokehold, from which you could either knock them out through strangulation or snap their little digital necks.</p>

 <p><i>MGSV</i> expanded CQC to include all manner of new moves such as throwing an enemy up against a wall, stealing their gun, or going all Neo on a swarm of enemies with a rapid series of punches on multiple targets when surrounded. In <i>Delta</i>, you still get that old familiar punch-punch-kick animation with three taps of the melee button. It feels a little awkward to be honest, being mapped to the right trigger on a controller, but that button serves as your CQC command here, just as it does in <i>MGSV</i>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619219"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619219">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Snake’s moveset is otherwise just like it was in the original (at least as far as I can tell after 30 hours). You can grab with similar speed and movements; you can toss an enemy down to the ground by combining the CQC button with a directional movement. This feels easier to do in the <i>Remake</i> than it does in the original. Holding enemies up at gunpoint, however, is a little trickier. You have to be <i>real </i>close to do it. I didn’t hold up enemies a whole lot during my playthrough as I found I wasn’t close enough and ended up getting spotted too often. Maybe with future playthroughs I’ll get a better sense of that, but it feels harder than it did in the original, and even compared to <i>MGSV.</i></p> <figure id="attachment_2000619224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619224"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619224">© Gif: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>CQC in <i>Delta</i> sticks very close to how it was in the original game. There’s a more dramatic flair at work in the animation that can sometimes feel different, but Snake typically grabs and tosses enemies at a similar pace as in the original <i>Snake Eater</i>.</p>

 <h2><span id="it-feels-like-snake-eater,-it-tastes-like-snake-eater-(with-a-bit-of-hot-sauce)"></span>It feels like <i>Snake Eater</i>, it tastes like <i>Snake Eater </i>(with a bit of hot sauce)<span></span></h2> <p>While <i>Delta</i> has clearly taken some cues from <i>MGSV</i>, and maybe it even borrowed some animations here and there, the experience of playing this remake almost never feels like <i>Phantom Pain</i>. Yes, Snake can now crouch walk and transition to crawling in a way that doesn’t exist in the original <i>Snake Eater</i>, but otherwise everything feels like an analog copy of the original. Analog in the sense that it’s not a pure copy, and features a few quirks of its own.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619221"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619221">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>When in battle, <i>Delta</i> also feels dramatically more similar to its original in my experience. <i>Phantom Pain</i> is snappier, faster, conceived as a modern third-person shooter. The new camera style of <i>Delta</i> can make things easier (veterans should probably start on Hard mode, as I mentioned in my review), but you’re still in trouble when the enemies spot you and start increasing in number. It is hard, as it was in the original, to shoot your way out of situations. <i>MGSV</i>, in my experience, could let you be more of a bloody menace if you so desired. <i>Delta</i>, however, aims to preserve the outnumbered, outgunned feeling of the original.</p> <p><i>Delta</i>’s unique additions to the <i>Snake Eater</i> formula feel grounded in its roots with gentle modern modifications. A <i>Snake Eater</i> mod of <i>MGSV</i> this is not.&nbsp;So if you’re like me and hold that 2000’s-era <i>MGS</i> experience in high regard, get ready for a wildly satisfying modern tweak of a legendary stealth game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s an exciting time for <i>Metal Gear Solid </i>fans such as myself. We’re not only about to get a remake of one of the best <i>MGS</i> games of all time, but also a new take on the classic stealth gameplay that made it so memorable. Earlier this month, I and several other journalists were invited to a <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i> event to get some lengthy time in with the game and to check out the super cool installation at NYC’s Lightbox studio that housed a recreation of the iconic flower bed of the game’s final showdown. Along with Michael McWhertor of <i>Polygon</i> and Destin Legarie of <i>The Destin Channel</i>, I got to chat with <i>Delta</i>’s producers, Noriaki Okamura and Yuji Korekado.</p> <p>What follows is a transcript of our roundtable conversation, with some slight edits for brevity and clarity. Konami provided a translator for our interview.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Michael McWhertor, <i>Polygon</i>:</strong> There’s been a lot of remakes in recent years, especially at Konami, and I wondered when you started working on this project how much you wanted to do this as a reinterpretation, or as a straight remake. Did you wanna add to it? Did you want to make <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> through the lens of 2025? What was that approach like? Was it a straight remake or something else?</p>

 <p><strong>Noriaki Okamura, Producer, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>:</strong> This is something we contemplated at the very beginning when we were starting this project: What would be the best way to do a remake of <i>MGS3</i>? And in those conversations what we ultimately decided on for <i>Delta </i>is [that] the concept of <i>Delta </i>is to be able to have new <i>Metal Gear</i> fans, new<i> Metal Gear </i>players to experience the original as is, as much as possible. Obviously we did the modernization that we need to so that it will be more fluid and more accepting to modern gamers and how they play games but in order for us to respect what was originally great about the game, we wanted to keep it as is as much as possible.</p>  <p><strong>Destin Legarie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DestinL"><i>The Destin Channel</i></a>:</strong> You’ve had a few preview sessions and you’ve gotten some feedback online. What changes have you been able to implement based on that online feedback today?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado, Creative Producer, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>:</strong> So one of the things we did is that, after we announced that we’re gonna do a remake, obviously there were a lot of reactions from a lot of <i>Metal Gear </i>fans and one of the things that really stood out to us is some of the additional modes that were, you know, removed, and because this game has been re-released so many times, and so some of them were they really wanted Snake Versus Monkey back, or, like, the Secret Theater videos back. After we we saw that there’s so much demand for it we decided, OK, what can we do to make those modes come back and what kind of way would be best to bring them back? So we did look into that kind of feedback.</p>

 <p><strong>Destin Legarie:</strong> Specifically, I’ve seen a lot of feedback about some of the facial animations. Has that feedback been taken to heart?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> Yes, we did get that kind of feedback. We heard them loud and clear and especially after we released some of the earlier trailers, that’s definitely something that was pointed out to us and like I said, we want to make sure the experience that we provide in the remake is the same kind of experience that the people who played the original experience had. We wanna make sure that wow factor is still there, so after that we definitely wanted to make sure that the quality is on par to what a <i>Metal Gear </i>game needs to be.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619261" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619261"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619261">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Claire Jackson, <i>Kotaku</i>:</strong> What was it like balancing modern stealth mechanics with the stealth challenges of the original game?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> One of the things we did for <i>Delta</i> is to provide two types of what we call “Play Styles.” We have the Legacy Style which you can play kind of with a similar camera and controls as the original, and the new style you can play with more modern controls and a third-person camera setting. And when we allowed that new type of play style, we had to make some adjustments, some rebalancing because the way that you can now see the map changes how you need to hide and what you can see and what you can look out for. So one of the things we changed was the character animation, character motions and also the reactions and the responses of of some of the NPCs, the AI as well, and we needed to do that because allowing a different kind of angle, different kind of play style changes the thrill, the nervousness of needing to hide. So this is something that we had to go back and do a lot of testing with, utilizing modern technology to make it feel [like] that same nervousness as you were playing in the original style, but with a new modern control and camera.</p>

 <p><strong>Destin Legarie:</strong> Do you feel that modernization might make it too easy? Because I remember when [the GameCube remake of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, <i>The Twin Snakes </i>came out, a lot of the criticism was that having that extra perspective made gameplay easier and the game easy.</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> To simply put it, yes, we knew this would happen, obviously. So, we had to do a lot of rebalancing between when you’re playing the Legacy Style versus the New Style, we had to make sure that the difficulty level would still match whatever playstyle you’re playing with and not make things too easy or too difficult.</p>

  <p><strong>Claire Jackson:</strong> Does the team have a preference between the original, overhead camera or or the third person one?</p> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> So, for [me] personally, [I love] both. Obviously modern players are more used to the third person camera and you know, specific types of controls. So for [new players] we want them to play with New Style first and because we think that this is the best way for them to get immersed into<i> Metal Gear</i>’s world in that way that they’re more used to. And once they cleared the game it will be fun for them to go back and replay the game in Legacy Style and see, “oh my goodness, there’s a whole new way of playing this game that I didn’t even know about,” so we would love for them to enjoy both Play Styles.</p> <p><strong>Michael McWhertor:</strong> I’m wondering if any technical issues came up developing certain aspects of the game? And I’m specifically thinking about how easy it was on the PlayStation 2 to, say, change the date, on your PlayStation 2 [to defeat the sniper boss, The End], whereas now on a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X or a PC, it’s, it’s more difficult to change the date on your system because it’s connected to the internet, and I’m wondering if you have a technical solution to that issue or if any other technical issues popped up?</p>

 <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> So just with how we were able to adapt [the game] to the consoles and platforms back then, we were able to do that for all the the supported platforms that [<i>Delta</i>] is going to come out on today, and you know there’s different features on different types of platforms and features that we wanted to incorporate as well. For instance, we like the [rumble] feedback on the [PS5’s DualSense]. These are the types of things that we did really look into to make sure that we do what we can to best adapt [the game] to modern consoles as much as possible. In terms of technical difficulties, we didn’t really have too much, yeah.</p> <p><strong>Destin Legarie:</strong> I know we’re here for <i>Delta </i>today, and we’re running low on time. I have so much that I want to ask but I would get in trouble if I didn’t ask about <i>Metal Gear </i>[<i>Solid</i>]<i> 4</i>. Is there any hope you can give for fans about <i>MGS4</i> possibly being in Volume 2 [of the <i>Master Collection</i>] or is it being worked on in any capacity?</p> <p><strong>Noriaki Okamura:</strong> This is something that we’re always, always thinking about: What is our next move in terms of the <i>Metal Gear</i> series, and we are aware that a lot of fans really want <i>MGS4 </i>back because it’s currently not playable on any current hardware or platforms, and this is something we do want to address at some point, making sure that fans can have a chance to play it once again. Unfortunately we can’t give you any more details other than that, but yeah, hopefully in the future this is something we can do.</p> <p><strong>Claire Jackson:</strong> Were there any unique challenges or surprises when it came to preserving the cinematic flair of the original [<i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i>]?</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619262"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619262">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Yuji Korekado:</strong> So for the cutscenes, we had to remake everything: The character models, the level, the stages, we had to do it all from scratch. And when we did that, one of our concerns was that even though everything looks amazing, if we still kept the same facing, the same camera angles, would it still hold up? And so once everything was done and we decided to create all the cinematics using the same camera, using the same background music, voice acting, we were blown away because the way that [<i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i>] was built originally was already perfect to begin with and the the modern graphics just enhanced that to the fullest. So we were very surprised that, you know, even to this day the way it was originally made was, you know, [it] didn’t need to be retouched.</p>
