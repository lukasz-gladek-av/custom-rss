			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-annonounced-release-date-pc-ps5-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a> is perhaps the only game based on a big PlayStation IP due to launch this year. Of course, it is also a spin-off title that mainly targets kids of around eight years old.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/making-horizon-zero-dawn-suitable-for-eight-year-olds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry</a>, James Windeler, narrative director at Guerrilla Games (which is working alongside Studio Gobo on this project), said that fans of the franchise will still recognize the main characters in LEGO Horizon Adventures, even though certain themes take on a more lighthearted note due to the different target audience.</p>
<p><em>We have tried to keep as much of the story as possible. A lot of what happens in the world, like the destruction of the old world… that's a pretty heavy theme for an eight-year-old. So we needed to find ways to keep that present in the story, because it is essential to Horizon. But it is also not something we leaned on. You won't find some of those devastating reveals from the first game, like those corporate masterminds dead around the table or anything like that.</em></p>
<p><em>There are moments from the first game that packs a really heavy emotional punch, that we've found, I think, a very good way to represent faithfully, but undercut them with comedy that keeps things light-hearted. This stuff is present, but it's certainly not surface. This is a much simpler version, but it has a lot of echoes from the original.</em></p>
<p><em>It has still got to feel like Horizon. We have definitely bent the rules a lot. But the characters remain core to who they are. I think we've found a really good balance with it. We have a lot of help. Ashley Burch is back as the voice of Aloy, and JB Blanc (as Rost). And you would have heard the exuberance to their performances. It is different to what the other games are, but they're still recognisable. They're part of it and they bought into it, and that's been a huge boon to us.</em></p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is launching this December on PC, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving out Xbox</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-switch-for-everyone-no-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-play multiplayer</a> among the announced platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-final-fantasy-14-expansion-ranked-dawntrail-endwalker-shadowbringers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Final Fantasy 14 is over 10 years old and players are finishing up its newest expansion, Dawntrail. With six expansions, including A Realm Rebron, Final Fantasy 14 is one of gaming's greatest comeback stories. From a critically-panned launch to becoming one of the biggest games of all time for Square Enix, all of it was thanks to the consistently excellent work from the developers. </p><p>But which expansion reigns supreme? With so many to choose from, and each expansion with its own unique characteristics, it's hard to choose. But we've gotten together to rank every Final Fantasy 14 expansion to find out which one we loved most.</p><p>So hit the jump to see our favorite expansions in Final fantasy 14 below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn</h2><p>The story of Final Fantasy 14’s rise from the ashes is well-documented. Following a disastrous launch, producer Naoki Yoshida took reins on the project and rebooted the game with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review">A Realm Reborn</a>, which literally destroyed the world of the launch game, and built on top of it the beloved MMORPG we know and love today.</p><p>A Realm Reborn was a two-fold project that fixed the frustrating gameplay and RPG systems of the launch version while telling a story that literally incorporates the destruction of the launch version into the wider narrative. And while A Realm Reborn quite literally saved FF14, the need to reboot an entire MMO and reintroduce players to the game is its greatest weakness. Compared to later expansions, A Realm Reborn feels downright glacial when it comes to pacing, and the need to revamp the world means its story is far more bloated than it needs to be in later expansions. While A Realm Reborn will always be cherished for saving Square Enix’s MMORPG, you’ll be hard-pressed to say the later expansions aren't better. - <em>Matt Kim</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Stormblood</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/27/ffxiv-40-mediakit-20170501-013-1498603434827.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/30/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood-review">Stormblood</a> is often looked at as one of the lesser-liked expansions, which, to me, speaks to how strong the rest of them are. That’s because Stormblood is still a crucial piece to Final Fantasy 14 that worked to conclude long-standing conflicts and show you just how evil and destructive the Garlean Empire was. I vividly remember the feeling of taking back Ala Mhigo after all these years of them being under Garlean rule, and taking back Doma Castle after seeing how Domans had suffered from the occupation. There are moments in which Stormblood undercuts its own messaging and perhaps didn’t fully find the nuance necessary to elegantly tell a politically charged story. However, it gets the larger picture right, and the liberation of the peoples across the different regions was invigorating nonetheless.</p><p>Stormblood’s zones might not be the most exciting of the bunch, but there’s a tranquility I still feel when flying across the Ruby Sea, over the plains of Azim Steppe, and past the rice patties in Yangxia. I often reflect on the stories of oppression and rebellion in those moments because of the smaller stories told throughout the expansion. I also remember Yotsuyu as one of the most complex villains of FF14 – her heartbreaking story represents how sadistic and corrupting living under oppression can be, which culminated in one of the best boss fights to this day. Stormblood may not have been the best expansion, but it had peaks that make FF14 what it is today. - <em>Michael Higham</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/01/dwan-1719847877677.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p>With <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail fresh in my memory</a>, it’s a bit hard to gauge its place in the Final Fantasy 14 pantheon, but even with all its implications yet to be explored, it still stands as a worthy addition to the MMO’s long history. The land of Tural opens FF14 to so many different themes and cultural influences it wasn’t able to incorporate in the past, and although it does come with some mixed results, the vibrant foundation it lays leaves even more room for growth.<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-is-like-playing-a-great-one-piece-game"> Newcomer Wuk Lamat</a> is a large focus and although she’s not the strongest character in FF14, she has the heart necessary to carry out Dawntrail’s message of finding peace through mutual respect and embracing our differences.</p><p>Dawntrail’s lasting legacy is in the second half of its story where things turn in unpredictable directions. Its fusion of references to ancient civilizations, its Latin American roots, and the old-timey American West somehow make sense when they clash with the cyberpunk-tinged sci-fi elements that eventually come to the forefront. It’s able to touch on classic Final Fantasy narrative themes from a fresh perspective. We explored the depths of the pain we feel from losing the things we love most during Shadowbringers and Endwalker, but the way Dawntrail contextualizes mortality is powerfully intimate. In its best moments, Dawntrail can be as impactful as anything else found in FF14, and for that alone, this expansion deserves its flowers. - <em>MH</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Endwalker</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-ffxiv">Endwalker is the culmination</a> of a 10-year long story arc for Final Fantasy 14. From the days of A Realm Reborn, players became embroiled in a celestial battle between the gods Hydaelin and Zodiark. Beset in the real-world by a global pandemic that delayed the expansion by a year, Endwalker was a reward for players who stuck with the MMORPG from its earliest days who can now see the conclusion to a long-running storyline.</p><p>The stakes were high but Endwalker is FF14’s most emotional expansion to date, reinforcing Final Fantasy 14’s core themes of how friendship and courage can overcome even the greatest challenges. And with so much of Final Fantasy 14 now playable in single-player, a new player could play from A Realm Reborn through Endwalker and feel that they’ve finished one of the best Final Fantasy games of all time.</p><p>But thankfully, Endwalker is not the end of FF14, and the newest expansion, Dawntrail, is setting the stage for the next 10 years of Square Enix’s beloved MMORPG. - <em>MK</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Heavensward</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/11/11/ffxivheavenswardbenchmark018png-a80986.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p>What a difference an expansion makes. Free from the need to fix an entire MMORPG, Final Fantasy 14’s next expansion after A Realm Reborn, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/29/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward-review">Heavensward</a>, is able to jump right into the action. With the Warriors of Light on the run, they escape to the frozen, holy land of Ishgard which has been too busy embroiled in a war against dragons to do much in Eorzea. </p><p>What’s immediately apparent in Heavensward is that it quickly establishes the themes and storytelling the FF14 team seems to revel in: dramatic, high fantasy that harkens back to the old pixel games like Final Fantasy 6. Heavensward is such a throwback to the classic sword and sorcery fantasy of early Final Fantasy games, while also introducing the dark courtly politics that would make George R.R. Martin grin. If A Realm Reborn took a lot of time to get going, Heavensward is action-packed almost from the jump and from there sets the bar for all later FF14 expansions. </p><p>To quote FromSoftware, the real Final Fantasy 14 begins with Heavensward. - <em>MK</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Shadowbringers</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/11/19/ffxiv-pub-fanfestival-2018-lasvegas-10-1542667050150.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p>Final Fantasy 14 truly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/12/ffxiv-shadowbringers-review">found its voice in Shadowbringers</a>. Lead writer Natsuko Ishikawa stepped into the role and her poetic storytelling style gave the expansion its identity, focusing on its characters with a level of depth and emotional sincerity never before seen in FF14. From the moment you step into The First, there’s an immediate sense of urgency that sets the tone for how dire the flood of light has been on the entire realm, flipping the script on typical light versus dark stories. And in horrifying ways, leaned on showing rather than telling.</p><p>Shadowbringers captured its grand moments with a weight and excitement that few RPGs are able to pull off. It earns those moments by building characters like the Crystal Exarch, Ardbert, and Emet Selch in a complex web of heroes and villains to carry its heavier themes, and contextualize despair and tragedy in a world separate from anything we’d known in Eorzea. FF14 began to ask the big questions about loss, grief, and the lengths people will go to preserve the things that matter most to them, and did so with nuance.</p><p>And if we want to count the post-launch content, Patch 5.3 capped off what was already one of the best stories in the series with another incredible conclusion, reaching a height that I don’t think FF14 will ever be able to top. My precious crystal cat boy gave his all to save a realm, and all of my Scion friends were there to witness his greatness as he immortalized his life’s work at the Seat of Sacrifice. From its writing and narrative themes to its music and visual storytelling, Shadowbringers not only proved itself as peak FF14, it’s arguably peak Final Fantasy. - <em>MH</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>These are our rankings for our favorite Final Fantasy 14 expansions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202090/meta-quest-app-horizon-mobile-app-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Meta is rolling out a <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/horizon-mobile-app/">revamped version of its Quest mobile app</a> that links it more closely with its 3D social platform <em>Horizon Worlds</em>. The app, now called Meta Horizon, comes with a new tab that lets you complete quests from your phone and customize your avatar. </p><p>You can also use the app to explore and join new worlds, as well as connect with friends in <em>Horizon Worlds</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23887494/meta-horizon-worlds-web-mobile-vr-super-rumble">launched on mobile</a> and the web last September. Meta says the update won’t take away any features in the existing app, and you can still use it to set up your Quest headsets and browse the library of apps in the Meta Horizon Store.</p><p>Another small update coming to the Meta Horizon app is the addition of light mode, allowing you to easily swap between light and dark whenever you want. Meta also rolled out a new feed featuring <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-quest-v67-update-new-window-layout-creator-content-horizon-feed/">content from creators</a> in the mobile app earlier this month.</p><p>The update comes as Meta looks to expand <em>Horizon Worlds</em> and its handle on the VR industry. In April, Meta announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137284/meta-license-horizon-os-quest-headset-lenovo-asus">plans to license its headset operating system</a>, called Horizon OS, to companies like Lenovo and Asus. It will also start featuring experimental App Lab titles more prominently in the Meta Horizon Store and is trying to make it easier for developers to bring their mobile games to Horizon OS.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paramount-s-halo-show-is-kia-but-xbox-will-try-to-save-it">the now-cancelled Halo TV show</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> known as "Halo The Series" on Paramount Plus.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You know, the one where we saw Master Chief have sex before we ever saw him on a Halo.

But that's fine! TV shows come and go. A lot of hardworking people took big creative swings, and there were plenty of times I went "that was a great episode of television" even while screaming about the overall creative direction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But as an industry observer, I can't help but notice that the Halo show and Microsoft's game division are suffering from the same problem: a business and creative strategy that, in one way or another, can be summed up like this: "I'll be better tomorrow."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Halo show was not better tomorrow">The Halo show was not better tomorrow</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's do a quick compare-and-contrast of the first Halo game and the first season of the Halo show. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo: Combat Evolved</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the player takes on the role of Master Chief, a super soldier cracked out of cryogenesis on a human warship fleeing a devastating loss against an alien species called The Covenant. The ship arrives over a mysterious ring called the Halo, its crew abandons ship and heads to the surface, and a war breaks out against The Covenant for control of the ring after everyone learns it's a massive superweapon. Then a zombie-like species called The Flood bursts from its innards, slaughters everyone, and only the Master Chief escapes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(Yes I know other people escaped. I read the books and played </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">that's called a retcon).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the Halo TV show...oh boy. The human race is in an existential war with an alien species called The Covenant, which is hunting for mysterious artifacts scattered across the galaxy pointing to a mysterious superweapon. The Master Chief, aka John, and his squad find an artifact while defending a group of space colonists who also hate the government and that stays relevant because surviving colonist Kwan Ha sticks around to throw monkey wrenches into the plot. This sets John off on a quest to find other artifacts while also rebelling against the repression against the United Nation Space Corps who kidnapped him as a child and put a chip in him that suppressed his emotions when they turned him into a super soldier and there's this human named Makee who was kidnapped by the Covenant as a child because she has a special connection to the alien artifacts and so does John and they're both weird chosen ones and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>help i can't do this anymore.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'll try to zip things up like this: Season 1 ends with the humans learning about the Halo. Season 2 follows the siege and destruction of the planet Reach, the battle that is shown in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo: Reach</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and ends with the Master Chief landing on the Halo in the last thirty minutes of the show. He and Makee have a standoff about how the Halo should be used and it ends on a cliffhanger.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was less a "zip-up" and more "getting your zipper stuck on the fabric of your jacket."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a final analysis the Halo show wasn't about the fight over the Halo, it was trying to answer a question that's often asked by executives giving script notes: why exactly do people care about the Halo to begin with? I fear Showrunner Steven Kane and the talented cast and crew working on the project were tasked with making a show about the broader Halo universe because someone higher up on the food chain was very insecure about a story set on Halo itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's not an impossible task but it sure as hell is difficult. It gets even harder when you put the burden of writing such an arc on the shoulders of two people. Picking through the IMDB credits, you start to get a sense of how the business model of streaming services tore this show apart. Kane and writer Kyle Killen (who also has a 'developed by' credit) are credited with the bulk of the scripts across both seasons, with Basil Lee Kreimendahl listed as "staff writer" on season 2.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A few other writer's names pop up below them, but this smacks of what's become known as a "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/features/writers-strike-tv-industry-streaming-problem-1235666463/">mini room</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" in the streaming era. Before the 2023 writer's strike, streaming service producers tried to pare down the number of writers staffed on a show by knocking out the entire scripting process with a small room of writers during the development process, with the showrunner executing those scripts once it goes to air. This process didn't always result in failure, but writers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/features/mini-rooms-writers-tv-pilot-series-orders-1235061733/">have discussed at length</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> how it hurt careers and made an already-difficult task that much harder.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The final product gave off the inevitable of "trust us, we're doing something different, but we'll get to the Halo soon." Season one passed, and once again we were given the energy of "trust us, we're doing something different, but we'll get to the Halo soon."

            <p>
Things are about to get lively on the Sea of Thieves! After spending far too long as giant, trash-talking disembodied head, the nefarious Captain Flameheart finally makes a proper return to Rare's multiplayer pirate adventure next Thursday, 25th July - and he'll be terrorising players with his formidable fire-belching warship as Season 13 gets underway.
</p>
<p>
As Rare explained <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-bumper-2024-bringing-windy-horns-grapple-guns-a-roaming-warship-and-loads-more">earlier this year</a>, that warship, The Burning Blade, serves as a new roving world event out on the waves, giving players the opportunity to go head-to-head against its awesome firepower if they so choose. The Burning Blade is officially the most powerful ship in Sea of Thieves, sporting ten cannons, the ability launch Ashen Roar balls of fire from its flaming bow, and a sizeable crew of obsidian skeletons to deal with. But if players manage to defeat it in battle, they have a choice: sink it in defiance of Flameheart or pledge their allegiance to the dread captain and become the new crew of The Burning Blade, temporarily at least.
</p>
<p>
Players that choose to do Flameheart's bidding and man The Burning Blade will get some assistance from its former obsidian skeleton crew, which'll be useful as other players - who can always see the vessel on their map - move in to try and take control themselves.
</p>

<p>
But what can you do as the new crew of The Burning Blade? Well, that ties in with Season 13's other new feature: Skeleton Camps. These are located throughout the Sea of Thieves, built by obsidian skeletons in order to extract mysterious artefacts from ancient temples hidden deep below the earth. Any crew, regardless of their allegiance, can approach active Skeleton Camps to ride the lift down into their depths and solve the puzzles within, but Flameheart has a special task for those commanding his vessel.
</p>
<p>
Each underground temple contains a crypt that's only accessible by scrutinising star charts and finding constellations hidden on their star-speckled ceilings. Get one open, though, and you'll uncover a half-finished ritual started by Flameheart's nefarious Reapers, who've been using corrupted Orbs of Secrets to extract knowledge from the Ancients buried inside. Crews in charge of The Burning Blade can then complete the ritual, collecting the secrets of the Ancients, and increasing the value stored within their ship.
</p>
<p>
Players on The Burning Blade are free to visit as many Skeleton Camps and complete as many rituals as they dare while they still have control of the warship, but if the risk from other players starts to feel too great, they can return to Captain Flameheart at the Reaper's Hideout and cash in their bounty for gold and Reaper's Bones reputation.
</p>
<p>
And for players that choose to oppose Flameheart, things work a little differently. For starters, when crews not in command of The Burning Blade enter Skeleton Camps, they'll need to scupper rather than complete the half-finished ritual, requiring them to defeat waves of vicious obsidian skeletons. And if they succeed, they can grab the Orb of Secrets, taking it to a Trading Company at an outpost in order to sell it for profit.
</p>
<p>
There's a little more to this side of things, however; if players who oppose Flameheart defeat The Burning Blade during its world event and let it sink rather than take control, they'll be awarded the Blade of Souls - a powerful weapon imbued with fiery attacks that increases in value for each ritual completed. This can then be turned into a Trading Company to earn gold and reputation when the risks start to feel too great.
</p>
<p>
Tying all this together are a bunch of new Commendations and rewards. There's a new Burning Blade ship set to unlock by completing rituals for Flameheart, for instance, as well as new Skeleton Curse customisation options that sufficiently ranked Hour Glass Battle players can use. Players that choose to sink The Burning Blade, meanwhile, can work toward unlocking obsidian weapons and clothing, plus the Obsidian Bone Crusher captain's cabin decorations and ship set. 
</p>
<p>
Alongside all that, Season 13 promises 100 more levels of seasonal progression and a new tier of premium rewards for those that buy the optional Plunder Pass. Additionally, players can purchase new toucan pets from the real-money Pirate Emporium when things get underway next Thursday, 25th July, on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5.
</p>
<p>
And if you're wondering what's next, we already have a pretty good idea. Rare's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-bumper-2024-bringing-windy-horns-grapple-guns-a-roaming-warship-and-loads-more">2024 Sea of Thieves roadmap</a> confirmed Season 14 will round out the year with new features enabling stealthier forms of play. Expect the likes of spring traps, blow darts, crouching and sneaking, plus the ability to silently hang off the edge of ships or scurry around disguised as treasure chests to trick unsuspecting crews. Oh, and there's a grapple gun on its way too...

In fact, they sound so alike that if you search for “cloudstrike” on Twitter, you’ll mostly find posts of people talking about the outage. Folks are now <em>convinced </em>that Cloudstrike is the name of the company that nearly shut down the whole world this morning, which is leading to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NotOR30/status/1814201312755470560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NotOR30/status/1814201312755470560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some confusion online</a></span>.</p><p>In actuality, Cloudstrike is an Arc exotic sniper rifle that was introduced back in 2020’s <em>Beyond Light </em>expansion. Cloudstrike <em>is </em>a pretty potent weapon, generating a powerful lightning strike at the point of impact after getting successive critical hits. Despite that incredible ability, I don’t think it’s capable of incapacitating the whole world like that.</p><p>Suffice to say, <em>Destiny 2 </em>fans went online today and were thoroughly confused at the fact that a four-year old weapon was trending for bringing the world to its knees. That didn’t stop them from getting some jokes off though.</p><p>Some folks working on the game seem to be getting a kick out of things. For example, one of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s community managers posted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/A_dmg04/status/1814326488029892895&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/A_dmg04/status/1814326488029892895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIF from the sitcom <em>Community</em></a></span>, featuring Donald Glover’s character returning to a room only to find it on fire. Most of the replies to his post are joking about Cloudstrike being responsible for the outage. A writer at Bungie posted a screenshot of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HazelMonforton/status/1814311639509782547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HazelMonforton/status/1814311639509782547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now deleted Reddit post</a></span> that sincerely asked, “Is Cloudstrike meta again?” Another user shared a more <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1e74c98/global_cloudstrike_issue/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1e74c98/global_cloudstrike_issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intentionally satirical post</a></span> to the game’s subreddit joking about a “global Cloudstrike issue.”<br></p><p>I’m glad there are some folks out there getting a kick out of things. Now that Trials of Osiris is back up for the weekend, I fully expect some of you to run around with Cloudstrike in honor of today’s historic event.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A CrowdStrike update that caused thousands of computers and servers to infinitely reset and "blue screen of death" finally has a solution, and it involves deleting (part of) System32. Yes, really, deleting one file in Windows' basic system directory apparently solves the problem that caused what some have called the biggest server outage in history.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/website-hosting/millions-of-windows-servers-down-after-crowdstrike-update-how-it-happened-and-how-to-fix" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TechRadar</a>, the fix to the issue involves booting Windows in Safe Mode, navigating to the CrowdStrike directory within System32, and deleting one file that matches a certain alphanumeric code. Meanwhile, Microsoft officially advises customers to restore from a backup if possible, and if not, attach the disk to a virtual machine for an offline repair.</p><p dir="ltr">In online circles, "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/delete-system32" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deleting System32</a>" is a well-known (if ancient) prank that trolls pulled on unsuspecting Windows users. It involves telling the user that deleting the folder will make their computer go faster (often through a specific command line); of course, in reality, deleting this folder would make their computer not work correctly.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it's not clear how many machines were affected by the July 19 outage, it had a major impact on airlines, hospitals, banks, and tech companies. Per <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/technology/microsoft-crowdstrike-outage-what-happened.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYT</a>, it even reportedly caused payment processors like Visa to suffer major downtime. Hundreds of flights were grounded as a result, and emergency 911 lines in multiple US states were also affected. Logistics companies like UPS and FedEx also experienced disruptions due to the snafu.</p><p dir="ltr">Initially feared to be a security incident or coordinated cyberattack, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz went to <a href="https://x.com/George_Kurtz/status/1814235001745027317" rel="nofollow ">social media</a> to quell those concerns. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he said that the issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed, though it'll likely take some time for the affected systems to recover.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fortnite-cursed-sails-event-now-live/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-awaited Cursed Sails event for <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-guidelines-frequent-crashes-ifortnite-intel-14th-gen-13th-gen-cpus/">Fortnite</a> is now live. Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is the next collaboration in-game, with players now able to live out their swashbuckling dreams by exploring Shipwreck Shallows and hunting for buried treasure.</p>
<p>With this <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/disneys-pirates-of-the-caribbean-docks-into-fortnite-br?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shiny new event</a> comes quests for players to complete, titled Cursed Sails quests. With this event comes a battle pass, where completing Cursed Sails quests will net you rewards from the Cursed Sails Pass. Completing the Cursed Sails quests will give you access to the Cursed Gold currency, the point system where you can unlock rewards from the battle pass.&nbsp; The battle pass features 11 unlockable cosmetics on the free track, meaning you don't have to miss out on looking the part of a pirate.</p>
<p>As with any battle pass, a free track allows players to unlock certain rewards, but they typically aren't as high rarity or high value as the paid track on the battle pass. By completing quests and unlocking the free tracks of the pass, you can expect to get items such as Jack's Cutlass, Bane Pickaxe, and Jack's Prize Back Bling.</p>
<p>For those who have purchased the battle pass for this event, you will instantly unlock Jack Sparrow's entire outfit. The premium track can net you rewards such as the Jar of Dirt Emote, Jack's Compass Back Bling, and many more Pirates of the Carribean-themed cosmetics. Additionally, you'll be able to get your hands on LEGO Jack Sparrow, where you can take him into LEGO Islands and LEGO Fortnite if you want a blockier experience.</p>
<p>While this event may feel similar to Wrecked, you will get to explore many new vessels that hide plenty of secrets along the way.</p>
<p>Participating in the event means you'll get to explore exclusive features that appear. For example, you may find a Ship in a Bottle when looting the vessels. By breaking it open, you can summon a Ghost Ship, which can crash into your opponents to deal devastating damage.</p>
<p>You can also have a blast with the event by jumping into a Pirate Cannon, launching you skyward and sending you a fair distance across the map. You can also move the Pirate Cannon around to choose where to aim and fire, giving you and your teammates the advantage of exploring uncharted territory.</p>
<p>Additionally, released in conjunction with this event, you can purchase cosmetic packs of Elizabeth Swann, Captain Barbossa, and Davy Jones, all of which come with their LEGO counterparts.</p>

<p>If you're curious but don't necessarily want to buy the game right away, EA Play subscribers have access to a 10-hour trial right now; Game Pass Ultimate members have this benefit as well since the membership includes EA Play.</p><p>College Football 25 is already doing well, as the game reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-hits-2-million-players-before-official-launch/1100-6525147/" data-ref-id="1100-6525147">2.2 million unique players during the early-access window</a>, while another 600,000 people have tried the EA Play trial.</p><p>EA's last college football game before this was 2013's NCAA Football 14. EA and the NCAA broke off their partnership due to a variety of reasons, including legal problems and lawsuits. Instead, EA brokered separate licensing deals to feature all 134 FBS schools in College Football 25. And in a major change, EA is paying athletes to be in the game as part of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals.</p><p>College Football 25 is available on console for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but not last-gen consoles, PC, or Nintendo Switch.</p><p>If you're just getting started with College Football 25, you may want to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-day-preorder-buying-guide/1100-6525115/" data-ref-id="1100-6525115">College Football 25 launch guide</a>.</p><p>You can see a sampling of review scores for College Football 25 below.

You can see sweat on individual players, the lighting is exceptional, and everything pops visually in a way that Madden just doesn’t. There’s also just a lot more stuff to enjoy, from the unique intros for each team as they take the field to mascots dancing around when their school pulls off a big play." -- <em>Will Borger </em>[<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Forbes -- 8.5/10</h2><p>"When I heard EA was bringing college football back, I was fully prepared to play a game of Madden with college uniforms. In all honesty, I would have played it and been mildly satisfied. EA delivered a much deeper experience that easily carves its own identity in every way possible. Once EA learns its way around the restrictions of the NIL situation, the series will go to an even higher level." -- <em>Brian Mazique </em>[<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2024/07/19/ea-college-football-25-review-the-good-the-bad-and-the-bottom-line/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2><strong>Polygon - No score</strong></h2><p>It’s a testament to what is possible with sports games when teams have longer than a few months to crank out AAA titles. And if this is the foundation for future college football games, then the series is in a very, very good place." -- <em>Matt Brown </em>[<a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/24201283/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-ncaa-ps5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2><strong>GamesRadar -- 4.5/5</strong></h2><p>"From nowhere, it's suddenly the sports game that all others have to beat." -- <em>Ben Wilson </em>[<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/college-football-25-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2><strong>Hardcore Gamer -- 4.5/5</strong></h2><p>"EA put all of its chips into College Football 25, and it truly paid off. People are buying consoles just to play this game. It's a cultural phenomenon and the experience that's provided isn't replicated anywhere else. All the new additions to help make the game stand out including Wear and Tear, Turbo Mode, different coverage shells and added hot routes for pre-play, and basically everything added isn't just a gimmick, it's a substantial change.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/tsukihimes-turned-me-into-visual-novel-fan<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While the rest of the world was playing <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, </em>I was playing <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legendary-visual-novel-tsukihime-piece-of-blue-glass-moon-gets-first-english-trailer">Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-</a>. </em></p>
<p>Obviously, these games are on completely opposite sides of the spectrum. One is this highly involved, hard-as-nails action game. The other is a visual novel, more similar to reading a book than it is playing a video game. Yet, I haven't been this hooked on a game in years. <em>Tsukihime,</em> you convinced me: Visual novels are freakin' awesome.</p>
<p><em>Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- </em>is a rather obscure title for those unfamiliar with visual novels, but it came to my attention after diving headfirst into the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fatesamurai-remnant-review-musou-holy-grail"><em>Fate</em></a> franchise. <em>Tsukihime</em> shares the same universe, so I already had a bit of familiarity with the subject matter, though if you want to go in blind, this is a perfectly fine experience on its own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-narative.jpg?itok=5n2pq32J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-narative.jpg?itok=w7nf8wwh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nasu's known for a certain writing style, and if "edgy" is what you'd call it, hey, count me in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Visual Novels Like <em>Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon- </em>Might Just Put You in a Trance</h2>
<p>This particular version of <em>Tsukihime</em> is a remake that originally released in Japan in 2021, but the West finally received an official English release in June 2024. I admit, I was very apprehensive. My previous foray into visual novels wasn't as enjoyable as I would have wanted, but like any piece of media, sometimes it takes a few tries before you find something that clicks.</p>
<p>And click, <em>Tsukihime </em>did. This visual novel is a treat to the eyes and ears, immersing the player in a narrative filled with magic, vampires, and plenty of emotional twists and turns. And that's the thing: I normally wouldn't attribute "immersive" to a very passive experience like a visual novel, but<em> Tsukihime</em> achieves just that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-narrative-2.jpg?itok=qHrlhiJT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-narrative-2.jpg?itok=q4usgo74 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shiki isn't your normal high schooler.</figcaption></figure><p>Exceptional voice acting with polished character art and backgrounds accompany words on the screen, and this combination creates a clear and cohesive image in my head as I read. Though there's little motion to these images, in my mind I can see this living and breathing world <em>Tsukihime</em> so clearly conveys.</p>
<p>Sound effects and music coalesce with the narrative as you read, putting me in a dream-like trance. These aspects of <em>Tsukihime</em> might sound like any other visual novel, but as someone who has little to no experience with the medium, the psychological aspects of reading took me by surprise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-vlov-2.jpg?itok=jiNxaKES 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-vlov-2.jpg?itok=zNENrI72 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Action-packed moments are still a thing, despite being a visual novel.</figcaption></figure><h2>Find Yourself a Story with a Hook</h2>
<p>Of course, <em>Tsukihime</em>'s story is what keeps me coming back. You play through the eyes of Shiki Tohno, an anemic high schooler with a very powerful supernatural ability: the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. Shiki can see red lines marked on every object and living thing in the world -- these are lines of death which, when severed, mark a permanent end for whatever it was on.</p>
<p>The player learns more about Mystic Eyes of Death Perception and the effect it has on Shiki and those around him. When Shiki gained these eyes after a horrific accident during his childhood, he was warned it may attract other "strange" things. After being outcast from his insanely rich family's mansion, he is summoned to the mansion a decade later to take up the role as eldest son once more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-dialogue.jpg?itok=_Yg_8v_A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-dialogue.jpg?itok=7pbBOJlN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tsukihime</em> takes time to brief the player on the world, and worldbuilding is exactly my cup of tea.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Tsukihime</em> takes a bit to ramp up, but the visual novel takes many unexpected turns. Vampires and some of the most bombastic fights in fiction are thrown in the player's face as the combination of voice acting, detailed visuals, and well-written dialogue constantly barrage the player in its latter half.</p>
<p>To dive into more detail on the characters and scenes in <em>Tsukihime</em>, well, we'd be here all day. And look, this is not a short experience -- with three different endings, it'll probably take up to 40 hours to finish everything.</p>
<p>So I'll keep it brief and say, I did not expect to get so emotionally involved in a game, much less a visual novel. In fact, few pieces of media hit me as hard as <em>Tsukihime</em> did. A key character, Arcueid, well, her story was so potent to me, I had to emotionally detach myself from the visual novel so it didn't make me a mess. And that is when I realized, if visual novels can do this to me, what else might there be in store?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-flowchart.jpg?itok=7gL0LYRW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-flowchart.jpg?itok=SBv2h1se 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is the flowchart feature, allowing you to jump to previous scenes.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Tsukihime </em>Came Equipped With Handy Tools for Beginners</h2>
<p>Visual novels are already a bit light on gameplay features, but <em>Tsukihime</em> makes things a breeze if this is your first foray into a the genre. There's the bare minimum you'd expect (a reading log, quick save and quick loads), but also other inclusions that made this much more accessible. It was a misconception of mine to go in expecting visual novels to be clunky, but everything flows very well.</p>
<p>There's a flowchart that allows players to jump around the story with ease, collecting new scenes or, if you have a change of heart or even <em>die</em> in the story, allows for a way to fix your mistakes. Though, if you do die, it'll give you tips on how to change your fate, which is also very appreciated as a newcomer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tsukihime-accessibility.jpg?itok=ahAlWMLr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tsukihime-accessibility.jpg?itok=h49xs7la 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's some handy features to make your reading experience smoother.</figcaption></figure><p>Other than that, there are three endings which means three routes, but a decent amount of overlap in the beginning. There's a feature that can automatically skip dialogue you've seen, and you can also adjust the speed in which new dialogue is shown. You can finely tune the timing on these, so developer Type-Moon clearly tried to make this as welcoming an experience as possible.</p>
<p>It was my fault for discounting visual novels as "not for me." If you find yourself in the same shoes, you might just be surprised. Pick up a visual novel with a subject matter that appeals to you -- it doesn't have to be <em>Tsukihime </em>-- and devote yourself to it like it's a great novel. You might just be surprised by how powerful visual novels can be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/19/the-ftc-pushes-back-against-xbox-game-pass-price-increases<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, Xbox <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/10/price-increases-and-new-tiers-are-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">announced</a> it was introducing new Game Pass tiers and raising its subscription prices for existing members on September 12. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took issue with these changes in a filing yesterday to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Microsoft revealed a new tier called <strong>Xbox Game Pass Standard</strong>, a $15 monthly subscription for new members that excludes day-one releases, EA Play, PC Game Pass, and cloud gaming. <strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</strong>, which includes those perks, will have its monthly price raised from $17 to $20. <strong>Xbox&nbsp;Game Pass Core</strong>, which only offers online play and a smaller library, is raising its yearly sub from $60 to $75 (the $10 monthly fee remains unchanged). <strong>PC Game Pass</strong> is increasing from $10 per month to $12.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the $10.99 <strong>Game Pass for Console</strong> is no longer be available to new subscribers as of July 10. If existing subscribers fail to renew their membership, they will be permanently locked out of this tier and must subscribe to another, more expensive membership.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf">filing</a>, the FTC blasts Microsoft’s discontinuation of Game Pass for Console, stating that users must pay a substantial price increase (81%) to switch to Game Pass Ultimate. Those unwilling to do so must settle for Game Pass Standard, which the FTC describes as a “degraded product” since it excludes day-one releases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“[Game Pass Standard] costs 36% more than Console Game Pass, and withholds day-one releases. Product degradation—removing the most valuable games from Microsoft’s new service—combined with price increases for existing users, is exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged."</p>

<p>The FTC was the primary opposition against Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and sees this move as proof of its concerns over the purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs[…]—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger.”</p>

<p>The FTC goes on to call the price increases "inconsistent" with the case Microsoft made during the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/07/11/microsoft-and-xbox-win-case-against-ftc-to-acquire-activision-blizzard">Xbox FTC trial last year</a>. It states, "Microsoft promised that 'the acquisition would benefit consumers by making [CoD] available on Microsoft’s Game Pass on the day it is released on console (with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition).' Microsoft’s post-merger actions thus vindicate the congressional design of preliminarily halting mergers to fully evaluate their likely competitive effects, and judicial skepticism of promises inconsistent with a firm’s economic incentives."</p>

<p>That last portion references&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-set-for-october" target="_blank">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s (the first new entry to release post-acquisition) October 25 launch on Game Pass Ultimate, roughly a month after the subscription tier's price increase.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-rated-by-esrb-for-pc-ps5-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The US Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> Hunt: Showdown 1986 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Here's the description of the game (which received a Mature 17+ rating):</p>
<p><em>This is a first-person monster hunting game set in a fantastical version of the Victorian era. Players use bladed bats, clubs, brass knuckles, and pistols to kill zombie-like creatures and human rivals. Combat is highlighted by impact sounds, gunfire, and blood-splatter effects. Some weapons allow players to cave in zombies' heads or to cut off their limbs. One type of zombie explodes into blood and viscera when killed; another type is depicted wearing human skin as a cape.</em></p>
<p>Notably, this is a separate listing from Hunt: Showdown. Before you dream of a sequel, though, Crytek General Manager David Fifield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crytek-will-never-replace-hunt-showdown-with-hunt-2-the-way-overwatch-2-did-overwatch-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Rock, Paper, Shotgun in late 2023 that such a thing was not at all in the plans:</p>
<p><em>I would say we would even be less aggressive than Overwatch or, you know, Destiny 2. No, we have no plans for Hunt 2. We just plan to keep going forward. </em><em>You could say that chapter two of Fortnite was Fortnite 2 - they made a new island, they radically overhauled a whole, giant part of all its systems, but they just called it chapter two of a game called Fortnite. So that seems to be more the trend that we'll follow, when updating Hunt: Showdown.</em></p>
<p><em>If we talked about other products in the Hunt franchise, they wouldn't be replacements to Hunt: Showdown, they'd be brand extensions. Here's another game you could make in the Hunt universe, but that game wouldn't be meant to replace Hunt: Showdown, the thing people play.</em></p>
<p>So, maybe Hunt: Showdown 1896 is going to be a brand extension, as suggested a while ago by Fifield. Or, more likely, this is simply the rebrand of the game itself. The developers have hinted at such a thing, and we already know that next month, they will <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-ps5-xbox-series-x-update-release-date-support-xbox-one-ps4-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add</a> proper PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X support while dropping old-generation consoles, which are indeed absent in the ESRB listing.</p>
<p>Either way, big changes are on the way for the game.</p>

<p>The EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) marketing director at Xbox says that the company “isn’t blessed” with a large budget in the region, leading to PlayStation outspending them on marketing in the region.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/xboxs-marketing-boss-fight-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketing Week</a>, Michael Flatt said that Xbox needs to “work really hard” against the competition. That work includes being “quite scrappy”.</p>



<p>“They’re [PlayStation] blessed with marketing funds that we’re just not able to enjoy,” Flatt said. “But that’s totally fine. We adopt what I would call a more fiscally responsible approach to media investments.”</p>

<p>He continued: “We’re not blessed with huge media budgets, so we have to be quite scrappy really, and quite tenacious to fight for funds that would probably go somewhere else.”</p>



<p>This interview comes after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-stop-pushing-xbox-consoles-in-europe-other-regions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims of Microsoft looking to stop</a> pushing console sales in the EMEA region. Instead, Xbox will reportedly put more of a focus on Game Pass, Cloud Gaming, PC, and Xbox controllers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/building-a-new-star-wars-moon-for-outlaws-ign-first<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At the very heart of Star Wars Outlaws is the fantasy that all sci-fi fans dream of: the ability to adventure across the stars. Five different moons and planets await you, from Rise of Skywalker’s chilly Kijimi to the classic deserts of Tatooine. But while fans will recognise many of Outlaws’ locations, there’s one that they definitely won’t: Toshara. </p><p>A brand new moon crafted especially for Star Wars Outlaws by the development team at Massive Entertainment, Toshara is inspired by the East African savannah. But while it has uniquely beautiful landscapes, it is – aptly for a game called ‘Star Wars Outlaws’ – a criminal hive. </p><p>“It's run by a corrupt imperial governor,” says Navid Khavari, Outlaws’ narrative director. “And while the Empire is in charge, this is also a hub of scum and villainy, and you have all the sorts of major syndicates trying to vie for a stake of Toshara.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/starwarsoutlaws-newmoon-landscape-1720445484854.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Toshara is inspired by savannah regions such as Tanzania. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>To ensure Toshara is as immersive and authentic as possible, Massive approached the moon from all angles. “We had to work out the demographics of the planet,” Khavari explains. “We had to work out what the major hubs are. We had to work out fauna, flora, all of these sections that needed to come together and also be weaved by narratives.”  </p><p>But before all that, Massive had to pitch Toshara to the custodians of Star Wars: Lucasfilm. Because Toshara isn’t just a location for a video game; anything in Star Wars Outlaws is canon, and so whatever Massive made would need to be fully approved by the people behind the films, shows, and Star Wars universe at large. </p><p>“It's like they're giving us a box of toys, we take the toys out, play with them, but then we also create our new toys and put them back for somebody else to play,” says Benedikt Podlesnigg, art and world director on Star Wars Outlaws. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While the Empire is in charge, this is also a hub of scum and villainy.</p></div><p>A major player in such a process is Steve Blank, director of franchise content and strategy at Lucasfilm. “Massive came to us with the idea of a savannah planet,” he recalls. “Once we sort of knew the high level intention behind the story and where we wanted to go, we let them ruminate on what does that mean? What would you like to see? What do you feel like you haven't seen before?”</p><p>The result of those conversations was a collection of unusual and familiar ideas. Massive wanted Toshara to be a world where the Star Wars mythology’s pirate-inspired elements could live – think Jabba’s barge and Luke being forced to walk the plank over a sarlacc pit. This had to be a place of high risk, high reward treasure hunting. And so was born the so-called gem of the underworld; a moon ruled by a corrupt division of the Empire and largely controlled by the galaxy’s crime syndicates. But it wasn’t enough to develop lore. The team had to start with the look and feel of the very ground itself. </p><p>“We approached Toshara in terms of the general Star Wars design tenets, where it has to be familiar but with a twist,” explains Julian Gerighty, creative director of Outlaws. The familiar is the landscapes of Tanzania, which Podlesnigg says would be the shooting location for Tosharan scenes if Outlaws were a movie. Layered on top of this is the twist: “huge mountain outcrops that have been carved so that a city can take place within those rock walls,” describes Gerighty. And then, within that rock, is Toshara’s most distinct characteristic: amberine. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/starwarsoutlaws-newmoon-city-1720445391303.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The crime-ridden city of Mirogana is built inside the amberine outcrops of a mountain. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Amberine is an orange, crystal-like material that runs through the crust of Toshara and juts out through its surface. Inspired by an old Austrian fortune-telling tradition in which molten lead is poured into cold water to create shapes that reveal what’s to come, the Amberine forms into a variety of striking forms. It is Blank’s favourite part of Massive’s new world. </p><p>“You find [amberine structures] sort of wherever you're going,” he says. “They're inside caves, they form plateaus [...] and they also react beautifully to the sun over Toshara, so you get these gorgeous reflections in the lighting.” </p><p>Unusually for Star Wars, amberine isn’t a precious resource like spice or Beskar Steel, and so Toshara’s population has left it untouched and intact. That’s not to say the crystal is useless, though. The moon’s climate is incredibly windy, and those winds erode away rocks, cliff faces, even mountains – a process that gradually reveals the incredibly resilient amberine within. It made sense, then, that Toshara’s main metropolis, the city of Mirogana, would be built within an amberine structure to protect it from the winds. </p><p>Basking within the orange glow cast by sunlight filtering through that amberine shield is the Pyke Syndicate, the most dominant of Mirogana’s criminal organisations. But don’t let them put you off visiting; the city’s busy streets are full of opportunities for both a galactic scoundrel scouting for gigs, and a player looking to diversify their experience.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The first thing that you should do as a scoundrel is go to the cantina.</p></div><p>“Every single location we had to choose had to be a den of scum and villainy, right? And in Mirogana you can do a lot of things,” says Gerighty. “There's the first thing that you should do as a scoundrel, as an outlaw, is go to the cantina. And in the cantina you'll find lots of shady characters that'll offer you jobs. Or you can just relax, eavesdrop, pick up some intel, play a couple of games of sabacc, bet on the Fathier races, play some arcade games…” </p><p>Beyond the cantina you’ll find a city split into several regions, each with their own flavour. The gambling district is constructed using different architecture and signage to the central market, while the Imperial checkpoint is built out of the Empire’s instantly recognisable flat panels and grid vents. No matter where you find an Imperial base on Toshara, it’ll stick out like a sore thumb. </p><p>“They come in, they don't care about their environment, they just stamp down their base wherever they need,” says Podlesnigg. He paints a picture of a time when the Tosharan landscape featured a colossal amberine archway, but when the Empire arrived they simply demolished the arch to make way for the base. In the game, you’ll be able to see that very base flanked by two amberine pillars – all that remains of that historic arch. “It creates a really interesting visual that's seen from far away that you can really use as a landmark.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/starwarsoutlaws-imperialcompoundconceptart-1720425543767.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Tosharan Imperial Base, flanked by the remains of an amberine arch. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Beyond the city’s borders, the aforementioned winds have eroded away the moon’s rock surface to reveal even more unusual amberine formations. A resourceful outlaw with a speeder bike could use such formations to hit even greater speeds during hot pursuits. </p><p>“It's very orange glowing, so it stands out very naturally in the environment,” says Podlesnigg. “So we could make ramps where you can jump off [while riding the speeder bike]. We made the wind tunnels where you can see [how they have been] carved out by the winds. I think one of the references was surfing underneath waves.” </p><p>In the process of planning out Toshara’s geography, Massive went as far as establishing that the moon’s wind currents all run north to south. This dictated the map’s population density, road networks, audio design, and – importantly – the formation of the speed-boosting wind tunnels. And so while the amberine ramps and tunnels may be a gameplay-first element, it’s all created hand-in-hand with world-building. </p><p>“For every location, no matter how small, we want to think about what happened here, what is happening now, and what is the location in general? What [do] people do here?” explains Podlesnigg. “So we have a very clear idea of the history of the place and what the place is.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For every location, no matter how small, we want to think about what happened here, what is happening now?</p></div><p>A skilled outlaw can harness the moon’s winds for their benefit, but not everyone is prepared to tackle such a climate. Echoing the derelict Star Destroyer on Jakku in The Force Awakens, Toshara is littered with crashed starships. They’re the remnants of those who tried to fight the winds and lost. It’s a smart bit of environmental storytelling, but the tale doesn’t end there. Those shipwrecks have become part of Toshara’s history and economy; with nothing but rock and amberine available to the moon’s population, the crashed ships were harvested for metal which was then used to construct many of the buildings you’ll see and explore.  </p><p>With so much of Toshara’s environment being made up of harsh rock, crashed spaceships, and strange amberine structures, the finishing touch had to be something much more alive and endearing. While the crime syndicates may be the planet’s apex predators, there are plenty of other creatures in the wilds to discover and befriend. Podlesnigg describes a magpie-like flying creature that’s “attracted by everything that sparkles, and they steal everything.” It’s an amusing trait, but one that folds directly into gameplay: “When you see them circling somewhere, maybe you can go there and find something of value.”</p><p>A cuter friend can be found in Toshara's weasel-like creatures, small pettable animals that will follow you around in groups. We can only hope that we’ll be able to round up a dozen and cause chaos in a cantina… </p><p>Toshara has yet more secrets to be discovered, but we won’t know this new moon’s best treasures until we explore it ourselves when Star Wars Outlaws arrives on August 30.

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

                <p>Prime Video's The Boys TV series wrapped up its fourth season this week, and the season went out with a bang. Now, the show's creator and showrunner has provided a peek behind the curtain of how the most climatic part of the finale was created, and it's getting people talking about the possibility of a video game based on The Boys. <strong>Major s</strong><strong>poilers follow below.</strong></p><p>Eric Kripke revealed that the team works with Cncpt Studio to create detailed CG pre-visualizations for major scenes prior to filming, and this was the case for the season finale. Creating a pre-vis sequence like this can help the team decide on camera positions, lens, and coverage, Kripke said, all without having actors rehearse in person. Peter Jackson famously used pre-vis animatics to plan out some of its biggest and most complicated scenes as well. Many Hollywood productions do this.</p><p>For the season finale of The Boys, Kripke enlisted Cncpt's help for the pivotal sequence where Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) launches tentacles out of his chest and uses them to rip the would-be president Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) in half. Cncpt's pre-vis of this sequence is pretty impressive in its own right, featuring all the main characters and their movements from the scene in pretty solid detail.</p><p>"Our team is amazing," Kripke said of the work. Take a look at the video for yourself below.</p><p>The impressive-looking character models have people calling on Prime Video to make a video game based on The Boys. It remains to be seen if that would ever happen, and the rights might be a little complicated given that The Boys is produced by Sony Pictures Television for Prime Video. Both Sony and Amazon have their own dedicated gaming divisions, too.</p><p>Characters from The Boys have already come to video games, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-brings-back-the-boys-dlc-soon-along-with-these-unexpected-bundles/1100-6523618/" data-ref-id="1100-6523618">Homelander, Starlight, and Black Noir were added to Call of Duty as playable characters</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-teaser-shows-first-look-at-homelander-in-action/1100-6523183/" data-ref-id="1100-6523183">Homelander alone came to Mortal Kombat. </a></p><p>The Boys will return for one final season to come, but it won't be here anytime soon. In the meantime, fans can look forward to Gen V Season 2 at some point sooner.
