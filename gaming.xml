            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-old-dungeon-keys-are-not-included-in-the-legacy-collection-bundle/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2s-old-dungeon-keys-are-not-included-in-the-legacy-collection-bundle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The consensus on <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s latest expansion pack is quite clear: <em>The Final Shape</em> is a delight in most ways that matter, and it delivers <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a superb finale to the Light and Dark saga</a>. For those eager to grab all the available content through the Legacy Collection, though, there is bad news.</p> <p data-characters="628" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">Specifically, even though it’s a good thing that Bungie has bundled all of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s previous expansion packs into a single Legacy Collection bundle (which makes the deal particularly enticing for newcomers), you don’t <em>actually</em> get all of the older legacy content at once. Instead, you’ll still be missing out on Dungeon Keys for the <em>Lightfall</em> and <em>Witch Queen</em> expansion packs. In effect, this means you only get access to the three classic dungeons (Pit of Heresy, Shattered Throne, and Grasp of Avarice) and the free Prophecy dungeon, while the remainder you’ll need to spend even more money on.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-you-re-not-getting-dungeon-keys-in-the-destiny-2-legacy-collection-bundle" data-injectable="false">You’re not getting Dungeon Keys in the Destiny 2: Legacy Collection bundle</h2> <p data-characters="593" data-current-count="893" data-injectable="true">Dungeons are, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-destiny-2-dungeons-in-release-order-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I myself have previously established</a>, a crucial aspect of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s endgame content. Not having access to them is something you’re bound to feel as you progress from the early stages of your progression over to advanced tiers and begin seeking out top-tier equipment and Exotics. The fact that purchasing the $69,99 Legacy Collection bundle only nets you one <em>half</em> of the grand total of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s dungeon roster is disappointing, to say the least. As the Reddit thread embedded above shows, the players aren’t thrilled with this development, either.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Each Dungeon Key (i.e. two dungeons) sets you back a whopping 2,000 Silver, too. This means that after you’ve already spent about $70 USD on the base gameplay experience, you’ll also need to spend an additional $40 USD to fill out your collection. Further, more dungeons <em>are</em> on the way, so if you get really hooked on the admittedly tense and rewarding gameplay loop of your average dungeon, you should be prepared to splurge even more money in the future.</p>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">It’s not a phenomenal look, no matter how you flip it. And, while the Legacy Collection itself is bound to go on sale sooner or later, Bungie isn’t particularly keen on discounting Silver in the Eververse store, so the odds are solid that those Dungeon Keys will only be available at full price for the foreseeable future.</p> <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="808" data-injectable="false">Certainly, you <em>could </em>argue that none of this diminishes the huge win that is <em>The Final Shape</em> DLC. You could technically enjoy it as a standalone experience, for sure, but much of it hinges heavily on you having experienced the prior <em>Destiny</em> content to some extent, and while dungeons themselves aren’t entirely crucial, it still feels kind of strange to see them carved out of the equation in such a manner. So, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-destiny-2-the-final-shape-the-franchise-renaissance-weve-been-waiting-for-or-just-another-outlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as per usual, it’s a give and a take with <em>Destiny</em></a>.</p>

<p data-characters="343" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Warframe’s</em> Jade Shadows update comes with a lot of new content that’s immediately interesting. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-jade-shadows-quest-in-warframe/">new cinematic quest</a> is great for those who’ve caught up with the story so far, the newest frame Jade makes for a great support frame, and all the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-evensong-in-warframe/">new weapons make for easy Mastery</a>, or possibly some new tools for your arsenal. </p> <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="165" data-injectable="false">One aspect that’s not talked about much however can be massive for your builds. Here are all the new mods introduced with <em>Warframe’s</em> Jade Shadows update.</p> <h2 id="h-every-new-mod-with-the-jade-shadows-update-for-warframe" data-injectable="false">Every new mod with the Jade Shadows update for Warframe</h2> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">While not many mods were introduced with this update, four new augment mods are available for <strong>Protea, Sevagoth, Dagath, and Qorvex</strong>. Each of these can be slotted into that frame to change up one of that frame’s abilities, giving it more functionality or completing transforming it. Here is each mod, along with what it does:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Temporal Artillery </strong>(Protea) <ul> <li><strong>Blaze Artillery Augment: </strong>When Temporal Anchor is activated, one existing Artillery unit will attach to Protea, halting its duration countdown. Max combo count is 20x.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Dark Propagation</strong> (Sevagoth) <ul> <li><strong>Sow Augment:</strong> Enemies killed while inflicted with Sow spread its effect in a 15m radius. Shadow’s Death Harvest also inflicts Sow.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Spectral Spirit</strong> (Dagath) <ul> <li><strong>Grave Spirit Augment:</strong> Immediately assume Grave Spirit’s Spectral Form. 100% chance for weapons and abilities to apply Doom. Kills outside of Spectral Form decrease its cooldown by 1s.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Wrecking Wall</strong> (Qorvex) <ul> <li><strong>Containment Wall Augment: </strong>Strip 50% of armor and shields from struck enemies. Hitting five or more enemies will restart the duration of any Chyrinka Pillars and empower them.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="false">While most of these augment mods will likely have niche uses if not being completely outclassed, the augment mod for Qorvex is particularly interesting. <strong>Armor strip builds</strong> are a major thing for late-game content in <em>Warframe</em>, so having one ability provide 50% armor strip is massive and helps reduce the amount of other armor stripping you might need.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/another-super-sized-fallout-mod-is-in-trouble.906087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-on-hold/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last year, I covered the release of a trailer designed to showcase Fallout: Nuevo México, an ambitious game-sized Fallout 4 mod that planned to introduce a whole new world. With the publication of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-trailer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">18-minute gameplay walkthrough</a>, Fallout: Nuevo México was revealed as an open-ended and inviting project, but things went a little quiet after that.</p>



<p>It has now been announced that Fallout: Nuevo México is on hold indefinitely and the project lead has departed the development team. Months ago, the trailers related to Nuevo México were deleted, which was bad enough by itself, but now that the lead developer, ‘Zapshock’, has stepped back from the squad, there are serious doubts that it’ll ever surface.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unexpected-stop">Unexpected Stop</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, Fallout: London was delayed indefinitely following the news that the Fallout 4 next-gen update was on the horizon. When it was released, the team working on Fallout: London for the last few years were forced to come to terms with the fact that work they’d completed up until that point would have, in the worst case, been rendered DOA based on the sizeable update pushed out by Bethesda Game Studios.</p>



<p>Fallout: London was ‘supposed’ to have been released in April, but now there are no indications of when it’ll see the light of day – if it does at all.</p>



<p>Nuevo México was shaping up to be something more tied to the roots of the Fallout series. It was set five years after the first game in a region familiar to the series, whereas Fallout: London toyed immensely with the lore of the universe, placing players in the United Kingdom and creating an entirely original experience. </p>



<p>Nuevo México looks ready to be scrapped entirely and Fallout: London is on the ropes. It’s a sad time to be a Fallout mods fan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/evil-genius-games-owner-promotes-nft-tech-despite-company-policy-being-against-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new tabletop company is mired in an NFT controversy. Some are marketing stunts like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-to-produce-limited-run-printable-nfts" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Exploding Kittens'</em> physical NFTs</a>. Others are dubious grifts like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wonders-of-first-ccg-to-be-removed-from-kickstarter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wonders of the First</a></em>. Then there are conflicts of policy and stance like Evil Genius Games owner Dave Scott promoting NFTs and Web3 technology despite the company's code of ethics being against their use.</p>
<h2>Evil Genius Games owner and NFTs</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/is-evil-genius-games-doubling-down-on-nfts-blockchain.704819/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report by ENworld</a>, Scott had participated in a pitch competition at Consensus 2024. Consensus 2024 is held in Texas and is run by Coindesk, one of the largest media and data companies dedicated to global crypto markets, blockchain and Web3 technology.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evil-genius-games-scott-nft-slideshow-screenshot.jpg?itok=WK68Uz3J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evil-genius-games-scott-nft-slideshow-screenshot.jpg?itok=JM-EZdt4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You want your Pacific Rim character turned into a token? Me neither.</figcaption></figure><p>In his pitch, Scott pitched a future of TTRPG offerings that would use the blockchain and NFTs. This pitch involved making turn-based RPGs on chain, minting items, character sheets, adventures, and NPCs as tokens that could be, bought, sold, and traded on chain.</p>
<p>Scott's pitch included a video presentation and an extended Q&amp;A. The video contained illustrations of a possible NFT future for Evil Genius Games' tabletop offerings, showing characters and ideas from their <em>D20 Modern</em>-inspired project <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everyday-heroes-rpg-book-rambo-total-recall" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Everyday Heroes</em></a>. In the Q&amp;A Scott stated the technology wasn't in place but they were starting to set up the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Scott's pitch for an NFT-based TTRPG future won the pitch competition.</p>
<p>Scott's advocacy and promotion of NFTs and Web3 technology opposes Evil Genius Games' code of ethics. On their official website, item number 2 of their <a href="https://evilgeniusgames.com/blog/our-technology-code-of-ethics/">code of ethics</a> states the company will not use blockchain or Web3 tech as part of their technology platform.</p>
<p>Notably, Evil Genius Games' code of ethics on NFTs and Web3 does come with a disclosure note. It states that one of the company's investors is the Blockchain Founders Fund, which heavily invests in Web3 startups. The note explains that an understanding is in place and that Evil Genius Games will not use blockchain technology.</p>
<p>It is a stance that becomes increasingly dubious in light of recent events. After the lawsuit regarding their cancelled <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/evil-genius-games-and-netflix-settle-rebel-moon-ttrpg-lawsuit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Rebel Moon TTRPG</em></a>, employees had begun resigning from the company citing <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/the-rise-and-fall-of-evil-genius-games.702617/">ethical concerns</a>. Those concerns included wage issues, concerns with certain technology being used, as well as interpersonal pressures.</p>
<p>Overall, Scott's presence at Consensus 2024 and the work environment of Evil Genius Games bring many things into question. The policy says one thing while the owner does the opposite. Employees leaving over ethical conflicts exacerbated by the involvement of certain investors.</p>
<p>All around a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/granteasterbrook/2023/03/01/a-beginners-guide-to-the-controversy-over-bitcoin-nfts/">highly controversial</a> technology being potentially incorporated into the distinctly analog hobby of TTRPGs.</p>

			<p>To cap off a memorable 2023 for RPG fans, Owlcat Games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-kingmaker-review-carving-your-own-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wrath of the Righteous</a>) released Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader, the first-ever cRPG based on the beloved setting invented by Games Workshop, last December.</p>
<p>The game earned an 8 out of 10 score in Wccftech's review. Author Francesco Deo Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>Despite not being a hardcore fan of the setting, Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader managed to capture my attention right from the get-go, resulting in an enjoyable experience for the over 50 hours I spent with it. While the game by Owlcat doesn't have the wide appeal of Baldur's Gate 3, it is a solid cRPG that is just a step away from being yet another must-buy title of 2023, mostly due to the lack of polish and some unenjoyable mechanics such as space combat.</em></p>
<p>Six months later, we've interviewed Owlcat Executive Producer Anatoly Shestov to discuss the game's ongoing support (to clean up some of that lack of polish mentioned in our review summary) and the recently announced Void Shadows DLC, which is set to add 15 hours of new story content, a new romanceable companion, and several new features when it launches on August 8. Scroll below for the full transcript of our conversation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Void Shadows DLC Teaser Trailer | Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/obmD2wU9lAs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the fans' reception and the commercial sales of Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader so far?</strong></p>
<p>Well, we delivered the game to the players in December, and the overall reception was quite positive. We were shocked by the positive sentiment that the player base shared with us. Of course, some people were unhappy with our choices with the companions, story decisions, and other stuff. But overall, we were praised for the best depiction of the Warhammer setting ever, not just in CRPG. And the praises were there, and they were deserved.</p>
<p>We definitely did not do everything that we wanted to do. That's why we continued to support the game, not just with bug fixing but with the overall improvement of performance, quality of life, and the different nuances of the game. By this time, we have already delivered around 10 patches, each targeting different sections of the game.</p>
<p>We're almost there to have the game we want to play ourselves, want to play more, want to replay with different play styles. For example, with the last patch, we delivered the certification of Steam Deck support. It was not just for the player base, for the audience. We just felt that the controls' experience could be better in our game, that it's not so comfortable to dig through text, it's not so comfortable to pick options, so we decided to pursue this not because of the value but because of our internal desire to make this aspect of the game better and based on the players' reception, based on our feedback and internal experience, we feel like we're there on this particular part.</p>
<p>A bit later, we will deliver a huge 1.2 patch to the player base with lots of additional balance tweaks and changes because players found ways to break our game through a bunch of bugs. They found such powerful combinations that they could defeat bosses in one turn, so we wanted to fix this. On the other hand, we wanted to improve those not-so-popular and less-than-effective builds.</p>
<p>Overall, we spent a lot of time on this particular thing and lots of small aspects of the game. For example, the user interface wasn't so nice and stylish and bright, so we tweaked lots of things. Overall, the interaction with every UI element of the game should feel smoother and easier. Our main UI art developer was given the freedom to play himself and fix the things that he felt were not as perfect as he wanted them to be.</p>
<p>Many things we are approaching at this particular moment revolve around our internal experience of playing Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader and adjusting it to feel better. That's basically how we perceive what we're doing right now. Aside from the DLCs that are in the process of being made, we just make sure that every part of the game will see some additional portion of love, attention, and care from the developers.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned Improving the interface. Does that include improving the controller UI specifically?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the overall scheme of interaction with the game was tuned. Most of the annoying bugs were fixed, and playing the game via controller now should feel better. I'm not saying it's ideal, but we made a real effort to improve it.</p>
<p><strong>When do you think this patch will go live?</strong></p>
<p>I won't promise you any precise date, but yeah, the patch is scheduled for this Summer. We will definitely make an appropriate communication to the community closer to the release of this patch.</p>
<p><strong>The recent announcement was about the first Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader DLC, Void Shadows. Can you talk about that and what you're going to add to the game with this DLC?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. Our overall desire to work within the Warhammer universe is the same. It's a desire to tell stories about things that happen there aside from the battlefield itself. Void Shadows, our DLC, is focused on the Genestealer Cult and the Death Cult Assassins. This is our way of discussing things that have happened before and after battles. Whenever you see the actual squadrons and the heavy army taking their place, there is some legwork prior to that. Some preparations are made for it, and these preparations affect the lives of the people, how different parts of the setting react to it, how they protect from it, or how they try to facilitate it.</p>
<p>It's an interesting, fruitful field for telling meaningful stories. That's why we decided to approach it as the first DLC. Of course, it allows us to tell more about the Voidship, more about the life and the people in it, and how it ties the main character with the others. One of the particular challenges was not to make things one-dimensional. Like, this is 100 percent enemies, this is 100 percent friends. Just, like, take your friends and kill your enemies. It's not how we tell stories here at Owlcat. We aim to at least point to the different sides and different perceptions of the events. What we came up with is this kinda emotional and deep narrative.</p>
<p>Mechanics-wise, there will be a new first-tier career and a second-tier career. One will revolve around lots of blade attacks. The second will revolve around different kinds of damage-over-time effects and manipulation with them. We are also introducing a new companion, Kibellah, a Death Cult Assassin built upon these two careers. With Void Shadows, we are also adding new layers of ship customization and several interesting custom-made space battles. And, of course, lots of regular exploration battles.</p>
<p><strong>I also read that there will be some new crew members and officers.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. To tell the story of the Voidship is to tell the story of the people who live there. We can't just add some random people on the lower decks. We are introducing new officers. There will be different departments of the ship that are not in a good relationship with each other, and the struggle between them will be an important part of the story. I don't want to spoil the fun beforehand, though.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Our vision for Rogue Trader DLCs is an organic evolution of the initial story'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I wanted to ask if the Void Shadows story takes place after the main Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader campaign, or is it supposed to occur sometime in the middle of it?</strong></p>
<p>It's a part of the main story. It's integrated into the main story, so it's not like a completely separate instance that you're playing as a separate entity. No, it's an addition to the regular story, to the main part of Rogue Trader. The story will happen mostly in the second and fourth chapters of the game.</p>
<p>Any player who has already played the campaign will be able to just continue his own play and receive all the DLC content, while a new player will experience a more polished, more, more organic, I guess, more organic story of the Koronus Expanse itself. That's our vision of the DLCs for Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader. They won't be separate entities but an organic evolution of the initial story, with it branching out for the different aspects of the world and the setting.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned some improvements to the space battles. Can you speak to that as well?</strong></p>
<p>There are lots of bug fixes, new types of equipment, new enemies, new types of space battles, and more. We are not introducing the option to skip the space battles. If you are inside one, you need to play it, but they are not mandatory at all. We also feel that we crafted quite interesting space battle encounters for this particular DLC.</p>
<p>They've got a unique feeling inside them, and there are even some immersive story elements inside them, so I strongly recommend anyone who didn't like the space battles to give it one more try, and the ones who do, just play through them. It will be worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Actually, earlier this morning, I was browsing the Rogue Trader subreddit. Someone had just written that they liked your game's ship battles more than those of an actual strategy game like Battlefleet Gothic: Armada.</strong></p>
<p>That's a super game. There are lots of fans of that game on our team. We didn't try to copy/paste it. We were trying to grasp the cornerstone feelings of it and to make them viable in a CRPG. What we ultimately came up with is some kind of spice. Not everyone likes it, but the ones who do like it really like it.</p>
<p>We try to aim at such things. We don't aim to create things that everyone will like. We don't do every part of the game for everyone. We just try to find such a proportion of things that any person, any player, will find something for themselves. Whenever some users say, 'We like your narrative, but we don't like your battles,' or vice-versa, that's fine for us. We never thought 100% of our game would appeal to 100% of the audience, not just because it's impossible but also because we don't like compromises.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We don't aim to create things that everyone will like. We don't like compromises.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You'll release a free update alongside the Void Shadows DLC, correct?</strong></p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share its main features?</strong></p>
<p>It's balancing, quality of life improvements, bug fixes, and an overhaul of the abilities and items. There's also some additional polish. Some areas will receive fully updated lighting, and others will get huge changes to AI interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider releasing more voiced dialogues in the future, or is it just too expensive?</strong></p>
<p>That would be very expensive, not just because of the voiceover itself but also because we have over one million words in Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader. To fully integrate new voiceovers would be tough. We already added some new voiceover throughout free patches, though, and we are considering the possibility of adding more. Of course, the DLCs will have their own new voiced dialogues.</p>
<p><strong>Owlcat isn't just busy with Rogue Trader, as you've also just released A Dance of Masks, the final DLC for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. That RPG received five DLCs in total. Is that the same amount you're planning for Rogue Trader?</strong></p>
<p>There's no such thing as a desired set number of DLCs. We'd like to add more stories, though. As long as we see the audience's support, we'll deliver new Rogue Trader content. If, at any time, this support should diminish, we would reconsider our options as a business. For now, I don't see any signs of Owlcat stopping support for the game.</p>
<p><strong>One last question. I noticed that you released Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous on Nintendo Switch via cloud. Is there a chance you'd do the same with Rogue Trader?</strong></p>
<p>It's too early to talk about the game coming to other platforms than those where it is already available. However, we are open to any option to make the game available to other audiences. If we find a solid business plan, we'll definitely pursue it. For now, we're just unsure if there is one.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you'd like to say to the Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader community?</strong></p>
<p>We delivered the game with way more bugs than we should have, and we worked our asses off as humanly possible to fix that. So, we wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone in the community who supported us from the get-go. It means the world to us.</p>
<p>For everyone who has wondered, 'Is it time to play the game yet?' I think it's definitely time now. If you still feel something is missing, go to our Discord, Twitter/X, Reddit, or whatever, and let us know. We will keep trying to improve it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24181315/star-wars-acolyte-justice-for-kelnacca<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="F4WlmN">[<strong>Ed. note: </strong>This post discusses events through episode 4 of <em>The Acolyte</em>.]</p>
<p id="hBFJFx">Men only want to hear one thing, and it’s disgusting: Wookie Jedi. According to my research, so do women, and nonbinary folk. In fact, “Wookie Jedi” is one of the most thrilling <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars">Star Wars</a>-related phrases one can utter, a character idea so dope it doesn’t seem legal. Well, in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23673259/star-wars-high-republic-explained">Star Wars’ High Republic era</a>, it <em>is</em>: Burryaga, a young Wookie Jedi, is prominent in the many High Republic novels you can read, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171654/star-wars-acolyte-series-jedi-sol-force-powers-mind-reading"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> finally gave him an on-screen counterpart. That’s right, I’m talking about Kelnacca, the Wookie with a wicked topknot that the show has <em>done dirty</em>. This cannot stand. </p>
<p id="pcKpaP">To recap, the narrative spine of <em>The Acolyte</em> thus far has been Mae (Amandla Stenberg) and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171592/star-wars-acolyte-kill-jedi-mae-sith-master-no-weapon">her mission to kill the Jedi</a> present at the death of the coven that raised her and her lost twin, Osha (also Stenberg). One of those Jedi was Kelnacca, next on Mae’s hit list in <em>The Acolyte</em>’s fourth episode. <em>However</em>, instead of a sick Kelnacca/Mae fight that showcases the sheer prowess of a Force-sensitive Wookie, we get anticlimax. There is no Kelnacca showdown, because Mae’s masked master has rudely beaten her to him. He’s dead. </p>
<p id="3fvDiN">Hey Lucasfilm: How are you going to do Kelnacca like that? Wookies have been playing second fiddle to their relatively hairless costars for decades now. Does Kelnacca even share a scene with another Wookiee that’s not about a non-Wookie? I don’t think so. You failed the Wookiee Bechdel Test, <em>The Acolyte</em>. </p>
<p id="06VnqK">Way back in 2016, when Netflix’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/stranger-things"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> debuted, fans got all in a tizzy over the death of minor character Barb, played by Shannon Purser. “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/7/13202170/stranger-things-season-2-justice-for-barb">Justice for Barb</a>,” the fans said, rallying online. I didn’t really get it then and I don’t get it now, but I suppose it’s nice to feel part of something, to know that lots of other people seem to care about fringe TV characters you have an affection for. </p>
<p id="aSmuVP">Such is the case with Kelnacca. I cannot be the only one out here who wants my badass Wookie boy to have his day in the sun, wrecking… whoever the bad guys are at this point in Star Wars history. Tax evaders? </p>
<p id="0wXtvj">Anyway, justice for Kelnacca! If <em>The Acolyte</em> doesn’t give us a flashback episode starring him, I will be <em>quite</em> cross. Don’t make me write another blog. I’ll do it. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallen-aces-preview-its-gabagood.906039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fallen-aces-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fallen Aces</em> is clearly a labor of love. Developed by Trey Powell and Jason Bond, this<a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/new-blood-interactive"> New Blood Interactive</a>-published title nails this hand-drawn, noir-inspired mafia game and offers a compelling introduction to the crime-ridden city of Switchblade City. Main character Mike's adventure through these mean streets offers up a compelling story full of twists and turns. This is one tasty helping of gabagool, boys.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-aces-rat.jpg?itok=8SuDPaBi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-aces-rat.jpg?itok=gLcBK_Vd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's immersive in that you can grab a rat and use it as a weapon.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Fallen Aces</em> -- the Next Great Immersive Sim?</h2>
<p><em>Fallen Aces</em>' story is surprisingly involved and features beautifully-crafted comic book style cutscenes. This serves as the perfect way to keep the narrative flowing without getting in the way of gameplay, which is where the real meat of <em>Fallen Aces</em> is.</p>
<p>This is a full-on immersive sim, no doubt about it. Fallen Aces<em> </em>offers unparalleled freedom in your approach to each and every situation. You'll go through the mean streets of Switchblade City, navigating ports full of goons, booby-trapped junkyards, fancy clubs, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to convey the total freedom <em>Fallen Aces</em> offers is by explaining how a typical mission goes. My favorite has Mike infiltrating an opulent mansion filled to the brim with goons. Find evidence for a murder, and get the hell outta' there. Quick and clean, right?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-aces-mansion.jpg?itok=wEMM7xZf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-aces-mansion.jpg?itok=0sTROKXC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nice house. Would be a shame if some goons ruined it.</figcaption></figure><h2>Mansion Infiltration</h2>
<p><em>Fallen Aces</em> doesn't hold your hand when it comes to your approach, so there are many different side pathways or hidden entrances and exits to your objective. Going through the front of the mansion? Bad idea -- there's armed thugs. I'll go around the side and look for a quiet side entrance.</p>
<p>This mission also equips you with some handy tools -- a blackjack (no doubt paying homage to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/20-years-of-thief-ii-fan-missions"><em>Thief</em></a>) and a tranquilizer gun. Perfect for my side objective, asking that I don't kill any bad guys throughout the mission. The side entrance is being patrolled, so I sneak up behind the guy and whack 'em with the blackjack, and hide his body for good measure so as not to alert the others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-aces-docks.jpg?itok=vQO0i4_3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-aces-docks.jpg?itok=GCsxDgdS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look out for sharks!</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this mission takes place at night. Lights illuminate certain areas near the front of the house, but this side entrance I'm aiming for is covered by trees and the shadows will help keep me unseen. I hop the fence, take out a few more guards quietly, and find a side entrance to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Drat, more guards. They're all over the place like roaches, so I do what I do best -- be stealthy, and don't get caught. Only, a goon turns the corner and immediately knows I'm up to no good, so there goes my cover. Nothing a few fists can't fix.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/combat-fallen-aces.jpg?itok=MXnt9JM1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/combat-fallen-aces.jpg?itok=skuvkmXe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't bring a knife to a gunfight, like this bozo.</figcaption></figure><h2>Speak with Your Fists in <em>Fallen Aces</em></h2>
<p>The developers are bold to introduce a mostly melee-focused FPS game, but they've somehow succeeded. See, when stealth fails, you can always rely on your fists or blunt force object you might find in the environment. Fist-fighting is quick, punchy (in more ways than one!), and doesn't feel clunky at all.</p>
<p>You're able to parry or block blows from baddies, which adds just a bit more depth to the combat system. Though you're better off just whacking them over the head with a pipe or stabbing them with a broken bottle a few times. The environment is as much your weapon as the items you carry, so use it to your benefit.</p>
<p>In one instance, I saw a banana peel and I just <em>knew</em> that this could be useful. Throwing it down in front of a goon, he'll trip over in a comical way. That gumball machine in the corner store? Throw someone into that, it'll break, and these goofs'll start tripping on gumballs like a bunch of doofuses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-aces-combat_0.jpg?itok=hXWsxpsZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-aces-combat_0.jpg?itok=OYVR0jNM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't mess with a man with a pipe.</figcaption></figure><h2>Stealthy or Not? The Choice is Yours in <em>Fallen Aces</em></h2>
<p>Switching between stealth and combat was my go-to for completing this mansion mission. With a complex layout and plenty of other entrances and exits, I made a quick escape after some more armed goons arrived to take Mike out.</p>
<p>This is the core gameplay loop for <em>Fallen Aces</em>, but if you're bold, you can go all-in without worrying about stealth. Sneaking in always provides a more intriguing and complex experience, however, as the thrill of not getting caught and finding weird or hidden paths forward is what I love about immersive sims such as this.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-aces-cutscene.jpg?itok=Nvz1UkUC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-aces-cutscene.jpg?itok=r5N9WfSg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cutscenes are shown through these lovingly crafted, comic book-style pages.</figcaption></figure><p>The other missions in <em>Fallen Aces</em> are just as compelling -- the finale of this first episode, in particular, feels even more lethal and high-stakes than the previous few. Finding a way into this great big nightclub with no real direction for my target, relying only on my senses -- it takes me back to that opera house from <em>Thief</em>.</p>
<p>In its current state, <em>Fallen Aces</em> is not a long experience, but it's still one I didn't want to end. There's one episode worth of content and it's polished as polished can be, and two more are on the way. If this is any indication of what we have in store for the other two, man, this game would make even Tony Soprano proud.</p>

<p data-characters="357" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Monopoly GO</em> seasons typically last anywhere from one to three months. During this time, you collect stickers to complete albums, which reward you with dice, cosmetic tokens, and a ton of cash for your landmark upgrades. Let’s find out what happens to any leftover stickers you have at the end of a season and whether your stars carry over to the next.</p> <h2 id="h-what-happens-to-sticker-stars-when-a-season-ends-in-monopoly-go" data-injectable="false">What happens to sticker stars when a season ends in Monopoly GO?</h2> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">What happens to your stars at the end of a <em>Monopoly GO</em> season depends on the season itself. For example, while the previous Monopoly Origins season turned your stars into a vault for the next album set, the current <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-making-music-album-stickers-and-rewards-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Making Music season</a> converts your stars into dice rolls. So far, each season has had different conversions for stars, and it’s unknown what Monopoly Games will do once it ends later this year.</p>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">For the Making Music season and album set, any leftover stars you have will convert to dice rolls. One star equals one dice roll, with the maximum being 700 stars for 750 dice rolls. In other words, if you don’t plan to purchase a last-minute vault for extra stickers, you’ll at least start Monopoly Games with extra dice.</p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="818" data-injectable="false">Overall, this is a solid conversion rate compared to what you get from vaults. With each vault, you can get a maximum of 230, 420, and 575 dice, while the star-to-dice exchange at the season’s end can give you far more. On the flip side, you can also get extra stickers by buying vaults, but this comes at the risk of not getting what you need to complete your albums. You can also <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-trade-stickers-and-stars-in-monopoly-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">give sticker stars to friends</a> if they want to take a shot at an expensive vault for extra cards.</p>

But for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24169416/tianas-bayou-adventure-pov-video-4k-ride-through">Tiana’s Bayou Adventure</a>, the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23680801/disneyland-close-splash-mountain-may-tianas-bayou-adventure">Splash Mountain remodel</a>, <a href="https://disneyimaginations.com/about-imaginations/about-imagineering/">Disney’s Imagineers</a> decided to take an alternative route and expand past the movie’s story, bridging the gap between the movie and the previously announced Tiana TV series. </p>
<p id="WrEx5P">“<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23191458/splash-mountain-new-name-disney-world-disneyland-opening-date">Tiana’s Bayou Adventure</a> takes place about a year after the events of the film <em>The Princess and the Frog</em>,” said Ted Robledo, executive creative director at Walt Disney Imagineering, in a presentation at a Walt Disney World press event. “So a lot has changed since then. And one of the most exciting parts of the attraction is seeing where life has taken her after that movie. Following the successful opening of her restaurant, Tiana’s Palace, there next to the beautiful Mississippi River in New Orleans, she’s continued to grow her business. But this time, she’s included members of the community, and built a new, beloved brand called Tiana’s Foods.”</p>
<p id="6qmiA4">There’s a whole storyline with the ride, which involves Tiana and Louis the alligator searching for animal musicians for an upcoming Mardi Gras festival. It isn’t the first Disney ride to be a sort of micro sequel: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fattractions%2Fepcot%2Ffrozen-ever-after%2F&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24180188%2Ftianas-bayou-adventure-show-ride-princess-and-the-frog" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23944229__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/epcot/frozen-ever-after/\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24180188/tianas-bayou-adventure-show-ride-princess-and-the-frog&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23944229__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/epcot/frozen-ever-after/&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24180188/tianas-bayou-adventure-show-ride-princess-and-the-frog&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Frozen Ever After</a> in neighboring Epcot takes place a year after the events of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23969905/frozen-anniversary-legacy-disney-movies-female-characters"><em>Frozen</em></a>. But Disney Parks senior vice president of creative development Carmen Smith says Tiana’s story will continue beyond the ride.</p>
<p id="cKbb4G">“Our partners at Walt Disney Animation Studios have also been amazing about this attraction’s development,” said Smith. “We’re so excited that Tiana’s story will continue after the attraction. And that’s with a new show coming to Disney Plus.” </p>

<p id="XSpFv1">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2020/12/10/22168776/disney-princess-shows-disney-plus-tiana-moana-baymax-zootopia">Tiana show was previously announced back in 2020</a>, along with a Moana series, but production news has been scant. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24065414/moana-2-teaser-trailer-announcement">Moana series was retooled into an upcoming theatrical movie</a>, but beyond a few writer-director announcements and delays, there hasn’t been news about the Tiana show in quite some time. It was originally supposed to debut in 2022, but then was pushed to 2023, then to 2024, with the announcement of <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/tiana-disney-plus-animated-series-joyce-sherri-lead-writer-director-1235749236/">Joyce Sherri as showrunner</a>. No specific premiere date has been announced. </p>
<p id="D2nB9I">If the Tiana show’s summary is still accurate, it will see Tiana setting off for Maldonia, where her husband, Naveen, hails from, and stepping up as crown princess. But her New Orleans heritage is still a huge part of her life. The setting difference means the story of Tiana’s Bayou Adventure won’t have significant plot ramifications for the show. An Imagineer that Polygon spoke to at the event maintained that the ride is “about a specific story in a specific moment here at Tiana’s Foods.”</p>
<p id="ULOYWX">But it’s hard to imagine that some of the details established by the ride — especially Tiana managing an employee-owned company — will be <em>totally </em>ignored by the upcoming show. Smith’s words imply that Walt Disney Imagineering and Walt Disney Animation Studios have been working together at least a little to establish a canon for Tiana. After all, Tiana is a business owner and chef first, and a princess second; leaving behind the restaurant and business she worked her whole life for doesn’t seem like the Tiana way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/banana-clicking-game-not-a-scam-developer-insists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The developers of Banana, a game about clicking a Banana which has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/banana-clicking-game-banana-now-the-11th-most-popular-game-of-all-time-on-steam">usurped Baldur's Gate 3 and Hogwarts Legacy on Steam's most-popular games of all time list</a>, have insisted it's not a scam.</p><p>A post on Discord from one of the three listed developers and co-owner of Banana, aestheticspartan, said the team had parted ways with one of its members after it emerged they were accused of being involved in a Steam scam previously. This team member has denied any involvement in a scam, saying instead an influx of money obtained through the Steam marketplace was the result of a bug.</p><p>Despite their involvement, "there is no scamming or scam going on," aestheticspartan insisted. Banana's gameplay literally involves clicking a banana repeatedly, but its main draw is in its dropping of Steam items which can be sold on the official marketplace. Banana gives out different bananas as its item, and clicking on the game once in a while nets players a couple per day.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/banana-1718705246631.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Banana has an interesting revenue split.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Most of these items are listed for just a few cents each, meaning the players of Banana are often spending and gaining very little at a time, but this likely doesn't matter to Steam owner Valve or the development team.</p><p>That's because both get a cut of every marketplace sale. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/61F0-72B7-9A18-C70B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve takes 5%</a>, to a minimum of $0.01, and the developer takes another small percentage, the exact total of which is unclear in this case, but likely follows the same conventions as Valve's to a minimum of $0.01.</p><p>Buyers and sellers don't see the same numbers on Steam's community marketplace, as the seller chooses the amount and the buyer sees the total of that number plus fees. This would explain why no banana item is available for less than $0.03 — they're likely listed at $0.01, but another $0.01 for Valve and $0.01 for the developer adds up to the $0.03 total.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/19/screenshot-2024-06-19-173635-1718815016161.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>These tiny numbers add up though. Using the most basic example, the plain Banana item (compared to the banana that looks like a Panda or any other obscure design), we can see how much the developer and Valve potentially make from Banana.</p><p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/2923300/Banana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> itself features an hour-by-hour breakdown of how many of these items are sold. Using the latest full day example, June 18, 2024, an eye-watering total of 1,993,669 of this single item were sold.</p><p>Valve therefore potentially earned a total of $19,936.69 from this single Banana's sales over a 24-hour period, a number more than likely earned by the developer, too. This standard drop is one of 81 items being sold on Banana's community marketplace.</p><p>This is the most common item, however, so it's being sold in larger quantities than other items. The Rainbow Banana, for example, is currently listed for around $0.75 but generally sells for less than 50 per hour instead of the thousands of the most common Banana. The most expensive item, the Crypticnana, of which only 25 exist, has been sold four times for values of more than $1,000 since June 17.</p><p>While this is a colossal price compared to the most basic Banana for the buyer and seller, Valve's 5% means it only nets $50 per $1,000 sold on these. It's therefore the $0.01 minimum policy affecting large quantities of low-selling items that make Valve and the developer the most money. A total of 14 items are listed at the minimum $0.03 amount, and each one sells thousands per hour.</p><p>Developer aestheticspartan's insistence Banana isn't a scam is therefore likely legitimate, but it's also almost certainly earning the development team tens of thousands of dollars a day, if not more. As for why it's so popular, developer team member Hery told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24173617/banana-clicker-game-steam-egg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a> Banana is a real-life "infinite money glitch." "I do believe that the reason why it mostly caught on is because it’s a legal infinite money glitch," Hery said. "Users make money out of a free game while selling free virtual items."</p><p>They also admitted Banana had a bot problem early on, with only around one third of all concurrents being actual players. Whether or not that figure has changed since Banana blew up remains to be seen, though Hery said the developement team has contacted Valve for help with the issue.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Image credit: Paradox.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on Life by You’s Early Access release,” Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive, said.</p><p>“Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio. We are deeply grateful for their hard work in trying to take Paradox into a new genre.”</p><p>Life by You, which Tectonic had worked on since 2019, initially set an early access release date for September 2023, but it was delayed to May 2024 before Paradox announced an additional delay to June 4. Two weeks before June 4, Paradox delayed the game indefinitely.</p><p>Delventhal alleged Paradox told Tectonic Life by You wouldn’t launch just two weeks before the June 4 release date, and staff only found out they’d lost their jobs when the studio closure was publicly announced this week. Delventhal said Tectonic tried to save Life by You by finding potential buyers or even going indie, but to no avail.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We spent a month in purgatory, and did everything we could to prove to them we were worth launching.</p></div><p>“I've known for some time that we might be getting shut down,” Delventhal said. “We were actively working on a hyper-moddable life sim called Life By You. An indie answer to the aging IP that is the Sims but instead focussed heavily on UGC.</p><p>“And as far as it goes, we were doing extremely well. </p><p>“I cannot share specific numbers, but I can say that we had an internal metric we were aiming for that had been approved, and that we exceeded that number by a significant portion. We also got a thumbs up a few weeks before launch.</p><p>“Then two weeks before launch we were told we wouldn't be launching. And just now that we've all lost our jobs. We were only informed of this via a public announcement.</p><p>“We were not told why. Instead we spent a month in purgatory, and did everything we could to prove to them we were worth launching, including things like finding potential buyers or suggesting cutting ties and going indie. We heard virtually nothing back.</p><p>“I was warned against writing anything about this experience. That it may hurt my future career or even that legal action could be taken against me. I have chosen to ignore these warnings.</p><p>“To be honest, I have guesses about what happened. And while I can't conjecture, I'm sure you have guesses too. As a business owner, some of them are understandable, but many of them are not.

            <p>Look, who knows when we’ll see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a> - there’s an increasingly less-than-zero chance we’ll all be living in a real post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland by the time Bethesda get around to revealing anything, if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-and-fallout-creators-bethesda-want-to-release-games-more-often-but-making-them-last-is-more-important">their deliberately slow approach</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> (it’s been nearly THIRTEEN years since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>) is much to go by. Still, even without a full sequel, Fallout is all around us - in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/well-whaddya-know-therell-officially-be-a-season-two-of-amazons-very-popular-fallout-tv-show">multiple seasons of a television show</a>, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-is-headed-to-fortnites-next-season">Fortnite</a>, and now in Call of Duty.</p>

<p>Not one to be outdone in the how-many-popular-licences-can-you-cram-into-one-video-game race, Call of Duty is following up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>’s own recent addition of Fallout skins with its own crossover with the series.</p>
<p>I’ll admit, it’s not an especially exciting take on a world full of strange mutants, ghouls, radioactive creations and a questionable satirical take on 1950s America. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-fallout-141-bundle">Call of Duty’s collaboration with Fallout</a> boils down to the chance to stick your military shooterpeople in the blue-and-yellow jumpsuits of vault dwellers. Vault 141 specifically, going by the number on the back of the suits - which doesn’t correlate to any Fallout vault we’ve seen in the games or live-action series, but instead references Task Force 141, the shooty all-star crew of Modern Warfares 2 and 3 made up of Price, Ghost, Soap and Gaz.</p>
<p>The Fallout Vault Dweller tracer pack stuffs in more than 15 items in total, including two Fallout-themed gun blueprints for a “Vault-Tec Approved” M16 and “Atomic Disintegrator” HRM-9, a couple of charms, a calling card, decal, emblem, sticker and loading screens.</p>
<p>The Fallout items can be used in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3">Modern Warfare III</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Warzone</a> and Warzone Mobile, with more goodies from gun camos to charms due to be offered as part of an in-game Vault Dwellers event from June 20th to June 26th. You’ll get extra XP if you’re using one of the vault dweller skins, too. Look, I'm sure there's plenty of people out there excited for some blue pyjamas to do murder in, but they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-is-getting-in-the-gundam-robot">not exactly Gundams</a>, are they?</p>

            <p>If you were playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> in December 2021, you will remember the launch of its last expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker">Endwalker</a> - though not for all the right reasons. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review">otherwise fantastic</a> cap to the near-decade-long Hydelyn-Zodiark was beset by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-xiv-giving-players-a-free-week-in-apology-for-queues">barrage of technical problems</a> at launch, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ffxiv-endwalkers-early-access-launch-is-here-and-already-has-long-server-queues">the MMO’s servers buckled</a> under the weight of record numbers of players, leading to hours-long queues to login that would often end in an error that then kicked you back into the queue. As someone that sat there for literal hours watching the numbers tick down, it wasn’t a great time - even if the wait was, ultimately, worth it.</p>

</div>
<p>With next expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail">Dawntrail</a> approaching, the question of how FF14’s servers will cope is once again upon us. Fortunately, the game’s team promise that they’ve taken “precautionary measures” since the gruelling experience of Endwalker nearly three years ago, bumping up the number of data centres and introducing whole new worlds for players to join to help account for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a>’s boom in players over the pandemic and beyond.</p>
<p>Even so, the developers caution that things may still struggle under the sheer number of players logging in for lengthy Dawntrail marathons, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39210/view/4160844172256662009?l=english">detailing some of what to expect</a> and how they’re hoping to make things at least a bit smoother than Endwalker.</p>
<p>In short: expect to find yourself in a queue once Dawntrail opens up to early access on June 28th, before its wide release on July 2nd. The devs do reassure that even if it seems like the number isn’t going down, you will be moving forward - though it’s worth noting that those paying for a subscription (which you’ll need for Dawntrail anyway) will be prioritised over those playing the base A Realm Reborn and earlier expansions Heavensward and Stormblood in the game’s free trial. Honestly, if you’re not up to Dawntrail and desperate to see the new story and duties as soon as you can, I would really recommend steering clear in the meantime. You won’t be able to even create characters on a congested world, so definitely don’t jump in now.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/final-fantasy-14-viper-job-dual-handed-blue.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Even once you’re in, there’ll continue to be some restrictions. Like with Endwalker, travelling between some data centers and visiting other worlds will be limited. That’ll remain the case until at least patch 7.01, though could last up to 7.05 if things are really bad. Needless to say, you’ll probably want to make sure you return any characters to their home world before Dawntrail arrives to avoid ending up stuck. Travelling between individual regions of the map will also be limited (get ready to see "Unable to move areas due to congestion" a lot), so you might have to wait a little before moving through areas.</p>
<p>The game’s auto-kick feature will crack down on inactive players more harshly, too - so don’t expect to be able to just sit in Limsa Lominsa to save your place while you grab a night’s sleep. Automatic logout will now occur after 30 minutes of inactivity - though, honestly, it’s just polite to log out if you’re not actually playing regardless, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Other efforts will include a queue system for instanced duties, including dungeons and main scenario quests, when congestion is particularly heavy, plus the return of separate instances for areas of the map - you can switch to a specific instance via an aetheryte, as in Endwalker.</p>
<p>In other words, it sounds like the team are doing all they can to try and remedy the pains of logging in suffered during Endwalker, but definitely don’t expect things to be as smooth as normal once the expansion hits. See you in the queues.</p>

            <p>When it comes to the ultimate showdown of all-time great fighting games, Marvel vs Capcom 2 might well take my personal bet for being the best of the best. I spent countless hours throwing down with housemates, friends and random passers-by who looked like they were up for a brawl during my teenage years. Yet the arcade classic has - as far as I can tell - never been given a proper PC release before the recent announcement of a new bundle of the comic-book crossover series headed to Steam this year.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, as said bundle is officially dubbed, will bring together both Marvel vs Capcom 2 and its predecessor Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes  - which again, I don’t think has ever had an official PC version - with five other games starring Marvel’s roster of superheroes with or without Capcom’s brawlers.</p>
<p>The list includes Capcom’s first Marvel-based fighting game, X-Men: Children of the Atom, which effectively applied Street Fighter II’s gameplay to the Marvel heroes. That, at least, did make it to PC, albeit back in 1997. Capcom and Marvel’s second game, Marvel Super Heroes, swapped X-Men for more of a mix, including the likes of Avengers members Captain America, Spider-Man and Hulk alongside Wolverine, Juggernaut, Magneto and Psylocke. That will see its first PC release in this new collection.</p>
<p>Pre-Marvel vs Capcom crossovers X-Men vs Street Fighter and Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter will be in here, too. As a fun historical tidbit, the games are particularly notable for introducing Variable Assist, a precursor to the assist mechanic that would go on to be a key part of MvC, though they also never made it to PC.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Rounding out the package is The Punisher, which is a beat ‘em up rather than a competitive fighting game. The 1993 Final Fight-like was only ever released on Sega Genesis outside of arcades, but was the first game to emerge from Capcom and Marvel’s partnership, making it a progenitor of sorts to the MvC series. Fortunately for us, the PC version in the collection will be based on the beloved arcade original, rather than its widely-derided console port.</p>
<p>Alongside the games themselves, the Fighting Collection will pack in some neat historical treats such as a museum and choice of display filters, plus some modern trimmings - including online multiplayer across ranked, casual and lobby matches with rollback netcode (including co-op for The Punisher), a spectator mode and leaderboards. All of the games will also have a training mode if you’re a bit rusty.</p>
<p>The Fighting Collection <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2634890/MARVEL_vs_CAPCOM_Fighting_Collection_Arcade_Classics/">will hit Steam</a> sometime later this year, also meaning all these games will find themselves on the Steam Deck through official means. A very welcome return.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-trailer-analysis-unreal-engine-5-pros-cons-lumen-resolution/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/perfect-dark-reveal-shows-both-ue5-pros-and-cons-with-lumen-and-low-native-resolution.905967/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-trailer-analysis-unreal-engine-5-pros-cons-lumen-resolution/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this month during the big <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, we finally got our first look the Unreal-Engine-5-powered “AAAA” <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/perfect-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark</a> revival, with Microsoft claiming what we saw was actual gameplay. Now, that comes with a number of asterisks – what we saw was clearly a very curated vertical slice of the game and it isn’t even clear if the footage was running on PC or Xbox Series X, but still, Microsoft insists it was gameplay, so it bears analysis.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tech heads at Digital Foundry</a>, who have gone over the Perfect Dark trailer, and found it exemplified both the strengths and weaknesses of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unreal Engine 5</a>. You can check out Digital Foundry’s full video below, provided you have around 10 minutes to spare, or you can scroll on down for our rundown of the important points.</p>
<p><iframe title="Perfect Dark Gameplay Trailer Breakdown: Immersive Sim Meets Mirror's Edge?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zW_ssHy918I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off, there’s the question of what the Perfect Dark trailer was running on. Digital Foundry suspects it was PC, but the performance and resolution of that trailer indicates it may have been running on more limited Xbox Series X hardware. Then again, it could just be that the PC version of Perfect Dark hasn’t been properly optimized yet or they were intentionally running the game on PC with XSX equivalent settings.</p>
<p>Moving on from that question, it does seem like Perfect Dark is tapping into Unreal Engine 5’s suite of tools, with Digital Foundry clearly identifying Lumen lighting techniques in use. It seems like the game is likely using software-powered Lumen, rather than the potentially-more-versatile hardware-based Lumen, but that isn’t rare (few games use hardware Lumen).</p>
<p>Less positively, like seemingly most UE5 games, the Perfect Dark demo had it share of performance issues. Per Digital Foundry, framerate during the trailer is “not stable” and pixel counting reveals it was running at around 1440p. Further analysis seems to show the gameplay was actually upscaled to 1440p, and that its native resolution was somewhere in the range of 720p to 960p.</p>
<p>Again, this was just an early vertical slice of the game – it’s likely the game is still a couple years away at least, so take all this with a grain of salt. The game may change quite significantly before launch and the underlying UE5 tech will also be updated. That said, in a lot, if not the majority, of cases, games are actually <em>downgraded </em>from their early vertical slice showings. We’ll see what happens in this case.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark is coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S. A release window has not been specified.</p>

<p>When the Marvel vs Capcom Fight Collection was announced on Tuesday, it was met with overwhelming praise from fans around the world. The only problem was that Marvel vs. Capcom Fight Collection isn’t going to be available on Xbox consoles.</p>



<p>No, when it launches later this year, it’ll be available only on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 (playable on PS5), and Steam. But why not Xbox?</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/capcom-skips-xbox-with-another-game-as-square-enix-steps-up-with-several-new-titles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, it has to do with Capcom’s MT Framework that the game’s are built on. The outlet’s source say that Capcom “has no pipeline for porting older MT Framework titles to Xbox’s modern system, which makes it more expensive to deliver the same titles than it would porting them to PlayStation 4, Switch, or PC.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/interview-designing-magic-the-gathering-modern-horizons-3/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=interview-designing-magic-the-gathering-modern-horizons-3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="367" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For the entire time I’ve been a fan of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-did-magic-the-gathering-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, which started at some point during the UK’s various staggered lockdowns, fans have revered <em>Modern Horizons 2</em> as one of the greatest sets to grace the TCG. Not only has its value never dropped, but every content creator I follow has nothing bad to say about it, often using boxes for giveaways. </p> <p data-characters="486" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">That’s why, when Wizards of the Coast announced <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-modern-horizons-3-release-date-set-information-and-where-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Horizons 3</a></em>, I knew I needed to get in on it and pay attention. It would hopefully be the new standard for sets in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> until <em>Modern Horizons 4</em>. Now that it’s out, we know that this set absolutely lived up to our extremely high expectations. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-modern-horizons-3-precon-commanders-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Commander Precons</a> are great, the Collector Boosters are fantastic, and the set is just great fun to play with, build decks around, and admire in a collection.</p>
 <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">So when offered the chance to sit down with senior game designer Michael Majors and product architect Mike Turian, I wanted to ask about everything: the goals for <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>, the designs, the story implications and more. Here’s everything we learned about the set from two of its designers.</p> <figure data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="88" data-current-count="88" data-injectable="false"><strong>What makes the <em>Modern Horizons</em> sets such massive cornerstones of <em>MTG</em> expansions for you?</strong></p> <p data-characters="541" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “There are multiple components. One is that I’ve always loved Modern. It has a deep card pool that enables and rewards creative deck building. That has always been my favorite part of <em>Magic</em>, figuring out ways to combine disparate pieces or diamonds in the rough in exciting ways that result in a sum greater than its parts. Giving folks more toys to add to their metaphorical sandbox is a real highlight for me, and I take a lot of joy in providing interesting ways for people to express themselves through the cards.</p>
 <p data-characters="732" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">“The second is that <em>Modern Horizons</em>, by nature, not formally connected to a particular plane or story, gives us the opportunity to make both creative allusions and rich mechanical mashups that would be considered out of place or potentially too complex in a normal frontlist release. The product line was originally pitched as a ‘Time Spiral 2,’ a block known as a love letter to fans of <em>Magic</em> way back in 2006. Since then, there’s been a lot more <em>Magic</em> made that’s available to reference and draw upon. <em>Modern Horizon</em>’s creative conceit, which I often refer to<br>as ‘canonically out of place and time,’ gives us a ton of freedom to combine interesting ideas and reintroduce old characters.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="79" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false"><strong>What were the team’s goals when sitting down to create <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>?</strong></p> <p data-characters="79" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “The short version was try not to break Modern too badly.</p>
 <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">“Joking aside, there were a lot of challenges and expectations that needed to be managed. Tradeoffs are always going to be a reality. We had received ample data and feedback at that stage that <em>Modern Horizons 2</em> was probably too pushed, and while fans of <em>Magic</em> love cracking open and playing with powerful cards, we needed to pivot in a slightly different direction. From the beginning, I knew we couldn’t “compete directly” with <em>Modern Horizons 2</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">“Early on, there was exploration done to find some lapsed themes that were a part of Modern and Standard previously that fans could be excited about if they were brought back. This resulted in some cornerstones of the set – Eldrazi, and Energy, as well as some one-off designs that aren’t intended to overwrite the usefulness of cards that folks already own but give them new options to play with.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">“From the beginning, I intended <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> to target three primary audiences – competitive Modern players per the set’s namesake, Commander players, and folks who have nostalgia for <em>Magic</em>’s history. A looser goal was that many of the most exciting cards in the set could overlap with multiple portions of these audiences. Some examples of this are the energy rares referencing powerful cards from <em>Magic</em>’s past, Necrodominance, and Birthing Ritual.</p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">“The internet likes to joke that the <em>Horizons</em> product line is ‘Commander Horizons,’ but again, products like these require tradeoffs. Nobody would end up happy if the product had 200 shots at Modern, not only for its overall implications on the format but the simple reality that it would be impossible for the format to absorb that much content.</p> <p data-characters="656" data-current-count="1020" data-injectable="true">“On a micro level, <em>Modern Horizons 2</em> providing a bevy of both powerful individual rate cards as well as many strong answers to those rate cards. For the most part, we didn’t focus as heavily on <em>MH3</em> on providing more answer cards, with some exceptions, but wanted to give more power back to synergy cards, engines, and other lapsed strategies from Modern’s past. A good example of this is the MDFC Flip Planeswalkers. They’re individually powerful cards but shine the brightest when incorporated in some specific types of strategies – Spell-based combo, Graveyard strategies, Sacrifice decks, and Life Gain, to name a few possibilities.”</p>
 <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="131" data-injectable="false"><strong>Did you use <em>Modern Horizons 1+2</em> as baselines or reference points when putting this set together? Or did you look at <em>MTG</em> as a whole?</strong></p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="466" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “Absolutely, both! I admit, after having done all three of these sets, I’ve used a lot of my ideas, but grounding the set in more firm mechanical space (Energy, Eldrazi, Modifications) as well as getting fresh perspectives from team members helps a lot for creating more awesome and nostalgic content for folks.</p>
 <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">“We also give ourselves a lot to work with – essentially all of <em>Magic</em>’s history! In this case, we even went into Magic’s future – sort of. While <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> is releasing after <em>Murders of Karlov Manor</em>, of course, I loved the concept of using Collect Evidence on a graveyard-based card so much that we even pulled a mechanic forward from a set that hadn’t come out yet while we were designing <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> for Detective’s Phoenix.”</p>
 <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false"><strong>Are there any particular moments in the <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> story that you’re particularly excited about?</strong></p> <p data-characters="624" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “As noted previously, <em>MH3</em>’s story larger takes place out of time and space, but we do get to capture a few specific moments and characters that are always awesome to see. The headliners are the MDFC Flip Planeswalkers – seeing their spark moment, as well as the Eldrazi, most notably Emrakul, the World Anew back dropped against the Innistrad moon that would become her prison. Some other highlights include seeing Shilgengar, Sire of Famine – the Elder Demon that Sorin’s family makes a pact with, as well Genku, Future Shaper – Tamiyo’s husband with whom they run an orphanage.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true"><strong>The Eldrazi seem to draw upon the unknowable gods and ancient creatures from the entire cosmic horror sub-genre. How do you approach such powerful beings and bring them in line with all <em>MTG</em> cards so they’re not as overpowered as they would be in real life?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “The mana system of <em>Magic</em> does a lot of work for us! They are way more powerful than the normal creatures you might see in <em>Magic</em>, but that’s the beauty of the game, you really must work for them. The question is where and how do you strike a balance of making players excited and satisfied by working so hard to cast these extremely powerful creatures. We want to make their arrival on the battlefield feel like an event that players will talk about – something worthy of their reputation.”</p>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false"><strong>Unlike most sets, <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> seems to draw a line at where <em>MTG</em> expansions have reached and pulls mechanics from them to help push the game forward. Which ones are you most excited about in <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> specifically, and why?</strong></p> <p data-characters="602" data-current-count="838" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “Energy! It’s cool and both tricky to develop and play with. I viewed it as a large opportunity to make cards that we can’t traditionally make – as an alternate resource, Energy really puts pressure on players to build around it synergistically and gives more freedom to us as designers to concentrate power among a very specific portion of the card pool. We wouldn’t really be able to make direction allusions to Recurring Nightmare or Alluren without severely powering them down, but using a restriction like Energy, we can make powerful cards worthy of their callbacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> isn’t all card mechanics and playing the game, though, a decent chunk of the fan base consists of collectors who just want to pick up the cards and own them, <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em> players, and those who just want to watch others play but understand the cards on a deeper level by owning them. I’m certainly guilty of having purchased Commander Decks and not played with them yet. </p>
 <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="64" data-injectable="false"><strong>What was the inspiration for the Ripple Foil effect in this set?</strong></p> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true"><strong>Mike Turian</strong>: “We are always looking to find new, striking foil treatments for <em>Magic</em>. Ripple Foil has an amazing sheen to it, much like looking out at a ripple in a serene lake. With <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> being a celebration of Magic, we went out and searched for a treatment that would amplify the beauty of the artwork. Ripple Foil had that quality of being striking and making the already amazing art stand out even more.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Magic Madhouse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true"><strong>We’ve not seen Collector Commander decks since the launch of the<em> Warhammer 40K</em> sets. Why did you want<br><em>Modern Horizons 3</em> to have these?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="736" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true"><strong>Mike Turian</strong>: “When we set out making the first <em>Modern Horizons</em> set, we knew that it would appeal to players of the Modern format, and it did. What also happened was our community of Commander players got excited by the cards in <em>Modern Horizons 1</em> too. We saw this happen again in <em>Modern Horizons 2</em>. As it turns out Commander players love powerful and appealing cards. So, when we were planning out <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>, it made sense to be able to create cards with the feel of a Horizons set that were focused on solely the Commander audience. With the Commander decks being part of <em>MH3</em>, we were able to create new designs that had the feel of being part of <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>, without having to worry about how they played in Modern.</p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">“From there, the Collector editions of Commander decks had been quite popular with <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> and with <em>MH3</em> we saw a chance to combine the new Ripple Foil treatment with the cool new Commander-focused designs. The reception for the Collector Commander has already been so positive, I’m glad we could bring it all together for <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>.”</p> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"><strong>If you’re allowed to reveal it, what is your favorite card, or cards, that you worked on from the set and why?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd. I’m very biased. She’s based off my dog. The thought process was essentially: people like dogs. I have a corgi; and we’ve never done a corgi. Ok, how would I show a corgi in <em>Magic</em>’s language? They’re herding dogs. Flickering things is like herding. If she herds your things, she gets a treat. And here we are.”</p> <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true"><strong>What would you like players, both long-time fans and newcomers, to get out of <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> as they pick up cards and sit down to play?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="false"><strong>Majors &amp; Turian</strong>: “Have fun and explore the possibility space. I’ve absolutely loved watching content creators brew with the cards even this early, and the fact that some of the cards don’t have so-obvious homes gives me a lot of joy as a deck builder. Whether you have nostalgia for the references and mechanical mashups of <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> or not, we hope that players everywhere love playing with the cards.”</p>

An <strong>Xbox  Game Pass Ultimate subscription</strong> can help, though, as it’ll provide day-one access to many of the titles currently in development.</p><p>Thankfully, CDKeys is now selling <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fxbox-live%2F1-month-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-xbox-one-pc">one-month subscription codes for $10.19</a> (about $7 off) and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fxbox-live%2F3-month-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-xbox-one-pc">three-month codes for $27.99</a> (about $23 off), the latter of which is a better deal. CDKeys is a trusted merchant here at <em>The Verge</em>, so don’t feel deterred if you’re unfamiliar with the name. The online retailer specializes in selling heavily discounted key codes for gaming products, whether you’re looking to save on subscriptions, full games, in-game currency, or post-launch DLC. </p><div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to more than 100 titles, including new first-party releases on day one, which you can play on multiple devices. The pass also gives subscribers access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p></div><p>You can redeem the codes no matter which region you’re in, and you should be able to purchase and stack as many as you’d like so long as you’re under Microsoft’s 36-month pre-pay limit. (Not all of the codes at CDKeys are region-free and stackable, so double-check that you’re buying the correct one using the links above.) Plus, in this instance, both new and existing subscribers can redeem the digital codes.</p><p>You’ll certainly want to consider extending your subscription or finally making the jump from Game Pass Core, as Xbox has put together arguably one of its strongest gaming lineups ever going into 2025. Perhaps the most significant launch is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer">an all-new <em>Gears of War</em> prequel subtitled <em>E-Day</em></a>, which follows the friction that Marcus Fenix, Dom, and the rest of their COG cohorts experienced when the locusts first emerged.

            <p>The original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> might be returning to PC - and soon! - if recent signs hold true. An age rating for the 1996 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">survival-horror</a> classic was recently confirmed by European suitability judges PEGI, hinting at an impending (re-)release for the almost three-decade-old zombie game.</p>

<p>Before you butt in to tell me that Resident Evil 1 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304240/Resident_Evil/">is already on PC</a>, it’s time for some clarification! The <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Resident+Evil&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-ATBS9F3l3HEr1D9FIZavGcU82YJkYSz9MyGRwstz_Po&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">new PEGI rating</a> spotted by Gematsu refers specifically to a PC port of the very original Resident Evil released on PlayStation in 1996, rather than the later remake released first for GameCube in 2002 before then serving as the basis for the more recent (relatively, anyway) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-resident-evil-hd-remaster">HD remaster from 2015</a>. (If you’re wondering: it’s a PEGI 18, obviously.)</p>
<p>A second point of clarification for those smart-asses still holding up their hands: yes, the original Resident Evil from 1996 has <em>technically </em>already been released on PC before, hitting Japanese computers the year of its release before finding its way to North American and European keyboards-and-mice the following year.</p>
<p>However, that PC version dates from the age of disc drives and CRT monitors - both of which are now dead enough to rise from the grave as shambling techno-corpses themselves - and has never been released digitally through the likes of Steam, Epic Games Store or GOG. So this’ll mark the first time in almost 30 years that the very first, non-remake Resident Evil has been available to play without hunting down a secondhand physical disc or taking, ahem, <em>other </em>routes.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The original Resident Evil (1996) has been rated for PC in Europe. Resident Evil was technically already released for PC in 1996, but I guess it's not actually available via Steam or any digital marketplaces these days. <a href="https://t.co/hVHlkCWRrx">pic.twitter.com/hVHlkCWRrx</a></p>— Gematsu (@gematsu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1802945852689801265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>There’s still time to squeeze in one more clarification, don’t you fear. The PEGI rating doesn’t make completely clear if this Resident Evil will be the very original or its expanded Director’s Cut, featuring rearranged item and enemy placements alongside some new costumes, a better gun (which had a random chance to blow zombies’ heads off, like in the remake) and a beginner difficulty mode, which was only ever released for PlayStation in 1997. However, given that the PEGI entry does specify "Resident Evil (1996)" and the Director’s Cut has never escaped PlayStation, it may well be the vanilla original for now.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, PEGI's entry states the release date of the Resident Evil PC port as June 18th - yesterday. That might be a mix-up with the date the rating was approved, or it might mean that a surprise re-release isn’t very far away…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181252/boys-vought-on-ice-lets-put-christ-back-christmas<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wByDyS">There is no amount of sonic pain composer Christopher Lennertz won’t endure for his bud of 30 years Eric Kripke, the current showrunner of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24176428/the-boys-season-4-review-new"><em>The Boys</em></a>. Lennertz previously listened to endless amounts of boy band slop to pen the Super-Sweet single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8wIfVnaorc">“Rock My Kiss”</a> for season 3 and pushed himself to write the gooiest sentimental track imaginable for Starlight’s pop-star moment, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw_OHwI5dUQ">“Never Truly Vanish,”</a> and now he’s back with season 4’s “Let’s Put the Christ Back in Christmas.”</p>
<p id="Qd942u">“If there’s anything I can say about <em>The Boys</em>, it’s that we do our research,” Lennertz tells Polygon, with minimal eye twitch.</p>
<p id="wOmPjF">Former fraternity brothers who embarked together into Hollywood with no money and a high tolerance for Taco Bell, Lennertz and Kripke have formed a mind-meld rapport thanks to years on <em>Supernatural</em> and <em>Revolution</em>. So the writer knew he could deliver minimal instruction for what he wanted for the proposed Vought on Ice sequence in season 4 episode 3, “We’ll Keep the Red Flag Flying Here,” Lennertz says. </p>
<p id="d88P6Y">“I get literally one short paragraph that says, ‘Homeland and Maeve as ice skaters come out, sing a Vaught-produced song about war on Christmas, there’s a nativity scene and Jesus, and then everybody gets killed.’ And then it says something about ‘putting Christ back in Christmas.’ That’s the whole assignment.”</p>
<p id="xt1xnh">The dynamic between showrunner and composer is more about vibes. As Lennertz began work on “Let’s Put the Christ Back in Christmas,” he began watching video after video of Ice Capades, Disney on Ice, Frozen on Ice, and any other bit of source material that could inform the finished dance. “I knew I needed sleigh bells and I knew it needed to be fast,” he says. Then the Vought of it all pours in, which Kripke is good for. Around the time Lennertz was matching high notes to laser sounds, his old friend was sending him articles about the latest anti-Christmas fearmongering. Lennertz recalls the news of Candace Cameron Bure’s <a href="https://ew.com/tv/candace-cameron-bure-new-christmas-movies-wont-feature-lgbt-love-stories/">deal with the Great American Family network</a>, and her stance against Hallmark Channel’s LGBTQ+ representation in Christmas movies, as an exasperated-sigh-worthy beacon for the satire.</p>
<p id="33Sgtw">“[Eric] has very little patience for that kind of silliness, as do I,” Lennertz says. “We’re pretty open people. So that was sort of our job from the very beginning.”</p>

<p id="31FsRC">Lennertz’s big dream for the sequence was to go bigger than anything <em>The Boys </em>had done before. This was not his first big showstopper number — Lennertz previously worked with musical legends Alan Menken and Marc Shaiman to expand <em>Hawkeye</em>’s fake Avengers show <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22800803/hawkeye-cast-rogers-the-musical-song"><em>Rogers: The Musical</em></a> into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23612226/rogers-the-musical-disney-parks-hawkeye-captain-america-broadway">an actual stage event for Disney California Adventure</a> — and his mind immediately went to Broadway to fill the vocal roster for the song. While the actors on screen are all ice-skating professionals, the song touts Andrew Rannells (<em>The Book of Mormon</em>) as Homelander, Shoshana Bean (<em>Hairspray</em>, <em>Hell’s Kitchen</em>) as Maeve, and James Monroe Iglehart (<em>Aladdin</em>, <em>Hamilton</em>) as Jesus.</p>
<p id="gc9TzC">“I texted Eric, and I was like, ‘Can we shoot for big Broadway stars and make this a big cameo thing?’” he recalls. “And as soon as I got the permission for that, I’m like, <em>Well, that’s gotta be Andrew</em>. And then we got a Black Jesus in James Monroe Iglehart, who then of course Vought makes into a white Jesus later, which is so Vought. [...] Thankfully, they all said yes. And they were all my first choice, every single one of them. I got real lucky.”</p>
<p id="y7Pu6t">The finished version of “Let’s Put the Christ Back in Christmas” is painfully real, as far as schmaltzy ice-skating dance numbers go. Then it just becomes simply… painful. You can watch the unstained version above, but for the whole bloody affair, head to Prime Video, where the first three episodes of <em>The Boys</em> season 4 are currently streaming.</p>

<p>The developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/banana-steam-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">behind the viral clicker game</a> Banana is coming to the game’s defense, saying it’s not the scam people are making it out to be.</p>



<p>Taking to the game’s official Discord server, co-owner aestheticsparn said that there is “no scamming” happening with Banana. In fact, the developers want to make the game more than what it currently is.</p>



<p>“We cannot wait to turn this game into something bigger and better than just a clicker game,” they wrote. “Please stay on the lookout as we have been and still are working on a large amount of updates to improve the game and let you all do much more with your bananas.”</p>



<p>If you don’t know what Banana is, it’s a pretty simple concept. You open a banana, click said banana, earn drops that vary in value, and repeat. Where the actual value comes in, it’s unclear. However, people seem to be hooked on it as it has become the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ninth-most-played game in Steam history</a>, ahead of game’s like Baldur’s Gate 3, Hogwarts Legacy, Apex Legends, and more.</p>



<p>Along with the overall goal of what they hope to achieve with the game, it was revealed that a member of the team was let go after it came to light that they were previously involved with a Bitcoin scam on the Steam marketplace.</p>



<p>“As you all have heard by now Theselions used to be involved in a steam market ‘bitcoin’ scam/bug,” aestheticspartan said. “We did not know about this until recent videos started to point this out and we had a talk almost immediately with the whole team about the situation. </p>



<p>“We gave him the chance to explain the situation to us and we know he is showing remorse and is sorry about what happened in the past.”</p>



<p>One issue that sits with the game is that there is likely a bot problem. With it being free on Steam, users are able to create hundreds of extra accounts in order to try and get more and rarer banana drops.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately we are currently facing some problems around botting, since the game takes basically 1% to no resources of your PC, people are abusing up to 1000 alternative accounts in order to get Rarer drops or at least drops in bulk,” one developer known as Hery told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24173617/banana-clicker-game-steam-egg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-patch-ditches-30fps-cap-on-pc-for-fatalities-and-other-in-game-cutscenes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> has a new patch that finally removes the 30fps cap for cutscenes on PC.</p><p>NetherRealm’s fighting game launched with a 30fps cap for in-game cutscenes such as Fatalities despite gameplay running at 60fps. Developer NetherRealm has insisted this cap lets it create flashier cutscenes, but some players have said the switch from 60 to 30 and back again is jarring.</p><p>Now, in <a href="https://mortalkombat1.bugs.wbgames.com/patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fresh update for Mortal Kombat 1</a>, that 30fps cap is removed with the addition of a new graphics setting that increases the lock to 60fps on PC only, but it’s worth noting that NetherRealm warned this setting is intended for PC gamers with high-end rigs.</p><p>The patch, also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, makes a number of character fixes, including to the recently released DLC character Homelander. The patch notes are below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Mortal Kombat 1 - Homelander First Look Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Also this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-delays-ferra-kameo-launch-announces-takeda-release-date">NetherRealm delayed the launch of Kameo character Ferra and announced the release date of the final Kombat Pack 1 DLC character, Takeda</a>. Ferra, the small fighter who sat atop the hulking Torr as part of the combined Ferra &amp; Torr character from Mortal Kombat X, was set to hit Mortal Kombat 1 in Kameo form later in June, but now launches alongside Takeda's early access release on July 23.</p><p>Thoughts now turn to what follows for Mortal Kombat 1 during its second year, with NetherRealm yet to announce future DLC plans. Earlier this month, a prominent Mortal Kombat 1 dataminer uncovered evidence to suggest that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dataminer-uncovers-voice-line-for-ghostface-from-scream"><u>Ghostface from the Scream franchise is an upcoming DLC character</u></a>. Ghostface was assumed to be a part of the inevitable Kombat Pack 2, but the character's release may be tied up with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/courteney-cox-reportedly-in-talks-to-return-as-gale-weathers-in-scream-7"><u>the ongoing issues surrounding the next movie in the series, Scream 7</u></a>.</p><p>NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon has confirmed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-story-dlc-confirmed-big-surprise-after-that"><u>Mortal Kombat 1 will eventually get story DLC and “a big surprise after that.”</u></a> Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/mortal-kombat-2"><u>Mortal Kombat 2 movie</u></a> is due out October 24, 2025.</p><h2>Mortal Kombat 1 Patch Notes - PS5, XSX, Steam and EGS | 06/18/2024</h2><p><strong>JUNE HOTFIX</strong></p><p><strong>PC Steam &amp; Epic Games Store</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added a new Graphics Setting to increase the 30 FPS lock on certain sections to 60 FPS, which is intended for users with High-End Hardware<ul data-cy="list"><li>The new setting to enable this is accessed via Main Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Graphics &gt; Experimental &gt; 60 FPS Mode: OFF (Default)/ON</li><li>Note that this setting will not affect pre-rendered movies and will be automatically disabled during Online Matches to avoid stability issues</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>General Fixes &amp; Adjustments</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed several desyncs that could occur during online play if the game had been hot-fixed</li><li>Adjusted camera behavior when Homelander, Omni-Man, or Peacemaker are interrupted or hit high off screen</li></ul><p><strong>Character Specific Adjustments</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Main Fighters</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Reptile</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed damage scaling on Force Ball when not enhanced</li></ul></li><li><strong>Peacemaker</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Human Torpedo &amp; Enhanced Human Torpedo now hits High</li><li>Reduced base health value to 650 (from 700)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Homelander</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed canceling into Flight when grounded more than once in a kombo not consuming Super Meter</li><li>Fixed Jump Attacks during Flight be able to be canceled into Flight on block</li><li>Fixed not being able to breaker God Complex &amp; Enhanced God Complex</li><li>Improved Punching Down linking into God Complex &amp; Enhanced God Complex from Flight when it hits opponent near the top</li><li>Fixed issue that could result in Homelander sliding on the ground sometimes when God Complex from Flight was canceled from certain heights</li><li>Fixed rare issue that could result in Homelander sliding on the ground sometimes when God Complex from Flight was performed just as flight was about to time out</li><li>Fixed rare instances of some juggle kombos sometimes behaving slightly differently against Homelander with specific timing</li><li>The following attacks can no longer be parried by Dirty Trick<ul data-cy="list"><li>Kitana - Fancy Strike (Away + Front Punch)</li><li>Rain - Tide (Away + Back Punch) &amp; It Pours (Back Punch, Front Punch, Front Punch, Back Punch)</li><li>Reptile - Kneet Trick (Towards + Back Punch, Front Kick)</li><li>Sindel - Shear Genius (Towards + Front Punch) &amp; Off The Top (Away + Back Punch, Front Kick, Back Punch)</li><li>Ermac - Dragged Under (Front Kick, Back Kick)</li><li>Peacemaker - Gutshot (Away + Back Kick) &amp; Pinky Toermenter (Down + Back Kick)</li><li>Quan Chi - Skeleton Jacker (Towards + Back Punch, Front Punch)</li></ul></li><li>The following attacks can now be parried by Dirty Trick<ul data-cy="list"><li>Ashrah - God’s/Demon's Wrath &amp; Dark/Light Ascension</li><li>Baraka - Baraka Barrage, Stab Stab, &amp; Chop Chop</li><li>Havik - Twisted Torso</li><li>Kenshi - Quick Slice (Jump Front Punch in Sento Stance), Upper Gash (Jump Back Punch in Sento Stance), Ancestral Guard, Soaring Sento, &amp; Teamwork</li><li>Kung Lao - Kung-Kussion &amp; Shaolin Shimmy</li><li>General Shao - Power Strike</li><li>Smoke - Vicious Vapors &amp; Smoke Bomb</li><li>Peacemaker - Coming Through!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creatures-of-ava-wants-you-to-save-its-many-adorable-animals-in-august.905910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creatures-of-ava-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios and developer Inverge have announced the&nbsp;<em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>release date, and the adorable-looking creature-saving action-adventure game (that's a lot of hyphens) is launching very soon.</p>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>is arriving on August 7th across PC and Xbox Series X|S, and if you've ever wished that creature-collecting games focused a little less on "collection" and a little more on actually helping the species in question, this one's for you.</p>
<p>11 bit and Inverge's game takes place on the titular planet of Ava, which an infection known only as The Withering is slowly destroying. It doesn't take a genius to spot the ecological parallels of this one, but that doesn't make them any less timely.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-release-date-flute.jpg?itok=bARyUrQx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-release-date-flute.jpg?itok=WztVLJkK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>wants you to help save its many adorable species of animal.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the game is not a life sim, nor is it an open-world survival-crafter. Rather, it's an action-adventure game with an intriguing-sounding "non-violent combat system".</p>
<p>It'll offer four distinct biomes to explore, each with different creatures to discover and save. Said creatures range from dinosaur-like bipeds through to flying creatures reminiscent of mosquitoes, and plenty more besides.</p>
<p>Some of the creatures may look more dangerous or intimidating than others, but this isn't a game where you'll have to worry about getting blindsided by a giant stegosaurus, so don't worry.</p>
<p>You can check out a short but rather adorable trailer showing off a few of&nbsp;<em>Creatures of Ava</em>'s, well, creatures right here.</p>

<p>As well as the creatures themselves, you'll also meet with the Naam, a tribe of Ava's inhabitants who have their own unique customs to learn.</p>
<p>Those inhabitants will teach you melodies on the flute that you can use to pacify and tame some of Ava's wilder creatures. As you can tell, this one's all about working in harmony with nature rather than against it.</p>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2304440/Creatures_of_Ava/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/creatures-of-ava/9NV5LTSPHQD2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on August 7th, and it's also coming to Game Pass on day one. Give it a look if you want to bring out your inner animal lover.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-stories-2-sales-pass-the-two-million-mark.905907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-stories-2-sales-two-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone almost three years after the turn-based RPG's original release.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240619.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter 2: Wings of Ruin&nbsp;</em>has sold over two million copies since it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-of-ruins-release-date-and-more-revealed-in-digital-event">released in July 2021</a>. It originally launched on PC and Nintendo Switch before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-stories-2-announced-for-ps4-monster-hunter-stories-release-date-revealed">coming to PlayStation 4</a> last week.</p>
<p>The aforementioned press release doesn't break down what proportion of the game's sales are attributable to each platform, nor how much of a sales boost the PS4 version of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>may have provided.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2-sales-field.jpg?itok=19zUUSE5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2-sales-field.jpg?itok=yzjP1X13 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>offers turn-based RPG action with a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>twist.</figcaption></figure><p>On July 20th, 2021, around eleven days after&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>originally launched, Capcom announced that the game had <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e210720.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sold a million copies</a> around the world.</p>
<p>That means it's accrued another million since then, although that million has obviously been a lot slower to come than the first million was. Still, two million sales for a turn-based&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>spinoff is solid.</p>
<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>hasn't managed to reach the same level as mainline&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>does, but that's hardly fair given that the series is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-series-sales-100-million-anniversary">one of Capcom's biggest earners</a> alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million">franchises like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em></a>.</p>
<p>As for why&nbsp;<em>Stories 2&nbsp;</em>has captured so many people's imaginations, Capcom says it's down to the "engaging all-new story about Monster Riders", as well as other elements "unique to RPGs".</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em>, it is, believe it or not, the followup to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>, and just like that game, it's a turn-based RPG with a reduced focus on hunting compared to the main series.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em>, you play as the grandchild of legendary Rider Red, and you must investigate the reason behind Rathalos disappearing around the world.</p>
<p>As your journey unfolds, you'll recruit "Monsties" (d'aww) to your cause, hatching them from eggs and raising them to fight for you in battle.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1277400/Monster_Hunter_Stories_2_Wings_of_Ruin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007583" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-of-ruin-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

        <p>"What I see in Veilguard is a game that finally bridges the gap."</p>

            <p>
Former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-veterans-casey-hudson-and-mark-darrah-have-left-the-studio">left BioWare in 2020</a>, commenting that "I know that Dragon Age won't just survive without me, it will thrive". We'll never quite learn the truth of that claim, for Darrah has now rejoined BioWare to work as a consultant on the recently revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. He reckons it's thriving. Specifically, he thinks this is the most enjoyable Dragon Age's combat has ever been. Shhh, nobody tell the Inquisition.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"What I see in Veilguard is a game that finally bridges the gap," Darrah told internet-based magazine <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/18/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-combat-abilities-skill-tree-and">Game Informer</a> in a new preview that digs a bit deeper into the game's newly tactical management-lite fisticuffs. "Uncharitably, previous Dragon Age games got to the realm of 'combat wasn't too bad.' In this game, the combat's actually fun, but it does keep that thread that's always been there. You have the focus on Rook, on your character, but still have that control and character coming into the combat experience from the other people in your party." 
</p>
<p>
The piece also includes some commentary from game director Corinne Busche, who notes that Dragon Age's combat has long been in a state of flux, and justifies the shift towards real-time as making It Feel As Though You're Actually There. "Every single entry reimagines what combat is like and I would say our goal was to make sure we had a system that allowed players to feel like they actually were able to step into the world of Thedas," Busche told the site. "They're not a player observing from afar - they are inside of this world. Being this authentic world that's brought to life, the combat system needs to support that, so you are in control of every single action, every block, every dodge, every swing of your sword."
</p>
<p>
I'm always a bit grumpy about arguments that real-time combat is more immersive, authentic, or what-have-you than, say, turn-based. Dragon Age is a game in which I float in the air outside my character's body while they shoot purple lightning at demonic incarnations of pride. I am never going to feel like I'm "inside of this world", even if I push the button that fires that specific lightning bolt. I'm more convinced by Busche's following remarks that she wants Dragon Age: The Veilguard's combat and upgrades to hinge on "real numbers" - that is, chunky figures such as +25% whose impact can actually be understood at a glance. 
</p>
<p>
In general, Veilguard's upgrades are "about changing the way you play, not the statistical minutiae", Busche explains, with passive abilities including guaranteed critical hits and jump attacks. I would say that Inquisition's fussier percentages do change the way you play, but Veilguard's system definitely sounds like it'll involve less time in menus doing sums. The transition here reminds me of the transition from Darkest Dungeon 1 to Darkest Dungeon 2, which also simplifies the stats into multiples of 12.5, and is none the worse for it.
</p>
<p>
There's also some detail about companions, who get smaller upgrade trees than that of main character Rook (in Inquisition, each character has access to broadly the same quantity of options). They're levelled up by ranking up your Relationship with them, which earns a skill point; it sounds like they don't accrue XP the old-fashioned way, though the picture is unclear.
</p>
<p>
"[Companions] are their own people," Busche said of how companions act in the fray. "They have their own behaviors, they have their own autonomy on the battlefield, they'll pick their own targets. As their plots progress, they'll learn how to use their abilities more competently, and it really feels like you're fighting alongside these realized characters in battle." It's still important to wield character abilities in tandem, however. Busche gave the example of one character slowing time so that another can fire off a heavy knockdown attack, allowing the player to land a finishing blow. "It is a game about creating this organic sense of teamwork."
</p>

In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">my own first look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> I wrote that "I am definitely in mourning for the less kinetic, more strategic Dragon Age that might have been, but I'm more excited for Veilguard than I thought I'd be after copping the first trailer". Since then we've learned that the game will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-strips-your-rpg-party-down-to-two-companions-but-theyll-be-deeper-with-a-lot-more-banter">restrict you to a couple of companions in battle</a>, in another step away from Inquisition's party-based tactics. So yeah, still grieving a bit, but I remain hopeful that The Veilguard will prove an entertaining action-RPG if not the Dragon Age fourquel I wanted. The key thing, for me, will be the plot. I don't mind this being a slicked-back punchfest if there's a gorgeous dark fantasy melodrama involved. Fingers crossed I'm able to play again before release and get a sense of events beyond the prologue.

<p>Ubisoft is facing some controversy with the “Assassin’s Creed Shadows Dubbing Challenge” contest for TikTok, announced on June 18. The winners of this contest will be granted a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the captivating world of voice acting, joining a recording session led by seasoned professionals, including the renowned Danny Wallace (Shaun Hastings). </p>



<p>Participants will also be able to lend their voices to a secondary NPC, with their dubbing to be featured in the highly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows upon its release.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Contestants must follow Assassin’s Creed or Ubisoft TikTok accounts according to their preferred language out of the seven options. From there, they must choose one of the Assassin’s Creed cutscenes being progressively added to those accounts this week. Then, you must use the ‘Duet Feature’ and record yourself reading the script. Once that is done, post the video on your TikTok account with #AssassinsCreedDubbingChallenge. The team will then choose the best performer for each language.</p>



<p>After emerging victorious in the Ubisoft contest, the Assassin’s Creed team will fly you to London to lend your voice to a secondary NPC for AC Shadows. Furthermore, you will undergo specialized voice training under the guidance of a professional coach and will have a personal recording session. While this opportunity might seem like a dream to Assassin’s Creed players, industry experts have criticized it, labelling the contest as exploitative.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-accused-of-exploiting-fans-by-offering-voiced-roles-in-assassins-creed-shadows-as-contest-prize/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=ubisoft-accused-of-exploiting-fans-by-offering-voiced-roles-in-assassins-creed-shadows-as-contest-prize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Destructoid</a>, Senior voice artists such as Rufus Wright from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Jennifer Caitlin Roberts from Fire Emblem Heroes, and Jack Sapsford have voiced concerns about this challenge. <a href="https://x.com/rufusgwright/status/1803186900271763584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wright</a>, who has dedicated countless hours to voicing Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, a job for which he was compensated as a professional, stated, <em>“Using fans to work for free is a really, really bad look, particularly when these games gross billions of dollars.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/JackSapsford/status/1803119281036738711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sapsford</a> chimed in, stating that voicing lines for characters is considered <em>“a job and not a competition” </em>He also advised that contestants should remember to charge $250 per hour for their work. On the other hand, <a href="https://x.com/akaGhostBird/status/1803334410777026819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Caitlin Roberts</a> raised another important issue, asking Ubisoft whether we could get “confirmation” that the fan submissions will not be used to train AI, highlighting the ethical implications of the contest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the topic of AC Shadows, check out Insider Gaming’s recent reports on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what’s included in the game’s collector’s edition</a> and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-new-in-depth-gameplay-look-at-ubisoft-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay deep-dive from Ubisoft Forward 2024 </a>here.</p>
