			<p>Grand Theft Auto 4 with RTX Remix Path Tracing looks like the remaster we'll likely never get, introducing significant visual improvements that enhance the game's visuals considerably.</p>



<p>How much <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/">the mod developed by Xoxor4D</a> enhances the visuals of the fourth entry in the series by Rockstar Games is shown in a new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC.</a> The video showcases the vanilla version of the game running side by side with the path-traced version at 4K and 1440p resolutions, utilizing NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation.</p>



<p>As expected, the mod is highly demanding, and even high-end modern hardware has trouble running it at 60 FPS without Frame Generation, but the results seem well worth the performance hit,  although some of the visual elements of the game, besides lighting and shadows, need an evident update, such as character models and low-quality textures.</p>

<p>The Grand Theft Auto 4 RTX Remix mod is not yet available publicly. However, those interested in trying it out before its launch can do so by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xoxor4d">supporting Xoxor4D on Patreon.</a></p>



<p>Replaying through Grand Theft Auto 4 with RTX Remix path tracing and other mods is definitely a good way to make the wait for Grand Theft Auto 6 more bearable. The sixth entry in the series was initially scheduled to launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S this year, but <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Rockstar Games ultimately delayed the game to May 2026. </a></p>



<p>While no precise reason was provided for the game's delay, Rockstar Games stated in the message shared to announce the delay that the additional development time was required to meet and exceed players' expectations for a game whose launch is predicted to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">the biggest entertainment launch to date.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Happy Halloween! Yes, kids all around the nation get to enjoy one of life’s best treats: A Friday Halloween. Stay up late, kids, and eat so much candy. But before you wreck your teeth and stomachs, let’s get through today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Today, we have evidence of a <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake Xbox port, more layoff news, the reveal of pets in <em>Fortnite</em>, and some new ports of&nbsp;<em>Turok 2&nbsp;</em>arriving courtesy of Nightdive Studios.</p> <h2><strong><em>Fortnite</em> adds animal sidekicks</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640494"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640494">©Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-fortnite-sidekicks?lang=en-US">Epic announced</a> that the long-rumored pets feature is finally arriving in <em>Fortnite</em> on November 1 alongside<em> The Simpsons</em> mini-season. These tiny buddies are officially known as “Sidekicks” and will follow you around in battle royale and other <em>Fortnite</em> modes. However, enemy players won’t see them in competitive modes, so your cute puppy doesn’t give away your position and get you killed. Sidekicks will also be immune to damage and will feature their own customization options that can be unlocked by completing quests. I can already hear Epic’s bank account filling with even more money.</p>

 <h2><strong>The <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is likely coming to Xbox in the near future</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1okrnqd/silent_hill_2_has_been_rated_for_xbox_series_xs/">Folks have spotted</a> an ESRB rating for a yet-to-be-announced Xbox port of last year’s excellent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. This doesn’t officially confirm such a port will happen, but it seems very, very likely that Konami is gearing up to bring the remake to Xbox Series X/S in not too distant future. At the moment, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is only available on PS5 and PC.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>MGS3</em> remake’s multiplayer mode is now available</strong></h2>  <p>When Konami’s fancy remake of M<em>etal Gear Solid 3</em> launched back in August, the game’s promised multiplayer mode was missing as it needed more time in the oven. Now, <em>Fox Hunt</em> is finally out as part of a free update. At launch, <em>Fox Hunt</em> features two stealth-focused multiplayer modes and supports 12 players. While it ain’t a new version of <em>Metal Gear Online</em>, I’m certainly curious to check it out. I mean, once I find time to play it and the 20 other games I still need to play this year.</p> <h2><strong>More layoffs hit Heart Machine</strong></h2> <p>The studio behind <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>and <em>Solar Ash</em> is reportedly laying off employees for the second time this month. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-possessor-s-dev-heart-machine-lays-off-more-staff-two-weeks-before-the-game-s-launch">As reported by <em>GameDeveloper.com</em>,</a> at least four different staff members have recently posted on social media that they were laid off. One now out-of-work dev shared a video suggesting that by the time the studio’s next game, <span data-testid="content-text"><span><em>Possessor(s)</em>, launches on November 11, most, if not all, of the people who worked on it might be gone from the indie studio. This is the second round of layoffs to hit the company this month and the third round in early 2025.&nbsp;</span></span></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-battlefield-6-skins-silly-cosmetics-crossover-black-ops-7-steam-2000640251"><em>Arc Raiders</em> will avoid silly, immersion-breaking skins</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-price-inflation-trump-tariff-snap-2000640156">Candy prices are going up thanks to President Trump</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-simulator-2-room-interview-pine-studio-2000639908">A wonderful interview with the devs behind <em>Escape Sim 2</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Six One Publishing, a new publishing wing from the team behind the Six One Indie Showcase, has announced the first game under its label. Introducing Blue Ridge Hunting, a co-op horror game set in the Appalachian Mountains from Jade Meadows.</p>



<p>Players will either go on the hunt solo or with up to two friends to follow the journey of Levi Chambers, <strong>“a disgruntled West Virginia native haunted by sightings of the infamous Mothman his entire life.”</strong> </p>



<p>The game, according to the press release, will explore themes of trauma, grief, and family through the lens of Appalachian folklore.</p>



<p><strong>“The Appalachian Mountains are steeped in some of America’s most chilling folklore, home to legendary cryptids and unexplained phenomena,”</strong> the game’s description reads. <strong>“Step into the boots of the Appalachian Investigation Group, a team dedicated to tracking these elusive creatures. Using a range of tools and equipment, gather evidence, follow the clues, and embark on high-stakes hunts based on real sightings and local legends.”</strong></p>



<p>Features of the game include (courtesy of Six One Publishing):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Found Footage:&nbsp;</strong>A gritty retro/PSX art style inspired by early 3D horror and analog media.</li>



<li><strong>Always Listening:&nbsp;</strong>Creatures react to proximity voice chat and radio chatter. Communication is crucial, but dangerous.</li>



<li><strong>Into the Woods, Solo or Together:</strong>&nbsp;Explore the Appalachian wilds alone or with up to 5 players in online co-op freeplay mode.</li>



<li><strong>Bump In The Night:&nbsp;</strong>A narrative-driven story (1–3 players) following the Appalachian Investigation Group’s hunt for the truth.</li>



<li><strong>Experience The Legends:&nbsp;</strong>Face unique, intelligent creatures based on real Appalachian legends and folklore.</li>



<li><strong>Dark-Bluegrass Symphony:</strong>&nbsp;An original score that blends haunting melodies with Appalachian roots, amplifying the tension and tone.</li>
</ul>



<p>The game will launch first in early access and include a full story when 1.0 releases. There’s no release date just yet for Blue Ridge Hunting, but a demo is available now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2434930/Blue_Ridge_Hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Steam</a>, along with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jadecompany/blue-ridge-hunting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Kickstarter</a> to help with the game’s development. </p>

                <p>ModRetro has announced two new games for its Chromatic Classics Collection. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-for-game-boy-gets-new-physical-edition-for-franchises-30th-anniversary/1100-6534930/">After releasing a brand-new version of Rayman for Game Boy Color</a> earlier this year, the company is celebrating Croc and GameStop's mascot, Buck the Bunny with new cartridge releases.</p><p>Croc: 25th Anniversary Edition celebrates the cute little reptile's Game Boy Color adventure from 2000, and preorders will open on October 31--or Croctober 31 if you're a fan of the franchise--with a planned shipping date of December 2025. Priced at $45, the classic side-scrolling platformer features over 30 levels spread across four worlds. The original game revolved around Croc taking on Baron Dante and his minions, and this version features upgraded controls and enhanced save functions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594385" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594385"></a><figcaption>Croc: 25th Anniversary Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg"></figure><p>Buck and the Cursed Cartridge is billed as a fast-paced run-and-gun platformer from ModRetro. After the GameStop bunny picks up the titular cursed cartridge, he finds himself pulled into the game world and forced to fight for his life in this digital frontier. The game will feature multi-phase boss fights, upgradeable abilities, and even cheat codes. Priced at $45, it'll be available starting October 31. Both of these games will be available through the ModRetro store and GameStop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594386" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594386"></a><figcaption>Buck and the Cursed Cartridge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg"></figure><p>One thing to note about these games is that even though they have ModRetro and Chromatic branding on them, they'll still work just fine on the original Nintendo hardware and other FPGA handhelds like the Analogue Pocket.

It doesn't have a release date yet, but it does have an early-bird preorder price of $199.</p>

                <p>It seems that Square Enix is getting into the Halloween spirit and upping its fashion game. That would explain why the company behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14</a> announced on October 31 that its long-running MMO would do away with class requirements for glamours, the game's equivalent of transmogrification.</p><p>In layman's terms, players can now use the appearance of any armor set regardless of their current class and job. That means that healers like white mages can now ditch their fancy robes and look like hulking dark knights--one of Final Fantasy 14's tank classes--and vice versa. Pandæmonium, indeed.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1984241152321814609" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Fashion enjoyers, this one is for you!<br>From Patch 7.4 onward, you'll be able to equip any glamours regardless of your class/job! ✨<br>Mix and match your favorite outfits and slay on the battlefield! 💅 <a href="https://t.co/4WogdAbGM6" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/4WogdAbGM6</a></p>  — FINAL FANTASY XIV (@FF_XIV_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1984241152321814609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In the past, Final Fantasy 14 has been fairly strict about jobs using armor that falls within their respective schools of equipment. For example, all tanking and healing jobs share gear, but things get much dicier in this regard when looking at DPS roles, especially ones that differ between ranged attack and melee. As such--as well as to differentiate players and give these jobs unique visual identities--many of these roles have exclusive weapon and armor sets.</p><p>Players are then free to turn armor and weapons that their job can use into glamours, allowing them to swap between appearances and aesthetics that they prefer while using gear that is functionally better. Now though, Square Enix is throwing open the doors to Final Fantasy 14's intense fashion-savvy crowd by getting rid of any restrictions and multiplying player's dress options tenfold.</p><p>The change, which seems to going over <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/en.finalfantasyxiv.com/post/3m4ij6vvmes2z/quotes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">exceptionally well</a> with players, will be introduced in the forthcoming 7.4 patch, which releases on December 16.

            <p>Nintendo has won a lawsuit against streamer Jesse Keighin, who was sued by the Japanese video game giant for allegedly streaming pirated games before they were released.
</p>
<p>Nintendo also alleged that Keighin had taunted the company, claiming he sent a letter: "boasting that he has 'a thousand burner channels' to stream from and 'can do this all day'". <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-wins-lawsuit-against-defiant-pirate-streamer-everygameguru/">Outlet Torrent Freak</a> reported that Keighin posted on Facebook: "Should have done more research on me. You might run a corporation, I run the streets."
</p>
<p>Following the successful lawsuit, Colorado federal courts have ordered Keighin to pay $17,500 to Nintendo. The judge presiding over the case did reject two of Nintendo's permanent injunctions however, these being related to the destruction of circumvention devices, as well as an injunction to apply to third parties who were involved alongside Keighin.

</figure>
<p>The judge deemed the request to destroy these circumvention devices "unclear" and "unreasonable", due to the fact that Keighin used online emulation services. As for an injunction applicable to third parties, the judge rejected the proposal as Nintendo failed to specify who these third parties were.
</p>
<p>The $17,500 figure comes from a $10,000 fine for Keighin's latest infringement, the streaming of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brotherhood, while the remaining $7,500 comes from fifteen separate $500 fines for multiple previous violations of Nintendo's anti-piracy measures.
</p>
<p>This is the latest development in an ongoing war raged by Nintendo against pirates. It was only earlier this month when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-seeks-45m-against-reddit-moderator-accused-of-pirating-switch-games-in-latest-crackdown-against-piracy">Nintendo announced its intent to sue a Reddit moderator accused of pirating its games for $4.5m</a>. Nintendo previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">updated its Nintendo Account Agreement, reserving the right to brick consoles in an attempt to curb piracy</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Panic Stations is a new game developer formed by former Mediatonic developers who worked on the popular competitive multiplayer title, Fall Guys. The studio announced itself with a <a href="https://x.com/PanicStationsHQ/status/1983881949266530781">post on its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a> in a video filled with cartoon pigeons. Joe Walsh, a game designer at Panic Stations, provides the voice over for the first pigeon you see, beginning the video by saying, "<em>Games should be funnier and they should be stupider. Here at Panic Stations, we're going to fix that</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The team is currently working on its debut game, which it says is "<em>not about pigeons</em>" <a href="https://www.panicstations.com/">according to its website</a>. In an interview with GamesIndustry.Biz, co-founder Paul Croft said, "<em>I'm a huge fan of the online co-op space and it's been amazing to see it evolve over the last few years. It is really exciting to team-up with some old friends - we're aiming to build games that bring immediate joy to players and bring people closer together</em>."</p>



<p>Croft is not wrong to point out that cooperative games are having a bit of a moment, especially when you consider how successful games like Peak, R.E.P.O., and Lethal Company have been recently. A cooperative game with a solid gameplay loop that also encourages comedic gameplay scenarios is a real recipe for success.</p>



<p>Whatever Panic Stations makes for their debut game, it'll certainly be interesting to see, especially when considering the pedigree they have coming from Fall Guys, a game that absolutely no one saw coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fall-guys-falling-in-and-out-of-love/">when it first arrived in 2020</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>South Korean game studio Shift Up recently posted a developer interview video to celebrate the third anniversary of its RPG <em>Goddess of Victory: NIK</em>KE. And as reported by <em><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shift-up-says-it-doesnt-tolerate-any-expressions-of-hate-in-nikke-following-backlash-over-alleged-small-genital-gesture/">Automation Media</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/articles/405545">ThisIsGame,</a> </em>during this video, the studio’s director Hyungsuk Yoo took a hard stance against “<a href="https://youtu.be/dYEX1ND8HrI?t=1864">hateful expressions</a>” in the popular RPG, saying: “We will never tolerate anyone intentionally inserting hate speech into <em>NIKKE</em> or approaching the game with that mindset.”</p> <p>However, the devs don’t directly mention what this is in reference to in the video; it’s very likely an attempt to address a controversial situation involving a piece of art created for <em>NIKKE</em> and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_pinching_conspiracy_theory">odd conspiracy online involving a pinched hand gesture</a> that many men in South Korea believe mocks men with small penises.</p>

 <p>In August, to celebrate the game’s 1,000th day in operation, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251030-53477-001.jpg">a piece of artwork was released.</a> Some South Korean men online alleged that two characters in the artwork were covertly flashing the pinched fingers gesture. <a href="https://game.naver.com/lounge/nikke/board/detail/6464533">Shift Up quickly apologized</a>, edited the image <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251030-53477-002.jpg">to remove the gestures</a>, and blamed the whole incident on an overseas team responsible for the art. But that hasn’t stopped many online players from continuing to harass the devs and leave angry comments. So the recent commitment against “hateful expressions” is seen by many as the studio’s latest attempt to calm things down.</p> <p>It’s unlikely this will work, though, as the “Crab Hand” gesture has become a widely embraced conspiracy theory among many men in South Korea who believe it to be connected to a feminist movement in the country that some believe went too far. As a result of this situation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_pinching_conspiracy_theory#List_of_notable_responses">many, many companies have faced backlash</a> for artwork or ads that seem to include “crab hands,” even when it seems obvious that the art wasn’t intended to mock anyone or the hands are only vaguely pinched.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-race-polymarket-clair-obscur-2000640468</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/betting-markets-have-decided-silksong-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-a-chance-in-hell-of-winning-game-of-the-year.1340446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Polymarket has opened up betting on The Game Awards 2025 and no one seems to have a doubt that <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> will take top honors at Geoff Keighley’s showcase. The odds are so stacked in the French RPG’s favor that a $100 bet on <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> would net you over $1,000 if it actually ended up winning game of the year instead.</p> <p>Gambling on the 2025 GOTY race opened up on <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/game-awards-game-of-the-year-2025">Polymarket</a> on October 29, well in advance of anyone actually voting on what game will actually win has even begun. The Best Game category is decided by media ballots (90 percent) and fan voting (10 percent) with the winner revealed during the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267">live show on December 11</a>.</p>

 <p>Nominees are chosen in November followed by a final round of voting. While it’s Keighley’s show, he doesn’t participate in any part of the selection process. Also, full disclosure, <em>Kotaku</em> has never participated in voting and nothing in this article should be mistaken for financial advice (that’s a thing you’re supposed to write, right?)</p>

 <p>With all of those wrinkles in mind, the first 48 hours of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-goty-game-of-the-year-past-winners-list-1851721067">GOTY race</a> on Polymarket were interesting to witness. While<em> Clair Obscur</em> is currently leading with bets suggesting an 80 percent chance of winning, it didn’t start out that way. It was actually<em> Silksong</em> who was the frontrunner in the initial hour after the market opened. Whoever was betting first must have been all in on the Metroidvania hype.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640482" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640482"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640482">Polymarket / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But it didn’t take long for the pack of frontrunners, which also included <em>Death Stranding 2</em> and <em>Hades 2</em>, to fall way behind Sandfall Interactive’s surprise turn-based hit. All of those other games are not currently trending in the single-digits. <em>Silksong</em> is second with 8 percent, <em>Hades 2</em> is third with 5 percent, and <em>Death Stranding</em> only has 3 percent. Over $75,000 has been wagered so far.</p>

 <p>From there<em> Split Fiction</em>, <em>The Oute Worlds 2</em>, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em>, and <em>Blue Prince</em> all have at least a percentage point. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> and every other game that came out this year, on the other hand, are all at decimal points. Shockingly, there is over $900 of betting volume on <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, a game which is not coming out this year. I guess someone didn’t get the memo.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Clair Obscur </em>GOTY train keeps chugging along</h2> <p>What can we make of all this? Remember, prediction markets aren’t an indication of what will happen, they’re a measure of what people&nbsp;<em>think</em> might happen. The complete domination of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> could mean that lots of people played it and think it’s great, or it could just mean people who like placing wagers on Polymarket are seeing how jazzed everyone else is about the game and trying to refine that online noise into quantifiable signals.</p>

 <p><em>Polygon</em>‘s Oli Welsh, who maintains a rolling list of GOTY frontrunners based on a mix of experience, vibes, and data, has had <em>Clair Obscur</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/546327/game-of-the-year-game-awards-2025-frontrunners/">in the lead for a while</a>. Maybe Polymarket users are taking their cues from him! One of the only variations from the current betting landscape is that he has<em> Yotei </em>in closer contention, even if it’s still an outside shot. If you look at Metacritic, however, <em>Hades 2</em> technically has a higher composite review score from all of the aggregated critics. Those are the people who do most of the voting, after all.</p> <p>The actual mechanics of how various outlets vote, from magazines like <em>Game Informer</em> to YouTube groups like <em>Easy Allies</em>, probably play an even bigger role in deciding the outcome than ambient industry vibes. Some ballots are decided on purely by the head of those outlets. Others do informal internal voting. Some might make choices based on what they&nbsp;<em>think</em> is supposed to be the right answer, just like the Polymarket folks are doing. Others might decide based purely on what the most people at that outlet played and liked. Often passion carries the day. Five people really liking game X might not carry the day against three who think Y is the most important game of the decade.</p> <p>Will that messy, inconsistent process yield <em>Clair Obscur</em> as the winner this year? The users on Polymarket clearly think so. We won’t know until the paper envelope is opened on stage by the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-rebirth-astro-bot-winners-goty-list-1851720291">makers of last year’s winner<em>, Astro Bot</em></a>.</p>

              <p>Laptops that are specifically designed with gamers and creatives in mind usually don’t come cheap. While the exact price depends on the configuration, most of the powerful options out there with solid graphics easily cross the $1,000 mark. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p>Amazon has slashed the price of the latest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5200/">16-inch HP Elitebook (AMD Ryzen 5, 32GB DDR5 RAM and 1TB PCIe SSD) down to $859, after an unbelievable $1,540 discount on the retail price of $2,399</a>. This is the lowest we have seen this machine drop to in a long while, and we don’t expect the offer to be around for long. It’s best to grab yours before it’s too late. There’s no telling if this discount will return for Black Friday or if the stock will even last that long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5200/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Reliable Performance for Both Work and Play</h2>
<p>Like most HP laptops, this machine comes in a sleek, lightweight build with a premium finish. The screen is a 16-inch diagonal Anti-Glare WUXGA display that delivers sharp, bright visuals. 400 nits of brightness keep everything clear in all lighting conditions, while blue light support makes all-nighters easier on your eyes. It’s also paired with Radeon 740M graphics, which can handle streaming and gaming without stutters.</p>
<p>There’s a spill-resistant, backlit keyboard that’s quite comfortable to use for longer sessions. Calls are made easy with a 5MP camera paired with Poly Studio-tuned speakers and AI noise reduction – you’ll look your best, and sound just as good.</p>



<p>For power, you’re getting a 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 processor that can clock up to 4.9GHz; perfect for heavier workloads. Even better, it’s backed by 32GB of DDR5 RAM for some impressive multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD that offers much faster boot times than traditional drives. 1TB is also enough space to store all your essentials, from media content to work documents and games.</p>
<p>Connectivity-wise, it comes with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connections, plus a full selection of ports including HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, two USB-A ports, and two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports.</p>
<p>The machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, meaning you’ll enjoy a bunch of productivity features right from the get-go. Microsoft Copilot takes the experience even further by assisting you with your day-to-day tasks. It can quickly pull answers to questions, summarize content, and help you stay organized. If you’ve been looking for a powerful upgrade without blowing your budget, this deal is worth grabbing.</p>

<p>Big releases continue to come thick and fast heading into the final months of the year, and the release date for Where Winds Meet stands out as one of the most anticipated in November.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet is set to make waves across the rest of the world, having made its mark in China upon release last year, with millions of players signing up for pre-registration rewards ahead of the drop of the free-to-play title.</p>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting the journey across ancient China and are ready to learn the ways of Wuxia combat, we’ve got all the important details on the release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-where-winds-meet-coming-out">When is Where Winds Meet Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>On the horizon. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Where Winds Meet is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC on Friday, November 14, and is available as a free-to-play title.</strong></p>



<p>Initially released in China in December 2024, Where Winds Meet’s global launch is on the horizon and has attracted a wealth of interest, receiving over seven million pre-registrations.</p>



<p>Almost a year since the release in China, Where Winds Meet is well-prepped for the global launch, and there isn’t too much longer to wait before you can begin your adventure.</p>



<p>As ever, though, there will be a bit more waiting depending on where you are located in the world, as the start times vary for time zones.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-where-winds-meet-start-time">Do We Know The Where Winds Meet Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Where Winds Meet has a global release of 3 PM PT on November 14, with access to the game opening for everyone across the world at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike a staggered release, which allows some players in Australia and New Zealand, for example, to be the first to jump in, there are no advantages for such locations this time. In fact, players in those time zones eagerly awaiting the release of Where Winds Meet will actually have to wait a little longer.</p>



<p>The doors open for Where Winds Meet at 3 PM PT, likely to be the same across all platforms, which means a wait until later in the evening, or even the next day, for some time zones.</p>



<p>The table below highlights the release time for Where Winds Meet in major time zones across the world, as shown by the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/where-winds-meet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Where Winds Meet Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">6 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">10 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Nov. 15</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p dir="ltr">However, there are a couple of caveats to consider. For starters, Arc Raiders broke the Steam record when including PvP extraction shooters, but it's arguably not a requirement to fit in the genre. Without PvP, Helldivers 2 holds the top spot for the genre, according to<a href="https://steamdb.info/tag/1199779/" rel="nofollow "> SteamDB</a>, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stop-shtting-your-pants-helldivers-2-boss-jokes-as-game-passes-500000-concurrents/1100-6534312/">saw a huge resurgence in player counts</a> when the game came to Xbox Series X|S in August. Meanwhile, Escape From Duckov has peaked on Steam with a little over 300,000 concurrent players and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-duckov-briefly-outgunned-battlefield-6-on-steam-this-week/1100-6535685/">outgunned Battlefield 6 briefly</a> last week.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of which, Escape From Tarkov looms large in this discussion. The game that arguably put extraction shooters on the map <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-will-finally-escape-early-access-this-fall/1100-6534196/">will finally come to Steam on November 15</a> as part of the version 1.0 release. People who already own Escape From Tarkov <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-on-steam-will-require-you-buy-it-again/1100-6534783/">will have to pay again to play on Steam</a>, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Arc Raiders is also available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S--in addition to PC. So keep in mind the concurrent-player numbers are obviously larger than just what's seen on Steam. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-cross-play-and-cross-saves-explained/1100-6535834/">does have cross-play and cross-save</a>, too.

                <p>Before Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a> remake was released last October, there was a report that the game would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-playstation-console-exclusive-for-at-least-a-year/1100-6526604/" data-ref-id="1100-6526604">a timed exclusive for PlayStation 5</a> for at least a year. Now, the year is up and an updated listing by the Entertainment Software Rating Board appears to indicate that a leap to Xbox Series X|S is immanent.</p><p>The ESRB has slightly modified <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its Silent Hill 2 page</a> (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>) to state that it's certified for the "Xbox Series" consoles. The rating itself hasn't changed, and it's still M for Mature. However, Microsoft and Konami have yet to formally announce the port or set a date for it. We can't even say for certain if Silent Hill 2 will get a physical release on Xbox, or if it will be digital only.</p><p>For now, there are no signs on the ESRB page that Silent Hill 2 will be coming to Switch 2 any time soon. But it's not out of the realm of possibility for the future.</p><p>Following Bloober Team's success with the Silent Hill 2 remake, Konami announced that the studio is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/" data-ref-id="1100-6532382">a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>. That project doesn't currently have a release window.</p><p>The most recent game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a>, was released last month to largely positive reviews. Konami announced that title alongside Silent Hill 2's remake, and Silent Hill: Townfall during the same livestream in 2022. Series producer Motoi Okamoto has said that the team revealed all three projects at once because, "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-producer-explains-why-konami-announced-three-games-at-once/1100-6535588/" data-ref-id="1100-6535588">We wanted people to feel how serious we were about reviving the series</a>."</p><p>Outside of the games, a new live-action film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-will-hit-theaters-in-early-2026/1100-6532537/" data-ref-id="1100-6532537">Return to Silent Hill</a>, will be released on January 23, 2026. The movie will be an adaptation of Silent Hill 2, and sees the return of the original film's director, Christoph Gans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/battlefield-6-reclaims-no1-as-ea">The Game Business</a>, backed by <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD data</a> shows that for last week's EU video game sales (October 19-26), Battlefield 6 has taken back the top spot after Pokémon Legends Z-A <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/">had it for its launch week.</a> Legends Z-A drops to third, with EA Sports FC 26 keeping its top-three spot on both the units sold and revenue earned sales charts.</p>



<p>After Pokémon Legends Z-A took the top spot for its launch week, with Battlefield 6 in second and EA Sports FC 26 in third, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-eu-launch-sales/">Battlefield 6 is back on top</a> with EA Sports FC 26 in second, and Pokémon in third, with regard to units sold. However, this is the point where it should be noted that Nintendo does not share digital sales data, and that the numbers GSD uses are only based on physical sales.</p>



<p>Every other entry on the top ten list for revenue and units sold that's not a Nintendo game is based on both digital and physical sales, so while it's possible that Pokémon Legends Z-A could remain in third place if we had a complete picture, it's also a safe bet that Legends Z-A has in fact remained at the top spot in the charts when including digital sales.</p>



<p>But we don't have the digital sales data, so as it stands, the top three are the same for the revenue earned charts. Beyond the top three, both charts start to show discrepancies, some more significant than others.</p>



<p>Like how on the units sold charts, Ninja Gaiden 4, one of the many major releases in October, is nowhere to be found. The same goes for The Outer Worlds 2; however, both games earned a spot in the top ten for revenue earned, with Ninja Gaiden 4 making the list in the number six spot and The Outer Worlds 2 squeezing in at the number nine spot.</p>



<p>There are also three games on the units sold charts that don't make the revenue charts, and only one of them is a new release. That marker goes to Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted, which makes the units sold top-ten at number six and then just below Grand Theft Auto V, in the number eight spot is Titanfall 2, which jumps up 3,688% compared to where it was on the charts a week prior.</p>



<p>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is another that made huge leaps to make it into the top ten at the number ten spot on the units sold charts. Both leaps are impressive on the face of it, though slightly less impressive when checking their price history via SteamDB, which shows that both <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1237970/">Titanfall 2</a> and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1328670/">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> are coming off a major sale where they were both 90% off, making the cost for one of the best shooters of all time and one of the best RPG trilogies of all time the price of a coffee to pick up, if you didn't already own them.</p>

              <p>As we enter into the holiday season, there’s one event in particular to look forward to and that’s Black Friday (and to a lesser extent, Cyber Monday). It’s a great time to get some of your gift shopping wrapped up, or for you to get some gifts for yourself while saving some cash. Even though we’ve still got a few more weeks to go, you can find some Black Friday-level deals at Amazon if you look hard enough.</p>
<p>For the PC gamers out there – if you’ve been on the hunt for a new gaming monitor, you can right <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5199/">now save 40% on this LG UltraGear display: It normally goes for $499, so after the discount, it comes down to just $299</a>.</p>

And with a 1ms response time, you can expect your controls to feel responsive and snappy. Don’t discount the importance of a fast input time. It could be the difference between feeling like light on your feet or feeling like you’re moving through mud. I’ve been playing&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>at first on an old 2017 Vizio TV on my Xbox, but recently moved over to a new monitor for my PC and it’s night and day. The platforming sections have become a breeze.</p>
<p>The display has smooth visuals with vivid colors and high-resolution graphics made possible via the HDMI 2.1 input and DisplayPort 1.4 input. Both allow for up to 240Hz as well.</p>

The FPS counter and display your real-time data so you can ensure you’re games are running optimally.</p>
<p>The headphone jack is capable of sending over accurate spatialization and localization for games that support 3D audio. Fully immerse yourself in you game, hearing sound from all directions.</p>
<p>The stand is fully adjustable. The LG UltraGear can be slid up and down and titled forward and back. This allows you to perfectly position it in your sight line and even adjust it as you play as your posture changes. Always have the best view possible. If you’re using this as a secondary monitor, you can consider turning the display to stand vertically. This can be great for save space on your desk as well as to read through messages over Discord or Slack in a separate window.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace has been out for almost two years now, but its playerbase is growing increasingly exasperated over a persistent issue impacting players with dark-skinned custom main characters: their characters are literally invisible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're unfamiliar with Love and Deepspace, it's an otome game developed by Chinese studio Papergames and published globally by Infinity Nikki developer Infold Games. Love and Deepspace is unique in that it's a 3D otome game with action RPG elements, where players can build relationships with five different potential love interests while also fighting off space monsters. But the romantic elements are the big draw, with visual novel segments and highly detailed, fully animated cutscenes between the player character, or MC, and their love interest, presented as gameplay rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace has now been out since January 2024, almost two years. It's been wildly successful during that time, too, with over 50 million players worldwide as of 2025. It won Best Mobile Game at Gamescom this year, and has been praised for its positive tone toward women and their needs in relationships. Admittedly, Love and Deepspace isn't exactly a pioneer on the diversity front: there's only one body type available for the MC, and all the available love interests are light-skinned. But there are a variety of customization options for the MC's looks, including multiple darker skin tones. It's a feature which hasn't historically been a common one in otome games, and which has helped players with darker skin create MCs that they feel represent them in the romantic scenarios the game presents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But ever since its release, players have been reporting issues with the game's lighting causing MCs with darker skin tones to look weirdly shadowed, or occasionally become totally invisible during certain cutscenes. The complaints go back to the launch of the game and are still being posted as recently as this week, and they all look something like this:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/Love_Deepspace?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Love_Deepspace</a> for giving us darker skin players NO LIGHTING in this new card😒 <a href="https://t.co/innx60E7et" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/innx60E7et</a></p>— MadameSynclair (@MoonkissedMuse) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoonkissedMuse/status/1976999057332879509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That's, uh, pretty bad! The issue isn't consistent across every cutscene and varies depending on skin tone, but the common factor is that players whose MCs have darker skin tones never know, when a new update is released, if their characters will be visible in the cutscenes or not. Players experiencing this issue say they've reported it to Infold many times, and recently, IGN received a small flood of submissions to its tips email aliases from players upset about the issue. Until now, Infold hasn't said anything about the issue at all. But when IGN reached out for comment, Infold provided the following statement:</p><blockquote>At Infold Games, we’ve always believed that our games are shaped together with the players who love them. The community’s feedback, discussions, and creative passion are what keep Love and Deepspace evolving and alive.</blockquote><blockquote>We’ve seen the conversations and truly value everyone who has taken the time to share their experiences and thoughts. Every comment, whether it’s about visuals, storytelling, or representation, helps us better understand how our work resonates across different perspectives and cultures.</blockquote><blockquote>Love and Deepspace is, at its heart, a shared world of emotion and imagination. We hope to keep building it hand in hand with our players, learning and improving together along the way.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace players are understandably frustrated by this issue. After all, the game has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-love-and-deepspaces-quest-to-become-the-biggest-name-in-global-romance-games">explicitly been promoted by the company</a> for its extremely in-depth technical achievements in getting every detail of the characters to feel real: hair, skin, clothing, everything. It would be one thing if this was a one-time issue with one card that was quickly fixed. But after two years and absolutely no acknowledgement, players with darker skin are linking the problem to long-time issues in games with racism and colorism. Even if it's not intentionally malicious, they say, it all goes back to developers prioritizing making sure white skin tones look good, and only throwing in darker skin tones as an afterthought, without taking care to make sure they look just as nice. As <a href="https://x.com/StarPop_Arts/status/1924726566807871759" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one player, StarPop, put it eloquently on Twitter back in May</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In history, dating games has been set where it was just a fair/pale Mc and black/brown players don't invest in playing the game because they don't see themselves. For us, we are seeing someone else or pretending to be someone we're not. Because of racism and colorism, pale skin meant beauty as dark tones meant dirty, disgusting, unlovable just because they don't 'fit the beauty standard'. With dating games that doesn't suggest skin tone variation, it's another way of telling us that we aren't worthy of love nor attention. For games that's supposed to represent you falling in love and being treated fairly because the love interests love you for who you are, it excluded many potential players due to it. When Love and Deepspace came out, black/brown players got into it and it felt like heaven that the MCs skin tone can change."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">In history, dating games has been set where it was just a fair/pale Mc and black/brown players don't invest in playing the game because they don't see themselves.

"Just doing lighting on a default mc when you implemented different tones doesn't work because not everyone has the same skin tone."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">StarPop's thread is just one person's experience, but it reflects dozens of other comments from non-white players and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ryjVLOrjrA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content creators</a> that have <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@his_lily00/video/7562744637941714189?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-90xSrjMQOpZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popped up</a> across social media on Twitter, Reddit, Discord, YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms over the last two years. Unfortunately, many of the comments recently have begun despairing of there ever being a fix to this issue. Though the community is still encouraging players to report the issue to Infold during player surveys, it's without any real hope of change:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I almost made a post about this but realized it wasn't worth getting my or anyone else's hopes up," wrote one Reddit user in a reply to another post on the subject from three days ago. "Not saying people should give up campaigning that they fix it (not even make dark skin MCs look perfect, just VISIBLE), but with the complexity of the lightning and the fact that they couldn't even be bothered to change the shading on the injuries in Edge of Continuum (my MC's "scratches" look like she tried to apply the wrong foundation, THERE ARE ONLY LIKE 5 SKIN COLORS BRO, COME ON), I'm resigning myself to having to submit another bug report that my MC looks like a shadow person and just enjoying the card as much as I can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And if by some miracle they actually addressed it and it looks decent, I will give InFold every last prop in my arsenal. All the props, straight to their inbox."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

And now, a similar rating has been added to the site specifically for the "Xbox Series" platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unlikely to be a surprise to most — we already knew that the remake of the horror game was a year-long console exclusive for PS5, and that expired last month — but it's good news nonetheless given Konami itself had been a little coy about when we may see the port release on Xbox Series consoles (and silent completely on the highly anticipated Born From a Wish DLC).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-hit-25-million-as-franchise-surpasses-10-million"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake has sold 2.5 million worldwide</u></a>, which pushes sales of the franchise overall to 10 million.

                <p>A single throwing knife was the most devastating weapon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> when the game first launched, and a few weeks later, Gearbox finally fixed the infamous tool. Seemingly gone for good, the "Crit Knife" has come back from the dead, as this week's update has restored it to <em>most</em> of its former glory.</p><p>Originally, the Crit Knife was creating an unintended damage loop that allowed players to melt through even the toughest bosses within seconds. You'd need a throwing knife with the Penetrator augment to achieve this effect, as it would increase your critical hit chance to 100% for five seconds. With the Crit Knife dominating the Borderlands 4 meta and overshadowing viable builds, it was eventually nerfed in the October 23 patch alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-horny-shield-wasnt-supposed-to-be-that-horny-actually/1100-6535701/" data-ref-id="1100-6535701">horny BDSM shield</a>.</p><p>This new version of the Crit Knife wasn't bad, but it definitely left a lot to be desired. Gearbox made it so that the Penetrator Augment would create a flat 30% critical hit chance for five seconds, which could actually reduce the effect if you had any buffs or gear equipped to increase it.</p><p>This week's patch has changed things up yet again, as a bug has now made the Penetrator Augment capable of adding an extra 30% critical hit chance--and it can stack when used--giving players up to 90% critical hit chance over the five-second window of opportunity.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Lazy_Data/status/1984024985414070688" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">100% CRIT KNIFE IS BACK!<br>Yeah you just throw it 3 times now lmao and get 90%. a 4th to go over or just have any other crit chance. <br>Silly but yeah. lmao.

Gearbox has been doing weekly updates and hotfixes to the game since launch, and this will likely be patched out soon. For now, if you have the Crit Knife, enjoy it while it lasts.</p><p>If you still need one, you can always redeem a few <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/">Borderlands 4 Shift codes to add a few Golden Keys to your inventory</a>, which can then be used to unlock treasure chests containing powerful randomized gear around the Kairos map. In related news, 2K announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-next-crossover-is-one-you-will-never-guess/1100-6535741/">Borderlands 4 was set to invade PGA Tour 2K25</a> this week. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/">The game has had impressive sales in the US</a> so far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-first-paid-dlc-brings-new-story-based-missions-bosses-and-legendary-loot/1100-6535395/">and its first post-launch DLC</a> will add more story missions, bosses, and new loot in November.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Today is the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-track-list-every-game-song-system">Nintendo Music</a>, the well-received app for smart devices that gives you access to some of the most notable OSTs from the publisher's history. At launch, the app provided us all with a way to listen to music from the likes of Animal Crossing New Horizons, Wii Channels, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox-64">Star Fox 64</a>, Metroid, Mario Kart, and more.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, we've seen Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-of-gamings-most-memorable-tunes-is-now-available-on-nintendo-music">slowly but surely adding more music</a> to the app, bringing franchises like Fire Emblem, Kirby and more into the service. In a world of muddy legal rights and in which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-donkey-kong-credits-furore-says-it-values-contributions-that-all-staff-make">Nintendo doesn't particularly like handing out full credit to devs that worked on its games</a>, Nintendo Music represents something quite pure, and - importantly - helpful for fans of older games.</p>
<p>But when it comes to physical releases of its music, Nintendo has always been a bit more protective. Yes, it is possible to get some Nintendo OSTs on CD in the West, but it's always been a bit of a chore - these releases have either been tied to promotions, packed-in with games at retail (such as the release for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-skyward-sword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a> back in 2011), or locked behind MyNintendo points redemptions, or similar. The company has long seemed reticent to provide fans with a legal and approachable way to own physical versions of its music. Until this week.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Nintendo and Laced Records <a href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-soundtrack-limited-edition-8xlp-box-set-000000000010018665">announced a collaboration</a> that will see the record company launch a couple of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> vinyl soundtrack collections - the first time, ever, that the 136-year-old company will issue products like this outside of Japan.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Mouth-watering, isn't it? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Laced Records</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Releasing 19th June, 2026, Laced and Nintendo are bringing multiple versions of the Breath of the Wild soundtrack to market. The collections come in the form of both two- and eight-LP sets, and will retail at <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/products/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-limited-edition-deluxe-double-vinyl">£36 (or $50)</a> and <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/products/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-deluxe-x8lp-boxset">£145 ($195)</a>, respectively. The two-disc set will contain a curated tracklist of 34 songs, whilst the bigger eight-disc set will house a massive 130 tracks from the game. The songs are arranged by mood and theme, meaning each side should present a soundscape and tone familiar to anyone that's played through Link's Hyrule adventure.</p><p>"When I founded Laced over 10 years ago, I could have only dreamt about partnering with such an iconic game company as Nintendo," says Danny Kelleher, founder and CEO of Laced Records. "To bring these beautiful vinyl products to life for The Legend of Zelda franchise has been a dream come true for me and the team at Laced. We worked closely with Nintendo to ensure these vinyl releases were of the highest quality, from the design and packaging to sequencing the tracklists for the two LP and the eight LP.</p>
<p>"The fan and video game vinyl community response has been incredibly positive. After months of hard work behind the scenes with Nintendo, it's a real honour to finally share these products with the world."</p>
<p>I'm sure it's been no small feat getting Nintendo on-board with this deal; the fact that a relatively small British company has managed to get Nintendo to play ball on a release like this is a watershed moment, and perhaps - <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/10/29/breath-of-the-wild-vinyl-nintendo-music/">per comments given to the Washington Post</a> by Bill Trinen, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a>’s vice president of player and product experience - represents Nintendo testing the market ahead of more releases in a similar vein.</p>
<figure>

<p>"As we're looking at Nintendo and our intellectual property, one of the things we've really started to zero in on is there's a lot more opportunity around music and we've got a broad music library," Trinen said to the outlet. Official Pokémon vinyl, anyone?</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>One of my most prized records. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for Laced, as an avid collector of video game music and records, I can say that the company produces incredibly well-made products, and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> OST collection is one of the records I'm most protective of in my collection. Laced's Tekken 3 print is just behind it (at least when it comes to VGM). The asking price may be quite steep, but I think the quality is there, and - for any of you waxheads out there - this stuff tends to accrue value at a ludicrous rate, too, so it's always going to be a decent investment.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us. The gaming audience, in particular, seems hungry for ownership of its purchases, and a move towards more readily-available physical media can only ever be a good thing, as far as I'm concerned. I'll be watching this space with anticipation.</p>

<p>Pre-order bonus revealed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has today opened up pre-orders for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, and there's a teaser of some additional side story DLC coming our way later in 2026.</p>
<p>The new trailer (above) finishes with a brief look at everything included in the game's 'Deluxe' and 'Premium Deluxe' Edition packages. It's mainly bonus armour and hair customisations, but there's also that 'Side Story: Rudy' mention to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>It's a little vague, but here's the official summary of this DLC from the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/stories3/en-uk/">Twisted Reflection website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A side story about Rudy, whose family have served as Azurian Royal Palicoes for generations.<br>
One day, while accompanying the protagonist on a survey of some egg quartz, Rudy makes a surprising discovery!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That tells us... not a lot, honestly. The additional side story is expected to launch in Autumn 2026, so we're sure we'll hear a little more about the bonus in the coming months — the base game itself doesn't launch until <strong>13th March</strong>, let's not forget.</p>
<p>We know that the Rudy bonus is included as standard in the Deluxe and Premium Deluxe editions (the former of which is now available to pre-order on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Monster-Hunter-Stories-3-Twisted-Reflection-2951637.html#Deluxe_Edition">EU eShop</a> for £74.99), but Capcom is yet to reveal any info on purchasing the DLC separately.</p>
<p>Either way, keep an eye on those storefronts, because Twisted Reflections pre-orders are starting to roll out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>‘s most overpowered weapons, if not the most OP, is a simple Throwing Knife with a Penetrator augment. It boosts your chance of critical hits and makes it easy to melt bosses in the process. Gearbox Entertainment has been trying to nerf the player-favorite “crit knife” for weeks but it keeps messing up, and now it’s back with a vengeance.</p> <p>Back when the game launched, the Penetrator augment increased your crit chance to 100 percent for five seconds. With the right loadout, that was more than enough time to completely deplete even some of the biggest enemy health pools. Here it is in action:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lmao crit knife absolutely needs to be nerfed <a href="https://t.co/gXxYoZjSfE">pic.twitter.com/gXxYoZjSfE</a></p> <p>— Nick (@TheOneSoVile) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOneSoVile/status/1977528266425848227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So the developers committed to nerfing the crit knife to bring some semblance of balance back to the meta, or at least spice it up a bunch.&nbsp; This balance patch was due out in early October but got delayed a couple of times. When it finally arrived via the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oe72cs/borderlands_4_update_notes_october_23_2025/">October 23 update</a>, the crit knife was reworked to provide only a 30-percent increase in critical hit chance for the duration of the buff. But that’s not exactly how it worked in practice.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">ATTENTION BORDERLANDS GAMERS! <br>The new crit knife sets your crit chance to a target at 30%, it DOES NOT ADD 30% Crit Chance. Meaning if you have above 30% crit chance throwing it will hurt your damage. <br>Chatter mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/Lazy_Data?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Lazy_Data</a> figured this out and I just tested to confirm. <a href="https://t.co/cAnElpK3Gl">pic.twitter.com/cAnElpK3Gl</a></p> <p>— Moxsy (@MoxsyOG) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoxsyOG/status/1981523204800749596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Instead, <em>Borderlands 4</em> players quickly realized that instead of giving them an additional 30 percent crit chance, the Penetrator Augment was setting a flat rate of 30 percent crit chance for all attacks during the five-second timeframe. That meant that if you started with a higher crit chance for whatever reason, using the new crit knife would actually bring it down. This took the Throwing Knife from good but not great to actively bad. So Gearbox pushed out <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">another update</a> to make it work as intended.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">100% CRIT KNIFE IS BACK!</p> <p>Yeah you just throw it 3 times now lmao and get 90%. a 4th to go over or just have any other crit chance. </p> <p>Silly but yeah. lmao. This damn knife dude. <a href="https://t.co/R2d8yI3TZT">pic.twitter.com/R2d8yI3TZT</a></p> <p>— LazyData (@Lazy_Data) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lazy_Data/status/1984024985414070688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Except that the new patch added an entirely new bug. Now, the Penetrator Augment does give players an&nbsp;<em>additional</em> 30 percent crit chance, but even more importantly it actually stacks the crit chance with other uses of the knife. That means you can still get up to a maximum of 90 percent crit chance with it during that five-second window. A multi-week-long nerf dance has effectively concluded with the dreaded crit knife meta back in action and nearly as good as it was at the beginning of October.</p> <p>It seems all but guaranteed at this point that Gearbox will patch this bug out in the days ahead. It remains to be seen, though, whether that arrives via a hotfix sometime this weekend or is held until the next weekly update on November 7. It seems fans of the crit knife are getting one last <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-halloween-event-borderlands-4-sucks-bad-horrors-of-kairos-2000638842">unexpected treat this Halloween</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone is so fixated with player count numbers, and ARC Raiders is the biggest extraction shooter in a long time. Embark Studios’ new title is here, so let’s check out its player count numbers and how it’s performing on Steam Charts.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> brings its own brand of extraction shooter excellence to the genre. Escape From Tarkov’s firm grasp on the concept is being challenged by the hilariously named Escape From Duckov, and now Embark’s ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The latter was extremely popular during its multiple betas, and we’re seeing if this has translated to the full launch.</p>

<p><strong>The first 24 hours of ARC Raiders saw 264,673 players hop in simultaneously, according to Steam, and this figure is expected to grow.</strong></p>



<p>A game’s player count numbers are usually expected to go down over time; it’s a given. With new releases always on the horizon, what once was new eventually fades away. ARC Raiders is likely to retain a lot of players—which Embark is counting on as it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 years of content</a> lined up—but the first-day numbers are always crucial.</p>



<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> reported an all-time peak of 264,673 within 24 hours. This is an exceptional figure, and again, this only accounts for ARC Raiders’ presence on Steam. We still don’t have a program or sophisticated piece of technology capable of accurately recording and reporting PlayStation and Xbox players.</p>



<p>Still, you can logically take the PC data and extrapolate it to get a good idea of how popular ARC Raiders is, and how it’s more than likely doing on other consoles or formats.</p>

<p><strong>ARC Raiders launched on a Wednesday (October 30, to be precise), and a new game’s first weekend is usually the busiest period for a game. ARC Raiders’ peak will likely skyrocket once it hits its first Saturday-Sunday period.</strong></p>



<p>We’ll be keeping an eye on ARC Raiders over the coming weeks and months. However, what we’ve been able to glean is that everyone’s desperate to see what the fuss is all about and how the final product holds up.</p>



<p>With the first 24 hours in the books, ARC Raiders was still comfortably hitting six digits for concurrent players. We’ll keep an eye on the game’s first weekend, as the 264,673 figure could very easily be broken.</p>
