Nintendo isn’t going to reveal its specific Switch 2 production plans until it releases the business plan for its next fiscal year (which begins in April), Furukawa says, but the company wants to gauge demand following the Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">on April 2nd</a>.</p><p>“As with the Nintendo Switch, we believe it will not be easy to rapidly increase production capacity, but based on our past experience, we will make preparations to respond as quickly as possible,” he says.</p><p>The Q&amp;A has a few other interesting tidbits:</p><div><ul><li><span>Furukawa says that “dedicated software” is important with the launch of a console, which could indicate that Nintendo won’t have many new games for both the original Switch and the Switch 2 (though Switch games will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">be backward compatible with the Switch 2</a>).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-superstar-zywoo-says-the-scene-misses-his-rivalry-with-s1mple/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The rivalry between Counter-Strike superstars Mathieu “ZywOo” Erbeau and Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev is an era-defining one. As the game fully embraces a new CS2 era though, along with some new stars, the MVP of the final CS:GO Major says that his rivalry with s1mple is missed.</p>



<p>But not by him.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-zywoo-and-s1mple-dominated-counter-strike-together-for-four-years">ZywOo and s1mple dominated Counter-Strike together for four years</h2>



<p>In an interview with bo3.gg, <a href="https://bo3.gg/news/exclusive-zywoo-about-s1mple-absence-from-the-pro-scene-for-me-though-nothing-has-changed-donk-and-m0nesy-are-now-the-rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZywOo was asked</a> about his own rivalry with s1mple and how it compares with the rivalry between <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new stars Danil “donk” Kryshkovets and Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</a>. ZywOo said that donk and m0NESY reminds him of great sports rivals like LeBron James and Michael Jordan, and Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>



<p>From 2019 to 2022, the rivalry between ZywOo and s1mple was on par with those sports greats. In all four of those years, the two owned the top two spots in HLTV’s Players of the Year list. ZywOo won in 2019 and 2020, and s1mple won in 2021 and 2022. S1mple won his Major first at PGL Stockholm 2021, but he slipped to number 7 in the 2023 players list. That year, ZywOo reclaimed the top spot and won his first Major at BLAST Paris.</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t say I miss it,” ZywOo said when asked about his rivalry with s1mple. “But I think the scene does. He brought so much to the game.”</p>



<p>Since the release of CS2, the player regarded as the GOAT of CS:GO has not managed to find the same level of success. After CS2 came out, he took some extended time off, as he was unhappy with the state of the game. While away from NAVI, the team won the first CS2 Major without him, which he says <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/38871/s1mple-on-return-navi-won-the-major-so-some-plans-have-changed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“changed plans”</a> for his return. He stood in for Team Falcons early in 2024, then re-joined the team on loan from NAVI to close out the 2024, but is now back on NAVI’s reserve roster.</p>



<p>Even if s1mple never returns to the top echelon again, the way ZywOo says his rival pushed him to be better as laid a foundation for new rivalries to blossom. But hopefully, the story of their rivalry doesn’t end here.</p>

          <p>Since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/its-official-take-a-first-look-at-the-switch-2/">our first glimpse of the Switch 2</a> last month, we've been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/all-the-things-nintendo-didnt-tell-us-about-the-switch-2/">left guessing</a> on many crucial hardware details, including the all-important launch price. Now, Nintendo has hinted that the unsteady state of the international money market may play an outsize role in that pricing decision.</p>
<p>Addressing a question about Switch 2 hardware pricing during <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf">an investor Q&amp;A session</a> Wednesday, Nintendo president Shintaro Furukawa said (via machine translation):</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to the current inflation, we are aware that the exchange rate environment has changed significantly since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. We also need to consider the affordable price that customers expect from Nintendo products. When considering the price of a product, we believe that it is necessary to consider these factors from multiple angles.</p>
<p>At this time, we cannot disclose the specific price of the Nintendo Switch 2, but we are considering it while taking various points into consideration. At this time, we do not plan to change the price of the Nintendo Switch hardware.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of that is the usual polite executive-speak shorthand for "we're not ready to answer that yet." But the bit about exchange rates and inflation got us wondering just how vulnerable a Japanese company like Nintendo might be to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/30/why-is-japans-yen-so-weak-against-the-us-dollar">the yen's historic weakness</a>, and what this might mean for the Switch 2.</p>
<h2>More yen for your buck</h2>
<p>When the Switch launched in early 2017, a single dollar could get you about 114 Japanese yen, a rate broadly in line with the norm over the previous two decades. Today, that same dollar can get you over 152 yen, matching rates the world hasn't seen since before 1990.</p>
<p>This means that, at launch, the 29,980 yen asking price for the Switch in Japan was worth about $262, in roughly the same ballpark as the $299 US launch price. Today, Nintendo still asks 29,980 yen for a Japanese Switch and $299 for an American Switch. But that yen-denominated Japanese price is now worth just $196 under today's exchange rates.</p>

<p>This means that, in real terms, customers currently pay a lot less for Nintendo hardware in Japan. Conversely, it also means Nintendo makes a lot more money selling hardware in the US than in Japan.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the Switch 2? Well, let's say Nintendo wanted to launch its new system at about the same price as the original Switch but adjusted for the last eight years of inflation. The $299 US launch price of the Switch in 2017 is worth about $387 in today's dollars, making a $399 Switch 2 price seem entirely reasonable in this scenario.</p>

                <p>Between the giant creatures, multiple on-screen characters, and a large map to explore, there's no question that Capcom's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-and-so-far-it-rules/1100-6526070/" data-ref-id="1100-6526070">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is going to demand a lot of power from PCs. Now, less than a month away from the game's release, Capcom has shared a PC benchmark tool to show players how their computer measures up to the system specs.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/benchmark/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark</a> is on Steam's site, and it requires players to have Steam installed and room to download the benchmark itself. The benchmark can rate the performance of your machine and give it a score up to 20,000. Any computer that hits 10,250 and up on the benchmark will be able to play the game. Everything that comes in underneath may take some changes in order to properly enjoy the experience.</p><p>The game's minimum <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/benchmark/#systemrequirements" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">system requirements</a> have also been released and can be seen below:</p><ul><li><dl><dt>Resolution</dt><dd>1080p（FHD）</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Frame Rate</dt><dd>60fps (with Frame Generation enabled)</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>OS</dt><dd>Windows®10(64-bit Required)/Windows®11(64-bit Required)</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Processor</dt><dd>Intel Core i5-10400<br>Intel Core i3-12100<br>AMD Ryzen 5 3600</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Memory</dt><dd>16GB</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Graphics</dt><dd>GeForce RTX 2060 Super（VRAM 8GB）<br>Radeon RX 6600（VRAM 8GB）</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>VRAM</dt><dd>8GB or more required.</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Storage</dt><dd>75GB　SSD</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Note</dt><dd>SSD required.

Once you see that, you'll understand why this game needs so much processing power.</p><p>Players who want to get an early taste of what's to come can join <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-another-cross-platform-beta-next-month/1100-6528691/" data-ref-id="1100-6528691">the second open beta test for Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which will take place on two consecutive weeks: February 6-9 and February 13-16. Most of the content in the second beta will be identical to the first one that was held last November, as players will be able to get their hands on the character-creation tools as well as a story trial, and a Doshagma hunt. In the second beta, the Doshagma hunt is now the jumping-off point for further adventures that can pit players against the Gypceros and Arkveld. Everyone who plays the second beta will be given a Felyne pendant or Seikret, as well as a bonus item pack that will carry over to the main game upon its release.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds will arrive on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 28. But if players want to get some bonus items ahead of time, all they have to do is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-bonus-monster-hunter-wilds-items-by-playing-monster-hunter-now/1100-6528784/" data-ref-id="1100-6528784">play the mobile game Monster Hunter Now</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/apex-legends-season-24-is-getting-big-and-buff/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Apex Legends Season 24 marks the sixth anniversary of the breakout battle royale hit, taking the genre by storm in early 2019. Six years is a long, long time to keep a game running and to keep a large audience of players engaged, but you know what people love? Buffs. Lots of buffs. That’s what Season 24 is bringing to the table when it launches next week on 11th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apex Legends: Takeover Dev Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRAKqGo_wBE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As the rumblings coming out of EA higher-ups seem to vacillate between Apex Legends needing a full sequel and needing to keep a hold of what it’s got, and the work for Season 24 has certainly looked to refine and hone the game further. There’s no new Legend characters this time around, with Respawn recognising that, when you’ve got more than two dozen characters, it’s difficult to create something that’s tangibly different and exciting. So the team is pushing toward making more systemic changes with quality of life changes and improvements prioritised alongside new content through the year ahead.</p>


<p>So let’s start with those QOL changes. Matchmaking is getting another overhaul to prioritise fairness, now making use of ranked placements to impact unranked play – so less ability to go and smurf some lower players –&nbsp;and will display the skill width to give you an idea of where you stand in relation to the rest of the lobby.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ranked, anti-cheat will be a continuing priority, but Respawn has also come up with an intriguing way to help disincentivise cheaters with a new Road to Ranked system. This system of in-game challenges will replace the simple account level check, making it so you need to prove skill and teamwork to play Ranked, getting new players up to speed, and adding a hurdle that bot accounts cannot bypass simply through time. Existing ranked players will keep access, though.</p>

<p>And then more broadly points of interest will be highlighted when you drop, letting you easily scope out loot tier and zones, you’ll get even more granular detail through the end of match summaries, and weapon mastery trials are removing sillier objectives in favour of consistent performance.</p>

<p>There’s also new Arsenal crates, visible while diving, that guarantee a weapon and a quick upgrade, removing some of the guessing game from the first few seconds of a match and making things more deterministic.</p>
<p>All good changes, but the thing that Respawn really hope will get players hooked again is a general boost to how fast-paced, snappy and rewarding the combat is. Every single weapon has been buffed in one way or another, increasing damage and with changed headshot multipliers. Some weapons are getting a bigger boost than others, but the general goal is to uplift all ships to the same level, instead of neutering an effective and popular build.</p>
<p>At the same time, armour has been simplified, effectively removing helmet armour from the game –&nbsp;a mythic helmet armour upgrade is actually just upgrading the main armour to red tier – and with headshots no longer affected by armour. Sniping is just about to get much, much more effective – the Kraber will be able to one-shot players with anything up to purple armour. The counter to this is that you can carry more syringes, and crawl speed when downed is increased, so you can hopefully get to cover or nearby buddies.</p>

<p>With no new characters, Respawn has looked to rebalance the meta in two ways. Support characters will no longer have the Heal Expert perk, aiming to push them back to actually being a support class, while the Assault characters Ash and Ballistic have been buffed to make them more explosive in combat.</p>
<p>Both have a new Stowed Reload perk that will reload any weapon after 2 seconds –&nbsp;the Gold Mag weapon upgrade is also boosted to this level – their Combat Reserve perk will add two additional slots specifically for grenades, beyond whatever your backpack can hold, and the Battle Surge ability triggers whenever cracking an enemy shield to increase move speed and reloads, as well as highlight that enemy for your team.</p>
<p>More specifically, Ash can snare more effectively, her ultimate will travel further and move faster, and Tether will snare enemies from your location instead of theirs to really hamper their movement. Her data knife is also making way for a new omnidirectional dash for added mobility. Ballistic’s upgrade can now double his Whistler tactical charge, and his Sling can carry Havoc ammo, to boot.</p>

<p>Again, this is all about the meta shift, to try and put Apex Legends in a better, happier place going forward. But what’s the ‘Takeover’ thing about? Well, that’s referring to community curated game and mode modifier, leaning on the game’s most popular streamers and creators to cook up challenges, rewards, modes and events. Each one will run for two weeks, with a community challenge in week 1 determining the reward for the solo challenge in week 2.</p>
<p>And the beloved R-301 is getting even more love with three Mythic variants dropping into Pubs with Rampart-themed supply drops. They’ll have three distinct Hop-Ups –&nbsp;Red for aggression, Yellow for speed, and Green for support – and give you a big boost to any match your playing. This ties in with a Wraith-inspired Mythic R-301 look that can be purchased.</p>

<p>As there’s questions over the future of Apex Legends, Season 24 feels like a slow and steady kind of update. There’s less of the glitz and glamour of a new map or hero, there’s no grand throwback event to call back to the “good old days”. Instead, it actually seems to be doing the one thing that players tend to want the most: buff the heck out of everything. Will that be enough?</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-hands-on-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wwe-2k25-hands-on-preview.1101030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since its successful 2022 reinvention, 2K’s popular WWE  series has continually made a host of iterative improvements in an attempt to not only build upon its winning formula but also justify its annual releases. WWE 2K25 certainly promises a new batch of iterations, including a brand new, online interactive world called The Island, a revamp of its story, general manager and Universe mode,  a new hardcore match type called Bloodline Rules, and several more. However, I can’t say if all these new additions will elevate 2K25 above its predecessor because, unfortunately, I didn’t get to sample any of them at a recent preview event. </p>Instead of sampling this year’s most significant alterations, my time with 2K25 was largely focused on the (mostly) unchanged core gameplay and this year’s adjusted Showcase Mode, which focuses on The Bloodline stable of wrestlers. But while I was locked out of most of this year’s new ideas, I did appreciate some small but significant alterations. They’re enough that I’m confident WWE 2K25 will be another successful evolution of the series and most likely worth any wrestling fan’s time.<output data-cy="article-video"></output><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>WWE 2K25’s Showcase Mode focuses on the history of the Anoa’i family, headlined by its most recent stars Roman Reigns and The Bloodline, but also celebrates previous generations like The Wild Samoans, Yokozuna and, most famously, The Rock. The mode now includes three types of matches: Ones where you <em>recreate</em> history, others where you <em>create</em> history, and most interestingly for me, matches where you <em>alter </em>history. I got to experience all three types in the shape of recreating Nia Jax’s Queen of the Ring victory from 2024, creating a dream Wild Samoans versus The Dudley Boyz match, and altering the history of the iconic Roman Reigns against Seth Rollins bout from the Royal Rumble in 2022. All three offered their own style of fun and unique perspective for any hardcore WWE fan and an improvement on last year’s showcase mode. But that’s not to say there aren’t still some small issues.</p><p>The Showcase Mode in last year’s WWE 2K24, much like the one in WWE 2K23 before it,  was hampered by an over-reliance on switching to real-life footage that ran for multiple minutes – a system developer Visual Concepts dubs “Slingshot”.  As I pointed out in my preview for WWE 2K23,<em> “I found myself wanting to be back in the action and create these moments myself, not just watching clips of footage that are already burned into my brain.” </em>Two years later, I’m happy to confirm that although the issue is not completely solved, progress has been made.</p><p>The cut to real-life footage is now gone, as is the over-reliance on taking you away from the action (at least as far as I experienced in the hands-on session). Key moments are recreated in-engine through animation, providing a less jarring experience and a level of satisfaction from seeing iconic moments realised in the game’s (mostly) gorgeous graphics. These sequences also seem significantly shorter, meaning less time away from controlling the action. </p></div><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">WWE 2K25 Screenshots</h3></div></output><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>That’s not to say that all my prior gripes with staying in control have been addressed, though. During the conclusion of my Nia Jax match, complete control was taken away from me. Rather than stay in the ring, I was forced to embody a bystander during the 1,2,3. Ideally, I’d like more control during these important moments. I want to relive them with my own gameplay decisions, not merely observe as a passive bystander. </p><p>Elsewhere, 2K25 makes minor improvements to other rough edges. Previous showcase modes relied heavily on a checklist system, requiring you to complete often rudimentary manoeuvres to trigger the match’s live-action sequences. A common complaint is that this approach makes a match feel less like dynamic gameplay and more like a to-do list. This system<em> is</em> back, which no doubt will prove contentious once again, but it has been slightly refined for WWE 2K25, with added optional objectives on a timer. You’re rewarded for completing these actions with cosmetics, but most importantly you’re not punished for failing them as you were in previous entries. It’s a vital (baby) step in the right direction.</p><p>The standout addition to Showcase Mode is without a doubt the aforementioned ability to change the conclusion of certain historic matches. Where Roman Reigns once lost by disqualification to Seth Rollins, you can now experience how things could have played out should Roman have altered his temperament in the final moments. It’s a fresh experience for hardcore fans of WWE and I’m very excited to see what happens in the other unannounced change matches.</p></div><output data-cy="article-video"></output><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>While there are notable changes in modes and match types, the core gameplay essence of WWE 2K25 is basically the same as before with some minor tweaks. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. I was already happy with the grappling action in WWE 2K24, so I largely believe it’s a smart decision to stick with the proven, successful formula. There are though a few interesting additions and returns, however.</p><p>WWE 2K25 sees the long-requested revival of chain wrestling, a gameplay sequence that was sacrificed with WWE 2K22’s huge engine revamp. During the opening moments of a bout, instigating a grapple will now force players into a mini-game that allows you to gain the upper hand. After locking up you can choose to drive, wrench, attack and ultimately reposition your opponent into a spot that is advantageous to you. Like the trading blows mechanic introduced last year, chain wrestling adds another staple of WWE action, taking another vital step towards accurately recreating what fans see on TV every week.</p><p>Also making a return is the submission system, a mini-game in which you must either avoid or match your opponent's colour block on a wheel. While it has an overwhelming U.I. presentation,  it quickly becomes second nature, and I’m glad to see it return. If you’re less excited by its reappearance, it can fortunately be disabled in the options. The same goes for chain wrestling and other quick-time event moments – they’re all optional. </p></div><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wrapping a bottle of Logan Paul’s luminous juice around your opponent's head certainly feels like the best use of the egregious electrolytes.</p></div><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Without a doubt, my favourite gameplay feature from WWE 2K24 also makes its triumphant return: weapon throwing. Not only has the roster of weapons been improved, but the backstage brawls have now expanded into new environments that are perfect for weapon tossing. The best location I experienced in the demo was the WWE archives, which not only allows you to toss apples, footballs and megaphones, but also drops you into a WWE fan’s dream environment, littered with history and easter eggs galore. Oh, and you can also fight on top of a giant Wrestlemania sign and everyone’s favourite giant fist from the Smackdown days of yore.</p><p>As to be expected, much like in real life, the ring area is covered in Prime sponsorships. Say what you will about that, but it does allow you to use the Prime Hydration Station’s giant bottle as a weapon. For my money, wrapping a bottle of Logan Paul’s luminous juice around your opponent's head certainly feels like the best use of the egregious electrolytes.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable gameplay alteration this year, though, is the long-overdue intergender gameplay. For the first time in a 2K WWE game, you’re able to pit the men against the woman in a match of your choosing. This, along with the largest roster ever (with 300+ wrestlers to choose from) finally opens the doors to a whole host of matchups that previously weren’t available. </p></div><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Lastly, although the demo build featured a limited amount of new updates to explore, I did get some hands-on time with the brand-new match type called Underground. It’s a rope-less variation of an exhibition match that puts you in a Fight Club-like setting with lumberjacks around the ring. This is something completely brand new for the series and something I can share more about later this month as part of our exclusive IGN First content. Be sure to check IGN later this week to get a look at a full match,  as well as a full, detailed explanation of the new match type from Visual Concepts developer, Derek Donahue.</p><p>WWE 2K25 continues the recent tradition of the series, layering new features on top of existing and robust fundamentals. Nothing right now feels particularly revolutionary as the formula feels largely consistent with last year's offering just with some small-but-smart tweaks. Time will tell if the advertised big sweeping changes and new modes I didn’t get to see will truly make this edition stand out from its peers, but from my brief experience, it’s hard to say this is anything but a very incremental step for an already well-realised series.

                <p>Fans of Wicked certainly felt a stirring when the film finally got to the musical's best-known song, Defying Gravity, but they probably didn't notice the subtle Fortnite sound effect during its final sequence. That's right: Some of the sounds of Elphaba flying in the final sequence are straight from your nephew's favorite battle royale game.</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-cant-believe-this-is-true-but-wickeds-biggest-song-features-a-hidden-fortnite-cameo" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>, you can see this unlikely detail in a video from the Rough Cut that features Wicked editor Myron Kerstein breaking down the complex final scene of the film, which features a wild mix of visual effects along with the music. At around the 7:20 mark in the video, you can see "All Skydiving Fly Sounds (Fortnite) - Sound effects for editing" right in the middle of the editing timeline.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBAv0Ld38Lk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fBAv0Ld38Lk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This is the sound effect that plays when you jump out of the Battle Bus and shoot towards the ground. Fortnite developer Epic Games released the sound as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnGwhm9e6fM">royalty-free library sample</a>, and it seems that Kerstein used it to full effect. The Rough Cut video is quite an interesting watch if you're interested in film production or just curious about the amount of work that goes into even a relatively short scene in a big film like Wicked.</p><p dir="ltr">Artists aren't shy about using samples, whether that's in video games, movies, or even music, and you can find lengthy YouTube videos that investigate the origin of these audio clips. For example, here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGt57ndBrpU">25-minute video</a> exploring the sources for the music of the Spyro series. In other Wicked news, the hit film <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wicked-film-adaptation-gets-lego-sets-new-book-box-sets-and-more-merch/2900-5759/">got a Lego set</a> and other merch that's definitely worth checking out.</p>

            <p>
EA CEO Andrew Wilson had confirmed the publisher would be willing to delay its next Battlefield - currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expected to release before April 2026</a> - if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us".
</p>
<p>
Battlefield's recently announced launch window is, of course, absolutely stuffed with major releases, with the likes of Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, Ghost of Yōtei, and Fable all currently aiming to launch in the same timeframe. And that's without considering the juggernaut release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">officially arriving this "autumn" despite persistent rumours of a potential delay</a> - a release window other publishers appear reluctant to commit to until Rockstar makes its plans known.
</p>
<p>
So there's fierce competition for eyeballs and wallets ahead - something Wilson acknowledged in a response to an investor question regarding the new Battlefield's launch window in its latest financial call. "I do believe that this year might be a nuanced year relative to competition," he admitted. "There may be some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing."

<p>
Wilson also noted EA has "invested more in this Battlefield than any Battlefield before... We're looking for this to be the biggest Battlefield we've ever made." As such, the publisher "[wants] to make sure that we launch that into a window where we can deliver on the fullness of the promise of what Battlefield can be and grow the community to a level that is commensurate with the size of the game that we're making."
</p>
<p>
And while the publisher believes its new Battlefield "will be great and ready" for release in Financial Year 26, Wilson admitted, "If we got close to that timeframe and believed that this wasn't going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player acquisition opportunity for this Battlefield to be all that it needed to be."
</p>
<p>
EA has, of course, been investing heavily in its new Battlefield instalment, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-amassing-largest-battlefield-team-in-franchise-history-to-double-down-on-live-service-multiplayer">huge group of developers</a> spanning four of its teams - DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion - now working on the game. That's as it seeks to "get the community back on [its] side" following the poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> - which quickly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-is-now-one-of-steams-worst-reviewed-games-of-all-time">became one of Steam's worst-reviewed games of all time</a> after its launch in 2021, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">later acknowledged to have flopped</a>.
</p>
<p>
EA has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">promised a return to the modern era for Battlefield's next outing</a>, alongside traditional classes and more focused maps as it attempts to win series fans back. And with so much riding on the new Battlefield if the franchise is going to survive, release timing will be a significant consideration. Even so, EA's hype machine is already gaining momentum ready for the new Battlefield's arrival, with the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">recently unveiling its new Battlefield Labs community testing initiative</a> alongside first footage of the game.
