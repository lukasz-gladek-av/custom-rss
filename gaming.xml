                <p dir="ltr"><em>God of War is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, March 22, 2025. Below, we examine how Kratos' character arc has shifted over time to become a timely reflection on masculinity and change.</em></p><p dir="ltr">As much as people remember the brutality and the grandiosity of God of War, as a singular game and as a series, it's easy to forget that the first God of War in 2005 doesn't actually begin with Kratos fighting a hydra and ripping soldiers apart with his bare hands.</p><p dir="ltr">It begins with a suicide attempt. Starting a new game, the very first thing we hear from Kratos is him gravely intoning that "the gods have abandoned me" before walking straight off a cliff into the Aegean Sea. This is a warlord who accidentally murdered his own wife and child, and is then cursed by an oracle to have his family's ashes permanently grafted to his skin, ensuring there is nowhere in Greece he can go where his crimes are unrecognized. The only help he receives is being conscripted by the gods to murder Ares, who set him up to begin with, which isn't really helpful at all. The reward is the gods' forgiveness, which does nothing to alleviate his consistent nightmares about the deed. When blood doesn't grant him peace, the gods give him power, letting him take Ares' place as the Greek God of War, beginning a reign so destructive that almighty Zeus himself has to intervene to take him down. That's before finding out Zeus himself is Kratos' father, and Kratos having his revenge means laying waste to his entire domain. Which Kratos does.</p><p dir="ltr">For a series that built so much of its early reputation on violent catharsis, it always felt ike Sony having their cake and eating it too that Kratos' quests never really get him any real solutions to his pain. Even when he sacrifices himself for a more noble cause in God of War III, spilling blood doesn't fix problems in this series--though it sure feels great in the moment. It all still leads to the desolation of Kratos' homeland, the complete massacre of its pantheon, and he himself doomed to wander the Earth with nothing but his thoughts. If I had a nickel for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-2-spoilerfree-review/1900-6417483/">every prestige PlayStation franchise that ended up there</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbj5C-Sw2_A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Lbj5C-Sw2_A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">All of this is a product of the time in which Kratos was born, really. Not as a character, but as a game from 2005, and one that felt like a grim-and-gritty nu-metal take on Greek myth--and two years before Zack Snyder would get there on film, to boot. Kratos' angst is the style of the time, a man who has made horrible, cruel, vicious mistakes, and his rage about that becomes everyone's problem. Everything about Kratos' design is of its place and time, and if there is any enduring lesson from that place and time, it's that hatred and violence can be useful and have their place, but they, in and of themselves, are not solutions. There is no happy ending with just nihilism as a driving force. By definition, it ends with nothing. God of War III just shows us the endpoint. Or, at least, what we thought was the end, before 2018, and Kratos' arc became one of the most beautiful things ever committed to pixels.</p><p dir="ltr">What tends to go forgotten after all these years is that the shift for this character didn't begin in 2018. It began in 2010, when we find out exactly why Zeus felt Kratos needed to die, the first acknowledgement that he himself had started a cycle of violence, creating the precise circumstances where his child, Kratos, would do to him what Zeus did to Kronos. But, again, Zeus still dies in God of War III. One of the unkillable plagues of AAA gaming is the inability for its stories to speak a language that isn't a language of blood, and there was no way to reconcile Kratos with the forces that resulted in his existence except by ensuring Zeus could not inflict more pain on others--not that there was anyone left on Olympus when Kratos was done. The cycle could only have a chance to be broken by taking Greece's #1 abuser out of the equation.</p><p dir="ltr">The thing we never see much of--in real life or in video games--is what awaits on the other side. Revenge is easy to obtain, retribution is easy to imagine, but the thing we don't consider enough in our art is what rehabilitation looks like. What does it mean for someone having done the things Kratos has done to continue to exist, if we are to allow him to exist?</p><p dir="ltr">There's no roadmap for processing the things Kratos has done, the only certainty being that he must carry the unrelenting weight of it. And he does carry it. The Kratos of 2018 is, too, a product of his time. He is heavy, taciturn, all too aware of what his power and anger can bring, trapped alive in a tomb of scars and regrets. It's where the manhood he was created to embody leads. But the singular issue with men knowing their acts have consequences, the innate wrongness of it all, is there is so little that tells them where to go next. That's especially true for Kratos since the one woman who could have guided him a little further down a righteous path has passed away when the new games begin.</p><p dir="ltr">The only light that shines out in that darkness is the fact that Kratos has a son. And in his son, even as he lacks the literal and metaphorical vocabulary to do it, he has but one true north, a realignment of priorities for this kind of narrative: "Don't be sorry. Be better."</p><p dir="ltr">How does Kratos atone? Are the centuries Kratos spends in silent exile enough? Is it enough that he once again loses a wife? The hard answer is that there may never be enough. But the asterisk is that it is good and worthwhile to try.</p><p dir="ltr">Thus begins a story unlike any in all of gaming and at bare minimum rare in all of fiction; the slayer of gods, monsters and men putting something back into the world instead of burning it all down, a father seeing his future reflected in the prism of his child's life, while ever pursued by the distorted Norse funhouse mirror of his past. And even though Kratos takes up the blades again, it is endlessly fascinating that Kratos does not regress. There is brutality still, a wellspring to draw upon when faced with a threat. But the timbre of the violence is different. It is violence attempting to operate without malice. And that's a hard tightrope to walk, one that God of War 2018 and Ragnarok don't always traverse without slipping. But the intent is clear, on the part of the developers, and this character, this man. We must try to be better, even when better is inconvenient.</p><p dir="ltr">Kratos watching himself and his son struggle with power and privilege is wonderful on its own, their journey towards empathy and sympathy for each other, for all they have endured is equally so. But the moment that fully raised Kratos into the rarified air of characters in gaming came later, when the Valhalla DLC for God of War Ragnarok dropped, and Kratos faced his true enemy. Himself.</p><p dir="ltr">Kratos faces his younger self, the bastard who slaughtered by the thousands, bathed in blood and fury, the one who would rather have killed himself than confront his grief and crimes, and the one who came to power he did not deserve or understand. That Kratos. It could have been a final boss. Instead, it is a monologue. Kratos has the vocabulary to face himself.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL9c_A9I2VY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qL9c_A9I2VY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">High-profile games don't reckon with the ramifications of their existence much. It's not fun, or entertaining, or empowering in the traditional sense. And a power trip like 2005's God of War is those three things above all else. But no matter what the medium is, there's a crucial honesty in the idea that the stories we tell each other grow with us, that a tale can mean one thing when you're 20, and something else entirely when you're 40. Where God of War differs is in being one of the few video game characters that has legitimately grown and changed in 20 years. Not after a reboot or redesign, but because the character has had experiences that recontextualize everything he's done. And so, Kratos faces himself.</p><p dir="ltr">"What can I say to you? I remember how it felt to take the throne. All that it meant, and all that it did not. A god of war. A god of pain. Of suffering. Of destruction. The Norns said I chase a redemption that I know I can never deserve. What does that make me? God of fools. A god of...hope. ‘When all else is lost.' You lost everything. And everyone. And you became. There is no forgiving you. You chose. I chose! What now? Should I, this same man…should I sit? Take? Proclaim? Lead? Place myself in service? In service. Should I lose everything and everyone? Will there still be enough left inside so that I do not become you? I do not know. But I have hope. You are cruel, and arrogant, and selfish. But you are more than that. You have always been more than what others saw. You are more than that."</p><p dir="ltr">That monologue represents one of the greatest feats of storytelling in this medium, putting itself in direct dialogue with the game that many of us followed into adulthood, with many of them really. It is a thorough understanding of the power of escapism, the appeal of it, but also its limits, its failures, and ultimately, that it is not enough for any soul that wishes to evolve. For men in particular, the ones for whom Kratos represented a place of violent force unquestioned, for those words to come from a better man is miraculous. And it uses one of gaming's most violent monsters to tell it, without redeeming him, simply showing the path forward, the way to wield power and privilege. There is no arc like this in the wider landscape of gaming. And that, more than any blessing from the gods, will make Kratos truly immortal.</p>

<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman’s</strong> wait for Atomfall was broken by grabbing The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, the Smash TV clone Deathrun TV, and the platforming puzzler The Last Shot. That should keep him busy this weekend, until Atomfall arrives next week.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-review-all-zealots<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kill Team</em> 2024 continues with the release of its second expansion set, Blood and Zeal. Following the same format as previous expansions, we're treated to 2 brand new kill teams, both sharing religious zealotry but to very different gods. In this article, we'll take a look at both kill teams and what else Blood and Zeal adds to your games.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a> here.</p>




<h2>All The Fanatics All The Time</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Blood and Zeal, as with previous expansions, adds 2 brand new kill teams and some scenery that builds on that from the Hivestorm box, but rather than new missions, it has the Blood and Zeal mission pack to expand your games. The full box contents are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Blood and Zeal&nbsp;Dossier</li>
	<li>8x Goremongers</li>
	<li>11x Sanctifiers</li>
	<li>Datacards for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Tokens for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Blood and Zeal Mission Pack Card Set</li>
	<li>A large Shrine Statue scenery piece</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-4.jpg?itok=PD0g1vxH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-4.jpg?itok=r57ShW_W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kill Team</em> Blood and Zeal includes a new style of mission pack with the Blood and Zeal card pack.</figcaption></figure><h2>Different Flavours Of Zeal</h2>

<p>Instead of the usual mission pack with linked scenarios,&nbsp;<em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Blood and Zeal adds a mission pack card deck to existing scenarios, putting the Shrine Statue in the centre of the board. The mission pack card deck has cards of 2 different types, and players can choose which deck to draw from. Cards are drawn at the start of each strategy phase, when your opponent scores a VP, or if you interact (praying or defiling) with the Shrine Statue.</p>

<p>Cards can then be played during the turn, with blood cards offering an offensive bonus like the Double Fight/Shoot card, which lets you immediately repeat a fight or shoot acction, and zeal cards offer a defensive bonus, like the Obscured card, which makes an operative targeted by a ranged attack more than 6 inches away obscured, reducing the hits by 1 and protecting them from critical hits.</p>

<p>At the end of the game, both players total up their used blood and zeal cards, and the player with the most of either, scores 1VP. The Blood and Zeal mission pack can put real pressure on during the game, as your opponent gains a card every time you score VP, giving them an edge as you never know what ability they've drawn, along with securing them a possible extra 2VP at the end if you've given them a lot of cards to use. It also draws combat to the Shrine Statue as both players try to control it to stop the other from drawing more cards.</p>

<p>The Sanctifiers are ad-hoc units of zealots of the Imperial Creed, brought together by their faith, they join crusades with other forces of the Imperium or begin their own. The Sanctifiers have the Sermon special rule, that if played as a Strategic Gambit, one of their fighters gains the Orator keyword, which allows nearby units to benefit from the Sermon. Anyone benefiting from the Sermon takes 1 less damage from damage of 3 or more.</p>

<p>Each band is led by a Confessor, who, if is the Orator, can use the Lead the Procession special rule, which gives all nearby friendly units a free charge, fallback, or reposition action if the Confessor takes one of those actions, which can result in a particular devastating charge if you have a load of powerful units bunched up together.</p>

<p>The Confessors are backed up by Perscutors who wield oversized chainweapons, and Conflagrators, who dual-wield hand flamers. They can also deploy Miraculists, who have a single-use but very powerful Holy Light attack and can lay down psychic fire on nearby foes. To back them all up, you can take 2 Missionaries, who carry the heavy weapons like standard flamers, plasma and melta guns, but also have access to the Brazier of Holy Fire, which can be used as a short ranged, or melee weapon, and benefits from the Blaze special rule that sets targets on fire, dealing D3 damage whenever they activate until they put it out.</p>

<p>You can feel the fanatical zeal when using them. They're very close combat orientated, with short ranged weapons and melee armaments all round. They also mostly like to hang around in packs to benefit from the Sermon, except the Missionaries who's thematic 'Spread the word of the God-Emperor' ability gives their weapons severe if they're 6 inches away from other friendly operatives, and the Micaculists, who's Holy Light doesn't care who it burns.</p>

<p>The Goremongers are a different breed of fanatic. Like all followers of the Blood God, Khorne, they want to spill blood in his name. But these mortal followers are a further step into madness, having fought beside or seen the demonic followers of their god, and an obsession born of that experience pushes them further. Their cult starts with replacing their legs with bionic replacements and then installing tanks on their backs that carry a mix of blood and stimms that drive them and their augmetics.</p>

<p>These tanks give the Goremongers access to the Sanguavitae special rule, which lets them deplete their gore tank for special abilities. They have access to healing, increased action points, double fight actions, D3 extra damage on a charge, increased movement, and extra attacks. Tanks can carry a maximum of 2 uses and need to be topped up by taking out enemy fighters. This means that the Goremongers will do well against kill teams with lots of low wound fighters, but not so well against elites or durable fighters, and even worse against elite, durable kill teams like the Plague Marines.</p>

<p>As might be expected from a kill team that refills the blood tanks on their backs with their slain enemies, they like to get in close, which means most operatives are limited to wilding an autopistol (the Inciter wields 2!), but this is just to give you options, if you're shooting you're doing it wrong. The kill team is led by the Blood Herald, who can refill their gore tank for free if it's empty, thanks to their Khorne's Favour ability. They can also ignore the entirety of an attack once per battle.</p>

<p>The rest of the kill team is made up of an expected mix of bloodthirsty, melee-focused fighters. The Bloodtaker can fill their gore tank just by damaging enemies and can also transfer that blood to nearby friendly fighters' gore tanks. The Impaler is armed with a Fleshskewer that can drag enemies and choose not to inflict damage so that you can finish them off in combat, and the Inciter, who wields 2 autopistols, can also use them in close combat to make sure they're still taking the blood tithe.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> Blood and Zeal is another great thematic box for <em>Kill Team</em>. The focus on getting up close and taking names works really well. The Blood and Zeal mission pack adds a new dynamic to the game, and while not balanced enough for competitive play, it gives a great narrative experience. The combination of Blood cards and the Goremongers Sanguavitae abilities can lead to some absolutely insane attacks. The Shrine Statue is an awesome scenery piece, and while it's nice to get functional scenery, having great-looking centerpieces is awesome too.</p>

<p>In a recent seminar at GDC, Cameron Williams, formerly of Rockstar Games, offered a walkthrough of the issues plaguing open-world games. Williams has since relocated, taking his talents to Absurd Ventures, the studio founded by Dan Houser, but he has previously worked on Grand Theft Auto 6 and Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>He stressed that large open worlds with too much content are leading to analysis paralysis and preventing players from wanting to actively explore. The worlds we’re experiencing these days are so expansive and the incentives for travelling vast distances and covering all the bases just aren’t enough anymore. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-impossible-task">‘An Impossible Task’</h2>



<p>In a panel discussion covered by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/players-dont-explore-former-grand-theft-auto-6-and-red-dead-online-designer-lays-out-the-perils-of-open-world-fatigue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> at GDC, Absurd Ventures’ Cameron Williams took a deep dive into one of the most talked-about issues with open-world games. In his words, they’re becoming too big and diverse, presenting players with so many options that they simply cannot choose what to do next.</p>



<p>This is something that the team at Absurd Ventures is actively trying to avoid.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players just don’t explore, right?</p>



<p>Whether they just simply aren’t compelled or your game has a huge time investment and it’s hard for players to pick up and put down, which is an increasing challenge, especially with the sort of evolving ecosystem of free-to-play and live service games that are kind of eating everyone’s time and attention.</p>



<p>They’re wondering, ‘Okay, how far away is the next thing? I really gotta run all the way across the map? And what’s my gain?</p>



<p>We want to avoid creating a possibility space so large that <strong>players simply just don’t know what to choose</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s something I covered in my recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">review of Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, which is a great game but suffers from the open-world fatigue that Williams is referring to. The objectives are far too spaced apart and the world is enormous, which makes it a chore to navigate, leaving players to rely on fast-travel mechanics far too often.</p>



<p>These games can be hellish for what Williams dubbed ‘beeliners’ – players who want to go from A to B with as little interference as possible. They’re the gamers who don’t have time to waste on side content and tertiary missions and want to explore a story and hang up their hat.</p>



<p>Do you think open-world games are becoming far too bloated for the average gamer to enjoy? Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

<p>Battlefield leaks are still flowing thick and fast from the latest round of testing sessions, and in the freshest drops, an all-new map has been revealed. It’s called Battery, and per the reports, it’s a dense urban map themed on Gibraltar, which was a location given away in early concept art for the game.</p>



<p>A series of gameplay clips from Battery have leaked on Reddit. They showcase the new map and some Conquest action – check out the links below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-new-norm">The New Norm</h2>



<p>Many have theorised that Electronic Arts <em><span>all</span>ows </em>these leaks to flow from the Battlefield Labs tests, as it’s effectively free publicity. The consensus so far has been that the next Battlefield game looks <strong>good</strong>, even at this alpha stage. It looks like a throwback to the peaks of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4</a>, which is great news for those more veteran of the series.</p>



<p>In the latest Battlefield leaks, we’re given a look at Battery, a packed urban map with tight streets and tall buildings. It’s the kind of map that fosters intense destruction, close-quarters combat, and kill boxes for vehicles, but it looks great at first blush.</p>



<p>The best look at Battery comes courtesy of user TooFlu2, who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jguiic/gameplay_from_the_new_battlefield_labs_map_and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">uploaded a two-minute clip</a> to the Battlefield subreddit.</p>



<p>In another post, user eggdrums115 uploaded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jgofni/first_overview_of_new_map_battery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a picture of Battery’s tac-map</a>, which shows you just how tight-knit the environment will be.</p>



<p>The more talked-about features pop up again in this gameplay snippet, such as players having the ability to pull downed teammates out of the line of fire. It’s also a showcase for the convention military mechanics that are set to feature in the next Battlefield game – gone are the futuristic gadgets, robot dogs, and wingsuits.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the next Battlefield game? Have the leaks filled you with hope that it will finally deliver when it’s ultimately released? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> OG mode is taking another step toward the present very soon--<strong>Season 3 starts on March 25</strong>, taking us back to the season that kicked off way back in February of 2018. While Fortnite OG has waned in popularity a bit recently, one of the big reasons for that is that Fortnite changed very little during those original two seasons, so this nostalgic mode didn't get to do much differently either. Season 3, however, is where things began ramping up. The game's overall storyline made its very first appearance when a large meteor appeared over the island midway through the season.</p><p dir="ltr">With just days remaining before the next round of Fortnite's throwback party begins, let's take a look at everything we know about Fortnite OG Season 3.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_teaser">Fortnite OG Season 3 teaser</h2><p>Epic has dropped a single teaser for OG Season 3, which shows an astronaut helmet with the Fortnite island visible in the reflection--along with the meteor above it. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHdzbgTMbcX/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The TikTok and Instagram versions of the teaser</a> are the most illuminating versions, as they reveal that the astronaut is wearing a studded leather jacket. There aren't any skins that wore anything like that from Season 3, battle pass or otherwise, but our Metallica-themed remix of Rust from Chapter 5 Season 3 did. Regardless, I doubt that thing is spaceworthy, but Fortnite isn't concerned with such things.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Pass_Season_3">Fortnite OG Pass Season 3</h2><p>The first two OG passes have included three new skins that are remixes of existing skins that first appeared during the original seasons. Each pass had two remixes of old pass skins and one remix of a shop skin, though it should be noted that they had to do it that way for those seasons because they didn't have many skins--the Season 1 shop only had two, and the Season 2 battle pass only had three knights and Sparkle Specialist.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463354" data-ratio="0.55826771653543" data-width="1270" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463354"></a><figcaption>The original Season 3 pass, pictured here, will heavily inspire the OG Pass.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Season 3 battle pass, by contrast, had six skins--Rust Lord, Elite Agent, The Reaper (Fortnite-brand John Wick), and three astronauts. They could make three distinct skins from that group, but on the shop side of things, Season 3 did introduce Raven--and Epic loves doing new versions of Raven almost as much as it likes doing new versions of Midas.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_map">Fortnite OG Season 3 map</h2><p dir="ltr">Not much changed between Season 2 and 3, as you can see--the Season 3 map is almost identical to the Season 2 island that's on the way out. But that teaser including the meteor could be hinting that we'll start in the middle. As the end of the season approached, and the meteor came along with it, small pieces of the meteor kept falling off and damaging the island every match, and that's exactly the sort of shakeup feature that the OG mode could use. Since Epic has typically not done many in-season map changes in the OG mode, would anybody be upset if they jumped straight to that part?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463352" data-ratio="1" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463352"></a><figcaption>Fortnite OG's presumed Season 3 map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_loot_pool">Fortnite OG Season 3 loot pool</h2><p dir="ltr">Most of the current OG loot pool will stick around for Season 3, but this season introduced a variety of interesting new weapons and gadgets that you will very likely see in the new OG season.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hand cannon</li><li dir="ltr">Crossbow</li><li dir="ltr">Guided missile</li><li dir="ltr">Egg launcher</li><li dir="ltr">Port-a-fort</li><li dir="ltr">Remote explosives</li><li dir="ltr">Clingers</li></ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a>, the first real attempt ever to compete with The Sims in the life sim space, is here, releasing via Steam Early Access, and it's only natural that players will spend their first several hours in the game creating their characters and messing around in build mode to see what kinds of dollhouses they can assemble. There's no point in jumping into the simulation until you've got everything else in order.</p><p>For those Sims players who are eager to see what InZoi's got that The Sims doesn't, be warned that InZoi's build mode has a few big quirks that you'll need to learn about before you get started, or else you might accidentally rip the walls out of your house while you're trying to make it bigger. Fortunately, we've got you covered with our InZoi build mode guide.</p><h2>How InZoi's home-building gameplay differs from the Sims</h2><p>If you're coming to InZoi from The Sims 4, you'll probably be used to a build mode in which everything is one context-sensitive click away. Clicking on an object picks it up; clicking on a wall lets you move it to expand or contract the room it's containing. You just click on what you want to manipulate, and then you manipulate it. InZoi's build mode is slightly more complicated than that, thanks largely to the fact that it has more customization options--but there are some fundamental differences from The Sims that will probably trip you up at first.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463269" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463269"></a><figcaption>InZoi's build mode will be familiar to Sims fans, but it has several unique aspects to it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr"><span>The first of these big differences is that you need to choose the right selection mode. By default, your cursor is using the standard "</span><strong>Selection Tool</strong><span>," which lets you click on and manipulate individual objects, like your couch. When you're in the mode, moving a wall will move </span><em>only</em><span> the wall--the room the wall belonged to won't change aside from no longer having a wall. If you want to change the size of a room, or make your house bigger, you'll instead need to choose the </span><strong>Room Selection Tool</strong><span>, which you can find on the build mode options bar near the top of the UI, immediately to the right of the standard Selection Tool.</span></h3><p dir="ltr">It's in that part of Build Mode--the part where you're dealing with furniture, appliances, and anything else you might put in your house--where you'll find another quirk you'll need to remember. In InZoi, you can customize your furniture just as deeply as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-custom-clothes-and-furniture-in-inzoi/1100-6530233/" data-ref-id="1100-6530233">you can customize your clothing</a>, but you can only do so <em>after</em> you have placed the item in question. So you would, say, pick a couch you like from the build menu, place it in your home, and click on it to bring up the option to customize it--then you'll be presented with a pile of options for texture and color, and you can upload your own texture images yourself if you want, or use InZoi's built-in AI image generator to make one. If you want all your furniture to be covered in pictures of your dog, you can do that.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463268" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463268"></a><figcaption>You'd better get used to swapping between the Selection Tool and the Room Selection Tool, because you're going to do it a lot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This after-the-fact customization causes no issues for things like your refrigerator, but since everything you can place in build mode works the same way, there are certain things where this becomes a problem. For example, if you want to add a staircase that turns 180 degrees halfway up, you'll have to place a full straight flight of stairs first and then bend it afterward. Since the purpose of such a staircase is to save on the horizontal space that the staircase takes up, having it work this way defeats that purpose because you have to make room for the full normal staircase anyway. You'll have to exercise a bit of cleverness to deal with this issue when it arises.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you understand these two basic aspects, most builders will be ready to go in InZoi; build mode is otherwise largely similar to that of The Sims but with a redesigned UI. But we'd be remiss if we forgot to point out one other strange thing about InZoi's build mode that has no equivalent in The Sims.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463270" data-ratio="0.56288478452067" data-width="2274" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463270"></a><figcaption>The ersatz apartment building where my Zois live</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I set up my first Zoi family, I put them in what looks like the first floor of a small apartment building in Dowon, which you can see above--it has a communal space with a gym on the ground floor, with three floors of living space above it. My family lived on the first of those floors, but I soon realized that I had no neighbors, and there was no access point for the upper two floors.</p><p dir="ltr">The whole building belonged to my family, and I just had to build new staircases to get up there--I had three times more space to work with than I'd thought, and my small apartment turned into a large house in minutes. It was a pretty surprising development since this is not how a building like this works in real life, and the game had made no attempt to tell me that I could do that. This is something to keep in mind when you start feeling like your family needs more space--you might already have it.</p><p dir="ltr">InZoi launches in Early Access on Steam on March 27 for $40. Until the game officially launches, players can download the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-an-inzoi-creative-studio-key-for-the-demo/1100-6530268/" data-ref-id="1100-6530268">InZoi Creative Studio</a> for free. Through the 22nd, you'll unlock access by watching InZoi streams on Twitch or the game's Steam store page. Starting on the 23rd, the Creative Studio will be available to download on Steam without requiring any tasks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So far it feels like this anime arena fighter's combat and story mode were made in different rooms.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Editor's Note: This initial review in progress is based only on the PlayStation 5 version so far, with the PC version </em><a href="https://x.com/BLEACH_game_en/status/1903117822466855006" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>experiencing launch issues</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Bleach is the flashiest member of the shonen anime “big three,” standing shoulder to shoulder with mega popular series like One Piece and Naruto, it has long suffered from middle child syndrome when it comes to arena fighter adaptations. Bleach Rebirth of Souls aims to break the cycle of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-deserves-more-than-run-of-the-mill-arena-fighters"><u>run-of-the-mill anime fighters</u></a> this series has previously been part of, delivering a unique action game that attempts to raise the genre to greater heights. Even though I still have a lot left to play before my final review, having only spent 10 hours with it since I received review code just before the Ultimate Edition went live yesterday, it's evident that developer Tamsoft has a deep respect for the anime. Every detail of its crisp character models is meticulously crafted, and the combat feels like it's been lifted straight out of the show, with a depth that begs to be explored. However, the story mode, where I’ve spent most of my time so far, plays like a laughable attempt at a visual novel that was hobbled together as a last-second afterthought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bleach Rebirth of Souls opens with a tutorial that puts its best foot forward – its combat. It’s easy to get overloaded with a bunch of confusing anime jargon as it explains how its health bar, counters, and super moves work, but here’s the quick way to understand things: This is a 3D arena fighter with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/06/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review">Super Smash Bros.</a>’s life stock system, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review">Sekiro</a>’s stance-breaking swordplay, and Bleach’s unique visual flair. Unlike other arena fighters, which often have combat so shallow you only need to find a single combo or spam super moves to win matches, Bleach's combat feels like a challenging game of tug-of-war – one where victories are clinched rather than mindlessly stomped out of opponents.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Bleach Rebirth of Souls Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each sword swing feels snappy and weighty as you teleport around the screen, ambushing your enemies from behind and breaking their guard. It never gets old to see large blocks of text wrap around freeze-framed characters with every successfully landed counter and super move. Even when you play Rebirth of Souls on its Standard Mode button layout, which streamlines things by letting you dish out flashy auto combos, it still harbors complex and unique mechanics specific to each character that warrant further exploration. That could be Uryu's long-ranged bow attacks  or Yoruichi's in-your-face brawler style. Variety like that is important as I both decide on a main and try to understand how to defeat different characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a massive fan of the anime and manga's stunning artistry, stirring character development, and shocking plot twists, I had high hopes that Rebirth of Souls could deliver a worthwhile story mode. Sadly, I’ve been disappointed big time. By and large, cutscenes in an anime fighter should act as a sparkly reward at the end of battle, meant to bring the momentum of a fight to a thrilling climax. Cutscenes in the story modes of Naruto and Dragon Ball Z’s games are sometimes so well animated that they could serve as a substitute for watching the actual shows. That is not the case with Bleach. If anything, they nearly bring things to a screeching and embarrassing halt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The look of its combat may have a lot of tender love and care put into it, but the story moments between that action instead play out like a cheap visual novel. Outside of a few pre-rendered cutscenes, the SparkNotes version of the anime this story mode attempts to tell is a rushed, hobbled mess. Instead of being greeted by bombastic scenes where my favorite characters clash, I was met with Machinima-looking animations where in-game models would fart out energy waves at each other and stiffly fall to the ground. Even the emotionally heady scenes lose all sense of tension as its characters move around like clumsy action figures with limited points of articulation in bright, low-poly arenas. What's more, exciting moments like sword clashes and beam struggles lose all of their gravitas as these scenes incessantly cut to black with bright slashes on the screen that look less like a creative choice for dramatic effect and more like a placeholder for an animation that wasn’t added in time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat's vibrant sword slashes feel at odds with the unevenly crafted cutscenes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If this was a genuine attempt to resemble a visual novel, it definitely missed the mark, as it feels more like an unfinished first draft – and with review codes arriving so close to launch, it’s hard not to see this as an intentional hope that fans will buy-in based solely on the goodwill of the franchise. Which is a shame, because both its English and Japanese voice cast are putting in work with their vocal performances and the character models are faithful recreations that do look great in action. As if Bandai Namco took pointers from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhndpv7sEqE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invincible season 2’s joke</u></a> about how animators cut corners to make more scenes, Rebirth of Souls put all of its focus on the fights, and every moment outside of them looks like a fan-made animators first crack at recreating the anime as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But although the story mode has yet to wow me in the 10 hours I’ve spent with it so far, there’s still more to play with — namely, the online and offline versus mode — before I can settle on a final verdict. As it stands right now, Bleach Rebirth of Souls’ combat goes above and beyond a run-of-the-mill anime arena fighter, with a dense battle system and tons of love put into making each of its characters feel unique. That makes it all the more disappointing that its crisp character models, vibrant sword slashes, and stylish typography accompanying each super move feel wholly at odds with the animation in its unevenly crafted cutscenes. Instead of making me want to play through the anime’s sprawling story myself, it's only encouraged me to revisit the source material so that the emotional climaxes actually land. But despite not delivering on that lofty promise, I’m keen to see if the versus modes will pick up the slack as I work toward my final review.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Verdansk returns to Call of Duty Warzone on April 3, more than three years after it disappeared from the iconic battle royale title. It’s penned as being a last-ditch effort for Activision to retain players, and it’s arguably the biggest thing to happen to the game since it was <strong>removed </strong>in December 2021.</p>



<p>Today, the Verdansk Tac Map was revealed on social media, uncovering the full suite of POIs and some tidbits of information about the ‘new old’ map – including <strong>water on land</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-same-but-different">Same But Different</h2>



<p>Verdansk is almost entirely unchanged in the new graphic published <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1903129487123849371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Call of Duty</a> on social media. The POIs are the same as they were five years ago when the game was first released:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dam</li>



<li>Military Base</li>



<li>Quarry</li>



<li>Airport</li>



<li>TV Station</li>



<li>Storage Town</li>



<li>Superstore</li>



<li>Stadium</li>



<li>Lumber</li>



<li>Boneyard</li>



<li>Train Station</li>



<li>Hospital</li>



<li>Downtown</li>



<li>Farmland</li>



<li>Port</li>



<li>Prison</li>



<li>Park</li>



<li>Promenade</li>



<li>Hills</li>
</ul>



<p>Where you land first is entirely up to you, but those hot spots likely haven’t changed over the last half-decade.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted a couple of telling sights on the new Verdansk Tac Map, though. It looks as though we’ll have water extending throughout the map in the form of rivers, which wasn’t a thing when the map was first released in March 2020. It seems like the updated railway line is also present, which means the train could be coming back.</p>



<p>It has also been noted that classic weapons could be making a comeback for the return of Verdansk. As players, we passed through so many metas back then that there’s a wealth of weaponry for Activision’s teams to choose from.</p>



<p>Aside from that, Verdansk looks as good as it ever did. Could this be a Fortnite OG kind of resurgence that brings millions of players back to Warzone overnight? Perhaps. We’ll know for sure on April 3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/european-commission-targets-exploitive-virtual-in-game-currency-practices/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The European Commission and the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network have published a new set of guidelines covering the purchasing of in-game virtual currency today. These new principles were applied after the CPC Network found a game developer to be engaged in a number of practice deemed “harmful to children.”</p>



<h2 id="h-the-european-commission-has-launched-a-probe-into-star-stable-online">The European Commission Has Launched a Probe into Star Stable Online</h2>



<p>On March 20th, The CPC Network <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that that a number of commercial practices from Star Stable Entertainment AB were deemed “particularly harmful to children” in their game, Star Stable Online. These practices allegedly include “direct appeals to children in the advertisements,” the use of pressuring techniques, a lack of clear and transparent information, and failing to ensure that influencers promoting the product were disclosing commercial content.</p>



<p>The developers of the children’s game where you collect, accessorize, and race horses now have a month to address the issues highlighted by the CPC Network. However, these issues have made the CPC Network see “the need for European consumers to be better protected.” Thus, they have <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/8af13e88-6540-436c-b137-9853e7fe866a_en?filename=Key%20principles%20on%20in-game%20virtual%20currencies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> seven “key principles” on in-game virtual currencies:</p>



<ol>
<li>“Price indication must be clear and transparent.” This effectively requires games to list the real-world money equivalent on any in-game virtual currency or in-game digital content.</li>



<li>“Practices obscuring the cost of in-game digital content and services should be avoided.”</li>



<li>“Practices that force consumers to purchase unwanted in-game virtual currency should be avoided.”</li>



<li>“Consumers should be provided with clear and comprehensive pre-contractual information.”</li>



<li>“Consumers’ right of withdrawal should be respected.” </li>



<li>“Contractual terms should be fair and written in plain and clear language.”</li>



<li>“Game design and gameplay should be respectful of different consumer vulnerabilities.”</li>
</ol>



<p>The CPC Network hopes these principles will “will help create a safer, more transparent experience for players,” but will also continue to monitor EU gaming companies and “may take further actions if harmful practices continue.” All the newly established principles are based on pre-existing EU consumer laws.</p>



<p>Are virtual currency practices too exploitive of children? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

But is the game any good? <a href="http://://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-seasons-change-nature-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s gorgeous</a>, but does it succeed in the narrative it’s trying to tell? And how does it balance historical accuracy with having a good time? On the latest episode of Aftermath Hours, we talk about it.</p><p>I have been pretty high on what I’ve played on <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, as has Luke. But being only a measly 28 or so hours into the game and only just having gotten Yasuke as a playable character, we decided to bring a ringer on to the pod who has, you know, actually finished the game. To that end we invited my old friend and games writer Yussef Cole to give some perspective after submitting a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/arts/assassins-creed-shadows-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fairly critical review</a> of the game for The New York Times. We talk about what the game does right and wrong, its place in the series generally, and how that fits into the context of Japan, Yasuke’s context in Japanese history, and the perennial problem of accuracy versus “having fun” that plagues all of these games.&nbsp;</p><p>You can follow Yussef on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/youmeyou.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>. Yussef also co-edits <a href="https://bulletpointsmonthly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bulletpoints Monthly</a>, a website dedicated to longform games criticism.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/apple-arcade-is-reportedly-unprofitable-without-apple-one-bundle/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Apple Arcade, the mobile gaming subscription service, is reportedly one of several Apple services suffering from low usage and profits. It’s been reported in the past that payouts to developers have been declining for years, and if it weren’t included in the Apple One bundle, it would be considered unprofitable.</p>



<h2 id="h-25-of-apple-arcade-users-during-it-first-years-were-on-free-trials">25% of Apple Arcade Users During it First Years Were on Free Trials</h2>



<p>The information comes, ironically, from tech and business news outlet The Information, who <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-streaming-losses-top-1-billion-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Apple is losing over $1 billion a year on its streaming service, Apple TV+. The report also mentions other Apple services that are supposedly not performing well, including Apple Arcade.</p>



<p>“Apple Arcade, for example, had only 2 million users in its first year after it launched in 2019, with roughly 25% of them on free trials, according to one person with direct knowledge of the figures,” reads The Information’s report. “Without Apple One, some services, such as Apple Arcade and Fitness+, likely wouldn’t be profitable.” Apple One is a subscription bundle introduced in 2020 that offers access to Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and iCloud storage, with a Premier plan option that includes Apple News+ and Apple Fitness+ as well.</p>



<p>Apple Arcade was launched only a year prior in 2019, offering direct access to paid games without advertisements or in-app purchases. 71 games were included at launch, and developers like Capcom, Sega, Bandai Namco, and Devolver Digital partnered with Apple to create games for the service. But <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-axed-games-declining-payouts-disillusioned-studios-and-an-uncertain-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> from Neil Long at Mobilegamer.biz from last year claimed that payouts to developers had been declining for year, and that a “shitload” of projects had been canceled. One developer reportedly told Long that the Apple Arcade service had “the smell of death” around it. Still, Apple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-trials-of-mana-and-more-coming-to-apple-arcade-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added 10 new games to the service just this past January</a>.</p>

The lengthy Secret Lair Our Boss Is On Vacation superdrop will contain nine special drops for fans of the game to pick up, with a special promo card for those that go all in.</p>

<h2>The Secret Lair Our Boss Is On Vacation Superdrop Announcement</h2>

<p>In the official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-superdrop" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, Wizards of the Coast outlines the cards in the Secret Lair Our Boss Is On Vacation superdrop. As the name implies, the cards in this superdrop are chaotic and sporadic. As if the person in charge wasn't around to approve them.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-spongebob-meme-cards.jpg?itok=AwPuvRi2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-spongebob-meme-cards.jpg?itok=0buJQmb4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first three drops in the superdrop are the previously announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spongebob-secret-lair-brings-iconic-cartoon-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spongebob Squarepants Secret Lairs</a>. Want to wield Mr. Krabs or Sandy Cheeks as Legendary Creatures or just cast meme-art versions of Counterspell and Force of Despair? These are the cards to pick up.</p>

The <em>They Grow Up So Fast</em> drop showcases five different dragonlord cards. Each card is reversible. One side shows the dragon as a recently hatched wyrmling. the other shows them fully matured. This drop contains the following cards:</p>

<ul><li><em>Dragonlord Atarka</em></li>
	<li><em>Dragonlord Dromoka</em></li>
	<li><em>Dragonlord Kologhan</em></li>
	<li><em>Dragonlord Ojutai</em></li>
	<li><em>Dragonlord Silumgar</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-garden-buds-card-artwork.jpg?itok=olZliX4E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-garden-buds-card-artwork.jpg?itok=E8KJPcgo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those with an eye for nature, the fifth drop is for you. The <em>Garden Buds</em> drop showcases nature or forest-dwelling cards in a trippy artstyle courtesy of Jordan Crane. The cards featured in this drop are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Ashaya, Soul of the Wind</em></li>
	<li><em>Elvish Reclaimer</em></li>
	<li><em>Harrow</em></li>
	<li><em>World Shaper</em></li>
	<li><em>Horn of Greed</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-tragic-romance-artwork.jpg?itok=Oh6dpFgv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-tragic-romance-artwork.jpg?itok=-yv75yRj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Drop six is for those that have indulged in a bit of fantasy romance. Aptly named <em>Tragic Romance</em>, this drop contains four cards with artwork straight out of a harlequin romance novel showcasing art by Abigail Larson. Those four cards are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon</em></li>
	<li><em>Kaalia of the Vast</em></li>
	<li><em>Angel of Despair</em></li>
	<li><em>Master of Cruelties</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-twisted-toons-cards.jpg?itok=KxfwWXC4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-twisted-toons-cards.jpg?itok=MbsPPp4y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In a complete pivot in tone is the seventh drop. The <em>Twisted Toons</em> drop sports an early 20th century cartoon look straight out of Fleisher Studios. If you like old-school Disney, or played a lot of Cuphead, these cards may catch your eye. Those cards are.</p>

<ul><li><em>Silence</em></li>
	<li><em>Winds of Abandon</em></li>
	<li><em>Culling of the Weak</em></li>
	<li><em>Fatal Push</em></li>
	<li><em>Young Wolf</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-pick-em-and-stick-em-artwork.jpg?itok=FYlJGkfx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-pick-em-and-stick-em-artwork.jpg?itok=nRujkfKD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The eighth drop in the Secret Lair Our Boss Is On Vacation superdrop is yet another switch in tone. The <em>Pick 'Em and Stick 'Em</em> drop is a candy coated dose of bright, colorful fluff. It even has sheets of stickers to customize those cards further. The drop contains the following:</p>

<ul><li><em>Thalia, Heretic Cathar</em></li>
	<li><em>Clever Impersonator</em></li>
	<li><em>Hedron Crab</em></li>
	<li><em>Pitiless Plunderer</em></li>
	<li>Treasure Token</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-class-of-87-artwork.jpg?itok=yjCvLUQE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-our-boss-is-on-vacation-class-of-87-artwork.jpg?itok=-edc-THw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Last but not least is the S<em>ecret Lair: Class of '87</em> drop. As the name implies, this drop reimagines several cards as high school yearbook photos. The artwork by Stephen Andrade and Scott Okumura even goes that extra mile with era-specific stylized text. The cards in this drop are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Aesi, Tyrant of Gyre Strait</em></li>
	<li><em>Anje Falkenrath</em></li>
	<li><em>Chulane, Teller of Tales</em></li>
	<li><em>Radha, Heart of Keld</em></li>
</ul><p>All nine drops in the Secret Lair Our Boss Is On Vacation superdrop is available in both non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $39.99). In addition, if you spend more than $150 on a single order, you will receive a rainbow foil Deadeye Navigator promo card at no additional charge. The superdrop will be available March 24.</p>

At the time I blamed it on technical limitations and a focus on zombie-filled wastelands, and the lack of good dinosaur games made me really sad. So I’m happy to report that in 2025 we have a bunch of new dinosaur games to get excited about, and not all of them are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-trailer-every-dinosaur-mutant-1851755947&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-trailer-every-dinosaur-mutant-1851755947"><em>Jurassic Park</em>-related</a></span>. </p><p>Just yesterday,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/future-games-showcase-2025-trailers-painkiller-1851771551&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/future-games-showcase-2025-trailers-painkiller-1851771551"> during the Spring Future Games Show</a></span>, another new dinosaur game was announced: <em>Deathground</em>, a co-op survival horror game featuring dangerous dinos. And it’s just one of many upcoming games that look to be trying to fill the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768?_gl=1*1rb6268*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjU4NjY3MS4yMi4xLjE3NDI1ODc0MzMuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768?_gl=1*1rb6268*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjU4NjY3MS4yMi4xLjE3NDI1ODc0MzMuNTguMC4w">creepy, <em>Dino Crisis</em>-shaped void</a></span> that currently exists because Capcom won’t remake or develop a new entry in the franchise. </p><p>So let’s take a look at some of the potentially awesome dinosaur games coming to a video game console or PC near you. (Oh and spoilers, but none of the games listed in here have release dates, so who knows how long we’ll have to wait to play them.)</p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-survival-fps-action-trailer-game-awards-1851083053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-survival-fps-action-trailer-game-awards-1851083053">Announced back in 2023</a></span>, <em>Jurassic Park: Survival</em> is an upcoming first-person survival horror game being developed by Saber Interactive. Since its announcement we’ve not heard or seen much else about the project, but we know it’s still in the works. Let’s hope this game is better than <em>Trespasser</em>.</p></div><div><p>Set to be published by Annapurna Interactive, <em>The Lost Wild</em> is also a first-person survival horror game set on a jungle-covered island filled with hungry dinosaurs and abandoned science facilities. The trailers we’ve seen for this upcoming dino game look amazing, and if it plays as well as it looks we might be in for a terrifying treat.</p></div><div><p>Stop me if you’ve heard this before. <em> Compound Fracture</em> is a spooky first-person game featuring dinosaurs and dilapidated facilities where questionable science took place. However, unlike the other games on this list, <em>Compound Fracture</em> is designed to look and play more like a 1990s game, complete with some lovely looking low res textures. I’m very excited to see more of this indie game in the future.</p></div><div><p>This is the most recently announced game on our list and while it has some similarities to  the other dinosaur games we’ve looked at, including its FPS perspective and focus on horror, <em>Deathground </em>will support online co-op. Also, the dinosaurs in this upcoming survival horror multiplayer game have feathers. I’ll let you decide how you feel about that.</p></div><div><p>While many of the games on this list are directly inspired by <em>Jurassic Park </em>and its lush tropical jungles, <em>Paleophage </em>is clearly riffing on recent <em>Resident Evil</em> remakes with its more urban setting and third-person camera. That sounds great to me! If this game is half as good as the recent <em>RE4 </em>remake and also has dinosaurs in it, I’ll be perfectly satisfied.</p></div><div><p>Not every upcoming dinosaur game is a survival horror adventure. Take <em>Turok Origins</em>, which was announced in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/turok-origins-new-game-saber-space-marine-third-person-1851720969&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/turok-origins-new-game-saber-space-marine-third-person-1851720969">December 2024</a></span> and looks to be a co-op third-person shooter set in the strange prehistoric alien universe of <em>Turok</em>. It’s being developed by the company behind S<em>pace Marine 2.</em></p></div><div><p>Published by TinyBuild, <em>Ferocious </em>is described by its devs as an old-school, action-packed FPS set on a tropical island inhabited by dangerous mercs and even more dangerous dinos. Simple premise, but the game basically looks like <em>Far Cry </em>+ dinosaurs and that’s a formula that has me excited to play. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
