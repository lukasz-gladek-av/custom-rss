However, due to industry-standard revenue splits, aggressive recoup models, and passive investors, the devs see income months later and are a sadly small slice of the pie, often that is enough to shut down a promising studio. We want to provide a sustainable model that helps the local industry grow and thrive and allows developers to keep their gold in their pockets after launch.”</p><p>Goldpact Goblins president Iain Garner added, “What we’ve learned is that the heart of almost every successful game is a thriving community and our unique strategies are designed to help studios build, understand, and support communities that survive and thrive long after the Goblins have left the building.”</p><p>Since forming on January 1, Goldpact Goblins has established partnerships with the following games and studios:</p><ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3193310/Deadly_Rehearsal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Deadly Rehearsal</em></a> (Kaigan Games)</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2621930/Grim_Trials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Grim Trials</em></a> (Glory Jam)</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3040930/Just_A_Shadow_Game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Just A Shadow Game</em></a> (IndieLab)</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2445690/Lost_Castle_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Lost Castle 2</em></a> (Hunter Studio)</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3154150/SpookABoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Spook-A-Boo</em></a> (Wala Interactive)</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3070070/TCG_Card_Shop_Simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>TCG Card Shop Simulator</em></a> (OPNeon Games)</li></ul><p>While Goldpact Goblins’ capacity for full service projects is already filled, it remains available for short-term consultancy, and will be able to offer full support for new developer projects after July 2026.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-servers-downtime-february-5/</link>
            <guid>1426201</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite players around the world have been locked out of the game on February 5 as Epic Games deploys the latest update to the title, with players impatiently waiting for the Fortnite servers to be back up.</p>



<p>After a huge South Park collab in January, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth is entering a new month with a fresh drop of content, keeping the game alive until the next major seasonal change early in March.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Fortnite downtime and everything coming in the February 5 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New content. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite Servers are down for several hours for the update on February 5, and there is no confirmed time of their return. However, previous updates indicate how long players need to wait.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, which means that the Fortnite servers should be back up after the v39.40 update somewhere between 2 AM PT and 2 AM ET.</p>



<p>However, downtime can be longer if issues are discovered or if there is a larger patch to deploy, and social media is the best place to keep track of the server status.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-february-5-update">What’s In The Fortnite February 5 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The biggest addition in the February 5 update in Fortnite is the start of a new Fortnite Festival season, with Chappell Roan as the headline act.</strong></p>



<p>After plenty of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festivals-next-major-collab-may-have-been-found/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks and rumors</a>, her inclusion as the star of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-13-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Festival Season 13</a> was revealed by Epic Games, and the new season, of course, means a new Festival Pass to progress through.</p>



<p>In the Battle Royale scene, the South Park collab has now completed, with the Born in Chaos Mini Pass expiring. Unfortunately, if you didn’t complete the pass, those free rewards are now unavailable, though they could return to the Item Shop for purchase in the future.</p>



<p>The Valentine’s Day event is also set to be added, though the dates for its duration are not yet confirmed, and there’s a slew of big collabs coming to the Item Shop, including the second wave of KPop Demon Hunters and two character skins from Marvel Rivals; Magik and Luna Snow.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Valve time strikes again. Three months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-valve-announces-standalone-steam-frame-vr-headset-plus-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-revival">announcing a trio of new hardware products</a>, including the Steam Machine, Steam Frame and Steam Controller, Valve has published a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">blog post detailing their delay</a>. The new hardware was meant to arrive in the first quarter of this year, but this has now been "revisited" to the first half of the year due to the "memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about". </p>
<p>The Steam Machine is likely the major catalyst behind the decision, as the sharp rise in RAM and storage prices could force a rethink for a living room box that was intended to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">bridge the gap between consoles and entry-level PCs</a>. With RAM and storage prices doubling, tripling or even quadrupling over the past three months, even the relatively modest base model with 16GB of DDR5 RAM and 512GB will now cost significantly more to produce. </p>
<p>For context, the cheapest 16GB DDR5 SODIMM kit has <a href="https://zdcs.link/98AyY1">more than doubled in price on Amazon UK</a>, from £67 on Valve's November announcement date to £148 today. A 512GB 2230 NVMe SSD of the type used by Valve in the Steam Machine has <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8YMG">also rocketed up in price</a>, from £54 to £88 in the same time period. If we look at 2TB drives, it's <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxg3D">a steeper climb</a>, from £129 to £244. </p>
<p>Valve isn't paying consumer prices from Amazon, of course, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">these price surges are a worldwide affair</a> that have affected nearly every part of the PC industry. The situation could even postpone the release of the next generation of games consoles. </p><p>While the Steam Machine is the most obviously affected, the Steam Frame VR headset is also a miniature Snapdragon-powered gaming PC, with its own 16GB of LPDDR5X memory and 256GB or 1TB of storage, and its pricing will therefore need to be reconsidered. Previously, Valve had indicated that it expected the Frame to undercut the Valve Index in price, which retails for £919. The Steam Controller is the only member of the trio relatively immune to the current climate, though its launch is necessarily tied to the other two products. </p>
<p>Valve's post states that it expected to be able to share pricing and availability data by now, so it will be interesting to see how long it will take the Washingtonian firm to release revised information. In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">the recent blog</a> to see a few more frequently-asked questions answered, on topics including RAM/storage upgradability, ongoing support for the Valve Index and expected Steam Machine performance figures, with more blogs to come over the coming weeks. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>South Korean video game publisher Krafton, Inc. has announced that PUBG: Blindspot, the free-to-play 5v5 tactical shooter developed by PUBG Studios, is now available on Steam via Early Access. The team describes the game as being "designed around fast, high-intensity indoor firefights" that mix close-quarters battles and team-based strategies with a top-down perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Krafton, which made headlines last October after touting that <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">it would transform into an "AI-first company,"</a> says in a press release that today's Early Access launch marks the beginning of an open development phase, "with the development team actively working alongside players to refine gameplay systems and expand content" ahead of the game's 1.0 release. PUBG Studios adds that player feedback will play a central role in shaping the game with updates designed around depth, balance, and quality.&nbsp;</p><h3>PUBG: Blindspot Maps</h3><p>PUBG: Blindspot is the first spinoff of the mega-popular battle royale grandfather (though that's a heavily debated topic), PUBG, and takes place decades after the events of the original game. The head of the IP, Taesok Jang, says, "Starting with PUBG: Blindspot, the PUBG IP will continue to expand into new genres and platforms."&nbsp;</p><p>Today's launch precedes Competitive Season 1, which will launch next week on February 12. You can download the game right now on Steam, or play the game via Nvidia GeForce Now streaming.&nbsp;</p><h3>PUBG: Blindspot Characters</h3><p>If you've played any of the game's betas, you'll find some new content in today's Early Access release, like a defense-exclusive character with Molotov-based arena control, according to the press release.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to check out PUBG: Blindspot?

<p>PUBG: Blindspot might share the branding of the hit battle royale, but it’s a totally different style of game. This is a 5v5 team shooter that’s all about lines of sight with a shared team vision, controlling angles and close quarters combat with an element of destruction. New content is already planned, including the defence character Blaze, the addition of Molotov Cocktails for area control.</p>
<p>The early access launch is the start of open development that will take on feedback from the player base to inform the updates, balance and future updates. It’s available for free at this time, and per the FAQ on Steam, it’s planned to stay in early access for around one year, after which Krafton “plan to offer bundles at various price points, as well as a variety of in-game items.”&nbsp;The game will almost immediately kick into a seasonal structure, with Competitive Season 1 launching on 12th February.</p>
<p>“Early Access allows players to become active participants in the development process,” said Seungmyeong Yang, Production Director of PUBG: BLINDSPOT. “By launching as a free-to-play title and developing openly with the community, we aim to shape PUBG: BLINDSPOT together through ongoing communication and frequent updates.”</p>

<p>We got to go hands on with this game late in 2024 saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/project-arc-preview-pubg-studios-tactical-shooter-from-the-top-down/">our preview</a> “There’s just something about the top-down angle and the shared team vision that makes the game feel lighter than Siege, to me, and that’s something that I really hope resonates with gamers at large. I can definitely see this working really well on consoles, as well.”</p>

<p>Following its release on Switch and Switch 2 last December</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="15948a6745072"><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15948a6745072/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>There was some shock earlier this week when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/heres-a-look-at-the-best-selling-switch-and-switch-2-games-so-far">Nintendo's financials</a> seemingly confirmed that neither the Switch or Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> had cracked one million sales. So, how about the combined figures?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File journalist Stephen Totilo</a> has now reached out to Nintendo and got an official confirmation from a representative that the "combined sales" of the two titles have surpassed the one million mark. Here's the message relayed on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Following some consternation yesterday about neither the Switch nor Switch 2 versions of Metroid Prime 4 (Dec. 4) making Nintendo's million-seller list for the period ending Dec 31, a Nintendo rep confirmed to me today that the combined sales of those 2 versions have in fact passed a million copies"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cetznxhr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Nintendo hasn't released the exact sales figures for either version, or the combined figures in this case, but this latest update likely puts these sales more in line with the typical performance of the Prime series, even if the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/metroid-prime-4-beyond-sales-have-got-off-to-a-slow-start">individual releases got off to a slow start</a>.</p>
<p>The side-scroller entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>, which released on the Switch in 2021, is currently the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> series' best-selling game, with over three million sales. As for how Beyond stacks up against <em>other</em> Prime releases, the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> game remains the most successful entry, and the more recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Remaster</a> on the Switch was able to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/230509_4e.pdf">surpass the million mark</a> in a matter of months.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not known if Beyond has actually met Nintendo's sales expectations at this early stage, and there are many other factors to consider, including the title's lengthy development cycle, its cross-generation release, and a launch window in one of the busiest years on record for Nintendo - with the Switch 2 just getting started.</p>

<p>The Sony PlayStation 5 can officially claim victory over the Nintendo Switch 2 during the 2025 holiday season.</p>



<p>Sony recently released its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 FY2025 earnings.</a> The data show that 8 million <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5 </a>units were sold in the quarter ending September 30, 2025. In the same quarter, Nintendo sold 7.01 million Switch 2 units. Of note, this was the first full quarter with the Nintendo Switch successor on the market.</p>



<p>The Sony PS5 has been on the market since 2020 and has sold<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-passes-90-million-units-sold/" id="174295"> over 90 million units </a>to date. The<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908"> Nintendo Switch 2 </a>was released in June 2025 and had <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold 17.37 million units </a>as of New Year’s Eve 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-battle-between-sony-and-nintendo-rages-on">The Battle Between Sony and Nintendo Rages on</h2>



<p>Although Sony had a stronger quarter, the Switch 2 outsold the PS5 in the United States in 2025. Nintendo’s original Switch is currently the second-best-selling console of all time, with 155.37 million units sold. However, Sony’s PS2 remains the best-selling console a quarter of a century after its release, with 160 million units sold worldwide.</p>







<p>Sony’s PlayStation 6 may not be released until 2027, giving Nintendo a head start in this generation. Learn more about the potential release of a PS6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" id="151319">here</a>. Even Xbox, which acts more as a publisher in today’s console market, may not have its next<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" id="94492"> hardware release until 2027.</a></p>

<p>The Heavy, Max and the rest of the gang are back</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Here's a blast from the past! Developer Skunkape Games (the team founded by former Telltale employees who revived the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sam_and_max_the_complete_trilogy">Sam &amp; Max</a> series) has today announced the return of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/poker_night_at_the_inventory">Poker Night at the Inventory</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This poker title featuring an all-star cast of video game characters (Max - Sam &amp; Max, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiware/strong_bad_episode_1_homestar_ruiner">Strong Bad</a> - Homestar Runner, Tycho - Penny Arcade and The Heavy - <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong>) was originally developed by Telltale Games for Steam in 2010 and was delisted in 2019.</p>
<p>The new version has been "lovingly remastered" and will be reopening its doors for Switch and multiple other platforms on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>. Players can expect overhauled graphics and lighting, along with gameplay fixes to improve the overall poker simulation.</p>
<p>There are also new unlockables (including the return of TF2 items on Steam) and quality-of-life features - with the game updated using the "same engine as the team's recent remasters of the Sam &amp; Max trilogy". Here's some additional information via the Steam listing, and you can check out the official trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently reopened following a seismic retrofit, the Inventory is once again the hottest gathering place for video game characters to unwind after a long day on the job. Drop in to play No Limit Texas Hold’em with four familiar faces: Max, Strong Bad, Tycho, and The Heavy.</p>
<p>From the archives of Telltale Games, this jokey poker game pits iconic characters against the Player (that’s you!) in a high-stakes battle of cards, bets, and trash talk.</p>
<p>Each tournament you win brings you closer to unlocking a new hidden table design or custom card deck, each with new art unique to one of your opponent’s home franchises. Some of the decks and table felts have hidden properties that change the look of a character at the table, or the game itself. Keep an eye out for new unlocks created just for this release.</p>
<p>The Inventory and its guests look better than ever, with a top-to-bottom visual refresh, featuring higher resolution models, a more detailed environment, crisper animation, and new lighting.</p>
<p>In addition to tuning how much table talk you want to hear, you can now change the starting buy-in amount to literally raise or lower the stakes. There are also some new graphics features to up the filmic ambiance, like optional cinematic motion blur and film grain (they're off by default).</p>
<p>The team stripped Poker Night’s original poker code down to parts, scraped the gunk away, and rebuilt it better than new. Poker Night at the Inventory now plays a far more accurate game of poker, and your opponents will make more informed decisions that better fit their play style and personality.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Says Its New Console Plays The ‘Majority’ Of Steam Games At 4K 60FPS With FSR]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-resolution-framerate-specs-2000665807</link>
            <guid>1426090</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve still hasn’t revealed the full breakdown of what’s inside its new Steam Machine console or how much it will cost. Those details were delayed along <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">with the device’s “early” 2026 launch</a> due to an AI-fueled PC part shortage. But the company did offer a fresh clue about how the mini-computer will perform, and it almost sounds too good to be true.</p> <p>“In our testing the majority of Steam titles play great at 4K 60FPS with FSR on Steam Machine,” the company <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583">wrote in a new update</a> on February 4. “That said, there are some titles that currently require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with VRR to maintain a 1080p internal resolution. In the meantime, we are working on HDMI VRR, investigating improved upscaling, and optimizing ray tracing performance in the driver, so we are approaching this from multiple angles.”</p>

 <p>Steam users are…skeptical. “I don’t see how that’s possible on many, if not most current AAA games,” wrote one commenter. “The hardware just isn’t there. Isn’t this supposed to be a 3050 or lower class device?” Another wrote, “I don’t think the hardware is capable of delivering this promise. I have a 12 GB 3060. Which, presumably, is a significantly more powerful GPU than the one being offered. But it’s a still a lower-end GPU and I’m not playing any AAA games at 4K.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">It’s hard to know what exactly that means</a> since thousands of new games come to Steam every year and most of them are small indie games that aren’t very demanding to run. The Steam Machine might run <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> at 4K 60FPS no problem, but what about <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> and <em>Crimson Desert</em>, both AAA blockbusters coming to Valve’s storefront over the next couple of months? Not to mention all of the games that launched last year with PC performance issues like<em> Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p>

 <p>If the Steam Machine can pull off 4K 60FPS for even some of those big games without too much frame generation or upscaling, it would have a lot to offer not just console players but people coming from lower-end or very dated PC gaming rigs. But it also probably won’t come cheap. Then again, in this new world where gaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">gets more expensive every year</a>, who’s to say what even still counts as “cheap.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802</link>
            <guid>1426081</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">The Steam Machine</a>, Valve’s ambitious new venture into living room console gaming, was supposed to begin shipping in “early” 2026. That’s no longer the case. The company announced on Wednesday that its original launch plans have been pushed back to later in the year due to memory and storage shortages as companies race to pivot to AI.</p> <p>“When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” Valve wrote in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583">February 4 blog post</a>. “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then. The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).”</p>

 <p>The plan is still to ship the Steam Machine, a new Steam controller, and the new Steam Frame VR headset within the first half of 2026. That suggests the first units should still arrive in players’ hands sometime before June 30. But Valve adds that market conditions are currently shifting too quickly to confirm “concrete pricing and launch dates” at the start of 2026 as previously planned.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">First revealed back in November</a>, the Steam Machine is a small cube-shaped console with PC gaming specs somewhere between a PlayStation 5 and a PS5 Pro. The device is targeting the most common specs of the average Steam user with the goal of playing most games at 4K 60FPS with FSR enabled. This has led to lots of speculation about how much the device might actually cost, with Valve confirming it’s not planning to sell Steam Machines at a loss and declining to say whether it will be close to the current average console price of $500.</p>

 <p>And that was before PC components from RAM to graphics cards started significantly increasing in price as part supplies are monopolized by companies investing in AI datacenters. Employees at retailers like <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">GameStop and Target</a> have showed SSDs for PS5s and other upgrades spiking in price overnight, and some companies have shifted out of the consumer market altogether. While Valve seems to be waiting to see if things calm down at all, there’s no indication yet that this isn’t just the new normal.</p>

But because of the ongoing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones">memory and storage crunch</a>, that launch has been delayed to sometime in the first half of this year, and Valve says it will reset expectations for how much they will cost “as soon as possible.”</p><p>“We planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fgroup%2F45479024%2Fview%2F625565405086220583%3Fl%3Denglish" rel="sponsored">Valve says in a new post</a>. “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then.

From the beginning, Valve told us the Steam Machine, its ambitious new console, would be “positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space.” For the Frame, the company said it was aiming for a price that was less than its previous headset, the Index, which cost $999. And for the Steam Controller, Valve said it was targeting a price that would be competitive with other controllers with “advanced inputs.”</p><p>But within days of Valve’s hardware announcements last November, it became clear that Valve would have a tough time offering competitive pricing with the cost of RAM shooting up. It <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/valve-brings-back-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-hands-on-with-valves-new-amd-based-living-room-gaming-hardware">told <em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a> that the console was tough to price because “the market is kind of weird” and “memory prices are going up like right as we speak.” As of early 2026, PC gamers have seen the price of RAM triple, even quadruple, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones">memory makers pour their supply</a> into the more profitable AI server realm.</p><p>Yesterday, AMD CEO Lisa Su <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fearnings%2Fcall-transcripts%2F2026%2F02%2F03%2Famd-amd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript%2F" rel="sponsored">said on an earnings call</a> that “From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year.” It seems that the words “from a product standpoint” were carrying a lot more weight than we thought.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/874196/valve-steam-machine-frame-controller-delay-pricing-memory-crisis]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/valve/" id="172462">Valve </a>provides an update on the release of its Steam Machine and additional hardware slated for 2026.</p>



<p>Valve is once again entering the console market with its PC-console hybrid, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/steam-machine/" id="3197">Steam Machine</a>. Announced in November 2025, the new console is slated for release in the first half of 2026. Now, Valve has provided an update on its Hardware releases, some of the challenges they’re facing, and what that means for customers.</p>



<h2 id="h-pricing-and-launch-date-remain-uncertain-for-steam-machine">Pricing and Launch Date Remain Uncertain for Steam Machine</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post </a>on Wednesday, February 4, Valve revealed that industry-wide memory and storage shortages and rising memory prices have forced it to revisit its shipping schedule and pricing, particularly for the Steam Machine and the Steam Frame VR headset.</p>



<p>They still plan to ship all three products in the first half of the year, but they are currently working to finalize pricing and a specific launch date. They promise to keep customers updated as best they can.</p>



<p>“Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce,” they say.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-steam-machine-s-ssd-and-memory-will-be-upgradable">The Steam Machine’s SSD and Memory Will Be Upgradable</h2>



<p>Later in the blog, there’s an FAQ. There, Valve reveals the components of the Steam Machine and notes that both the SSD (NVMe 2230 or 2280) and memory (DDR5 SODIMMs) will be upgradable. They also claim that during test runs, most Steam titles run at 4K 60FPS with FSR on the Steam Machine.</p>



<p>However, they note that some titles will require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower frame rate. They’re also working on HDMI VRR and investigating how to improve upscaling and optimize ray tracing performance.</p>







<p>While it’s not fair to say these devices are being delayed, as no concrete release date was ever given, the uncertainties players hoped would be resolved by now will continue due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/">volatility of the RAM market</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>explains its belief that updates to Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Splatoon 3 help maintain player loyalty during the Switch-to-Switch 2 transition.</p>



<p>In January 2026, Nintendo launched a significant update for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" id="3155">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. This update not only introduced additional in-game content but also quality-of-life improvements for those who pick up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2</a> edition of the game. Splatoon 3 also received a major update, extending its lifecycle. Splatoon also received specific updates to support the next Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Now, Nintendo is admitting that it is trying to balance releasing new titles for its latest console with easing players into the transition from the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-president-discusses-transition-philosophy">Nintendo President Discusses Transition Philosophy</h2>



<p>During its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investor presentation</a>, Shuntaro Furukawa, president of Nintendo Co., Ltd., explained that major updates to existing titles are a key part of Nintendo’s philosophy because they help maintain connections with existing customers.</p>



<p>The belief is that it allows players to feel they are still getting value from their original Nintendo Switch while creating a pathway to adopt the next-generation console.</p>



<p>“As we move forward with the multi-year transition from Switch to Switch 2, we believe it is also very important to maintain contact with our customers who are currently using Nintendo consoles.</p>



<p>“In that sense, we thot it would be a good idea to update titles that have been big sellers on the Switch, such as ‘Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ and ‘Splatoon 3,’ at this time,” he said (via Google Translate).</p>







<p>Nintendo is continuing to march into its next generation. However, they are not fully finished with the original Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, scheduled for February 5, will feature games coming to both consoles. Insider Gaming will have coverage of the presentation.</p>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Valve [202 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/valve">Valve</a> has provided <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steam_hardware/announcements/detail/625565405086220584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an update</a> on its <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/valve-announces-steam-machine-steam-frame-and-steam-controller">November 2025-announced</a> Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller hardware—specifically addressing launch timing and pricing. <span id="more-1023815"></span></p><p>“When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” the update reads. “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then. The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).”</p><p>It continues, “Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed. But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change. We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible.”</p><p>In the meantime, Valve plans to share deep dives into specific features, updates, and “what’s new” writeups via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Hardware blog</a>. Today’s update comes in the form of a FAQ addressing some of the other most-asked-about topics surrounding the new hardware.</p><p>Here is the full FAQ:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Steam Frame and VR</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Will Steam Frame support other streaming services?</strong></p><p>SteamOS has a built-in browser, and we expect streaming services to work in a theatrical browser mode.</p><p><strong>How can I request a Steam Frame developer kit?</strong></p><p>Steamworks developers can submit a request for Steam Frame dev kits at the partner site <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>Supplies are limited, but we are sending out kits on an ongoing basis.</p><p><strong>Will Steam Frame work with lighthouse base stations?</strong></p><p>It’s not something we’re working on, but we built Steam Frame to be modular and extensible so that the community and 3rd parties can build out the features and accessories that are important to them.</p><p><strong>Can Steam Frame be used while wearing glasses?</strong></p><p>A bunch of people on the team wear glasses and use Steam Frame without issue, but it really depends on the width of the glasses frames. And while we don’t have details to share yet, we are looking into making prescription lens inserts available ahead of launch.</p><p>I heard that Steam Frame has foveated streaming – is that the same thing as foveated rendering? What games support it?<br>With Steam Frame, we are introducing a new feature called foveated streaming. While both use eye tracking data, the technology is different:</p><ul><li>Foveated rendering uses eye tracking data so the game only renders high resolution data in the portion of the viewport that the player is looking at.</li><li>Foveated streaming, on the other hand, uses eye tracking data so that the <a title="Platforms > PC [25,417 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> only streams high resolution data in the portion of the viewport the player is looking at.</li></ul><p>Since foveated streaming is a system-level feature, it applies to all games, and requires no game developer work. If a game implements foveated rendering, the benefits of that feature will stack with foveated streaming.</p><p><strong>Will Valve Index have ongoing product support?</strong></p><p>While we’re no longer making Valve Index, we do intend to support Index owners the same way we have in the past on an ongoing basis.</p><p><strong>■ Steam Machine</strong></p><p><strong>How well can Steam Machine play newer, more demanding games on Steam?</strong></p><p>In our testing the majority of Steam titles play great at 4K resolution / 60 frames per second with FSR on Steam Machine. That said, there are some titles that currently require more upscaling than others, and it may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with VRR to maintain a 1080p internal resolution.</p><p>In the meantime, we are working on HDMI VRR, investigating improved upscaling, and optimizing ray tracing performance in the driver, so we are approaching this from multiple angles.</p><p><strong>Will third parties be able to make faceplates for Steam Machine? Will you be making the CAD for those faceplates available?</strong></p><p>Yes, we plan to share faceplate CAD, specs, and details in the coming months, for customers and manufacturers to make their own.</p><p><strong>What components of Steam Machine are upgradeable?</strong></p><p>Steam Machine’s SSD (NVMe 2230 or 2280) and memory (DDR5 SODIMMs) are both accessible and upgradeable.</p><p><strong>■ Steam Controller</strong></p><p><strong>Can I play non steam games with the Steam Controller?</strong></p><p>he controller can work with any game compatible with the Steam Overlay.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/steam-machine-steam-frame-and-steam-controller-update-we-have-work-to-do-to-land-on-concrete-pricing-and-launch-dates]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For those concerned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" id="155026">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> failed to sell 1 million copies, there is some good news.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>released its financial results for the end of 2025, many noted that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was not among the games reported to have sold over a million copies. The game was released in December for both the original Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, leading to some being concerned that a major Nintendo release failed to meet these benchmarks. </p>



<p>However, Nintendo has confirmed that the game has surpassed 1 million sales across both the original and successor Nintendo Switch consoles.</p>







<p>Stephen Totilo on Bluesky said a Nintendo representative told him the combined sales surpassed the metric.</p>







<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-was-the-final-game-for-nintendo-dev">Metroid Prime 4 Was the Final Game for Nintendo Dev</h2>



<p>In the wake of the release of Metroid Prime 4, Kensuke Tanabe, a legendary producer at Nintendo known for his work on the franchise,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-will-be-kensuke-tanabes-final-nintendo-project/" id="171810"> confirmed</a> that this would be the final game that he would work on at Nintendo.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4 was announced in 2017 and took nearly a decade to release, after the project switched development Studios from Bandai Namco to Retro Studios. Ultimately, the game received favorable reviews, but many admitted it failed to live up to the legacy of earlier games in the franchise.</p>







<p>Nintendo continues to march into the future with a Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase on February 5, announcing more games coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 and some that will release on the original Nintendo Switch. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the presentation on February 5.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch </a>may be dropping the “2” from its name, but it’s trading it in for the Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Switch 2.</a></p>



<p>Details remain scarce, but the development team announced that Overwatch is heading to the Nintendo Switch 2 in Spring 2026. The announcement was made during the Overwatch Spotlight on Thursday, February 4, 2026. The game was released on the original Nintendo Switch. As such, it is playable on the successor console. However, a dedicated Switch 2 release would mean some likely upgrades and optimization for the new hardware.</p>



<p>As of yet, there is no specific release date attached to the release of Overwatch: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p>

<p>The big announcement from the showcase was the reveal of a year-long story arc known as “The Reign of Talon.” Reign of Talon will be a 6-season storyline, introducing five new heroes, new in-game events, and more. A new arc will then commence in early 2027.</p>



<p>Also, it was announced that Overwatch, which had renamed itself “Overwatch 2” in 2022, will revert to its original name.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/overwatch-2-is-just-overwatch-again-with-new-story-focus-and-new-characters-including-a-flying-cat-healer/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Blizzard is hitting the big red reset button on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, reverting the game back to being just <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch">Overwatch</a> from 10th February, a bit like when Prince decided to be called Prince again instead of having an unpronounceable sign for a name. As part of the soft reboot, Overwatch will embrace a new story focus with a narrative arc running through each season, and there will be 10 new heroes launched through the year, with the first five joining the roster alongside the reboot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Overwatch Animated Short | “Reign of Talon”" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ch2J2Xuu3VI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Overwatch might have been feeling some of the heat from Marvel Rivals, pushing Blizzard to take this reinvigorated approach, harking back to the early days of the game. Each arc will start with a new cinematic and then continue through motion comics, in-game events, new voice lines, animated hero trailers and short stories.</p>
<p>The five new heroes include&nbsp;Domina, Emre, Mizuki, Anran, and Jetpack Cat, and each one will have an important role in the story.</p>


<p>Joining the Talon forces, with Vendetta leading them, is Domina, taking on the role of being a poke tank with a hard-light barrier, sonic repulsors and an imprisoning barrier ultimate. Emre is a former Overwatch Strike Team member, but walked away, got some cybernetic mods, and kind of lost his mind – he’s a fact-paced run-and-gun damage style. Mizuki is a new support with spinning blades that bounce of walls, a healing hat to bounce around and a healing sanctuary.</p>
<p>On the Overwatch side of things is the new damage dealer Anran, who shoots fiery projectiles and is sure to be veeeeeeerrry popular for cosmetics – hence why she’s available from 5th Feb via a Hero Trial. Then there’s Jetpack Cat, who is a ginger cat riding a jetpack and meowing a lot. She has Biotic Pawjectiles, a healling Purr, and the abilitiy to catnap as her ultimate. She will also make pet owners feel very, very guilty for shooting at her.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Overwatch Spotlight | 5 New Heroes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fa9myF4xm8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The three main character classes will remain, but they’re now being broken down into sub-roles to give special buffs as follows:</p>
<p>TANK</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BRUISER</strong>: Reduces critical damage received. While at critical health, gain movement speed.
<ul>
<li><em>Mauga / Orisa / Roadhog / Zarya</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>INITIATOR</strong>: Staying airborne lightly heals you.
<ul>
<li><em>D.Va / Doomfist / Winston / Wrecking Ball</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>STALWART</strong>: Reduces knockbacks and slows received.
<ul>
<li><em>Domina / Hazard / Junker Queen / Ramattra / Reinhardt / Sigma</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DAMAGE</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SHARPSHOOTER</strong>: Critical hits reduce your movement ability cooldowns.
<ul>
<li><em>Ashe / Cassidy / Hanzo / Sojourn / Widowmaker</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>FLANKER</strong>: Health packs restore more health.
<ul>
<li><em>Anran / Genji / Reaper / Tracer / Vendetta / Venture</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SPECIALIST</strong>: Eliminating an enemy briefly increases your reload speed.
<ul>
<li><em>Bastion / Emre / Junkrat / Mei / Soldier: 76 / Symmetra / Torbjorn</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RECON</strong>: You detect enemies below half health through walls after damaging them.
<ul>
<li><em>Echo / Freja / Pharah / Sombra</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SUPPORT</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TACTICIAN</strong>: You can gain excess ultimate charge, which carries over after using your ultimate ability.
<ul>
<li><em>Ana / Baptiste / Jetpack Cat / Lucio / Zenyatta</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>MEDIC</strong>: Healing allies with your weapon also heals you.
<ul>
<li><em>Kiriko / Lifeweaver / Mercy / Moira</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SURVIVOR</strong>: Using a movement ability activates passive health regeneration.
<ul>
<li><em>Brigitte / Illari / Juno / Mizuki / Wuyang</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Overwatch Spotlight | Sub-Roles &amp; New Meta Event" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRaSIHEJ424?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Season 1 will kick off a new meta event that will run for five weeks, asking players to join either Talon or Overwatch, and then fight for their side. You’ll get missions to complete each week to further the lore of the battle, and earn tons of lootboxes along the way.</p>
<p>Oh, and there’s an ugly new main menu that looks like a mobile F2P game. The old menus weren’t perfect, but they had a pleasing minimalism and clarity to them.</p>
