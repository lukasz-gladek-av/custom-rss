<p>Somewhat surprisingly, nothing was able to topple the top four of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> (on Switch 1 and 2) this time. Less surprising is that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> emerged as the best-selling newbie in fifth, outperforming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> on Switch 2, which debuted in sixth.</p>
<p>Remember, outside of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Dread</a>, Metroid has historically not sold well in Japan, so we're not entirely shocked to see Beyond appear so low. That said, after all these years of waiting, we would have thought the Switch 1 edition would at least make an appearance in the top 10...</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cenwysiu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The hardware charts have seen a big boom for Switch across the board. The Switch 2 shifted a whopping 200,000+ units last week, pushing its total up past the 3 million mark, and the Switch OLED and Lite models comfortably took second and third place.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this means that combining the SKUs for the Switch and PS5 systems leans things firmly in Nintendo's favour. The standard, Lite and OLED models came together for 51,316, while the three PS5 options combined for 25,240.</p>

		<p>Moi Rai Games has released a major quality of life update for roguelike monster battler RPG Aethermancer. This new update, which is update 0.5.0.8, adds the new monster Ravager, a Combat Inspect feature, and the ability to redistribute equipment among monsters. Ravager’s addition brings new moves and traits to use, so players can experiment with party builds some more. The Combat Inspect feature can be used at any time in battle so you can see exactly what buffs, debuffs, and conditions are active at any time. You can read the full patch notes below.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Balancing Changes (Monster)</span><wbr></p>
<p>The balancing changes for this update are rather conservative, since the last set of balancing changes was rather recent. We mostly tried to target monsters, types, and skills that have been overperforming or underperforming for a long time.</p>
<p><wbr><b>Medusa</b><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Adjusted the Signature Trait to trigger for every 5 debuffs cleansed (from 6) and deal 1 x 5 damage (from 1 x 6)<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Naga</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the Signature Trait (unshifted) to deal 2 x 4 damage (instead of 2 x 2)<wbr></li>
<li>Increased 2nd Worthiness Perk (unshifted + shifted) to Shield Generator +3 (from +2)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Djinn</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>3rd Worthiness perk (unshifted + shifted) increased to Evasion +20% (from 15%)<wbr></li>
<li>Shifted Djnn’s health reduced to 30 (from 35); matching the unshifted value<wbr></li>
<li>Signature Trait (unshifted) was adjusted to grant +35% Crit Chance (form +30% Crit Chance)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Balancing Changes (Types)</span><wbr></p>
<p><b>Critical</b><wbr></p>
<p>We decided to give a soft rework to the Critical type with this update. We removed the few skills that apply Force (instead moving them to the Force type). To make up for that, Critical now has easy access to skills that apply Bleed stacks. Bleed stacks open up more potential for synergies for the Critical type itself, as well as for Maverick skills with other types. We think this is a more interesting direction for the Critical type and also helps to distinguish the Critical type from the Force type. We also made some further buffs and reworked some non-aura skills into auras. Please also take note of the new skills we added to support this rework (listed above)!<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Generate Force (Action): Only available to Force Type now.<wbr></li>
<li>Precision Meteor (Action): Only available to Force Type now.<wbr></li>
<li>Fire Blast (Action): Crit Chance increased to +30% (from +25%)<wbr></li>
<li>Stone Edge (Action): Damage reduced to 3 x 8 (from 3 x 9). Added: “On Crit: Applies 1 Bleed.”<wbr></li>
<li>Critical Bleed (Maverick Trait): Changed into a regular Critical Trait (no longer requires Affliction type in the party, is no longer a Maverick Trait)<wbr></li>
<li>Cruelty (Trait): Reworked into a Force + Power Maverick Trait: “At the start of combat, and whenever an enemy is staggered: Applies&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;Force and&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;temporary Power to self.”<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old effect (as a regular Critical Trait): “Crit Damage +3. At the start of combat, and whenever an enemy is staggered: Applies&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;Force to self.”<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Critical Hybridization (Trait): Reworked into an aura: “Aura: On Crit from an ally: Deals an extra hit with 3 Wild damage. Triggers once per action.”<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old effect: “On Crit: Deals an extra hit with 3 Wild damage. Triggers once per action.”<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assault Shield (Maverick Trait): Reworked into an aura: “On Crit from an ally: Shields them for 3.”<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old effect: “On Crit: Applies 3 Shield to the ally with the lowest amount of Shield.”<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sidecrits (Maverick Trait): Now also applies 1 Bleed: “This monster’s Sidekick Attack is always critical and applies 1 Bleed.”<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old effect: “This monster’s Sidekick Attack is always critical.”<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Force</b><wbr></p>
<p>Apart from the Critical rework, the most drastic set of changes are aimed at the Force type, which has been underperforming for a long time. These changes are meant to help promote the intended Force strategy of using Support Actions to build up Force stacks.<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Petal Shield (Action): Force stacks applied increased to 2 (from 1)<wbr></li>
<li>Air Shield (Action): Force stacks applied increased to 3 (from 2), but Shielding per Force stack reduced to 2 (from 3)<wbr></li>
<li>Precision Meteor (Action): Damage increased to 1 x 18 (from 1 x 15)<wbr></li>
<li>Into the Fray (Trait): Adjusted to apply 1 Force to each ally (instead of applying 1 Force to target ally and 1 Force to self)<wbr></li>
<li>Reinforce (Trait): Reduced the healing to 3 (from 5) and increased the Force applied to 2 (from 1)<wbr></li>
<li>Fierce Summoning (Maverick Trait): Also Shields the attached monster for 3 when it triggers<wbr></li>
<li>Massive Damage (Maverick Trait): Health required per +1 Crit Damage adjusted to 15 (from 20)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Burn</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Burn Hit” equipment affixes were buffed: regular affix was buffed to +12% (from +10%) and rare affix was buffed to +20% (from +15%)<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Terror</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Bone Chill (Action): Terror stacks applied increased to 5 (from 4)<wbr></li>
<li>Panic (Trait): Terror stacks applied increased to 6 (from 5)<wbr></li>
<li>Nighmare (Trait): The damage hits now ignore retaliates<wbr></li>
<li>Dark Exchange (Maverick Trait): Debuffs cleansed (and transferred) increased to 4 (from 3)<wbr></li>
<li>Frightful Lightning: Applies 3 Terror to each enemy (instead of 3 Terror to each other enemy)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Summon</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>New equipment affix: “Essence Summoning +1” (Minions summoned by this monster gain +1 Essence). Requires “Summon” type in the party to be obtained.<wbr></li>
<li>Protective Servitude (Trait): Increased healing and shielding to 6 (from 5)<wbr></li>
<li>Summon Mastery (Trait): Increased Minion Damage to +2 (from +1). Removed the aura tag.<wbr></li>
<li>Impactful Summoning (Trait): Increased the damage to 4 (from 3)<wbr></li>
<li>Totem Summons: Changed to apply 4 heal + 4 shield (instead of only doing 6 shield)<wbr></li>
<li>Faun: Heal changed to 2 x 3 (from 3x 2) (This was always meant to be 2 x 3, but was set up wrongly)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Purge</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Shock (Trait): Damage reduced to 6 (from 7)<wbr></li>
<li>Split Aether (Maverick Trait): Damage reduced to 6 (from 7)<wbr></li>
<li>Wildflower Harvest (Maverick Action): Damage reduced to 3 x 4 (from 3 x 5)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Weakness</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Hexing Strikes (Trait): No longer has Weakness Reduction +1<wbr></li>
<li>Warlock Party (Trait): Now also has Weakness Reduction +1, but only applies 1 Weakness to the enemy with the lowest amount of Weakness (instead of 2 Weakness distributed to up to 2 enemies with the lowest amount of Weakness)<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Dodge</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eye of the Storm: Required damage adjusted to 35 (from 30)<wbr></p>
</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Much has been said about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> success and the business calls that made it an unexpected frontrunner in the 2025 Game of the Year race. Now we’ve learned that the game was somehow made for less than $10 million.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html"><i><span>The New York Times</span></i></a><span>, Sandfall Interactive co-founder and CEO Guillaume Broche said that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s budget was a tiny fraction of your average AAA game, coming out to “less than $10 million.” To put that into perspective, Insomniac’s </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>cost around </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233"><span>$300 million</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> managed to avoid those ballooning budgets by aiming for a much smaller scale and refusing to chase the modern open-world bloat that has some games costing huge fortunes and taking half a decade to make.</span></p>

 <p><span>As Broche lays out, Sandfall made a string of creative decisions that would allow the studio to create a lot with fewer resources, a smaller team, and a reasonable budget. One major example is how the game’s overworld is a miniature recreation of a map, rather than a full-blown open-world space. This allowed the devs to present an explorable universe to players without having to create something on the scale of open-world games that show off every detail as players walk through it.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sandfall </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>is an independent studio</span></a><span>, but much of </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>‘s funding came from publisher Kepler Interactive, and some parts of development (including battle animations and localization) were outsourced. The result is that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> manages to have all the polish of a prestige AAA game at a budget that a lot of other publishers would have you believe can’t possibly produce games of its quality.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s still a false narrative floating around the internet that </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people"><span>only 30 people</span></a><span> made Sandfall Interactive’s breakout debut RPG. While yes, the company itself may be smaller than your average studio, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>was also </span><a href="https://vgbees.com/if-you-dont-count-everyone-else-all-devs-are-solo-devs/"><span>developed in collaboration with contractors</span></a><span>. The numbers don’t lie, though. When blockbuster development costs are ballooning,</span><i><span> Clair Obscur</span></i><span> proves you can make a hit that still looks and feels impressive without breaking the bank.</span></p>

 <p><span>It also, thankfully, is not a massive time sink. I rolled credits at around 30 hours, while most RPGs last at least twice as long. Broche told </span><i><span>The New York Times</span></i><span> he hopes </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>‘s success will help bring the cost of developing AAA games back to a more reasonable range.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We have the tech now to make those games with a relatively small team,” Broche said. “Games like this are coming. We are lucky to be early.”</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243"><span>The 2025 Game Awards</span></a><span> are tonight, and </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>has 13 nominations</span></a><span> across multiple categories, which is the most any game has earned in the event’s decade-long history.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-microsd-card-returns-at-0-07-per-gb-expand-storage-on-nintendo-switch-phones-or-tablets-for-almost-nothing-2000652287</link>
            <guid>1379707</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="168" data-end="915">Storage has become one of the most frustrating limitations of modern tech. No matter how much space manufacturers promise, it never feels like enough. Our phones eventually fill up with new photos and videos, our PCs balloon with game downloads and media files, and our gaming consoles never seem to have enough room for the next title we want to install. Because of this ongoing struggle, storage deals tend to be some of the best and most reliable purchases you can make. When SSDs, external drives, or microSD cards go on sale, it’s usually smart to grab one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6346/">Right now, the Samsung EVO Select line of memory cards is discounted by as much as 25%, making it a great time to upgrade your device’s storage without spending much.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has a handful of options at various capacities all on sale at the moment. The 64GB version of the Samsung EVO Select microSD is only&nbsp; $15 at the moment. But what’s this? So is the 128GB version. You can double the storage for no extra charge. Beyond that, the 256GB version is down to $23, and the full 1TB option has dropped from $93 to just $70.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6346/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Download More Game to Your Nintendo Switch</h2>
<p>For gamers in particular, especially those who own a Nintendo Switch, a microSD card is practically a necessity. The original Nintendo Switch model launched with only 32GB of internal storage, which disappears remarkably fast once you start downloading games. While Nintendo titles tend to be smaller than the enormous triple-A games common on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC—many of which exceed 100GB—Switch games can still add up quickly. For instance, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> weighs in at around 18.2GB, which is more than half of the system’s default storage all by itself. Add a couple more games and your space is gone in an instant.</p>
<p>That’s why ya gotta upgrade. With the Samsung EVO Select 1TB MicroSD card currently available for just $70, you can multiply your Switch storage many, many times over without needing to delete and redownload your favorite titles. 1TB gives you enough room to store a massive library of games, screenshots, captures, and save data, ensuring you’ll never need to stress about running out of space before a big download ever again.</p>



<p>However, if you’re playing on the Nintendo Switch 2, I hate to be the bearer of bad news. These particular microSD cards will not work with the latest Nintendo console. Nintendo’s next-generation console uses the newer microSD Express format, which offers significantly faster read and write speeds. Because of this difference, inserting a Samsung EVO Select MicroSD card into a Switch 2 will be met with nothing but an incompatibility message. Or maybe just nothing at all, I haven’t personally tested it.</p>
<p>The good news is that the EVO Select cards remain fully functional with the former lineup of Nintendo systems: the original Nintendo Switch, the Switch Lite, and the Switch OLED model.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the Samsung EVO Select series delivers read and write speeds up to 160MB/s. While that doesn’t meet the more demanding requirements of the Switch 2, it exceeds what’s needed for the original Switch family, which only recommends speeds up to 90MB/s. In practical terms, this means smooth loading times and reliable performance for everything you play. Unless you’re playing a&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>game because nothing can help those perform well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PC RAM Now Costs More Than Some New Graphics Cards]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/</link>
            <guid>1379704</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The PC Ram pricing problem continues to get worse for consumers. What was once one of the cheaper parts when building a custom PC, buying RAM has gotten to the point where it’s more expensive than buying even a brand-new graphics card for some.</p>



<p>A few weeks back, Insider Gaming reported on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-prices-have-soared-by-up-to-250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fact that RAM prices have risen</a> by up to 250%. Well, fast forward to mid-December, and those prices now look “affordable”. There have been increases in PC RAM prices by, on average, another 25% since November 26. Some have even gone up by another 50% or more if you were looking at picking up a 64GB pack. </p>







<p>That means modern day graphics cards like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series and AMD Radeon RX 9000 series are becoming cheaper in comparison. Need specific examples? A new ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5070 is available for $549.99 while a ASRock Radeon RX 9070 XT can be had for $599.99. Even an RTX 5070 Ti, which costs an average of $749.99, is cheaper than some 64GB packs, like the Corsair Vengeance. </p>



<p>Below you’ll find a comparison of prices from November 1 to November 26 to December 11. All of them have continued to rise, with reports suggesting that it’s not going to slow down. It’s even gotten to the point that traditional budget-friendly brands are being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/micron-shutting-down-its-consumer-crucial-ram-and-ssd-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completely shuttered</a> in order to focus on the needs of the big AI companies that are causing the problems. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>PC Memory</th><th>Nov. 1 Price</th><th>Nov. 26 Price</th><th>Dec. 11 Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>16GB Kingston Fury</td><td>$62.99</td><td>$149.99</td><td>$241.02</td></tr><tr><td>32GB T-Force</td><td>$96.99</td><td>$339.99</td><td>$429.99</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$97.99</td><td>$269.99</td><td>$349.99</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$104.99</td><td>$279.99</td><td>$439.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB Corsair Vengeance</td><td>$239.99</td><td>$839.99</td><td>$899.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$629.99</td><td>$719.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$569.99</td><td>$669.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out to multiple manufacturers to discuss what consumers can do and if they are going to do anything to make sure they still have options when building a PC. As of publishing, however, no company has given answers.</p>

<p>Mega Evolutions are having a moment elsewhere in Pokémon too, thanks to their inclusion in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Its DLC arrived yesterday, bringing spatial distortions to Lumiose City, on top of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-fan-favourite-pokemon-gets-a-new-mega-evolution-in-pokemon-legends-z-as-dlc-as-mewtwo-strikes-back">Mewtwo's recent appearance in the base game</a>.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, Pokémon TCG Pocket has a holiday-themed event starting on Christmas Day and running until 8th January, with various seasonal awards.</p>
<p>In addition, January will see a Mareep Drop Event, a fresh Wonder Pick Event, and a Mega Latios ex Drop Event.</p>

<p>But is it a remake..?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ecd2498efbcc1"><a title="Tomb Raider" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ecd2498efbcc1/tomb-raider.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Core Design</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-game-awards-2025-time-date-and-how-to-watch">The Game Awards</a> is taking place later today (or early tomorrow depending on your timezone), but it seems that yet another major announcement has leaked ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/major-tomb-raider-announcement-leaks-ahead-of-the-game-awards">Eurogamer</a>, the cover art for a new Tomb Raider entry has cropped up online along with a handful of screenshots. Titled <strong>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</strong>, some are speculating that it might actually be (another) remake of the original game from 1996, which itself also dealt with Atlantis.</p>
<p>The cover art features an updated iteration of Lara Croft which seems to blend the original design with the more realistic take featured in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">2013 reboot</a> (which, by the way, recently saw a release on Switch and Switch 2).</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6qjsyuv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>So if this is all legit – and it certainly seems to be – is it possible that this new entry could come to the Switch 2? It's hard to say at this stage, but it's a definite possibility. There's been a smattering of Tomb Raider titles on the Switch and Switch 2 in recent years, with the aforementioned Definitive Edition preceded by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_iv-vi_remastered">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-iii_remastered">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</a> from Aspyr.</p>
<p>Remake or not, the screenshots certainly look pretty neat, so we'll have to wait until The Game Awards to see this thing in action. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is also due to receive a fresh new trailer at the event, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/leon-kennedy-is-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-via-psn-store-image">a new piece of key art</a> from the PSN store prematurely revealed the existence of veteran protagonist Leon Kennedy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today might be all about <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a>, but it's still another Thursday in a new week, which means another NVIDIA GeForce NOW Thursday is here, with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-monster-hunter-stories/">a new batch of games added to NVIDIA's cloud streaming service</a>. This week, seven titles enter the service for the first time, including two games from one franchise, and three games are added to the selection of titles that are RTX 5080-ready.</p>



<p>The two games from one franchise are Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin. Ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection arriving on March 13, 2026</a>, you'll now be able to play through the first two games using GeForce NOW.</p>



<p>Two other notable games joining the service this week are two new releases, Skate Story and Death Howl, both two of the more interesting indie games to arrive towards the end of the year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining GeForce NOW for the first time this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Skate Story (December 8)</li>



<li>Dome Keeper (December 9)</li>



<li>Death Howl (December 9)</li>



<li>RuneQuest: Warlords (December 9)</li>



<li>Everdream Village (December 12)</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Stories</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin</li>
</ul>



<p>As far as the three games that are now RTX 5080-ready, it's a good week for 4X strategy players and city-sim building players, with the three games being Age of Wonders 4, Cities: Skylines, and Cities: Skylines 2.</p>



<p>Speaking of the RTX 5080 Blackwell servers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-adds-8-games-rtx-5080-servers-soon-to-be-live-worldwide/">they are still one region short of being available worldwide, according to the map of their initial rollout</a>. Stockholm has yet to be added, though it is expected to join the rest of the regions where RTX 5080 servers are already available "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, a final mention for The Game Awards, you can play a majority of the nominated games through GeForce NOW, including the heavyweight favourite, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and the games that have a shot at stealing GOTY out from its grasp, like Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and Hollow Knight Silksong.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You can’t really enjoy an immersive viewing experience without great sound to match the visuals. If you’re looking to make holiday movie nights better but your current TV doesn’t have solid built-in speakers, adding a soundbar to the setup can be a smart move. And thanks to Amazon, picking one up doesn’t break the bank today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">The Sony S100F 2.0ch soundbar is currently going for just $98 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping 39% off its usual price of $160</a>. Shipping is free as well, so you’re not adding anything on top of the sale price. Even better, orders placed today will arrive before Christmas, so you can have fun streaming marathons with friends and family with fuller, richer audio that fills the room. Note that it’s only around for a short time, so it’s best to grab yours before the offer expires.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Surround Sound Experience</h2>
<p>The slim design blends into every entertainment setup well, matching the aesthetics of any room. You can place it on your console right below the screen, or mount it on the wall if you prefer a cleaner setup. It punches well above its weight, though. Sony has packed the soundbar with a two-speaker setup that delivers front surround sound by handling the full audio range without requiring additional subwoofers or speakers. It produces audio as a stereo mix for a wider soundstage that fills the entire room, instead of just blasting from the front.</p>
<p>The bass reflex speaker does an incredible job of delivering punchy, deep bass without compromising on the details, even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. You will be able to vibe to all your favorite tunes, plus immerse yourself in thrilling scenes like never before. S-Force Pro, on the other hand, emulates cinema-style sound fields for better clarity and a 3D experience. Translation? Cars in F1 race past your couch, gunfire erupts right in your living room, and the Grinch’s footsteps feel like they’re actually coming from behind you. Whether you’re planning to watch an action-packed series or stream some good old Christmas title, it makes you feel a part of what’s happening on the screen.</p>



<p>There’s a voice enhancement feature that automatically improves dialog clarity, even in those loud, chaotic scenes. It also comes in handy when you’re catching up with friends on a bigger screen; you will be able to hear everyone on the conference call clearly. Connectivity couldn’t be easier. A single HDMI ARC connection between the TV and the soundbar gets the party started. You can control both the TV and the soundbar with a single remote. Best of all, it supports Bluetooth connections just as well, which is great for when you want to pair your smartphone wirelessly with it. Maybe play some songs or a podcast in the background as you set holiday decorations up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">On a regular day, this speaker would run you around $160, but this deal lets you grab it for $98, which is quite affordable considering all the features it gets you.</a> If you’ve been after better sound, this soundbar can be an excellent addition to your setup. Snap it up quick, though, as the discount is a limited-time one. The retailer hasn’t specified an end date, but we’re not expecting it to last long. Placing your orders now will also allow you to get it before Christmas!</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is a beloved game after being on the market for a little more than six weeks. It’s an all-new extraction adventure title from Embark Studios, and it’s proving to be a true disruptor to the genre. Recently, NVIDIA kickstarted a promotional event that allows certain players to unlock an exclusive ARC Raiders backpack, and it has proven to be a little too popular.</p>



<p>If you try to redeem the ARC Raiders NVIDIA backpack right now, you’ll be met with network errors and server issues.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-nvidia-arc-raiders-backpack-is-sought-after">The NVIDIA ARC Raiders Backpack is Sought-After</h2>



<p>There are a few caveats to claiming the ARC Raiders NVIDIA backpack, the most critical of which is that you need to be a PC gamer with an NVIDIA GPU. This is because it needs to link to the NVIDIA App and the GeForce Rewards program.</p>



<p>We’ve got a full guide explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/get-free-arc-raiders-nvidia-backpack/">how to get the ARC Raiders backpack</a> from NVIDIA.</p>



<p>The listing went live at 6 AM PT, and what must be thousands of ARC Raiders fans were waiting to receive it, so much so that the NVIDIA site stopped working:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is a testament to the power of ARC Raiders, which is one of the most popular and successful games of 2025 after just a few weeks on the market.</p>



<p>To be honest, customization in ARC Raiders could be a little better. It’s limited right now, and that’s fine, because it’s a live-service game and Embark Studios is adding more content as they flesh out the holistic offering. But that’s why deals like this NVIDIA ARC Raiders backpack are so special – because people want <strong>more</strong> ways to outfit their character.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you managed to secure one of the NVIDIA backpacks in ARC Raiders.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Skyrim Made Dominic Monaghan's PS3 EXPLODE | Star Players</p>
      </div>
<p>Carofano said Skyrim is a "great game" and the goal in releasing the game in so many places is to help it reach more people "in the best way possible."</p><p>He also discussed bringing Skyrim to Switch 2, saying there is a "whole new generation" of people who might pick up a Switch 2 and "that's the first time they've ever played Skyrim."</p><p>Bethesda previously put Skyrim on the original Switch, so creating a native Switch 2 version was "really an easy development process" and a "pretty quick" job to do, at least compared to Bethesda's traditional development timelines.</p><p>"Making the game takes years and years and years, but bringing it to this new console was a much, much faster process," he said.</p><p>The developer went on to discuss the ways in which Bethesda took advantage of the Switch 2 hardware.</p><p>"A lot of it was really just focusing on taking advantage of the new hardware. We can use DLSS now and get better resolution, better performance, and the game loads faster," he said. "Switch 2 has the Joy-Con 2 controllers that let you use mouse controls, so we added that. A lot of it is really just, 'How do we take advantage of the Switch 2? What can it do? And [how can we] give players the best version of Skyrim for that console?'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIntv_QfQjU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fIntv_QfQjU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Skyrim for Switch 2 launched this week and people quickly discovered numerous issues, including input delay. Bethesda said it is <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/57181" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now investigating reports of performance issues</a>, but there is no timeline or further details for when fixes will be available.</p><p>Before this, Bethesda boss Todd Howard<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/" data-ref-id="1100-6460286"> joked about all the re-releases for Skyrim</a>. He said, "If you want us to stop releasing it, stop buying it." Skyrim was originally released in 2011 for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, before coming to PS4 and Xbox One in 2016, then Nintendo Switch in 2017, and then PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2021. The Switch 2 edition launched on December 9.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who already own the Anniversary Edition on the original Switch, the Switch 2 upgrade for Skyrim is available for free. Those who don't already own any version of Skyrim on Switch can buy it on Switch 2 for $60. Owners of the non-Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Switch can upgrade to the Anniversary Edition for $20 and then receive the Switch 2 version for free. The Anniversary Edition includes the base game and its three official expansions, as well as access to Creation Club content made by players.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyrim has sold more than 60 million copies and ranks as one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">top 10 best-selling games of all time</a>. Its enduring appeal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-lead-designer-reacts-to-games-enduring-appeal-what-the-hell/1100-6535441/" data-ref-id="1100-6535441">even surprised Skyrim's lead designer</a>, who recently said he expected some other game to eclipse it in the years following its release. Part of the game's enduring popularity comes from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-skyrim-mods/2900-6392/" data-ref-id="2900-6392">Skyrim's vibrant mod scene</a>, where players are always creating new content that can transform the world Bethesda created in surprising ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Bethesda is currently working on Skyrim's sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, which was announced in 2018 but does not have a release date. In November, Howard said the highly anticipated RPG is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">"still a long way off"</a> and that he's "preaching patience" to fans. Howard has previously said he wonders if it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/" data-ref-id="1100-6517168">mistake to announce Elder Scrolls VI so early</a>.</p>

I want a Milky Way, Mr Bond. I'd just like a Milky Way, YEAH YEAH YEAH (Milky Way), Mr Bond.

<p>The video above isn't the trailer the <a href="https://x.com/007">007 Twitter account</a> shared and the yanked earlier today, as spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/">users on ResetEra</a>. It is, however, the first thing which comes to mind when I think of musician Lenny Kravitz, whom the trailer shows lending his face to a First Light villain named Bawma.</p>
<p>Bawma, according to the text of the tweet that's handily been screenshotted by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-leak-reveals-music-star-will-play-new-james-bond-villain-and-youll-never-guess-who-it-is">Ian Games Network</a>, "rose from nothing, broke free, and built his own Kingdom of Aleph." He's "the largest black-market dealer in the Western Hemisphere who's as charismatic as he is unpredictable."</p><p>Bawma shows off this charismatic unpredictability in the trailer by threatening to drop Bond into a pit of female crocodiles. Bond, always thinking with his tadger, ends the trailer by saying "Girls? Of course." Like he's just figured out his life's a big cosmic knob joke. A cosmic knob joke that'll presumably be laughed at again at tonight's Geoff Awards, assuming IO Interactive debut this trailer properly there.</p>
<p>Anyway, shout out to Neil Cicierega for absolutely ruining a bunch of songs for me in the best way possible. Make sure you're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tdyU_gW6WE">bustin</a> into our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">Geoff Awards liveblog</a> today if you fancy watching the show alongside us.</p>

Well, well, well, here comes Geoffers. G-Kay, the awarder of golden PDF badges to videogames, best pal to every celebrity less tasteful than Edward Norton. Gentleman Keighley, with his mindflaying footwear and his hands all lubed up to wangle fresh announcements from the games industry's chapped orifices. But what's this! His trousers are bellowing. He's got something stuffed down them, something that honks and rumbles like an elephant seal, something that yearns to raise the banner of victory over 10 million planets. 
</p>
<p>
Geoff grabs his groin and waddles away desperately, but not fast enough. His backside explodes in a rank gust of Promethium. A terrifying cybernetic face peers from the breach. "FOR THE EMPEROR," it hollers, while Geoff frantically seeks cover behind Evanescense. "FOR THE EMPEROR, PROBABLY! BUT MAYBE ACTUALLY FOR THE REBELLION INSTEAD."
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All of which is my extremely funny way of saying that a new Warhammer 40,000 game may be forthcoming at this year's Geoffening, aka The Game Awards, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">stream here</a>. Specifically, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 40,000 game.</p>
<p>We know from Creative Assembly's 25th series anniversary showcase last week that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creative-assembly-reveal-total-war-medieval-3-while-teasing-a-huge-game-reveal-to-follow">they'll be announcing a sizeable new thing at the annual Keighley Hootenanny</a>. During that previous anniversary showcase, there was also some footage of the developers' new Warcore game development tech, including a shot of a stone house with some filenames next to it. Amongst those filenames redditor Knavbot has found the magic words "40K". See below, via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-total-war-fan-spots-what-looks-like-a-leak-for-creative-assemblys-much-rumored-total-war-warhammer-40000-with-the-game-awards-announcement-just-hours-away">Ian Games</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_base_colour</li>
<li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_material_map</li>
<li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_normal</li>
</ul>
<p>
The spoilsports among you are hastening to point out that "40K" could refer to something else. Perhaps Creative Assembly have invented the first 40K resolution videogame, for example. Perhaps you will need a dedicated fusion reactor to operate your next gaming PC.</p><p>Detractors may also comment that while it's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">rumoured for yonks</a> that Total War is heading to the grim darkness of the far future, there's a parallel rumour which suggests that the next major instalment of the strategy series will take place a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. Back in May last year, a Dualshockers report <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumours-point-to-total-war-star-wars-in-the-works-at-creative-assembly">spoke of a Total War Star Wars game</a>, much to Nic's (RPS in peace) dismay.
</p>
<p>
"Why not both?" ask the terrible, eternally hungry people for whom nothing is ever Total enough. "After all, that Dualshockers report mentions <em>three</em> currently in development Total War games, and we already know about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-medieval-3">Total War: Medieval 3</a>." Sure! Why not make them all 40K resolution games while you're at it. Why not literally remove the eyelids of every Total War artist. Why not stitch them together into a human centipede that exists only to output scintillating high-def images of falling sand grains on Tatooine.
</p>
<p>
For me, the choice of licensed adaptations comes down to which game title I'll have the most fun abbreviating. I quite like "Star Twar", but "TwartyK" is just, so excellent. Might retire now, tbh. Still, you can probably do better. You can also tell me whether you think Creative Assembly have the chops to make a strategy game that's as ranged combat and vehicle-heavy as a Warhammer 40K or Star Wars game would need to be. Also: space battles?!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/meta-ray-ban-gen-1-gets-cleared-out-for-less-than-regular-sunglasses-even-though-theyre-smart-ai-glasses-2000652301</link>
            <guid>1379617</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The iconic Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses have been cool all the way back to Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison in the ’50s, and now 7 decades later, they’re getting a whole new life as advanced tech wearables thanks to Meta. These retro-cool glasses are now 21st Century marvels with speakers, camera, mic, and Meta AI all discreetly built in, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/">they’re also a great limited-time deal at Amazon right now for just $224.</a></p>
<p>There are 10 different models of the Gen 1 Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers available as part of this limited-time deal, in regular and large sizes for men and women, with a variety of frame colors and lenses ranging from clear to transitions to different shades and colors of sunglasses. They’re the top-selling AI glasses in the world, and now you can find out why for $75 less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Tech, But With Style</h2>
<p>Futuristic tech mixed with impeccable classic style is the mashup we need right now, so seeing Meta team up with Ray-Ban rather than create some bizarre-looking goggles or helmet or other such thing is a hugely welcome development. The Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers looks like the regular Wayfarers made legendary by Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise in <em>Risky Business</em>, and the Blues Brothers, but these also take seriously good 12MP photos and 1080p video, which is probably why&nbsp;<em>Popular Mechanics</em> calls them the best AI glasses for social media. To engage the camera, just touch a button on the glasses’ arm, or use a voice command.</p>
<p>(Side note: While the Wayfarers spiked again in popularity when&nbsp;<em>The Blues Brothers</em> came out in 1980, there’s an ongoing debate about whether they both wore Wayfarers, or if Dan Aykroyd’s Elwood actually wore lookalike vintage sunglasses. Either way, they’re indelibly associated with the Wayfarers.)</p>
<p>The Meta AI features are probably the most mindblowing of all. The multimodal AI can translate signs, identify objects, and even look up and give you historical information on something you’re looking at, in real time. It’s all done discreetly — you gain all of the information while to the rest of the world, you’re just a person in Wayfarers. Real-time audio translations from 6 languages and counting are built in, with no Wi-Fi connection necessary.</p>



<h2>Outstanding Audio</h2>
<p>Even without any actual in-ear extension, the custom-built open-ear speakers sound amazing during calls or if you’re listening to music or a podcast. You get immersive sound that doesn’t intrude on the people standing near you, and you can call and text hands-free. The incredible amount of interactivity provided by the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers make them a content creator’s dream, a multitasker’s must-have, and they just look&nbsp;<em>cool</em> no matter which feature you’re using (or none.)</p>
<p>The opportunity to look like James Dean but have hidden tech worthy of James Bond is worth a heck of lot more than just $224, but that’s the Amazon price tag on the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers during this limited-time deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/">Save 25% and grab one of the best and coolest tech wearables available anywhere.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>PlayStation have announced that Killzone content is returning to Helldivers 2, and this time, it’s here to stay. </p>



<p>Back in December 2024, Killzone made its first appearance in Helldivers 2 with two waves of crossover items that included weapons, armor sets, and cosmetics. The developers at Arrowhead have made it clear that they’ve heard the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-killzone-cosmetics-price-backlash-response-from-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan feedback regarding the pricing</a> and that the content will instead be re-released as a Premium Warbond. </p>







<h2 id="h-killzone-themed-premium-warbond-heading-to-helldivers-2">Killzone-Themed Premium Warbond Heading To Helldivers 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The perfect fit for Helldivers 2. Image by PlayStation.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Announced via the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">Pla</a><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ySta</a><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">tion Blog</a>, Arrowhead have confirmed that a fresh batch of Killzone-themed gear is on the way to Helldivers 2. For 1500 Super Credits, players will be able to unlock a Premium Warbond packed with iconic Killzone weapons, armor, and cosmetics—plus a collection of brand-new items that weren’t part of last year’s limited release.</p>



<p>Better still, Arrowhead are rewarding returning players. Anyone who <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-cosmetics-are-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously purchased any Killzone item</a>—even a single piece—will receive the full Killzone Legendary Warbond at no extra cost. All previously owned or gifted items will also be medal-unlocked, meaning players won’t need to spend medals to reclaim them and can instead focus on the new additions.</p>







<p>Here’s how eligibility works, as confirmed by PlayStation.</p>



<ul>
<li>Players who have previously purchased any (even one) of the Killzone items, will have the whole Helldivers 2 x Killzone Legendary Warbond unlocked at no extra cost! Additionally, there is no medal vacuum here! The items previously purchased (and those which were gifted last December) will be medal unlocked. So no need to spend medals on the items you already own!</li>



<li>Players who received the gifted items in December 2024 but didn’t pay for any single item, will have to pay the 1500 Super Credits to unlock the full Legendary Warbond.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Not to worry, if you do pay for the Warbond; the gifted items will also be medal unlocked.</li>



<li>Players joining after the Helldivers 2 x Killzone items left the store in December 2024 can access the Warbond by unlocking it for 1500 SC, and then enjoy redeeming medals on their favorite items just as usual.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Premium Warbond includes every item from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/second-wave-helldivers-2-killzone-2-crossover-content-will-be-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two waves of Killzone X Helldivers 2 content</a>, as well as a list of new items, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>StA-52 Assault Rifle</li>



<li>StA-11 SMG</li>



<li>PLAS-39 Accelerator rifle</li>



<li>AC-1 Dutiful/The Strength In Our Arms cape</li>



<li>AC-2 Obedient/Defender of Our Dream cape</li>



<li>Acclimated Passive</li>



<li>Extrasolar Ash patterns</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re a fan of either franchise, then now’s a great time to hop back into Helldivers 2. Will you be checking out the new Premium Warbond? Share your thoughts in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>. </p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077’s lead writer has stated that the team understood during the game’s pre-production that Night City would be the main antagonist, confirming the age-old fan theory.</p>



<p>The main attraction of Cyberpunk 2077 has always been Night City, which is not only a dense open-world that will keep you engaged the entire journey, but also an all-knowing and all-seeing entity that sells people big dreams, but they always come with massive repercussions. Now, a lead writer has confirmed that Night City is indeed the true villain of Cyberpunk 2077. </p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-always-night-city-versus-everyone-else-in-cyberpunk-2077">It’s Always ‘Night City Versus Everyone Else’ in Cyberpunk 2077</h2>



<p>For some time, players have theorised that Night City is the main character and antagonist in Cyberpunk 2077, and this post on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1aeuz79/v_is_not_the_main_character_my_simple_theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cyberpunkgame</a> explains it quite well. During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/5-years-on-from-cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-reveals-why-making-night-city-the-main-antagonist-created-an-irresistible-rpg-exploring-the-darker-side-of-human-nature-is-exciting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Cyberpunk 2077’s lead writer, Tomasz Marchewka, confirmed, “Quite quickly, during pre-production of Cyberpunk 2077, we realized that Night City is going to be our main antagonist.”</p>



<p>Marchewka acknowledged that some players had caught on quite quickly and asked about it. The game also features other antagonists, such as Arasaka, Adam Smasher, and others. However, it has always been “Night City versus everyone else, even the big guys. So yeah, that’s a cool concept to make the city the main antagonist,” explained the lead writer.</p>



<p>Igor Sarzynski, the cinematic director, also explained why players might find this world so compelling, stating that for him it was always finding the balance between “subtle, personal, human, and emotional elements – things that are fragile and touching and invite compassion – versus what you mention: the danger, the violence.” </p>



<p>“Everything that forces you to put on armor, literal or emotional, and protect yourself, fight for survival. Night City exists right on the edge of those realms, between beauty and bloodshed, and so you’re never bored; you always think that&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;the next dream will come true,” Sarzynski added. </p>







<p>In other news, the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will feature a city that feels like ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-city-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Gone Wrong</a>‘.

                <p dir="ltr">Maybe as a holiday treat, Nintendo has added a new GameCube title for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers out of the blue. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wario-world-review/1900-6030331/">Wario World</a> is now playable for the service on Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Originally released in 2003, Wario World is a 3D platformer that sees the antihero looking for payback after his treasure is stolen and his castle destroyed. Coincidentally, Treasure is the developer behind the GameCube title. The studio is known for Gunstar Heroes, Sin and Punishment, and Ikaruga.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaPq9Z2xgCY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DaPq9Z2xgCY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Wario World brings the GameCube library up to seven titles on Switch 2 for the Expansion Pack tier. What's intriguing about Wario World is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">Nintendo has teased GameCube titles</a> that still aren't out on the service, such as Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Pokemon Colosseum. Meanwhile, Wario World hadn't previously been mentioned. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/luigis-mansion-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-time-for-halloween/1100-6535610/">Luigi's Mansion arrived on the subscription service right before Halloween</a> and was the last addition.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-nintendo-64-platformers-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online/1100-6536837/">Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble will come to the Nintendo 64 library</a> for the Expansion Pack tier on December 17. A Nintendo Switch Online membership costs $20 annually and includes NES, SNES, and Game Boy catalogs. For Wario World and Rayman 2, the Expansion Pack tier is required, costing $50 yearly (and $80 for a family plan). However, just to note, only Switch 2 owners have access to the GameCube library.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We are mere hours away from <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, and just like in previous years, that means there are at least a couple of announcements that have been spoiled right down to the wire. This year, it's IO Interactive accidentally posted a reveal that was almost certainly planned for tonight's show, with a new trailer showcasing one key, but until now, an absent part of 007 First Light - and any major James Bond story - the villain.</p>



<p>The initial post shared by the <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI">official 007 First Light X (formerly Twitter)</a> was quickly taken down, though not before <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/#post-148736176">users on ResetEra</a> were able to capture it and share it far and wide across the internet. Which is how we now know that Bawma, the villain in the James Bond coming-of-agent story in 007 First Light, is played by none other than Lenny Kravitz.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate for IO Interactive that what would have been a pretty solid reveal was shared early accidentally, and surely some poor intern or social media manager at IO Interactive is not having the best day. That said, the early reveal doesn't take away from the fact that 007 First Light appears to be shaping up to be a classic Bond story, through-and-through.</p>



<p>All the way down to Bond being dangled over a pool of some kind of carnivorous animal that the villain keeps as pets. You don't get more Bond than that, and at this point, it seems like all the game's story might be missing is a front shot of James or his love interest (or both) slowly rising from the water after a swim in the ocean and walking onto the beach. </p>



<p>For more on The Game Awards ahead of tonight's show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">you can check out the full list of nominees here</a>, which includes 007 First Light and its nomination for 'Most Anticipated Game.' Not that it'll win next to Grand Theft Auto VI, but it has a nomination all the same. You can also check out a list of every announcement that's been rumoured and/or confirmed to appear at tonight's show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">and all Game Awards information you might need at our full Game Awards hub, here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP 17″ Ryzen 5 Laptop (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) Crashes Nearly 70%, With $199 Worth of Accessories Included for Christmas]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-17-ryzen-5-laptop-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-crashes-nearly-70-with-199-worth-of-accessories-included-for-christmas-2000652297</link>
            <guid>1379566</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptop upgrades can cost a pretty penny, depending on the features you’re after. If you’re a work professional or a student looking to upgrade their everyday machine, you need a model with a good display, a comfortable keyboard, a muscular processor, plus at least 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Most options offering these and more – especially the ones from known brands – sit well over $1,200, but that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6344/">We just spotted the 17-inch HP touchscreen laptop going for just $1,000 at Amazon, after the retailer generously took a whopping 67% off its usual $3,000 tag.</a> Orders placed within a couple of days arrive before Christmas, so you can also consider it as a gift for a loved one. Best of all, the retailer throws in a bunch of useful computer accessories worth almost $200 with your purchase – for absolutely nothing. There are no complicated coupon codes to enter to score the discount or the freebies. Just add the item to your cart, and the offers apply automatically. You’ll also save an additional 5% at checkout, which ultimately brings the overall price down even further. But as you’d expect, discounts this good don’t stick around for long. It’s best to hurry to grab yours, as the price could shoot back up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredible Work and Play Performance</h2>
<p>The roomy 17.3-inch HD+ (1600×900) display offers plenty of space to work and play without feeling limited. It not only pushes vibrant, detailed visuals, but also features an anti-glare coating that makes the overall viewing experience quite comfortable on the eyes. Whether you’re using it out there in the sun or while sitting in a dimly lit room, picture quality stays consistent and balanced. Touch support makes navigation easy. You won’t have to rely on the keypad or the mouse to find your way around things; just use your fingers directly on the screen to pinch, tap, scroll, draw, and even type. Paired with the screen is a spacious, full-sized backlit keyboard. It makes typing long documents easy on the wrists, while the backlight lets you hit goals even after the shadows fall.</p>



<p>The laptop runs on the AMD Ryzen 5 7430U 6-core processor, which is capable of hitting speeds up to 4.3GHz. It’s powerful enough to support you through all your tasks, from those early-morning deadlines to late-night passion projects. There’s a massive 32GB RAM to keep everything (video calls, resource-intensive applications, games) running smoothly; something that makes a huge difference during busy days when you need to handle a bunch of tasks at the same time. The 1TB SSD lets you store all your important files in a single place. You can throw in a ton of videos, high-resolution photos, work documents, research files, and more with ease. Even better, the memory and storage are expandable up to <strong>64GB RAM and 2TB SSD</strong>, respectively, so you can always add more as your needs grow in the future.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as solid. A single charge gets you up to 9 hours of video playback, meaning you can go a full day without plugging it in. Recharging doesn’t take forever either, thanks to HP Fast Charge that juices the laptop from 0 to 50% in just about 45 minutes. Plug it in during a quick lunch break at work, and come back to a machine ready to help you power through the rest of your day.</p>
<p>The accessory kit includes a Redragon mouse, an external CD/DVD drive, and a clean cloth. <strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> also comes pre-installed, so you’re literally getting a machine that’s ready to go right out of the box.</p>
