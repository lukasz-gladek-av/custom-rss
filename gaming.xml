Recently, it seemed like Adult Swim was finally set to deliver with an adaptation five years in the making. The first episode certainly lived up to the hype, then episode two dropped and fans were left scratching their heads at the shocking drop off in animation quality.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194741" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="An Anime That Might Make You Put Your Minecraft Bed Next To Someone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="139" data-playlist="194741,193799,193283" data-current="194741"><div><p>An Anime That Might Make You Put Your Minecraft Bed Next To Someone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194741/194741_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194741/194741_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194741/194741_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194741/194741_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20210.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>After the latest episode of <em>Uzumaki</em>  aired this week, the reactions started rolling in. “The quality drop in episode 2 of <em>Uzumaki</em> is actually embarrassing wow,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AwestruckVox/status/1843144917549535645&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AwestruckVox/status/1843144917549535645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one fan. “My day is ruined...” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/doffylmingo/status/1842817302808707396&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/doffylmingo/status/1842817302808707396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> another.

Out of respect for the hard work we chose C.”</p><p>It seems like maybe the production team was aware the series would be criticized, but maybe not as harshly as the actual reactions ended up being. DeMarco teased that there were particular individuals responsible for the shoddy work, but wouldn’t name who. “I didn’t think the actions of just one or two people should be the reason it never saw the light of day,” he wrote. </p><p>Adult Swim did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>  <em>Uzumaki</em> is about a quiet Japanese village beset by a curse where mysterious spiral shapes begin to take over, creating paranormal effects and corrupting people’s lives and their surroundings. That unique horror premise is a perfect, but also extremely challenging, concept to illustrate in motion. First teased back in 2019, the assumption was that five years meant everything had been meticulously crafted for the four-episode Toonami run this fall. </p><p> “The pandemic completely stopped production on the show for close to a year. It was the single biggest impact,” DeMarco <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/uzumaki-anime-release-date-trailer.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/uzumaki-anime-release-date-trailer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Vulture</em> last month</a></span>. “Our crew was small, so having even a few members and their families getting deathly ill was a huge blow to both the production and our morale. It was very challenging to bring the show back from the dead.” </p><p>But even by that point there was no inkling of any last-minute sacrifices or trade-offs in terms of the full production. Now fans are left to wonder what exactly happened to derail the team’s ambition and whether things will recover in episode three or be equally rough.

<p>2024’s spooky season is officially among us. Gamers alike are sitting down trying to find this year’s scariest game to indulge in on Halloween. So, what horror game will you try playing this Halloween?</p>



<p>Here are the top five best 2024 horror games to play on Halloween. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-5-best-2024-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween">Top 5 Best 2024 Horror Games to Play this Halloween</h2>



<p>Sometimes, playing a good horror game is the best way to get in the spirit of Halloween. That constant anxiety creeping up on you as you turn the corner in a game, expecting some type of creature or demonic spirit to jump out at you, is one of the best feelings Halloween can give us (well, for some).</p>



<p>While there are plenty of horror games out there that have been released over the years, what 2024 horror games are worth playing this Halloween? Here are the top five.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-5-alone-in-the-dark">5. Alone in the Dark</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The popular 1992 horror classic, Alone in the Dark, got a new installment this year. This new take on the original game was an instant hit with horror gaming enthusiasts, as it allows players to solve puzzles while fighting against monsters and navigating through terrifying places.</p>



<p>Not only does the game offer a solid campaign, but David Harbour (from Stranger Things) stars in the game as the main protagonist, Edward Carnby. Seems like the man is beginning to get type-casted as the cop/investigator. </p>



<p>The game currently sells for $59.99 on Steam and all other consoles.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-4-banishers-ghost-of-new-eden">4. Banishers: Ghost of New Eden</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Looking for something a bit more fantastical and expansive this Halloween? The new game, Banishers: Ghost of New Eden, is the perfect horror-adventure game to play. Released back in February 2024, the game has become favored amongst many. </p>



<p>However, despite how big the game may seem, Banishers: Ghost of New Eden is not an open-world game, but more of a semi-open world. The story is linear with many places to explore, but many of the spots have to be unlocked after finishing certain parts of the story.</p>



<p>The game currently sells for $49.99 on Steam and all other consoles.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-3-still-wakes-the-deep">3. Still Wakes the Deep</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Looking for a more traditional horror game that messes with the mind a bit? Still Wakes the Deep fits the bill. Released back in June, this game is a linear title that allows players to navigate a collapsing oil rig just off the coast of Scotland.</p>



<p>The oil rig collapsing, though, is not the main issue, as it is also infested by mutants. Find your comrades and help free them before the rig completely collapses or they are eaten alive by one of the disgusting and terrifying mutants.</p>



<p>The game is currently $34.99 on Steam and all other consoles.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-2-zoochosis">2. Zoochosis</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Zoochosis is easily the most innovative horror project to release in 2024. This indie game puts players in a terrifying zoo that has become invested with mutated animals. Instead of trying to escape the zoo, however, you have to try and administer vaccines to all the animals in an attempt to cure them.</p>



<p>Just try not to become their dinner first.</p>



<p>The game was released just last month (September) and has become a huge hit already with players. It was created in Unreal Engine 5 and is currently only available on Steam for $22.49.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-1-silent-hill-2-remake">1. Silent Hill 2 (Remake)</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>While it may be a remake, Silent Hill 2 is the perfect horror game to play this Halloween. With a 10/10 rating on Steam, the game gives players a brand-new look at the 2001 horror survival title. Players have the chance to, once again, enter the mystical and absolutely horrific world of Silent Hill.</p>



<p>The game not only offers jump scares and more, but it also does a fantastic job of making the player feel extremely lonely while playing. Just make sure to avoid the Pyramid Head monster at all costs. Trust me.</p>



<p>The game is currently available on PlayStation 5 and Steam for $69.99.</p>

		<p>The LittleBigPlanet series is coming to a sad and subdued end, it feels, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/littlebigplanet-3">LittleBigPlanet 3</a> and all the associated DLC are to be delisted from the PlayStation Store on 31st October.</p>
<p>The game will remain playable for anyone that owns the game and has the DLC, but online features have been disabled since the start of 2024, with user generated content inaccessible unless already downloaded and stored on a device.</p>



<p>What’s sad is that it’s bad actors that have ruined the fun of a thoroughly pleasant and beloved series. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/13/littlebigplanet-3-servers-come-back-online-for-ps4-but-ps3-and-ps-vita-game-servers-to-be-shut-down/">The issues started back in 2021</a> when the game servers were hit by what was initially suspected to be a DDoS attack, with intermittent availability over the weeks that followed, as the team maintaining the game sought to implement security fixes. It reached a tipping point when hackers started to leverage their access to display custom error messages on players’ screens with transphobic messages, forcing Sony to take the servers offline while working on a fix. A fix was eventually released for LBP 3 on PS4 specifically and the series’ millions of UGC levels preserved, but the PS3 and handheld versions of the game were lost at that time. Things clearly broke down again this year, and Sony threw in the towel.</p>

<p>It’s not completely the end of the series – Sackboy: A Big Adventure is still for sale – but none of the mainline series of games is available on a current platform and all online servers are offline. There’s no sign or rumours that series creator MediaMolecule will return to LBP, or that Sony intends to partner with a third party like Sumo Digital again.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/games-workshop-announces-new-edition-of-warhammer-underworlds.1004391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-announces-new-edition-of-warhammer-underworlds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new edition of <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> has been announced. This means the skirmish-based spin-off of <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Warhammer Age of Sigmar</a> </em>will experience major changes to its core gameplay. Changes that Games Workshop has been upfront in sharing.</p>
<h2>The Warhammer Underworlds Edition Changes</h2>
<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/qrtynnia/theres-a-new-edition-of-warhammer-underworlds-coming-these-are-the-biggest-rules-changes/">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop illustrates the changes coming in the newest edition of <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-warband-warscroll-screenshot.jpg?itok=RYZ2RHcV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-warband-warscroll-screenshot.jpg?itok=nrOOKgv0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first major change regards your Warband and their Fighter Cards. A new stat has been added called Bounty. This determines how much Glory you gain by killing a certain unit. In addition, decks are universal; any unique abilities a Warband has is defined by their Warband Warscroll.</p>
<p>Among these updated Warscrolls is a new mechanic called Warband Abilities. Some can be activated every round. For example, the Emberwatch has Alone I Stand!, which allows you to push a friendly fighter one hex. Others are potent, once-per-battle abilities with various trigger conditions.</p>
<p>This includes the Emberwatch's Deadly Sentries ability. After your unit picks a weapon as part of an attack you can choose to give it +1 Range for that attack.</p>
<p>Movement in <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> will remain unchanged in this new edition. But alongside the Move, Attack, Charge, and Guard action, there is now the Focus action.</p>
<p>Focus is designed to give you an out if you don't have a card to play, referred to as "bricked hands" by the community. If you Focus, you discard your entire hand and draw a replacement for each card discarded, and an additional Power card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-underdog-card-artwork.jpg?itok=DZ0DOxU2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-underdog-card-artwork.jpg?itok=W1K_ZnIL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's a strong move with a cost. If you use it too often, you won't have enough Glory to score or Power Cards to play.</p>
<p>For fans of the latest edition of <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em>, the Underdog mechanic will be coming to <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em>.&nbsp; The Underdog is whoever has fewer Glory. Underdogs win ties during first turn roll-offs in battle rounds two and three, and gains access to new abilities like more healing rolls are being able to redeploy fighters without using the Move action.</p>
<p>Lastly, a game of Warhammer Underworlds are fought only one board. According to Games Workshop, this was done to make combat faster and streamline game set-up. The new game boards will be made more compact with streamlined game language.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-cross-platform/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-diablo-4-cross-platform-or-are-you-limited-to-your-system%E2%80%99s-players.1004385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-cross-platform/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With the immense and seemingly continuously rising popularity of Diablo 4, especially after the launch of Vessel of Hatred and the massive 2.0 launch, along with the ARPG being available on most modern platforms, the gaming community surrounding the title continues expanding. But even so, sometimes you want to play with a friend or family member who doesn’t own the same system as you. Thankfully, you have options. So, is Diablo 4 cross-platform? How about cross-progression? Heck, let’s even dive in and figure out if the ARPG offers couch co-op!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-diablo-4-cross-platform">Can You Play Diablo 4 Cross-Platform?</h2>



<p>Diablo 4 does offer full cross-platform functionality. If you play on PC, you can connect with those on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S to form a dungeon party or tackle a world boss together without ruining the experience whatsoever. There’s minimal to zero lag during gameplay, and I’ve personally experienced zero issues playing with others between PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-diablo-4-support-cross-progression">Does Diablo 4 Support Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>Diablo 4 requires you to connect to the game servers via Battle.net; all of your progress is saved in the cloud, allowing you to progress on the same character and even transfer cosmetics bought via the in-game shop to any system you play on. If you purchase the game on PC, as many of us did, and then decide to download the Xbox Game Pass version on Xbox Series X|S, you’ll find your characters waiting for you, ready to dive back into Sanctuary!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-diablo-4-couch-co-op">Is Diablo 4 Couch Co-op?</h2>



<p>There’s good and bad news regarding couch co-op in Diablo 4. It’s available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One, but not on PC. For whatever reason, the studio could not get split-screen multiplayer functional on the PC version of Diablo 4, but they managed two-player couch co-op on consoles. Numerous bugs and glitches on PC prevented the mechanic from working correctly, so we’re missing out.</p>



<p>Where do you play Diablo 4? Let us know in the comments below, or join the discussion on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our official community forums</a>!</p>

<p>Before you jump into the new expansion, Vessel of Hatred, you should <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/before-playing-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tackle a few tasks beforehand</a> to give you the best start!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/accused-switch-modder-represents-himself-as-nintendo-lawsuit-moves-forward/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When faced with a legal threat from Nintendo, most alleged <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/nintendo-issues-cease-and-desist-for-switch-modchip-installation-service/">modders</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/former-rom-site-owner-must-pay-2-1-million-to-nintendo/">ROM pirates</a>, and/or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/switch-emulator-ryujinx-shuts-down-development-after-contact-by-nintendo/">emulator makers</a> will simply <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/nintendo-sends-cease-and-desist-notice-to-pokemon-rom-hacker/">give in to a cease-and-desist demand</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/switch-emulator-makers-agree-to-pay-2-4-million-to-settle-nintendo-lawsuit/">reach an out of court settlement</a>, or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/hacker-will-pay-nintendo-4-5-million-in-team-xecuter-plea-bargain/">plead guilty</a> rather than hiring legal representation for what could be a lengthy, costly trial. Then there's Ryan Daly, alleged owner of ModdedHardware.com,&nbsp;who has apparently decided to represent himself as a recent lawsuit brought against him by the Switch maker moves forward.</p>
<p>Nintendo says it first approached Daly in March about his site (currently password-protected but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240504061109/https://www.moddedhardware.com/">archived here</a>) and its sales of modded Switch consoles, console modding services, and piracy-enabling devices such as the MIG Switch card that were pre-installed with popular Nintendo games. At that time, Daly agreed "both verbally and in signed writing" to refrain from these infringing sales, according to Nintendo. It was only after months of Daly continuing those sales and largely ignoring further contact from Nintendo that the company says it was forced to file <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/nintendo-modded.pdf">its June lawsuit</a> in a Seattle federal court.</p>
<p>In that initial lawsuit, Nintendo said it "received a communication from a lawyer purporting to represent [Daly]" in June, followed by a message days later that Daly "was in the process of obtaining new counsel." That search for new counsel has seemingly not moved forward, as last week Daly <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/daly-response.pdf">filed a pro se response</a> to Nintendo's allegations, representing himself without any outside legal advice (thanks, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/modded-hardware-defendant-denies-nintendos-copyright-claims-in-court-241006/">TorrentFreak</a>).</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Demon's Souls celebrated its 15-year anniversary on October 6, 2024. Below, we examine how the progenitor of the Soulslike genre forged an uncompromising path for others to follow.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Die-hard From Software fans who've dodge-rolled their way through the fiery crucibles of Elden Ring and the Dark Souls series certainly know a thing or two about the origins of the so-called souls-like genre. Defined by a number of discrete pillars--"bonfire"-style checkpoints that restore a set number of heals, stamina meters, and menacing bosses--this style of game has become increasingly popular in the past 10 years. Moreover, these design tropes have crystallized into hard-and-fast principles that notable games like Lies of P seem to embrace wholeheartedly.</p><p dir="ltr">However, if you look at the first entry in the Souls series, the wildly innovative Demon's Souls, you'll find a game that bucks many notions that these newer games take for granted. Instead, it employs many byzantine and downright hostile design ideas that not only chafe against traditional notions of "fun," but the ideals of frictionless gameplay and player empowerment that have increasingly crept into the souls-like space in recent years. The sharp edges of Demon's Souls (and, to a lesser extent, Dark Souls) are as much a part of the series' success as its satisfying combat and intriguing lore, and it'll be interesting to see if From Soft ever returns to that mindset in the coming years.</p><p dir="ltr">Demon's Souls makes no effort to hide its unyielding nature: Its opening tutorial throws you into an intimidating boss fight against a mammoth foe who (almost certainly) stomps you flat and robs you of half your health bar, with no rematch available anytime soon. Of Demon's Souls' many peculiarities, this distinction between "Human Form" and half-health "Soul Form" is perhaps the best known, its existence serving as a sort of thesis statement for the game as a whole. But as many players learned firsthand when they dived into Bluepoint's 2020 PS5 remake, that's only the beginning.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="601124984" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

tempting to point to the infamous "Character Tendency" and "Level Tendency" systems in Demon's Souls as the ultimate examples of these sharp edges. Ostensibly intended to reflect the player character's moral standing, these two systems fall within a spectrum of "pure white" to "pure black," with many shades in between. Bound by a number of confusing rules that even veterans struggle to remember at times, these two mostly invisible markers have a surprising impact on many aspects of the experience. For example, worlds leaning towards a white tendency have weakened enemies, and you deal more damage to them, whereas blackened enemies hit harder and give you more Souls.</p><p dir="ltr">What's most galling about these dual mechanics is that their effects are not confined to the margins; several of Demon's Souls' best quests, NPCs, and weapons are locked behind Tendency gates and events. This forces you to pay attention to these cryptic indicators and experiment to learn more about them. For example, impassable gates with tempting loot behind them tend to mysteriously disappear at extreme Tendencies, leading to new paths to explore. Each level has a special NPC who appears at both ends of the spectrum in different forms, with distinct rewards for each.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's fair to say that many modern players rely on wiki entries and guides to navigate these unique elements years later, it's important to remember that those who first played Demon's Souls didn't have that option. If you wanted to get the impressively blunt Dragon Bone Smasher that an invader killed you with that one time, a poorly translated Japanese guide might tell you that you need pure white World Tendency in a certain level, but how to get there was a matter of contradictory rumors and innuendo. (For those without the patience to try to figure this out, the original PS3 Demon's Souls occasionally set the World Tendencies a certain way for holidays like Christmas and Halloween, but such opportunities were rare.)</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond Tendency, Demon's Souls' unforgiving nature is sewn into almost every facet of its design, even seemingly minor details. It's the only game in the Souls series to feature an item-encumbrance system, and if you accidentally pick up some loot you don't have room for, you'll have to drop pieces in your inventory to make space--those that are dropped despawn after you leave and can easily be lost forever. (Thankfully for some, this was fixed in the remake.) The game's lengthy levels feature few shortcuts and long boss run-backs, making every death a matter of minutes lost.</p><p dir="ltr">You don't have to look far to find examples of this sort of player hostility in the original Dark Souls. That game's complex Humanity system can be read as a successor to the downright inscrutable Tendency ideas of its predecessor, and the dreaded basilisk's curse you might encounter in the depths of Blighttown cruelly halves your HP. (The original incarnation of this mechanic was even more devious, as the curses could stack, halving your HP again and again to the point where a single swipe from a skeleton could kill you. Naturally, this was eventually patched out.)</p><p dir="ltr">Even Dark Souls 2's confusing Bonfire Ascetic system and limited enemy respawns reflect the deliciously inscrutable and uncaring design ethos of Demon's Souls to an extent, but that's arguably where that approach starts to die out. By contrast, Elden Ring's massive world is sown with secrets to find and lore to analyze, but it rarely challenges the player to truly figure things out for themselves beyond simple environmental puzzles. Yes, From Soft's most recent games are harder than ever, but their vision of difficulty has fundamentally shifted over the years. Where Dark Souls once challenged players to muddle their way through a crumbled world beyond their understanding--including in terms of game mechanics--Elden Ring throws in barrel-rolling light-show superbosses that take hours and hours to master.</p><p dir="ltr">Demon's Souls is not for everyone. Like many innovative games, it sacrifices universal appeal for an experience that is equal parts baffling, endearing, and downright clunky. As the prototype for a distinct style of game that has slowly congealed into its own subgenre, it feels strangely alien to those who have played many souls-likes that follow the seemingly sacred Dark Souls formula. Since From Software has grown in both size and audience over the years, it would seem difficult for the studio to harness the experimental approach that produced its greatest hit. However, when you look at the trajectory of the studio's games, such a shift seems inevitable. It's difficult to imagine a Souls-style game with a bigger world than The Lands Between or a harder boss than the final foe of Shadow of the Erdtree, but you certainly can't stop it from trying. To live up to its legacy as the one of the greatest developers in gaming, From Software's next path will have to be something that's challenging in an entirely new way; and in that way, it will continue the true legacy of Demon's Souls, the game that started it all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/suda51-and-swerys-25d-slasher-parody-hotel-barcelona-delayed-into-next-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Hotel Barcelona, the side-scrolling slasher movie parody from wonderfully oddball designers Goichi "Suda51" Suda and Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro and Swery, has been delayed from 2024 into next year so developer White Owls can "keep polishing it and making it better".
</p>
<p>
Suda51 (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a>, Shadows of the Damned) and Swery (Deadly Premonition, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-good-life">The Good Life</a>) shared a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-hotel-barcelona-a-horror-themed-side-scroller-from-swery-and-suda51">first look at Hotel Barcelona</a> last year, unveiling a game in which renowned serial killers from all over the US descend on the titular Pittsburgh hotel for reasons not entirely clear.
</p>
<p>
Motives probably aren't a priority, however, when dealing with a game whose novice federal marshal protagonist Justine also happens to have an insane serial killer named Dr. Carnival living inside of her. "Will she be able to exterminate all the evil serial killers and escape from this cursed hotel?!," asks its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286600/HOTEL_BARCELONA/">Steam page</a>, "Find out in this 2.5D slasher film parody action game!"

<p>
Justine's journey takes her across seven locations (each inspired by a different horror movie and overseen by its own serial killer boss) packed with enemies she'll need to slaughter in order to remain bathed in blood and increase the power of her skills. And if that wasn't wild enough, each time Justine dies and revives, she'll be fighting alongside a new Slasher Phantom - ghost versions of her previous attempts who'll deal damage and act as decoys.
</p><p>
All this was originally due to arrive this year, but with time running out for a 2024 release, <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/hotel-barcelona-slightly-delayed-maybe-ai-will-port-it-to-switch-1441313/">Gamereactor</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hotel-barcelona-has-been-delayed-to-next-year/">VGC</a>) asked Swery where Hotel Barcelona had got to during the recent IndieDevDay. "Right now," Swery explained, "we're bug checking the game and we want to keep polishing it and making it better. But ideally, we want to release the game in early 2025".
</p>
<p>
Hotel Barcelona is due to release simultaneously on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 whenever it eventually shows up, but a Nintendo version apparently isn't on the cards right now. "In the distant future," Swery joked, "maybe AI will port it to Switch for me".

			<p>WB Games Montreal is reportedly working on a new DC Comics game. A <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/jobs/r000085749/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3_t9JnHabk1U9HUAfChMB_jfoMoBnXSjRgdZkq22JxMrzlVBoK38ifnBU_aem_f7-dwYdH8yYWRm7zPmTy8Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job listing</a> for a Senior Producer was uploaded, with the text saying that they are looking for someone to join "its Game Development team, working on AAA titles set in the DC Comics Universe." However, that part of the text was removed, and it now just talks about working for the WB Games Montreal division of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The entire job description was posted on Reddit, but some of the text has since changed on the official website. A screenshot of the <a href="https://x.com/Jsig212James/status/1843680988733551090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original text was posted on X</a> by a user named James Sigfield.</p>
<p>It was also uploaded to the WB website, and it was also caught on LinkedIn, which described the roles of the job, including helping oversee "all phases and teams of development of a single project, from the concept phase through its release." From the sound of the job description and the responsibilities that they are asking for, it seems as if the project is in very early development.</p>
<p>Whoever gets the job will be asked to create a milestone roadmap, as well as deliver the milestones "from concept to ship" as well as helping to manage the production budget for the title. WB Montreal has made some very well-known games in the DC universe, such as Batman: Arkham Origins as well as the more recent Gotham Knights. 2024 saw the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, but the game received middle-ground reviews from critics but overwhelmingly negative reviews from consumers due to the game being full of bugs and server issues.</p>
<p>Looking at the Wikipedia page for the game studio also suggests that a new DC Comics game is in the works, as it's listed that the game is TBA but that the game is in production using Unreal Engine 5. Whether this is true remains to be seen and likely will not be confirmed until the game is announced or until Warner Bros. makes a statement about the information. However, considering that they scrubbed the text to remove the DC Comics segment from the job description, it seems unlikely that they would publicly come out and provide any information about the Senior Producer role or whether they are actually making a game in the DC Games universe.</p>

I love how Gallica, my fairy companion, sits on my shoulder as I walk through the streets of its fantasy setting. I enjoy reading all the chatter that pops up from the citizens as I make my way from one side of a city to the other. <em>Metaphor </em>isn’t an open-world game, but its towns are still decently sized and take a minute to get around on foot. Sure, you can fast-travel and miss out on all the ambient dialogue, but if you do that, you’re denying yourself one of the greatest simple pleasures of the game: skating around on your sword.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,193583,196578" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Yeah, swords aren’t just for swiping, slashing, and stabbing in <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>. They can also be made into a magical, floating skateboard. Doing so gives you a boost in speed as you traverse the giant cities and small villages of the United Kingdom of Euchronia. But it also gives you some special dialogue from onlookers as you zoom past them. Some will remark in awe as they’ve never seen a sharp blade turn into a skateboard before. Others will choose not to mind their own business and claim that you’re trying to get attention and disrupt the peace. It turns out that being weird and annoying to the youth trying to skateboard is another part of the real world <em>Metaphor</em> manages to capture in its fantasy universe.<br></p><p>While the protagonist of <em>Metaphor </em>can use different weapons depending on which Archetype or class they’re using, the skate-sword is a mainstay when you’re running around civilized areas. This makes some sense, because if you were playing as the Gunner Archetype, skating on a floating crossbow doesn’t sound practical. But I do wish it were possible to skate in some of the wild areas and dungeons you come across throughout <em>Metaphor</em>’s 80 or so hours. Though you of course need your weapon in hand in those areas so you can stab or shoot an enemy as they approach, but it sure would make some of the backtracking you have to do in later dungeons a bit breezier.</p><p>As I reflect on my time with <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, it still strikes me how much Atlus was able to adapt <em>Persona</em>’s formulas but still iterate on them meaningfully when moving to a fantasy setting. While I walked through the alleys and streets of Tokyo in <em>Persona 5</em>, I always felt like my own two feet were enough to get me where I needed to go. But <em>Metaphor</em>’s world feels bigger than these discrete slices of the real ones, and so it’s only natural that we need a new way to move through it. The skate-sword may look a little silly out of context, and maybe more whimsical than fitting for the dark political drama of the rest of the game, but it is one of the biggest quality-of-life changes Atlus could have made for <em>Metaphor</em>. When you play the game on October 11, get in the habit of whipping it out every time you’re in its cities. There’s no drawback, and you’re walking around enough.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>One way to navigate a massive sale like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime's Big Deal Days</a> is to shop for the really cheap stuff like $5 Blu-rays and $10 video games. Another way is to find a deal on something expensive that you've been eyeing for a while, like a top-of-the-line 65-inch OLED TV, and finally take the plunge. As you can probably guess from the headline, this article is about the latter sort of deal--Amazon has major markdowns on Sony Bravia televisions and accompanying sound systems during its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Big Deal Days</a> sales event.
