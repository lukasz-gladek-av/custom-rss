            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo randomly announced a ton of new content coming <a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118">to <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> in a couple of months</a>. That includes new Nintendo crossover items you can purchase from Nook’s Cranny. These will apparently let you play some classic games like <em>Ice Climber</em>. It’s a neat nod to one of the coolest parts of the 2002 <em>Animal Crossing</em> on GameCube, except that this time around it’ll require a paid subscription to access. Boo!</p> <p>It was a neat surprise going about your business in <em>Animal Crossing</em> and randomly discovering a game like<em> Excitebike</em> for the NES. No, it wasn’t just for decoration. You could actually activate it and play Shigeru Miyamoto’s original 1984 racer <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gamecube+animal+crossing+emulator+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=gamecube+animal+crossing+emulator+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIICAIQABgWGB4yCAgDEAAYFhgeMggIBBAAGBYYHjIICAUQABgWGB4yCAgGEAAYFhgeMgoIBxAAGAoYFhgeMggICBAAGBYYHjIICAkQABgWGB7SAQg1OTk2ajBqNKgCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">via a fully-functioning in-game NES emulator</a>. A bunch of other classics were available to collect as well. Some, like <em>Punch-Out!!!</em>, were only available through special codes. Others, like <em>Ice Climber</em>, required special e-reader cards.</p>

 <p>Imagine winning a random raffle or shaking a tree and being blessed with a free copy of the original <em>Donkey Kong.</em>&nbsp;Back in 2002 there was both the novelty of playing one game within another game and the appetite for older games that weren’t otherwise backwards compatible on modern hardware. Maybe your mom buried the NES up in the attic or sold it to help buy the SNES. Maybe <em>Balloon Fight</em> got lost when the kid down the street never gave it back.</p>

 <p>I booted up <em>Animal Crossing</em> so many times&nbsp;<em>just</em> to go back and play <em>Punch-Out!!</em>, which even at the time felt strangely nostalgic (and also a pain on the GameCube controller).</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo crossover items, Lego Items, Zelda items/characters (Tulin, Mineru) and Splatoon items are coming to Animal Crossing: New Horizons. </p> <p>When you purchase Nintendo system items, you can play a game from that system!</p> <p>For NES it's Ice Climbers and for Game Boy it's Dr.… <a href="https://t.co/YtyGCP3Nzo">pic.twitter.com/YtyGCP3Nzo</a></p> <p>— Stealth (@Stealth40k) <a href="https://twitter.com/Stealth40k/status/1983890433668173830?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So it’s a rad idea to bring that feature back for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, but a huge bummer that these games will only work with Switch Online where…you’ve already been able to go and play them for years. It doesn’t even sound like the full suite of NES classics will be injected into <em>Animal Crossing</em> when its free update arrives on January 15.</p>

 <p>Nintendo stresses you’ll only be able to play a “select classic game on each system,” and for the purposes of the trailer at least, it only confirms Famicom, NES, and Game Boy furniture pieces. So you’ll have access to the handheld version of <em>Dr. Mario</em>, but no word on if something like <em>Super Metroid</em> will be available with a possible SNES your Villager can buy from the Nook kids.</p> <p>Why not just make these games free for people who own <em>New Horizons</em>? I have no idea. Got to protect the value proposition of titles that came out over three decades ago and which Nintendo has sold multiple times before across half a dozen different platforms, I guess. Here’s to whichever poor kid accidentally buys <em>Ice Climber</em> in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> next year and gets instructed to input their parents’ credit card information when they try to play it without a subscription.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="08d8e91bb5349"><a title="Pokemon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08d8e91bb5349/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/56527">Famitsu</a>'s weekly software and hardware sales charts have dropped, and the king is still on top, as expected.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> tops the charts for the second week in a row, with the Switch 1 version selling a further 195,849 copies, while the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> shifts a further 71,991. Both pretty big drops from those mammoth numbers last week, but as a reminder, these are only physical sales, and the Switch 2 version comes in a bundle too. So all things considered, It's doing solid.</p>
<p>There was simply no catching Pokémon this week, seeing as both versions sold a combined 267,840 units. But <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has remained steady in third place, with a further 35,176 copies sold this week. That means the Switch 2's launch title is just 35,000 copies shy of reaching the 2 million mark, at least in terms of physical sales in Japan. That's pretty darn good.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59nykuit&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>In terms of other new releases on Nintendo consoles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> has shifted a solid 17,289 units on Switch (and a further 4,596 on PS5) in its first week, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> comes in at seventh with 6,778 sales. Donkey Kong Bananza, however, has slipped out of the top ten for the first time since its release.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of us for now — here's the top ten physical sales in Japan for the week of 20th to 26th October 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>Obviously, with a drop in Pokémon sales comes a drop in Switch 2 sales — but it's still way out in front, selling 65,434 units to get ever closer to that 2.5 million figure. That attach rate for Mario Kart World is <em>nuts</em>.</p>
<p>The three Switch 1 SKUs shifted 25,109, with the OG model actually being outsold by all three PS5 models, though cumulative sales for Sony's current console sit much lower at 10,503 this week.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> out now, it'll be interesting to see those sales in next week's charts and see how that release affects things.</p>

Downloaded more than 45 million times since its launch in November 2022, it has a roster of more than 160 “Nikke,” android soldiers who you take into battle in an effort to reclaim the overworld from a vicious race of aliens called Raptures who forced humanity to flee underground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That conflict comes to a head in this new story event, which will see players face off in a final battle against the evil Rapture Queen. But that’s just scratching the surface of what’s coming in the anniversary update. The other big addition is the new Surface Beta mode, which features large-scale simulation-style battles where you assemble Nikke squads, fight Raptures, collect resources, and capture strongholds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And, of course, it wouldn’t be a major update without new recruitable characters. New SSR characters Nayuta and Liberalio will be recruitable through the normal gacha system, while SSR Chime will be a free anniversary event character. Nayuta and Liberalio will take center stage in the new story content, with Nayuta rallying her Pioneer Squad against the Rapture Queen, who Liberalio reveres as a mother figure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The anniversary event adds a new gacha costume for Red Hood and pass costumes for Crown and Siren. Plus, it’s bringing back a re-run of the powerful Pilgrim characters, letting you choose one of Modernia, Dorothy, or Red Hood as your exclusive event pull. And there will be limited-time challenges like new boss fights, a new Union Raid, Solo Raid, and multiple minigames and events.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With the third anniversary fast approaching, we chatted with game director Yoo HyungSuk. He’s a 15-year veteran of the Korean gaming industry who started his career as a combat planner on MMORPGs. His previous work also includes being the director/planning director for games like Overhit and Lost Ark. He joined Shift Up in 2020, when he was named game director of Goddess of Victory: Nikke. We talked to him about the game’s successful three-year run, how the dev team approached the new anniversary content, their plans for the future, and more.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>According to your livestream, the new anniversary story content leads to what is a "final battle." Could you explain why such a storyline is being launched at this point?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Since launch, Nikke has had a considerable number of stories that are spread in all directions. We realized the need to slowly gather the stories that have branched out over the past three years into a single storyline, and the third anniversary is the starting point of this plan.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Nayuta, the featured character for the third anniversary update, is unique compared to previous Nikke characters. Can you talk about the concept behind the development of this character and the different abilities they have?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> All members of the Pioneer squad are based on classic JRPG parties. Snow White is the heavily armored knight and tanker. Scarlet is the agile swordswoman and DPS. Rapunzel is the priest who heals. That's how it works. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nayuta is the fourth member, so she was designated as the monk who supports. We didn't want her to be stronger than the other three members in combat, so we developed her to focus on utility, which led to the abilities she has now. Her main ability is using her clones to learn massive amounts of information. As a former D.E.E.P. member, she's also familiar with over-technology.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/29/nayuta-1761773266918.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>You’re also introducing a new gameplay mode called Surface Beta to launch alongside the third anniversary. Can you tell us more about it?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> As its name suggests, the Surface Beta content allows players to explore the biggest world in Nikke. To make the experience more immersive, we decided to adopt a simulation-style battle system instead of the existing shooting battle format. We incorporated fun elements across the expansive field, such as uncovering hidden areas and solving puzzles. Mainly, we want players to experience the battles against Lord-class Raptures. As Raptures have basic gimmick patterns based on the surface, it is important to choose the squads' locations wisely. We will also introduce even stronger bosses in the future, so stay tuned for more!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Your dev team has consistently created new minigames throughout Nikke’s three-year run. What factors are usually considered when deciding what type of minigame to develop?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> In major events like this anniversary, minigames are not mini. Given how important this update is, we put more effort into the game mode, with this one featuring a never-before-seen genre with unique visuals and an impressive scale. It's a management simulation-style game where you restore Eden, which was destroyed for a mysterious reason.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/29/surface-beta-1-1761773387145.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Just the fact that we’re here celebrating the three-year anniversary shows how successful the game has been and how it’s maintained a connection with the community. What do you think are the reasons for that success?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> We think our Commanders enjoy unique content and stories that are different from other games. In this age of content overload, providing gameplay, visuals, and stories similar to other titles would be nothing short of boring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of our game have a deep understanding of our content and stories. Since we have to keep delivering excellent content and narratives without disappointing them, we really try to emphasize to the whole development team that they should truly love the game and then it's not just work. We will continue keeping this in mind and work harder to make our game better, so please stay tuned.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Since Nikke first launched, what have been the biggest difficulties you’ve run into and how did you overcome them?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> In the past three years, our biggest problem has been figuring out how to adapt to this fast-changing era and deciding what content and stories we should deliver to bring players for maximum fun. This issue has persisted for three years and will continue into the future. We are game developers, and fun is the core value of any game, so it's only right that we face this challenge and keep bringing more fun and new content to our players. So it's both a joyful and difficult journey.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>That’s an interesting perspective. Do you think needing to adapt to that change has helped keep the dev team engaged? I imagine it can sometimes be difficult working on the same game for years even after release, dealing with complacency or burnout. But do you think having those consistent challenges to overcome helps with that?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Yes, when we set endless goals it's indeed possible to encounter problems like job burnout. Like boxers, we need to constantly compete, prove our ability, and have strong mental resilience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is why, from the very beginning, we've emphasized to the development team that, rather than aiming for zero mistakes, what matters more is learning from the mistakes and growing. After adopting this mindset, we noticed that continuously setting goals actually helps improve the team's focus.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/29/queen-1761773303922.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>You’ve been able to collaborate with some big franchises, from Evangelion to Stellar Blade to Nier: Automata to the recent Resident Evil. What’s the process in deciding who to collaborate with?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Collaborations are decided through various discussions, but recently, we've focused on finding IPs that players who like Nikke will enjoy, even if they're not familiar with it. We designed the Resident Evil minigame with this perspective in mind, and we hope players are having fun with it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Nikke has also shown up at some surprising real-life events, like the San Diego Padres baseball game and on the Hudson River in New York. Will we see Nikke at other real-world events in the future?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Of course! Bringing multifaceted enjoyment that goes beyond the game to our Commanders makes us happy. In particular, seeing Rapi throw the first pitch at Petco Park in San Diego was especially an honor for us. We'll continue to do our best, so please keep watching us.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Speaking of the future, what does Shift Up have planned for Goddess of Victory: Nikke in 2026?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> In 2026, we will continue to work hard to give you fun experiences, both in-game and beyond. We're preparing various events and updates to surprise you, and we're ready to bring more special surprises for the 3.5 and fourth anniversaries. I'm already excited now. In 2026, we also plan to improve the quality of our operations to provide a more stable experience. Hope you all enjoy the game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Since the third anniversary’s story is centered around the “final battle” theme, could you give us a hint about what comes next?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> We hope in 2026 our story could move on to the next stage. We plan to gather the countless stories we've told so far, converge them into one culminating point, and then move forward.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Nikke has built up quite a following of passionate fans around the world in its three years. As we celebrate the anniversary, is there anything you want to say to the players who’ve been on this journey with you?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> This year, we participated in the LA Anime Expo with Cosmograph and had the opportunity to talk to American players in person. Many of them expressed their gratitude, and some even shed tears of excitement upon meeting us. This left a lasting memory in my heart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> For those of us who spend all day in the office, this opportunity to meet players in person is extremely invaluable. Being able to personally feel the love from fans is truly blissful. Although developing the game and providing live service is sometimes hard and exhausting, the support from players pushes us to overcome difficulties and pick ourselves back up over and over again, and come up with more exciting and fun events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Goddess of Victory: Nikke is available to download for free on the game’s <a href="https://nikke-en.com/?pid=MKT&amp;af_click_lookback=517d&amp;c=NA2thANNI&amp;af_adset=PR&amp;af_ad=IGNarticle" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>official website</u></a>, or on the App Store or Google Play.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/theres-a-new-thief-game-coming-out-this-year-though-only-for-vr-devices/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-a-new-thief-game-coming-out-this-year-though-only-for-vr-devices.1339702/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>UK-based studio Maze Theory (which previously made several Doctor Who VR games and Peaky Blinders: The King's Ransom) and publisher Vertigo Games have just announced the release date of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800080/Thief_VR_Legacy_of_Shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thief: Legacy of Shadow</a>, a new stealth action game coming out on December 4. Unfortunately, the game will only be available for virtual reality devices, which still comprise a minuscule portion of the overall gaming industry. That said, if you are a VR aficionado, chances are you already have a PlayStation VR2, Quest 2 or 3, or a Steam VR-compatible headset.</p>



<p>Legacy of Shadow will bring players back to The City eleven years after the 2014 reboot by Eidos Montréal. Just like in previous Thief games, The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the powerful and feared by the oppressed. Its rooftops form a maze above the narrow, winding streets. The City Watch prowls the streets relentlessly, enforcing the iron will of Baron Ulysses Northcrest — a tyrant who crushes any hint of rebellion.</p>



<p>In Thief: Legacy of Shadow, you won't play as Garrett, the protagonist of the franchise's previous entries. Instead, you'll step into the shoes of Magpie, a cunning thief who was orphaned by Northcrest's brutality and then shaped by the streets. Stealing is Magpie's only means of survival. That is, until she uncovers a legendary artefact holding a legacy from the past. That's when she is forced to unravel The City's darkest secrets and expose the sinister conspiracy looming over its very foundation.</p>



<p>The developers have implemented immersive VR-centric game mechanics to allow players to steal, evade and outsmart the forces controlling the city. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players can look forward to pickpocketing guards, prying open hidden compartments, and bypassing locks using tactile VR interactions. Thief: Legacy of Shadow promises players a range of arrows and tools to distract, disable, or eliminate threats through immersive VR archery. Additionally, Maze Theory stated that every heist offers multiple paths and playstyles, allowing players to decide whether to sneak past guards unseen or take them down from the shadows.</p>

			<p>Today, Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that the Call of Duty movie has secured a director and a writer: Peter Berg and Taylor Sheridan. Berg will direct and also co-write alongside Taylor Sheridan.</p>



<p>Berg is known for directing several action thriller movies, including 2007's The Kingdom, 2013's Lone Survivor, and 2018's Mile 22. Sheridan, on the other hand, is primarily known as the creator of the Yellowstone franchise (as well as Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King, and Lioness), but he also wrote the two Sicario movies. Berg and Sheridan worked together on Hell or High Water, the acclaimed 2016 crime drama film that garnered four Academy Award nominations.</p>



<p>Presumably, the news means the Call of Duty movie adaptation is being fast-tracked. That is because the rights were picked up by Paramount, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-movie-in-the-works-paramount-skydance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as confirmed last month</a>, and Sheridan's time with Paramount will come to an end in 2028. From January 1, 2029, he will be busy working on film and TV shows for NBCUniversal as part of a five-year deal. Still, there is no official news on casting yet, so it may be a while before we hear who Berg and Sheridan have in mind for their story. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Call of Duty is preparing to launch Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on November 14</a>. The game features a story campaign that picks up the narrative thread of Black Ops 2. Set in 2035, the story will follow JSOC Commander David 'Section' Mason (played by actor Milo Ventimiglia) and his Specter One team as they investigate the return of the deceased Nicaraguan terrorist Raúl Menéndez, who threatens to 'burn the world down' in three days. Specter One also includes operatives Mike Harper (Michael Rooker), Eric Samuels (John Eric Bentley), and Leilani '50/50' Tupuola (Frankie Adams), as well as Colonel Troy Marshall (Y'lan Noel), who oversees JSOC's Tier 1 operations. Also involved in the Menendez investigation is 'The Guild', a former criminal organisation turned technology corporation, led by its CEO Emma Kagan (Kiernan Shipka).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Activision has officially announced its plans to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. It will be written and directed by<em> Friday Night Lights</em> creator Peter Berg with some writing help from <em>Yellowstone’s</em> creator Taylor Sheridan. No release date was shared.</p> <p>On October 30, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/">following an initial report from <em>Deadline</em></a>, Paramount and Activision confirmed that after signing a deal in <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-activision-2000622362">September to work together</a> on a future <em>Call of Duty</em> movie, the companies have settled on a director for the live-action war movie based on the popular first-person shooter franchise. Peter Berg is directing, writing, and producing the <em>Call of Duty</em> movie through his studio Film 47. Berg’s past work includes films like <i>Lone Survivor</i>,&nbsp;<i>Deepwater Horizon</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Patriots Day.&nbsp;</i>Taylor Sheridan is co-writing the movie and will help produce it. In recent years, Sheridan has become one of the biggest names in TV, creating shows like <em>Yellowstone</em>, <em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>, and <em>Tulsa King</em> for Paramount’s streaming platform.</p>

 <p>No plot details were shared in a press release announcing the<em> Call of Duty</em> movie’s director and writers, but Paramount did claim that the live-action film will be “designed to thrill its massive global fan base by delivering on the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series, while boldly expanding the franchise to entirely new audiences.” In other words, Paramount claims its new <em>Call of Duty</em> movie will be good and everyone will love it.</p> <p>Paramount likely sees Berg as a perfect fit for this project, as he has a history of making gritty action and war movies. And teaming him up with Sheridan makes sense as the two are friends in real life and have worked together before on movies like <em>Hell or High Water.&nbsp;</em>No casting announcements were made by Paramount, but considering Berg has used Mark Wahlberg in five different movies, it seems at least quite possible that the actor (who previously portrayed Max Payne) will be involved in the upcoming <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. Well, assuming it gets made. Activision has been trying and failing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty#Films">a decade now to make a <em>CoD</em> movie</a>. But maybe this time…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Peak developer has announced that a new biome, called ‘Roots’, will be arriving on November 5, 2025. </p>



<p>Landfall and Aggro Crab’s co-op physics-based climbing title, Peak, has been a major success since its release. The title had already approached the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-sold-nearly-2-million-copies-last-week-during-steam-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million sales mark</a> a few months ago, thanks to a boost in sales from Steam. Now, the developers are introducing a new biome to provide additional content for players. </p>



<h2 id="h-peak-s-next-biome-is-going-to-be-forest-themed">Peak’s Next Biome is Going to be Forest-Themed</h2>



<p>Announced through a new update on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3527290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the next Peak biome has been named Roots, and it evokes a truly foresty vibe. In the trailer, we see two characters hiding atop a tree trunk, with one character sliding in while holding a vine. As the duo seems to be planning their next move, one of the characters is abducted by a spider, and the teaser ends at that moment, revealing the November 5 release date. Check out the teaser for Peak’s Roots biome below: </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The last biome added was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peaks-first-major-update-adds-a-new-biome-items-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mesa</a>, which featured sandy terrain and massive mountains. This time, it seems like players will be scaling massive tree trunks rather than mountains and hills. Similar to Mesa, Roots might take over on its arrivals and then be rotated randomly with Mesa and Alpine; however, developers have not confirmed these plans. Moreover, players can also expect new items to keep them safe, new resources to make climbing each other, and new obstacles to make their lives more difficult. </p>



<p>In other news, Peak developers announced a brand-new co-op arcade racing game this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crashout Crew</a>, and its demo is now available.

		<p>Maze Theory has announced that Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows will be launching on December 4th, and the studio has released two gameplay videos. One shows Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows running on PSVR 2, while the other shows it running on Meta Quest. It is the same sequence for both, but if you want to compare you can watch both videos below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow - Gameplay #2 Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7QdiMNE_dM8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow Meta Quest Gameplay | Coming Dec 4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmTzk7-zT_0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow says,&nbsp;<em>“The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the tyrant Lord Ulysses Northcrest. You are Magpie, a cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest’s brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive. That is until you uncover something greater: a legendary artifact holding a legacy from the past. Use immersive VR mechanics to steal, evade, and outsmart the forces controlling The City. Unravel its darkest secrets and expose a sinister conspiracy that looms over its very foundation.”</em></p>
<p>In a blog post on the PlayStation blog website Steven Gallagher (Creative Director at Eidos-Montréal), that this was not the first attempt at doing a Thief game in VR. He said, <em>“Towards the end of Thief (2014), Eidos-Montréal tried creating their own playable VR demo as part of Sony’s Project Morpheus, the first iteration of PlayStation VR”, Steven reveals. “Unfortunately, we weren’t particularly experienced in making VR back then, so the overall product ended up being a bit hard to play.”</em></p>

<p>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow will feature non-linear levels so players have quite a lot of freedom in how to tackle the scenarios they find themselves in. Stealth and sneakily taking things are the main ways of success as combat is not going to be your strong point. Players will need to carefully plan routes and actions to pull of the heists properly.</p>

<p>And that fps might explain why</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="f94d289e8ff53"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2 Price" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f94d289e8ff53/animal-crossing-switch-2-price.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The prices have been revealed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and its upgrade pack, and they are slightly lower than you might have expected.</p>
<p>As listed on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950861.html">Switch eShop</a>, the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is now available to pre-order for <strong>£54.99 / $64.99</strong>, while the upgrade pack is a measly <strong>£4.19 / $4.99</strong>. Just in case the headline wasn't enough of a giveaway, that's the cheapest Switch 2 Edition we've seen from Nintendo.</p>
<p>For reference, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> set you back £58.99 / $69.99 for the Switch 2 Edition or £7.99 / $9.99 for the upgrade path. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> were £66.99 / $79.99 or £16.99 / $19.99 on new hardware, and while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s upgrades were available for free to NSO subscribers, those who weren't signed up had to pay £66.99 / $79.99 or £7.99 / $9.99 for the full next gen experience.</p>
<p>In short, Animal Crossing is a fair bit cheaper than we would have initially expected. But then, when we think about it, perhaps we should have expected exactly this. ACNH makes for a nice Switch 2 package, with Mouse Mode integration, improved resolutions and GameChat features to boot, but the whole thing feels a little slight compared to other S2 upgrades, no?</p>
<p>The frame rate, for example, remains at 30fps — the first Switch 2 Edition to not contain a boost in this department. There's a fresh Megaphone item, but almost all of the new content is tied to the ver. 3.0 update, which is coming to Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2. Compare that to Kirby or Mario Party, where the upgrades contained new modes and levels, and the reduced price makes a little more sense.</p>
<p>So, are we pleased that New Horizons isn't quite as expensive as the NS2 Editions that have come before it? Yes we are. But can we see why? Hmmm, probably.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hyperkin-the-competitor-controller-xbox-ps5-dualsense-review-price-2000640167</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-new-controller-is-really-good-but-broke-my-brain.1339642/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last month, I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://kotaku.com/hyperkin-x91-retro-controller-review-past-imperfect-1793539025">Hyperkin</a>‘s new Competitor controller. This wired gamepad is an officially licensed Xbox controller that is designed to look and feel like a PlayStation 5 controller. And it’s a great controller, but holy crap does it break my brain when I use it.</p> <p>Out now, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-controller-ps5-hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-price-1851733419">Hyperkin’s new Competitor controller costs $50</a> and is a damn fine gamepad. It features super-smooth and responsive Hall Effect joysticks, so stick drift shouldn’t be a problem anytime soon, and it has Xbox-like Impulse Triggers that rumble as you’d expect. This wired controller is incredibly well built and feels great to use. Heck, it feels really good just to hold. It’s the kind of gamepad that makes you want to play something when you pick it up. Buttons are responsive, too, though I’m not a huge fan of the menu and view buttons. They’re too slim in profile and can be easy to miss when first using the controller and blindly sliding your thumbs around.</p>

 <p>The Competitor sports some extras that a standard Xbox gamepad lacks, like two back buttons located on the rear of the gamepad’s long, textured grips. These can be programmed in supporting games, letting you assign reload or jump or other actions to these extra inputs. The back buttons can also be locked so you don’t accidentally use them, a feature I appreciate as I don’t normally engage with back paddles.</p>

 <p>The big difference between this and most other Xbox controllers is that it’s built to feel like a PS5 DualSense. The sticks are symmetrical, the d-pad feels ripped right off a Dualsense, and even the shape is a close-to-perfect match for Sony’s controller. If you’re someone who is more comfortable using a PlayStation controller, but you also own an Xbox Series X/S, the Competitor is designed specifically for you.</p>

 <h2>Plays great, feels weird</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640206"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640206"><em>The Hyperkin Competitor (black and white) next to my PS5 gamepad (black) and my trippy-looking Xbox controller.</em> ©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Overall, this is a fantastic controller that worked perfectly on my PC as well as my Xbox Series X. But actually using this controller to play games broke my brain. I didn’t realize until I started playing around with the Competitor how hardwired my brain is when it comes to controllers.</p>

 <p>Holding this thing, my brain wants to treat it like a PlayStation controller, yet the Xbox button prompts don’t match up with what my brain <em>thinks</em> I’m holding. I’d go to press the DualSense’s touchpad to open a menu and find nothing but barren plastic. It was like rubbing my stomach while tapping my head with a different hand. I could use the Competitor, but only if I thought about it, and even then, I’d make mistakes.</p> <p>I imagine for folks who prefer PlayStation controllers, this won’t be a problem. They’ll plug this into their Xbox and never look back. But as someone who hops between Xbox and PlayStation a lot, this controller really screwed with me. That’s not the controller’s fault. That’s my brain being weird. For most people, this won’t be a problem. And for $50, the Competitor is a solid, well-made Xbox or PC controller that will likely last you years if you take care of it.</p>

<p>Developer Heart Machine has laid off more employees, just weeks before the launch of its next game. According to a number of now former employees, the studio behind Hyper Light Breaker and the upcoming Possessor(s) has let them go ahead of the latter’s November 11th launch.</p>



<p>Based on social media posts, the layoffs took place on October 28 and 29. </p>



<p><strong>“I just wanted to post, I’m laid off,”</strong> said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/burnrate.bsky.social/post/3m4bqa3s5is26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one impacted employee</a>. <strong>“Just shouting into the void of the internet! It was a beautiful and wonderful team of people to work with at HM.”</strong></p>



<p>Another said that their time with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mllepilgrim.bsky.social/post/3m4c2kazjfk2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company will end</a> after Possessor(s) launches while Community and PR Manager Yiyi Zhang actually posted a video about the cuts.</p>



<p><strong>“Heart Machine has just laid off a bunch more people, effective immediately,”</strong> she said. <strong>“And by the time&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>&nbsp;comes out on November 11, I don’t know if anyone who worked on the game will even be at the company anymore. That’s game dev.”</strong></p>



<p>The latest round of layoffs comes just two weeks after Heart Machine said it was letting go of staff and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyper-light-breaker-developers-ending-development-and-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winding down development </a>of Hyper Light Breaker.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Heart Machine for clarification on the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokémon Legends Z-A Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Previously, the expectation was that you could only earn one Mega Stone for one of the three aforementioned Pokemon per season. The first season for Pokémon Legends: Z-A featured Greninjite as the reward for reaching rank K (the game starts at rank Z and tops at A).</p><p>But with the second season starting on Wednesday, November 5, at 10 PM PT/1 AM ET, those who missed getting Greninja's Mega Stone can win it by only leveling up once to rank Y, and Delphoxite will be rewarded at the lower rank of S. That's eight ranks lower than the prior season's requirement.</p><p>Should subsequent seasons follow this model, expect Chesnaughtite to be the Season 3 reward. <a href="https://plza-news.pokemon-home.com/en/page/10.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Pokemon Company also confirmed on its website</a> that the game will adjust points awarded and increase battle rewards after matches.</p><p>It's not a perfect solution, as players will still be required to participate in online matches (which requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription) to obtain these Mega Stones that could have just been part of the base game.</p><p>Additionally, a <a href="https://plza-news.pokemon-home.com/en/page/9.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch scheduled for some time in November</a> will address two issues that affect progression in the story. One prevents players from obtaining or catching any new Pokemon if their storage boxes are full before a certain story mission, and another is a glitch that can occur when the game transitions between day and night.</p><p>These changes and fixes to Pokemon Legends: Z-A will come after a largely successful launch for the game, which had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-the-biggest-physical-game-launch-in-years-in-us/1100-6535737/" data-ref-id="1100-6535737">massive launch in retailers</a>. The monster-catching game is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-paid-dlc-and-two-shocking-new-mega-evolutions/1100-6534700/" data-ref-id="1100-6534700">getting paid DLC</a> that will include some new Mega Evolutions.</p>

		<p>Team Peak has revealed that next week on November 5th it will be updating Peak and adding a new biome for players. That biome has been called Roots and from the brief teaser it looks like there will be tree climbing involved, and possibly spiders grabbing players. You can check out the short look at the Roots biome in the teaser below.</p>

			<p>While EA is all-in on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> right now after it had a massive launch at the beginning of October and earlier this week launched its battle royale mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Battlefield REDSEC</a>, Respawn is still chugging away at Apex Legends, with its 27th season set to arrive next week, titled 'Amped.'</p>



<p>The new season arrives with a refresh to one of the game's more popular maps, Olympus, and buffs for a few Legends, specifically Valkyrie, Rampart, and Horizon. This season also adds new mechanics that'll make the game even faster than it already is, with a new mantle boost giving players a speed boost on wall-bounces and mantling over ledges.</p>



<p>A new gameplay trailer shows off the new mantle mechanics while featuring the aforementioned legends, and of course, the new refresh for Olympus, titled Olympus: Rising, is also heavily showcased.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Apex Legends: Amped Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UkLtbMz5uz8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding buffs for Valkyrie, her VTOL jets are getting a speed boost, while her missile swarm no longer does any self-damage, nor does it have height restrictions. It also scans enemies hit with the swarrm and places a cooldown on movement passive abilities. Her Skyward Dive also has a shorter takeoff time.</p>



<p>For Rampart, her Amped Cover walls gain health with Evo increases and even include a roof. For Horizon, her Gravity Lift cooldown time has been reduced, while her Black Hole ability now gains even more health.</p>



<p>For all legends, the mantle boost gives players a speed boost for wall and ledge bounces, and the Trident now has improved collision and its own dedicated health bar.</p>



<p>In all the hullabaloo of Battlefield 6, it's easy to lose Apex Legends in the mix. That said, it's consistently stayed above <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172470/charts/#1y">150K concurrent players on Steam this year</a>, only dipping below that figure a handful of times. There's no denying that it's still popular, and its longevity is not to be dismissed, as few live service games make it to their 27th season. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Hardware Revenue Still in Freefall, Microsoft Reveals]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has released its first-quarter fiscal results for the 2025-26 financial year, and Xbox consoles appear to be continuing their sales freefall, although "content and services" revenue is up.</p>

<p>In the company's latest <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/more-personal-computing-performance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial release</a>, Microsoft says its Xbox hardware revenue has dropped by 29% when compared to the same period last year, and given that Xbox hardware sales have been in decline for a while now, that's not good news for the gaming division.</p>

<p>There's a silver lining for Microsoft, though, albeit a very small one; content and services revenue, which includes the company's Game Pass service as well as gaming-related software, increased by (an admittedly paltry) 1%, driven by "growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=Nf1aQZo1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=KeapOShe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass continues to grow, albeit slowly.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the first quarter of Microsoft's fiscal year covers the period between June and September, so it doesn't take into account the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">controversial Game Pass changes</a> introduced earlier this month, which saw the price of top tier Ultimate jump to $30 per month.</p>

<p>The data also won't include major Xbox releases for the end of the year, like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, the latter of which will almost certainly boost sales in the coming second quarter.</p>

<p>Still, Xbox's continuing console woes don't appear to be deterring the company from continuing to pursue hardware development, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-console-hardware-rumors" rel="nofollow">at least not officially</a>; it's been confirmed that there will be a next-generation Xbox console, and that it's being developed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">in conjunction with tech company AMD</a>.</p>

<p>Despite that, Xbox is currently chasing a multi-platform strategy, with major releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5" rel="nofollow">Halo</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War</a>&nbsp;</em>no longer confined to Xbox consoles. That's unlikely to change, even when Xbox does eventually release its next machine.</p>




<p>This data also doesn't take into account the newly-released ROG Xbox Ally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rog-xbox-ally-release-date" rel="nofollow">handhelds</a>, although whether they'll be enough to tip the scales and reverse the company's woeful hardware performance is unclear.</p>

<p>Things are looking a little rosier for Microsoft as a whole, however; the software giant <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2026-q1/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> a revenue increase of 18%, which I'm sure will soothe the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">thousands of employees who lost their jobs</a> during the company's latest round of layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Chief Rebel and publisher Arc Games have revealed The Haunting of Stronghold, the first seasonal event for dungeoneering MMO&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>, and it brings spooky cosmetics and more through November.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, The Haunting of Stronghold is&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>'s first seasonal event, and it'll be available in-game from now until November 13th, transforming the game's Stronghold hub into "a haunted wonderland".</p>

<p>You can look forward to "hauntingly beautiful hero cosmetics" exclusive to this season, as well as "spooky new visual elements" to enjoy in the Stronghold, an "otherworldly" rework of&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>'s main hub theme, and new audio elements to celebrate spooky season.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-the-haunting-of-stronghold-event-hub.jpg?itok=EY-vwW56 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-the-haunting-of-stronghold-event-hub.jpg?itok=78tWoBQF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fellowship</em>'s Stronghold is getting decked out in spooky accouterments for Halloween.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as cosmetics and a newly-decorated hub, you can also look forward to new mounts courtesy of the Caretaker of Fallen Heroes vendor, who will give you "plenty of treats" appropriate to the season.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>, Chief Rebel describes it as a "multiplayer online dungeon adventure" that features "endlessly scaling dungeon runs". It's essentially&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft</em>, but if everything except the dungeons was cut out or scaled back.</p>

<p><em>Fellowship</em>'s dungeons feature "an emphasis on skill, co-operation, and strategy" for boss battles, so you'll need to work together with your team as a unit if you want to surmount the game's many challenges.</p>

<p>Chief Rebel and Arc Games promise a "large pool of tank, healer, and DPS roles", each of which has "unique kits" to help you balance your team of four. Each run will also award you and your team with loot, and tackling tougher dungeons will grant better rewards. You know how this works.</p>




<p>You can check out <i>Fellowship&nbsp;</i>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fellowship-preview-familiar-yet-fresh-take-on-mmo-dungeons" rel="nofollow">our very own Austin's preview here</a> to find out what he thought of this new take on MMO dungeon-delving gameplay.</p>
