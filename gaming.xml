But now, cryptic posts on social media hint that the publication may make a return.</p><p>On Bluesky, the <em>Game Informer</em> account, which had not posted since July of last year, returned to life with a short video featuring the publication’s farewell message. At the bottom of the screen, code appears with the words “Continue” as though it were an arcade game asking if you wanted to put in more quarters to keep playing. The screen then flashes to black with a date, March 25th, suggesting a launch or announcement next week.</p><p>At the same time, several former <em>Game Informer</em> staff, including director Brian Shea, shared the post, strengthening the idea the magazine is on its way back while also icing the fear that GameStop was somehow reviving the publication without the staff the company laid off in August. Additionally, former staff members posted videos of a “continue” screen with a copy of <em>Game Informer</em> in the background, with the animation moving the cursor onto “yes.” Taken together, the teasers suggest <em>Game Informer</em> is coming back with its former staff returning to lead the publication.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to GameStop and former staff at <em>Game Informer</em> to confirm the news. In an email, Shea said that he can’t comment at this time but encouraged checking out the social media posts of his former colleagues. With the continued shrinking of digital media putting thousands of journalists out of work, especially in video games, it’s incredibly rare that something good happens. While we don’t quite know what form this announcement will take on March 25th, I think we can tentatively say, <em>Game Informer</em>’s getting the band back together.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's been a billion years since I played a proper new Front Mission game, and I'm depressed to learn that Square Enix cancelled one in 2022. Titled Front Mission 2089: Borderscape and developed by BlackJack Studio, it was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/04/front-mission-2089-borderscape-announced-for-ios-android">announced</a> for release on iOS and Android but, who knows, might have clanked and rumbled onto PC, the place all good mobile games go when they die. Alas, Square Enix shut the project down a few months after reveal. Now, they're suing BlackJack for releasing a new game that allegedly makes use of leftover parts from the Front Mission contract.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/542570/square-enix-front-mission-mecharashi-lawsuit">Polygon</a>, BlackJack Studio released a game called Metal Storm, or Mecharashi, in October 2024. Square Enix claim that BlackJack (known in the lawsuit as HK Ten Tree) developed it "using materials created pursuant" to their old Front Mission licensing agreement for Borderscape. 
</p>
<p>
Mecharashi was only ever released in China and Japan, but does have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446920/Mecharashi/">an English language Steam page</a>, which describes it as a "mecha-themed tactical turn-based game" that uses "a Front Mission-style combat system, where you can assemble mechas however you want, equip a wide selection of weapons, and choose your favorite pilots to engage in battle." The trailer certainly looks rather Front Missionary. Square Enix have sent a bunch of DMCA takedowns to get the game yanked from storefronts. It's back on Steam as of this writing thanks to a counter-claim.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix's lawsuit has been filed in both a US and a Japanese court, and includes side-by-side comparisons of Mecharashi and the unreleased Front Mission 2089: Borderscape - 11 pages of them. Find some examples below. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/1(8).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Polygon / Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The Final Fantasy publishers argue that the game can't be released in its current state because it makes use of "game mechanics, visual designs, and other protected content" from the abandoned Front Mission collaboration. They want BlackJack to both remove said infringing material and cough up $150,000 per infringement. 
</p>
<p>
Being neither alleged infringer nor self-described infringed-upon, I will conclude only by saying that I think those mech designs are quite nice. Softer-looking and warmer of hue than I remember Front Mission being, though that's me harkening back to the PS1 era when the science of video game anti-aliasing was in its infancy. It reminds me of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phantom-brigade">Phantom Brigade</a>. Ah, I hope we get another tactical mech game soon, once the lawyers have had their fun.

<p>After the skin briefly appeared during the Marvel Rivals early access tests, the beloved Spider-Man Spider-Punk suit is arriving to the store on March 20th. The skin has received a tune-up featuring some rocking new audio effects, meaning you’ll want headphones on to fully appreciate it.</p>



<h2 id="h-spider-punk-2099-arrives-in-marvel-rivals">Spider-Punk 2099 Arrives in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals confirmed today that Spider-Man’s Spider-Punk 2099 suit will make its official debut on March 20th at 2:00 UTC. The skin was one of a few that were playable during the early access tests for the game, such as the President Loki skin just recently officially released. The Spider-Punk character first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man comic series in 2015, and a version of them appeared in the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse film.</p>



<p>The Spider-Punk 2099 suit will, naturally, be sold as a bundle that will include a suit-specific emote and MVP screen. The bundle will likely include a spray and a player card as well. It will hit the store at the same time as another skin that originally debuted during the closed tests: Iron Man’s Steam Power suit. According to Marvel Rivals insider Miller Ross, the bundle will <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1902374511829512306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost</a> 2,200 store units.</p>



<div><article><p><span>🤟 Unleash the Spider-Punk within you! 🎸

“The biggest leap we’ve made in decades? Putting synths back in punk music. And hey, punk was born from the raw strum of a guitar even the future can’t take that away. Wish Hobie could see this…”

Leap into the action as Spider-Man’s </span></p></article></div>



<p>Unlike the Spider-Punk 2099 suit that was playable during the closed test, the soon-to-be-released official version appears to include a handful of electric guitar licks and riffs accompanying Spider-Man’s attacks and abilities. Skins have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major focal point in Marvel Rivals’ ability to generate massive amounts of revenue</a>. However, some fans are already expressing irritation that some heroes are getting favorable treatment. Spider-Man is getting their second Legendary skin, but heroes like Squirrel Girl, Black Panther, Groot, and several others have yet to receive one.</p>



<p>Is Spider-Punk 2099 a must-buy for you when it arrives in Marvel Rivals? Let us know down below and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

We got onto the topic of–what else–politics, and my friend talked about how pervasively the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/02/everything-youve-been-told-is-a-lie-inside-the-wellness-to-facism-pipeline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alt-right</a> has seeped into her sphere, which once felt like a bastion of, if not leftist ideas, at least anti-conservative ones. As the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-robert-f-kennedy-make-america-healthy-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US government </a>starts pushing fringe health theories into the mainstream,&nbsp; two recent TV shows–<em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> and <em>Common Side Effects</em>–also explore this world and its dark side. Both shows make space to think about a world that can sometimes feel too big to wrap your head around, but they also raise the volume on dangerous wellness conspiracies.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81637595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em></a> is a recent Netflix series that intersperses a fictionalized account of fraudulent wellness influencer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Gibson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Belle Gibson</a> with two actually fictional characters: Milla Blake, a woman who believes she cures her cancer through juicing and coffee enemas (and who seems based on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/01/jessica-ainscough-australia-wellness-warrior-dies-cancer-aged-30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real-life influencer</a> who ultimately died of cancer), and a woman with breast cancer named Lucy who becomes a fan of Belle’s work.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(The following contains some general spoilers for the plot of </em>Apple Cider Vinegar<em>)</em></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Apple Cider Vinegar | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u2Yj_rmCzhE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Belle falsely claims to have been diagnosed with various cancers that she treats with a diet that ultimately becomes the worldwide phenomenon The Whole Pantry (while I didn’t recognize Belle’s name when I first started the show, I absolutely remembered the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Whole-Pantry/dp/0718180410/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1D-WX9UTLx3UwZlVnLWuEg.BP49G0vtBHSVXaHONBIB5i7ZrbOactWCUwTBGq7BOBQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;qid=1742234285&amp;refinements=p_27%3ABelle+Gibson&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cookbook</a>.). Her fraud comes to light following reporting by Australian newspaper <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/revealed-the-age-stories-that-exposed-belle-gibson-s-lies-20250213-p5lbqj.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Age</a>, which first exposed that donations The Whole Pantry promised to various charities and individuals were never paid; the scrutiny ultimately forced Belle to admit that she had never had cancer.</p><p>The show jumps between multiple stories and timelines in a way that can be a bit confusing (the waters were further muddied for me given my feeling that the main actresses all look a bit alike) but which works to paint a complex picture of the world of wellness influencers. Milla, unlike Belle, earnestly believes that her non-medical cures saved her from having to have her arm amputated. When her cancer returns at the height of her fame, it doesn’t just threaten the media empire she’s built, but her entire sense of herself and her belief in the things she’s devoted her life to.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucy, meanwhile, is just a regular person. Her partner, who is one of the journalists investigating Belle, tries to stand by her through her treatment, but they grow estranged as Lucy’s fascination with Belle draws her deeper into alternative medicine. Unlike Belle and Milla, both of whom financially benefit from their experiences, we see the damage the wellness sphere does to Lucy financially, medically, and interpersonally.</p><p><em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> also shows how its protagonists’ actions affect other people in their lives. When Milla first decides to pursue alternate medicine instead of having her arm amputated, we see her parents struggle between supporting her and wanting her to get the care the doctors recommend. Later in the series, her mother is diagnosed with cancer; Milla insists she eschew traditional medicine. Lucy’s partner is motivated to look into Belle as much by his profession as he is wanting to free Lucy from Belle’s grip. Belle’s partner Clive is in a unique position; he loves Belle and her son, and he also clearly loves the swanky lifestyle her fame affords him. But he struggles as Belle’s story starts to fall apart.&nbsp;</p><p>What I appreciated most about <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> is the way the multiple storylines complicate what might otherwise be another grifter tale in the vein of <a href="https://play.max.com/movie/1d7c48f8-8064-46d7-a3b8-bb7b91fc2056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Inventor</em></a> or <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81008305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Inventing Anna</em></a>. While plenty of wellness gurus are obviously frauds, there are surely more people who are drawn to that space because they honestly believe in what it has to offer, and who become more than just participants because they earnestly want to help people. Through the show’s stories, we see how people value more than just the juices and health outcomes; the wellness world provides a sense of purpose and a narrative for the world that helps people make sense of themselves and their circumstances.</p><p>In their book <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/derek-beres/conspirituality/9781541702981/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Conspirituality</em></a>, Derek Beres, Matthew Remski, and Julian Walker write that “People are drawn to both marginal spiritual communities and conspiracism because 1) they are attracted to the idea of knowing something necessary for survival, 2) that no one else knows, and 3) that they can share with other kindred spirits.” When Milla’s cancer returns, she meets a woman who offers her <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/do-not-use-black-salve-dangerous-and-called-many-names" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black salve</a> for her tumors; the woman tells her she can’t legally sell Milla the salve “because the government are scared of its potential to destroy the big cancer industry.” <em>Conspirituality</em> calls this an “an imagined fall from organic grace… as folk medicines were discredited by the captains of new pharmaceutical industries, and as spiritual rites were disenchanted by academics and bureaucrats.”</p><p>This strand in <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> would be right at home in another recent show, Adult Swim’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/common-side-effects-adult-swim-max-hbo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Common Side Effects</em></a>.That show follows Marshall, who has discovered a mushroom that cures all diseases, and his attempts to evade the government and pharmaceutical companies that want to get their hands on it. In one way, it flips <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em>’s health frauds on their heads–there really <em>is</em> a miracle cure out there “they” want to keep you from, and we see it have real results throughout the show. But unlike <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em>’s characters, Marshall seems to have no desire for riches and fame; he just wants to save humanity with his discovery, while powerful forces try to stop him. He is, in a sense, portrayed as the exact kind of hero so many wellness influencers seem to believe they are, or at least present themselves as.&nbsp;</p><p>Both shows deal with themes that are incredibly relevant today. It is indeed true that government and medical bureaucracy prevent people from getting the care they need and create dehumanizing systems. But the wellness world’s brand of conspiracy often fails to take the <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right aim</a>, inventing a shadow cabal that wants to push drugs and harm people instead of focusing on capitalism’s role in the health care industry. This thread feels especially notable now that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mzk2y41zvo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RFK Jr</a>. runs the Department of Health and Human Services. RFK’s “MAHA” (“Make America Healthy Again”) agenda whiffs of health conspiracies and wellness hacks that would be right at home in both shows’ worlds: vaccine skepticism, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-medical treatments</a> for diseases, and various stances and theories that <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/gay-frogs-and-atrazine-why-the-alt-right-likes-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeal to the alt-right</a>. Some of it might sound good on its face–a hypothetical priority on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze391y17z7o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy food</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-says-government-ignores-chronic-disease-misguided-rcna190042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic diseases</a> <em>would </em>be a good thing, if they weren’t pushed by a guy who <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-health-stances-vaccines-fluoride-raw-milk-rcna180244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drinks raw milk</a>–but leaning into this as a country isn’t going to lead to some kind of wellness utopia; it’s just going to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-279-cases/story?id=119905598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kill people</a> and spread more misinformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> both humanizes and takes aim at this, <em>Common Side Effects</em> seems to revel in it, at least so far (the show’s season isn’t over yet). As games journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/iantothemax.bsky.social/post/3ljbt6imz3s2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ian Walker</a> pointed out, “It's just a mysterious mushroom from the rain forest instead of a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58170809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horse dewormer</a>.” What does it mean for both shows to explore themes that have long caused real harm, and are gearing up to cause more widespread harm now? Both shows make space to think about these issues apart from the horrors of the news; as fiction, they can look more deeply and explore more facets than a news story that has to prioritize accurate information above all else. But they also turn up the volume on a confusing world that’s already making a lot of noise in the public sphere, potentially giving it more validity in some people’s eyes. And while I don’t believe fiction is duty-bound to give moral instruction–neither show needs some kind of “remember: this is bad” placard–does <em>Common Side Effects</em>’ thriller conspiracy as humanized through its animation style and writing, or the ways in which <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> paints Belle as compelling, add fuel to the fire of these conspiracies?</p><p>I enjoy both shows a lot, including indulging in a certain brand of escapism they offer by letting me enter a version of our current world that doesn’t lead to babies getting measles. And <a href="https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art</a> is, of course, one way we explore and make meaning out of our lives, and the accelerated rise of the wellness sphere is something that’s urgently present in the lives of Americans right now. Ultimately, maybe anything that takes wellness claims out of the mouths of the people who peddle them has value, especially these days. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/uvw-cwa-video-game-union-microsoft-trump-musk"><h3>CWA And Video Game Workers Launch New Industry-Wide Union Anyone Can Join, Even If They’ve Been Laid Off</h3></a><p>With the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board under attack by Trump, CWA is trying something old and new</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions"><h3>Two Point Museum: It’s Great</h3></a><p>No tombs were raided in the making of this video game</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That message was notably not written by any of the staff members and was the only thing you could see on the website for the past seven months after GameStop wiped the publication’s online archive.

It ends with a date, March 25, 2025, teasing some kind of announcement next week.</p><p>After the teaser went live, several members of <em>Game Informer</em>’s staff at the time of the shutdown have posted similar teasers on their personal social media accounts, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-content director Brian Shea</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former editor-in-chief Matt Miller</a></span>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-inzoi-multiplayer-single-player/</link>

<p>Outside of official mods, it’s very rare to see a life-sim title enable multiplayer in any capacity. With Inzoi looking to take the genre by the scruff of the neck, we’re drawing our attention to Inzoi and whether it has multiplayer or focuses solely on single-player.</p>



<p>Even a cursory glance at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-inzoi-come-out-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a>‘s prerelease images and footage makes the soul feel warm. People playing together in a band or a couple enjoying the creation they conceived together. Everything we’ve seen looks friendly and instills a sense of togetherness. Your job in Inzoi is to micromanage the existence of Zois—plural being the key here. </p>



<p>Each city you build is crawling with characters, but can you bask in your vision with another person?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-inzoi-be-multiplayer">Will Inzoi be Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No buddying up yet. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Currently, Inzoi will not support any multiplayer features at launch.</strong></p>



<p>Like The Sims and other life simulators, there is no multiplayer in Inzoi. Outside of potential mods, this is a strictly single-player-only game. You only have to look at the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inzoi Steam page</a> to see the big “Single-Player” category assigned to it.</p>



<p>This is designed to be your world, your life, and it’s for your eyes only. However, I did say there is no multiplayer at launch. It doesn’t necessarily mean Inzoi won’t feature multiplayer content at any point in the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-multiplayer-be-added-to-inzoi">Will Multiplayer be Added to Inzoi?</h2>



<p><strong>Developer Inzoi Team is contemplating adding “various multiplayer features” to Inzoi.</strong></p>



<p>In the Inzoi <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1162040845181124618/1220564610151878696/1349181911481843722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord server’s FAQ</a>, a question asks: “Will the game be multiplayer?” Here’s what the official response says: “We are currently considering various multiplayer features, <strong>such as the ability to meet up with other online players or invite them over to your home.</strong> But specific details have not been decided.”</p>



<p>This feels more uplifting, wouldn’t you agree? There’s no timeframe mentioned as yet though as the team probably wants to ensure the Early Access launch goes smoothly first. We already know a ton of free DLC is coming courtesy of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-inzoi-cost-inzoi-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s cost</a>. We’ll keep you posted if the game does decide to integrate multiplayer into the main game.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does a lack of multiplayer put you off buying Inzoi? Or are you motivated to create virtual worlds with the foresight of potential forthcoming multiplayer content? Share your thoughts either here at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> or on our lively <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Dungeons &amp; Dragons has spawned numerous fictional settings for players to explore, but one of the biggest and most detailed is Dragonlance. The high-fantasy world, known as Krynn, was crafted by authors Laura and Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis, but rather than just serving as a campaign setting for dungeon masters and players to explore, Weis and Tracy Hickman further developed the universe into a sprawling series of novels, expanding Dragonlance's popularity beyond just D&amp;D players, and cementing it as one of the more prolific fantasy settings ever conceived. If you've ever wanted to get into the series, <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fworld-dragonlance-wizards-coast-books&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-26-dragonlance-novels-for-just-18-this-month%2F1100-6530195%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble's new The World Of Dragonlance Book Bundle</a></strong> includes up to 26 Dragonlance novels for $18.</p><p dir="ltr">Like all Humble Bundles, this is a pay-what-you-want deal where the more you pay, the more books you get.

Many former Game Informer editors and writers (I interned there in 2014) have gone on to write for other websites or appear on gaming-related podcasts, while those who still reside in Minneapolis, Minnesota (where Game Informer was based) frequently make appearances or are recurring guests on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/minnmax" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MinnMax</a>, a Patreon-funded video game podcast created by former Game Informer video producer Ben Hanson.</p><p dir="ltr">Game Informer's sudden and relatively unceremonious closure in August 2024 came as a shock to many in the industry. The move came just a few months after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-now-offering-standalone-subscriptions/1100-6522173/" data-ref-id="1100-6522173">Game Informer began offering standalone magazine subscriptions</a> not tied to GameStop's PowerUp Rewards program.</p><p dir="ltr">The magazine's "The Final Level" letter posted to social media was not penned by Game Informer staff, prompting the magazine's editor-in-chief, Matt Miller, to pen a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-editor-in-chief-says-goodbye-after-gamestop-deletes-previous-message/1100-6525613/" data-ref-id="1100-6525613">proper goodbye after a previous farewell message had been taken down by GameStop</a>. Hilliard, a former GameSpot editor who was Game Informer's content director at the time, said the shutdown was so sudden that the team wasn't even allowed to finish the magazine's upcoming next issue, despite it being over 70% complete.</p><p dir="ltr">Game Informer's final issue turned out to be June 2024's issue #367 featuring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-ref-id="5000-490222">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> on the cover. Whether or not Game Informer's resurrection also means a return to a print magazine is still unknown, but fans of the brand can expect more news soon.</p>

<p>The February 2025 releases of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is more than just one of the most successful launches of the year. The long awaited sequel produced more than five times the amount of launch month dollar sales than the original, even during a stacked release month.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-outperformed-the-original-in-reviews-and-sales">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Has Outperformed The Original in Reviews and Sales</h2>



<p>According to the latest monthly United States video game sales data from Circana, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was the second best selling premium game of February. Additionally, it’s also the second best selling premium game of 2025 so far, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-united-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sitting below Monster Hunter Wilds on both charts</a>.</p>



<p>But Circana’s video game analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5tjhs2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> an additional piece of insight about the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launch. According to Piscatella, the “launch month dollar sales total Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reached in February 2025 was more than 5 times higher than that the original [game] achieved during its February 2018 debut.” Since both games were originally priced at $59.99 USD, this effectively means that the sequel sold five times more than the original did during its launch month. However, the sequel did have a slight advantage in that it released on February 4th, while the original released February 13th.</p>



<p>Even though it had a week more of sales to tout compared to the original, the critical reception to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 show how popular the sequel is. The first game garnered a 76 from critics according to MetaCritic and an 83% positive rating on Steam, which is by no means bad. The sequel though achieved a Metacritic rating of 88, and a 93% positive rating on Steam.</p>



<p>Will Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 finish 2025 as one of the top 10 best selling games? Let us know down below and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Blizzard is instead progressing past vanilla WoW's normal endpoint and introducing new endgame content in the form of a new raid, as well as giving players the chance to wield one of WoW's most legendary weapons--the Ashbringer.</p><p dir="ltr">Phase 8 of WoW Classic Season of Discovery will begin on April 8, <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24188044" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blizzard has announced</a>. That will be when players will be able to explore new quest content centered around the Scarlet Crusade stronghold of New Avalon. Then, on April 10, players can venture into the new Scarlet Enclave raid, where a splinter faction of the Scarlet Crusade is seeking help to overthrow an "insidious evil" that has taken control of the stronghold.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1751220451" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">The Scarlet Enclave is where Paladin, Warrior, and, yes, even Hunter players can embark on a new legendary questline to reforge one of WoW's most iconic weapons, the holy two-handed sword Ashbringer. It will be the first time WoW Classic players will be able to get their hands on a non-corrupted version of the weapon, despite players back in the vanilla WoW days tirelessly trying to discover a way to no avail. However, players of the modern "retail" version of WoW were able to use Ashbringer as part of the game's 2016 Legion expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">How, exactly, players will purify the Corrupted Ashbringer and restore it to its former glory is still under wraps, but the datamining sleuths at <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/how-this-legendary-weapon-may-be-coming-to-season-of-discovery-in-phase-8-375915" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a> have some theories. If you don't want spoilers, stop reading now! Based on datamines, in typical WoW Classic fashion, the quest to restore Ashbringer looks like it will be a globe-trotting affair. The quest may even take players to previously unseen areas in WoW Classic like Mount Hyjal and the Well of Eternity.</p><p dir="ltr">Wowhead has also <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/possible-bosses-coming-in-the-scarlet-enclave-raid-season-of-discovery-phase-8-375982" rel="nofollow ">datamined</a> possible bosses for the Scarlet Enclave raid, and one of them will be a very familiar face to longtime WoW players. Spoilers if you don't want the contents of the raid revealed, but it looks like players will face off against none other than Lillian Voss. In modern WoW, Voss is a prominent undead character who first appeared in the game's Cataclysm expansion, where she infiltrated the Scarlet Crusade in a quest of revenge against those who wronged her.</p><p dir="ltr">Before she was turned undead, she was a fanatical member of the Scarlet Crusade, but her exact backstory, or the manner of her death, has never been revealed. Just as was the case when players believed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-think-the-war-within-big-bad-is-secretly-in-season-of-discovery-too/1100-6520312/" data-ref-id="1100-6520312">Season of Discovery included appearances from WoW: The War Within's main villain Xal'atath</a>, it looks like Blizzard is once again tying together its two eras of WoW in an exciting way.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the raid's final boss, that also looks to be a familiar face--the dreadlord Balnazzar. Previously seen in the game's Stratholme dungeon posing as a member of the Scarlet Crusade, it looks like he has now attempted a full-blown coup, and it will be up to players to dethrone him once and for all.</p><p dir="ltr">What will be next for WoW Classic Season of Discovery is still unknown, but Blizzard has said the experimental seasonal servers will continue to exist in some form even after new content is no longer in development. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">WoW: The War Within just received its goblin-themed Season 2 update</a>, as Blizzard continues to share more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">details on the MMORPG's highly anticipated player housing system</a>.</p>

Players will now receive $1,500 if they agree to allow their likeness to be used in EA <em>College Football 26.</em> This is more than double the $600 offered last year. </p><p>An EA Sports rep told the outlet that the increase in payments was to “make sure athletes feel recognized for the success of the game.” Players will also still get a free copy of the game, too.</p><p>“From the beginning, we’ve designed our NIL program to be accessible, direct, voluntary and equitable for all, offering the same base-level compensation to every FBS athlete that opts-in using the OneTeam platform and COMPASS NIL app,” an EA Sports exec told <em>The Athletic</em>. </p><p>“This approach empowers each athlete to make their own decision. College sports are growing and changing, and our focus at EA Sports is on continuing to put athletes first as we bring them in the game in <em>College Football 26</em> and beyond.”</p><p>It’s believed that around 11,00o players will allow their likenesses and names to be used in <em>College Football 26</em>, which is roughly the same as last year.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The wait has been so unbearable that even a casual mention, like the one Xbox dropped in a recent ID@Xbox post, can ignite the fires of those holding out for a 2025 drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, ID@Xbox director Guy Richards shared a post detailing how over $5 billion have been paid to independent developers through the program. It mostly goes over the success of past ID@Xbox launches, ranging from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/neva">Neva</a>. Then, in a portion about upcoming games, we get the name-drop:</p><blockquote>"Looking ahead, our lineup is incredible with upcoming games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Descenders Next, and FBC: Firebreak to play across the whole Xbox universe… and of course Hollow Knight: Silksong too!"</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This mostly confirms that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch sometime between me typing this, right now, and the end of all time. Granted, those games are interesting mentions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is set for April 24, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/descenders-next">Descenders Next</a> for April 9, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> has had a tentative 2025 window. This could imply Hollow Knight: Silksong is within some measure of grasp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are, to some degree, understandably impatient to learn whether Silksong might arrive, as it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news">been roughly six years since its announcement</a>. Now, let's see how the Silksong faithful are reacting to this mention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Where's the bait?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1je8o1b/silksong_is_officially_mentioned_in_an_official/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one commenter asked</a> on the Silksong subreddit. Another said: "Silksong being mentioned by Xbox?" and followed it up with an image of the Squid Game Season 2 scene where protagonist Seong Gi-hun declares: "I have played these games before!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a palpable air of both joking and irony that comes with communities like this, where groups have essentially bonded over waiting for news about something. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1jetj81/i_swear_we_are_a_circus_at_this_point/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another post</a> draws attention to this, noting that "we" — the Silksong holdouts — are a "circus at this point," making their point with the Patrick Star/Man Ray meme format.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The prevailing hope, or joke, is that news about Hollow Knight: Silksong is destined for April 2, during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announced-for-april">Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct</a>. To fans' credit, developer Team Cherry did stoke the flames a bit with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">some vague posting around the official reveal of the Switch 2</a>. The believers hold out hope, while the doubters sow doubt. "We are an [$8] Mega Buffoon Pack," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1jetj81/comment/milnxg4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one commenter said</a> in response to the circus meme. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hope and doubt comes in all shapes and sizes. But my favorite response to Xbox casually saying, "and of course Hollow Knight: Silksong too!" and all the speculation and cycles this causes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1je8o1b/silksong_is_officially_mentioned_in_an_official/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">came from Reddit user u/cerberusthedoge</a>: "We got Hollow Knight Silksong 2 before Hollow Knight Silksong."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Creative Studio won't let you do any of the simulation part of the game, but it <em>will</em> let you dabble with inZoi's character creation and build mode.</p><p>There's a little bit of a catch, though. For the first few days--March 20-23--you'll need to unlock access via streaming drop on Twitch or Chzzk, which will require you to link your Krafton account and watch an inZoi stream for 15 minutes, or on Steam itself. Steam will be the easiest option--you just have to watch a livestream from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inZoi's product page</a> for 30 minutes, and a key for the Creative Studio will be granted without remembering any additional logins.</p><p>There are only a limited number of keys that can be obtained from drops, but if they run out you won't have to wait too long. Starting March 23, the inZoi Creative Studio will become available for anyone on Steam to download for free. And you'll probably appreciate having the chance to go wild on character creation ahead of the release of the rest of the game, since inZoi features a rather intense level of customization built in--you can literally design your own clothing items from scratch, for one thing. It's a lot to absorb even without thinking about the simulation part.</p><p>On Tuesday night, Krafton hosted a very lengthy streaming showcase that went deep on everything inZoi will have to offer at launch, plus the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-price-and-update-roadmap-revealed-just-before-launch/1100-6530201/" data-ref-id="1100-6530201">game's roadmap</a> for the rest of 2025, and you can check that out below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkXfP9rwrm8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QkXfP9rwrm8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>InZoi launches in early access starting March 27 on Steam for $40.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has discussed the game's future following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">impending sale to Monopoly Go maker Scopely</a>, which is owned by the Saudi-backed Savvy Games Group, in a deal worth $3.5bn.
</p>
<p>
In a lengthy video interview with veteran Pokémon Go YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS3HawhQy78&amp;ab_channel=TrainerTips">TrainerTips</a>, senior product director Michael Steranka discussed several of the main concerns among the game's huge playerbase about the upcoming sale.
</p>
<p>
Asked whether Pokémon Go would ever get pop-up ads to drive more revenue, or share player location with either Scopely or Savvy, Steranka gave an emphatic no.
"That will never happen, I'm saying that right here now," Steranka said about the idea of pop-up advertising appearing in-game. 
</p>
<p>
As for player data, including scanned locations, this will still be shared with Niantic even after the sale, but will not leave the company's US-based servers.

<p>
"Anything players still scan or submit through [Niantic's location-adding software] Wayfarer or otherwise, that data does still get shared back to the Niantic Spatial organisation, but all that data is still fully encrypted and protected in all the ways we have been doing up until now - which is honestly best in class," Steranka continued.
</p>
<p>
"Contrary to popular belief, we don't store any player data beyond what's needed to actually operate the game, everything is fully anonymised and it's all stored on US servers. And in accordance to regulatory laws, to make sure your data is as safe and sound as possible. None of that is changing."
</p>
<p>
Asked specifically if it would be shared further by Pokémon Go's incoming owners, Steranka said no. 
</p>
<p>
"It's not shared up with Savvy or otherwise," he said. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking about the wider context of the deal, Steranka said it had been "in the works for a little while now" and made sense to separate the two halves of Niantic - the one focused on gaming, and the other focused on location mapping. 
</p>
<p>
"As you, and many other players in the community could tell, I'm sure, even from an outsider's perspective, Niantic's always had a little bit of a dual personality," Steranka said.  
</p>
<p>
"It naturally made sense to build on this [geolocation] platform that was all about servicing those kinds of applications, but I will say it did also lead to competing priorities, or more regularly too many priorities for the team to focus on, or lean into.
</p>
<p>
"In terms of what's good for Pokémon Go, this is absolutely one of the best things that could be happening to the game," Steranka said, adding that he hoped it would allow the game's design time to focus solely on what's best for the product.
</p>
<p>
While the development team will "still have full autonomy in our games and the decisions we're making", there will be "less of an emphasis on scanning" in future, Steranka added. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go's mission to get people outside is also "not changing", Steranka said. 
</p>
<p>
As for how Pokémon Go may be further monetised in future, Steranka said Scopely understood how profitable the game was already, and that it would not be wise to tamper with it.
</p>
<p>
"They've been very intrigued and impressed by how we monetise games," Steranka said, explaining that Pokémon Go was a rare example of a free-to-play mobile game where a lot of players pay a little bit, compared to other games relying on only a few players who pay a lot. 
</p>
<p>
Compared to the other paths open to Niantic, the sale to Scopely meant Pokémon Go's team would not have to deal with shareholders by splitting off or dealing with another kind of owner, Steranka concluded.
</p>
<p>
Niantic confirmed its plans to sell Pokémon Go, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-now">Monster Hunter Now</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a> to the Saudi-backed Monopoly Go maker Scopely earlier this month. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Pokémon Go fans had expressed deep concern over Scopely's acquisition</a> of the game, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">word of the deal was reported online</a> - something Niantic has continued to try and assuage. The hugely-popular mobile game has over 20 million weekly active players, with an average of 40 minutes daily playtime, and is set to celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds' launch has been extremely successful in the United States, where it became the best-selling game of the month of February and the current best-selling game of the year in a single day of availability.</p>
<p>According to data shared today by Circana (NPD), the latest entry in the series by CAPCOM was the overall best-selling premium game in the United States, topping the sales charts of every platform it has released on - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam - followed by two other February releases, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/">Civilization VII</a>. While the game sold great on all platforms, it was a smashing success on Steam, as the PC ecosystem accounts for more than half of the title's total dollar sales.&nbsp; With the game also being the current best-selling game of the year in the United States, it definitely looks like the first proper, simultaneous PC and console release for the series paid off big time.</p>

<p><br>
That Monster Hunter Wilds has been a smashing success, there was no doubt, as CAPCOM itself reported to have sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/">eight million copies in only three days</a>, becoming the fastest-selling game in the publisher's long history. A success that is completely deserved, as the game is, despite some shortcomings, incredibly fun to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S worldwide.</p>

<p>If you have not played GTA Online in the past 60 days, you might be eligible for Rockstar’s one-time exclusive offer, which gives players $3 million in-game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right: Rockstar is offering players $3 million in-game to return to GTA Online, but there’s a catch. Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/532607/article/rockstar-games-trying-to-win-some-gta-online-players-back-with-3m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, players should meet a set of eligibility requirements before claiming the in-game currency. Moreover, Rockstar only offers $1 million for free; for the remaining $2 million, players would need to make additional purchases, including buying a Shark Card and subscribing to GTA+.</p>



<h2 id="h-eligibility-requirements-for-claiming-3-million-in-gta-online">Eligibility Requirements for Claiming $3 Million in GTA Online</h2>



<ul>
<li>Players should have a Rockstar Games Account that’s linked to their platform.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Claim the offer on Rockstar’s <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Players should not have signed into GTA Online in the past 2 months (60 days).&nbsp;</li>



<li>The account should not have received a ban or suspension from Rockstar at any point.</li>



<li>The offer should not be redeemed already.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-3-million-in-gta-online">How to Claim $3 Million in GTA Online?</h2>



<p>To claim the $1 million, the player must claim the offer from Rockstar’s website and sign in to GTA Online using the same account. Once done, players will receive the in-game money within 72 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>United States video game sales data for February 2025 has been released. Not only is Monster Hunter Wilds the best-selling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-was-february-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game of the month</a>, but it’s the best selling game of 2025 through two months.</p>



<p>According to the latest data from Circana, Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of the month for PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam. When looking at the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5telk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam data</a>, it has accounted for “more than half of the title’s total dollar sales”.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Monster Hunter franchise, the release of Monster Hunter Wilds doubled that of Monster Hunter Rise in terms of dollar sales. It’s worth noting that Monster Hunter Wilds launched at $69.99 while Rise launched at $59.99.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-continued-to-fall-in-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Video Game Hardware Sales Continued To Fall In February</a></h6>



<p>Looking elsewhere at the data, Monster Hunter Wilds wasn’t the only new release to make it into the Top 20 best-selling games of 2025 so far. Other new titles to make the list include Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (2nd), Civilization 7 (3rd), PGA Tour 2K25 (6th), Avowed (13th), and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii (18th).</p>



<p>The prior top game, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, remains in the top 5. However, it has fallen to 4th on the list while NBA 2K25 fell from second to 5th.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> developers at GSC Game World have been through a lot, to put it mildly. Following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-stalker-2s-developers-persevered-as-russians-invasion-of-ukraine-began/1100-6529870/" data-ref-id="1100-6529870">full-scale Russian invasion in 2022</a>, roughly 200 developers opted to relocate to Prague in the Czech Republic, continuing to collaborate with their colleagues in Kyiv. This, in theory, should have led to a more peaceful development process for this group, but a large fire in the Prague office threw another unexpected wrench in its plans.</p><p dir="ltr">The fire, which broke out in late 2023 in the Prague office's server room, partially wiped out one of the floors. No one was hurt, but post-accident images of the damage show scorch marks and ash covering the ground. GSC Game World CEO Ievgen Grygorovych seems to view the situation as a sort of blessing in disguise, as he explained to us in the latest GameSpot Insider documentary.</p><p dir="ltr">"It actually made us stronger because we got to experience what can happen, how it may look--what we have to do to not let it happen again," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KSH5O1KLSI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8KSH5O1KLSI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There was certainly a material cost to the accident, though. In addition to the server on the floor being destroyed, developers' work computers were also destroyed.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was one more challenge to rebuild this game again," lead community manager Yevhen Bazarov said. "One more thing we weren't expecting."</p><p dir="ltr">While he's able to laugh about it now, lead cinematic artist Ingwar Dovgoteles was working on a cinematic-department documentation job that took roughly three days. He had finished it late the night of the fire. About 15 minutes after he got home, he got a call from the office that everything he had worked on was gone.</p><p dir="ltr">"All my work was there," Dovgoteles added. "[Done] in three days with all this documentation. It was just wasted."</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for GSC Game World, despite yet another setback, Stalker 2 did eventually release in late 2024, and it was one of our picks for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">best games of 2024</a>.
