This collection, which has been dubbed “Decades of Horror,” is made up of just about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-main-resident-evil-games-from-worst-to-b-1847399290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-main-resident-evil-games-from-worst-to-b-1847399290">every mainline entry in the series’ nearly 30-year history.</a></span> There are a few notable exceptions, like <em>Code Veronica</em>, and some remakes are there in favor of the classic versions of these titles, but for the most part, <strong>$30 will net you just about every </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil </strong></em><strong>game.</strong></p><p>These bundles are known for having tiers, though, and there are a few to work through. For example, <strong>beginning at $3, you can pick up the HD remaster of the first <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Resident Evil Revelations</em>, and the first episode of <em>Revelations 2</em>.</strong> The first title is obviously a classic that defined the survival horror genre, and gave us some of gaming’s most enduring characters in folks like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker. Though remakes and remasters can be hit or miss, the <em>Resident Evil </em>series actually has one of the most sterling track records in this department, and it all more or less started with this game.<br></p><p>I’ve never gotten around to the <em>Revelations </em>sub-series, which curiously began on the Nintendo 3DS, but I remember hearing at the time that they were a refreshing return to the series’ roots. After some time, the <em>Resident Evil </em>games started to become more synonymous with outrageous plotlines and non-stop action than horror, and while some welcomed the evolution, others missed what made them love the series in the first place. <em>Revelations </em>was a bid to win back that hardcore audience that missed slower, scarier games, and the success of them seemed to pave the way for the mainline games to return to survival horror as well.<br></p><p>Speaking of the screwy path that the <em>Resident Evil </em>franchise eventually found itself on, the next tier of the Humble Bundle packages in a ton more games. <strong>For $7, you can pick up everything I already mentioned, as well the critically beloved </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 4</strong></em><strong>, its less acclaimed action-centric follow-ups, </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 5 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>6 </strong></em><strong>(and their respective DLCs), </strong><em><strong>Resident Evil 0, </strong></em><strong>and all of </strong><em><strong>Revelations 2</strong></em><strong>, which was released piecemeal</strong>. The legacy of <em>4</em> is well-established (and it has a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">pretty great remake</a></span> from last year) but both <em>5 </em>and <em>6</em> have divided fans for years. Some are in favor of the gung-ho, balls-to-the-wall action of these increasingly ludicrous games, but for others, this is where the series really jumped the shark. I think if you are a person capable of shutting your brain off and being a part of really dumb sequences of events, such as punching a huge boulder, then you can’t really go wrong checking them out.</p><p><em>Resident Evil 0 </em>and <em>Revelations 2</em>, like the first <em>Revelations </em>game, are slower, and far more typical, installments in the franchise, though neither is particularly beloved. If you just want to round out the bases, though, it can’t hurt to pick them up.</p><p><strong>For $20, you get all of the aforementioned titles, <em>Resident Evil 7 biohazard </em>and its DLCs,<em> </em></strong><br><strong>and the recent remakes of <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>and <em>3</em>. </strong>This widely beloved trio of games have more or less ushered the franchise into a renaissance since the late 2010s. The first brought the mainline games back to survival horror but also shook up the formula by putting the action in first-person. This romp through a decrepit manor in the Louisiana bayou was creepy as fuck, and introduced Ethan Winters, the corny catch-phrase spewing protagonist of the game and its immediate sequel. While it’s definitely a little clunky, <em>RE7 </em>is the most atmospheric and unsettling of the modern games, in case you’re looking for the most frightening prospects.</p><p><em>Resident Evil 2 </em>and <em>3</em>, meanwhile, are currently held up as the gold standard of remakes across the industry. They both maintain the spirit of their original iterations while modernizing the controls and visuals in a from-the-ground-up reimagining. Even if people are down on <em>3</em>—which I believe mostly has to do with the fact that people <em>never </em>really liked it as much as <em>2</em> to begin with—you’ve got two absolute bangers here that Capcom managed to develop in tandem and release in back-to-back years.</p><p>Finally, the biggest bundle is the previously mentioned <strong>$30 one that brings everything, including the most recent mainline entry, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em><strong>Resident Evil Village</strong></em></a></span><strong>, as well as its DLC.</strong> <em>Village</em> maintains the first-person perspective of its horror-focused predecessor, but shifts gears once again. Stylistically, it’s like a first-person <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, and plays a lot of the same hits, like opening in a creepy village in the middle of nowhere, but it also takes some even wilder swings in due time. It is also the game that gave us Lady Dimitrescu, otherwise known as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-dont-want-resident-evil-villages-tall-vampire-lady-1846710943&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-dont-want-resident-evil-villages-tall-vampire-lady-1846710943">big woman that the internet wanted to step on them</a></span>.</p><p>Even if the ending of the game dragged on a little too long for me, I’m pretty confident that <em>Village </em>is actually my favorite <em>RE </em>game, since it pretty successfully melds all of the disparate things the series has been over the years into something that’s <em>mostly </em>cohesive and, importantly, ludicrously fun.</p><p>For as little as half of a retail game, you can play <em>the </em>most legendary survival horror series in games. Considering that Capcom unceremoniously announced a sequel earlier this year, now’s as good a time as any to jump on in. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We now seem to know exactly why Black Myth: Wukong isn’t on Xbox consoles yet. According to Forbes reporter Paul Tassi, Black Myth: Wukong has a console exclusivity deal with PlayStation.</p>



<p>“A source with knowledge of the situation has told me that Black Myth: Wukong is not currently on Xbox because of an exclusivity deal, and is not delayed because of any sort of technical issue,” <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1829211594108350790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, it’s worth noting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/an-update-on-black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tassi himself has said</a> that the game wasn’t on Xbox due to a “Tech Issue”. </p>



<p>“The bad news is that once again, Xbox seems to have blundered into a Baldur’s Gate 3 situation,” he reported just a week ago on the issues.</p>



<p>Tassi also references the conflicting statements between Microsoft and Game Science. Game Science has gone on record stating that they were “currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version” to hit quality standards. There has been no mention from the studio of any sort of exclusivity deal with PlayStation. Microsoft, on the other hand, has said in multiple statements that it “can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders”. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">from the start, the statements from Game Science and Microsoft conflicted with each other, with Game Science citing optimization while Microsoft cited "deals with other platform holders." <a href="https://t.co/47Up179ZWh">pic.twitter.com/47Up179ZWh</a></p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1829216520502948098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>For now, no such deal has been confirmed by either developer Game Science or Sony. Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony and Game Science for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>



<p>Since its release on PC and PlayStation 4, Black Myth: Wukong has sold over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million copies</a>. It’s also become the second-highest played game in Steam history when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes to concurrent users</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/iconic-mmo-wizard101-to-be-released-on-console/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wizard101 is one of the <a href="https://www.wizard101.com/?utm_source=%C3%9CberStrategist+PR+List+-+Leading+Gaming+and+Tech+News+%282023%29&amp;utm_campaign=71122f979a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_08_22_05_15_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-9e9ced9085-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most iconic MMOs</a> out there. It is set to be released on all console platforms, including PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. This release comes after its first release on PC in 2008, making the game a whopping 16 years old.</p>
<p>If you've wanted to get stuck into an <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-is-a-co-op-multiplayer-game-focused-on-mmo-like-dungeon-runs/">MMO</a> that takes you through a magical school with deckbuilding and strategic turn-based combat, Wizard101 is the way to go. There are over 20 magical worlds for players to explore, all with unique traits that make them memorable and special. You get to play as a student wizard, where you'll have to go on your journey, completing quests and meeting new people in bustling worlds full of active players. The game will also be fully voice-acted, giving each quest that personal touch.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you've been wanting to introduce your friends to this MMO but they are all on console, console users will share a server, allowing those on PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch to all play with each other via crossplay.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of Wizard101 on console, they have released a short 26-second trailer to get dedicated players excited about finally being able to play the game on console, as well as players who don't have access to a PC being able to play it on console for the first time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wizard101 Official Console Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdH0cSINQlA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the moment, there isn't a set release date for when Wizard101 will be available on console, and KingsIsle Entertainment has yet to announce it. While Wizard101 has been around for a while, it was only added to Steam in 2018, with it being a much more efficient way of running the game.</p>
<p>Even though the game is relatively old, there are still millions of players getting stuck into Wizard101 regularly, and the game is home to over a thousand hours of questing to be done. This doesn't include the battles players can participate in, where they can participate in 1v1 duels or team-based battles to try and get a space on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>This MMO is still home to weekly rewards, praising players for their dedication to the game and rewarding them for their time and effort spent completing challenges set out for them in-game, with the events of Wizard101 rotating weekly to provide as much variety as possible for the players.</p>

<p>The details surrounding crossplay in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 have been announced a week before the game’s launch.</p>



<p>Developer Saber Interactive published their <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/68-august-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">August Community Update</a> on Thursday, and with it came everything you need to know about how crossplay will work in Space Marine 2.</p>







<p>From launch day, Space Marine 2 will support “full crossplay” between PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Steam, and Epic Games Store (EGS).</p>



<p>“You will be able to play the Campaign and PvE modes without any restriction,” the developers say. </p>



<p>When it comes to the PvP mode Eternal War, Saber Interactive says that things have to be split for “fairness and balancing purposes.</p>



<p>“[Crossplay] will be split between PC players in one pool (Steam &amp; EGS) and console players in the other one (PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S),” they said.</p>



<p>Lastly, players will have the ability to disable crossplay entirely should they only want to play with those on the same platform.</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 releases on September 6.</p>

The most concrete part of the news is that Annapurna — which also has an indie game publishing arm — will be funding half of the development budget for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453049/control-2-sequel-remedy-entertainment">the previously announced <em>Control 2</em></a>.</p><p>Beyond that, there’s the potential for Annapurna to create film and TV adaptations of both <em>Control</em> and <em>Alan Wake</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">just got a long-awaited sequel last year</a>.

<p>Corsair has unveiled its new Ultrawide curved monitor, the XENEON 34 QD-OLED. </p>



<p>Retailing <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/monitors/CM-9030005-NA/xeneon-34wqhd240-c-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-34-inch-3440-x-1440-wqhd-1800r-curvature-240hz-0-03ms-gtg-displayhdr-true-black-400-1-5m1-contrast-ratio-cm-9030005-na" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for $1,199.99</a>, this new monitor has a 34-inch WQHD screen size featuring an 1800R Curve Quantum Dot OLED Display. It also has a 0.03ms response time with a 240Hz refresh rate.</p>



<p>“QD-OLED enhances response times and refresh rates, making the XENEON 34 QD-OLED an ideal partner for high-speed gameplay, whether it’s racing, FPS, or action games,” Corsair says. “With a refresh rate of up to 240Hz combined with an impressive response time of up to 0.03ms (GtG), the image on screen reacts to inputs faster than you can perceive.”</p>



<p>The monitor also includes support for both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium.</p>



<p>The rear of the monitor features a number of I/O ports. Those include two HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB-C 3.1 DP ALT with 65W PD, USB-C 3.1 DP Upstream with 15W PD, four USB-A 3.1 with KVM, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. As far as on-screen display is concerned, that is activated by placing your hand near the bottom of the monitor.</p>



<p>Lastly, the monitor has burn-in prevention features like “an image retention refresh after eight hours of use and an Orbit feature that shifts the entire image by one pixel every three minutes”. </p>

"So guess how big the script is? 2,200,000 words! Or 11,000 typical screenwriting pages.

A lot, most fans seem to predict.</p><p>Call of Duty sort of has this feature already in Warzone.

            <p>
Remedy Entertainment has announced a new partnership that'll see Annapurna Pictures financing half of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> in exchange for the film and TV rights to Control and Alan Wake.
</p>
<p>
Control 2 - the sequel to Remedy's acclaimed 2019 paranormal shooter - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">officially announced back in 2022</a>. Earlier this month, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">revealed the project had now entered full production</a>, and that the Control 2 team was currently "working towards developing the game to an early functional state from beginning to end."
</p>
<p>
Remedy announced its new partnership in a <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-inside-information-remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-partnership-agreement-on-control-2-and-bringing-control-and-alan-wake-to-film-and-television/">statement shared on its website</a>, confirming Annapurna will finance 50 percent of Control 2's development budget and gain the rights to "expand the award-winning Control and Alan Wake franchises into film and television".

<p>
Remedy notes the terms of the deal will see it retain full IP rights for Control and Alan Wake, but that revenue share from the deal will shift according to the release medium. Remedy will receive a greater revenue share from sales of the Control 2 game after initial investments have been recouped, while Annapurna will receive a greater revenue share from its audiovisual productions.
</p>
<p>
"The future of storytelling requires seamlessly integrating gaming, film, and television," Annapurna CEO Megan Ellison said of today's news, "and this partnership will allow us to explore new ways of bringing these narratives to life. By leveraging Remedy's innovative narratives and immersive worlds, we can push the boundaries of how stories are told and experienced across mediums."
</p>
<p>
Control and Alan Wake are, of course, set in the same universe, giving Annapurna significant flexibility in how the two properties might manifest for television and film.
</p>
<p>
Alongside Control 2, Remedy is currently developing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-details-control-live-service-multiplayer-spin-off">live-service multiplayer Control spin-off Condor</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-in-the-works-remedy-confirms">remakes of Max Payne 1 &amp; 2</a>. The latter project is also now in full production. Remedy's next release, however, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-expansions-detailed-include-trip-inside-fictional-tv-show">Alan Wake 2's second DLC</a>, The Lake House, which arrives in October and sees players exploring a "mysterious facility situated on the shores of Cauldron Lake set up by an independent government organisation to conduct secret research".

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro’s</a> design and plans for an announcement in the first half of September have been leaked.</p>
<p>The impressively well-informed billbil-kun, who made their name on French deals site <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">Dealabs</a> by very reliably leaking the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games line up over the past two years, is the source of this latest scoop. They dig into the general marketing plan for September, confirming certain elements previously aired by Jeff Grubb on his <a href="https://youtu.be/o8TqCntkFPg?t=2131">Game Mess Morning</a> podcast, who says that a State of Play showcase will take place toward the end of September, likely tying in with Tokyo Game Show.</p>


<p>The PS5 Pro announcement, however, is expected before this in the first half of September, according to billbil-kun.</p>
<p>Another juicy element regards the console’s design, which… well it will look like a slightly glammed up PS5 Slim and PS5. You still have the popped collar style, but the divide in panels will have four grooves to it – Sony will probably note the four grooves as opposed to the three stripes between them, so as not to get Adidas’s lawyers excited.</p>

<p>It’s obviously difficult to talk about absolute dimensions from a sketch, but they note that the PS5 Pro looks thicker than the PS5 Slim, which makes sense. However, the multi-panel design matches up in style with the Slim and it’s feasible that there is crossover with compatibility for the swappable panels. The added grooves would make the Pro a bit longer, and if there’s a little more filling to the sandwich, that will bring the cooling capacity back closer to the original PS5’s power threshold.</p>
<p>Of note, there is no sign of a disc drive in the sketch, and billbil-kun cannot confirm if the console will have an SKU that features physical media support out of the box. Sony is very likely, however, to build in support for the PS5 Slim’s detachable disc drive as a cost-cutting measure.</p>
<p>So, basically, watch this space for a big PS5 Pro reveal within the next couple of weeks!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has announced that it's teaming up with Annapurna for&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>financing, as well as to bring&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>to the worlds of TV and film.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-cooperation-agreement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on Remedy's official website, the Finnish studio says Annapurna will "co-finance the development" of&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, and that Annapurna will also take "the&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>franchises to film, TV and beyond".</p>
<p>The developer says this partnership will allow it to make&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>"exactly the game we want it to be". Contrary to what you might expect, Annapurna won't be publishing&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, either; that responsibility will still fall to Remedy itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/control-2-remedy-annapurna-rocks.jpg?itok=XE-12wYB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/control-2-remedy-annapurna-rocks.jpg?itok=KP3PyMII 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>sequel will be partially financed by Annapurna.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering how far along in the development process&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is, Remedy says the development team is "working full steam ahead on the game".</p>
<p>The studio goes on to say that it knows fans are eager for news on both this and <i>Condor</i>, Remedy's upcoming multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff, but that you'll "have to wait a while for that".</p>
<p>Last we knew,&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy">sitting in the "production readiness stage"</a>, which likely indicates that it'll begin full production in the coming months. It's likely we'll hear from the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-trademark-fbc-firebreak">Condor</a>&nbsp;</em>before that; they're both in "full production", according to Remedy.</p>
<p>Of course, we still don't know exactly when we'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, nor do we know when the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes will arrive. We'll just have to wait for more from Remedy on that.</p>

<p>Additionally, this extra injection of funding will no doubt come as a relief to Remedy, especially with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">cancellation of Tencent collab&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">Codename Kestrel</a>&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">lack of&nbsp;profitability for&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">Alan Wake 2</a>&nbsp;</em>looming in the background.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Remedy has in store for us with regards to&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Condor</em>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
