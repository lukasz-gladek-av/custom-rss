The series starts as a humorous, in-universe spoof on Halo multiplayer and evolves into a sci-fi epic with long-running story arcs and surprisingly moving character moments. It was the first video series created by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rooster-teeth-shutting-down-after-two-decades-is-looking-to-sell-off-red-vs-blue/1100-6521649/" data-ref-id="1100-6521649">now-shuttered Rooster Teeth</a>.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">If you don't want to wait for the Red vs. Blue: Restoration Blu-ray release, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0CQ8TMJB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">buy or rent the digital version on Prime Video</a>. And if you haven't caught up on all the previous seasons--which stretch all the way back to the original episodes from 2003--you can also stream the entire Red vs. Blue series leading up to Restoration <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Gulch-Chronicles-Chapter-8/dp/B0B6T44CQ4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Prime Video</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, Red vs. Blue owes its existence to the Halo franchise.

                <p>The use of AI in video game development has become a hot-button issue in recent months, especially at the very top of the industry. Now, a wide-ranging report claims that Call of Duty publisher Activision sold cosmetics that were partially made with AI.</p><p dir="ltr">The piece, which comes via <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a>, describes a climate of fear and anxiety surrounding the use of AI in the gaming industry, especially for 2D artists. It opens with a quote from an alleged email from former Activision chief technology officer Michael Vance, stating that artificial intelligence was "top of mind" for the publisher, and that the systems "hold a ton of promise."</p>

<p dir="ltr">An internal memo cited later in the piece apparently approved the use of generative AI tools like GPT-3.5 to create concept art and marketing materials. A cosmetic created by AI was then reportedly released Modern Warfare 3 through the in-game store. The Wired report links to the Yokai's Wrath bundle, which includes a skin, loading screen, sticker, and more, though it's unclear exactly what was generated by AI. </p><p dir="ltr">"I think we all didn’t talk about it much for fear of losing our jobs," a pseudonymous Activision artist identified as "Noah" said. He further claims that "a lot of 2D artists were laid off" in early 2024 when Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs, and that the remaining concept artists are being "forced to use AI to aid in their work."</p><p dir="ltr">We've reached out to Activision for comment on this, and we'll update this piece accordingly if we hear back. The Wired report presents the AI issue as one endemic to games, with many top studios and publishers like Riot, EA, and Activision struggling to determine the proper use of the technology. The report also suggests that the AI boom has triggered further interest in organizing activity within the industry, which may help explain how large studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-is-now-unionized-across-the-board-recognized-by-microsoft/1100-6525206/">Bethesda</a> have become fully unionized in recent weeks.</p>

There was no TikTok, DLC was still a relatively new concept on consoles, <em>Fortnite</em> didn’t exist, and covid-19 wasn’t a thing. But what if <em>Skyrim </em>launched in 2024? And what if it was written and developed by 13-year-olds? Well, you don’t have to wonder, because YouTuber CJMattis has created a video that presents us with that alternate timeline. </p><p>Using AI-generated voices, CJMattis has rewritten <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734">the famous intro to <em>Skyrim</em></a></span><em> </em>in which you wake up on a wagon alongside a few other captured prisoners as you all await your execution. Now all the characters use “Gen Alpha Slang,” according to the video’s title. </p><p>So instead of saying “Watch your tongue!” when someone in the cart speaks poorly of Ulfric Stormcloak, we get “Check your vibes!” When the person realizes who they are talking to they freak out, saying: “You’re the leader of the rizz-bellion!” At another point, someone asks what gooncave someone is from after he starts to panic and yell out, “No, this is cap. This must be cap.” </p><p>Here’s the original <em>Skyrim </em>intro in case you want to compare.</p><p>I do think that some of the “Gen Alpha” slang in this video is actually much older internet speak, like ratioed and doxx. And I’m not sure a reference to Twitch streamer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479">Kai Cenat</a></span> is slang, but hey, what do I know? I’m an old man. Besides, the main point of the video is to rot your brain, and it does a solid job of that. </p><p>Although, personally, I don’t mind kids using new words because that’s how this whole language thing works. That’s how this has always worked. The youth develop new words and phrases, their parents and teachers roll their eyes, and then 10 years later those kids—now teens—roll their eyes at the new kids and their fresh slang. Repeat until the heat death of the universe. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playback-outland.935682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/24/playback-outland/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><em>Nearly 10 years on, the Playback series returns to revisit games from years past.</em></p>
<p>In 2011, Housemarque released Outland, its unique and only 2D platformer. It tends to be overlooked within the company’s impressive catalogue of games, overshadowed by hits like Resogun, Super Stardust Delta, and Returnal. Nevertheless, Outland emerged during a phase of experimentation for Housemarque, and its impact is noticeable in many later titles, from the particle-like graphics that distinguished Resogun to the varied enemy styles that may have inspired those in Returnal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Outland - Reveal Trailer [Europe]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bcc949DAWPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Outland has also been in my Steam library for years, languishing with zero minutes of play, so I decided to finally sit down and give it a go. You play as a nameless Hero who has visions of a battle from 30,000 years ago which sees another nameless hero fight the Sisters of Light &amp; Dark, before imprisoning them. The Sisters are nearing their escape, and your character, a descendant of the original Hero, is charged with the task of preventing their escape and thwarting their plans to destroy the world. To be honest, while it’s narrated well enough, Outland’s story is not particularly engrossing or interesting, playing into all-too-familiar story beats.</p>
<p>What Outland did do when it released was play on the dual identity of the Hero, who can switch between red and blue forms. These forms correspond to the light and dark forms of the Sisters and plays into the gameplay too. The different zones have enemies and puzzles that are colour-coded red and blue, so your character’s colour matters. In Outland, the red form can combat blue enemies and navigate through red traps with minimal damage, and the blue form has the same capabilities. The game gradually introduces this mechanic, increasing the difficulty level as you progress. Initially, you get accustomed to the basic controls, but soon you will be leaping across colour-coded platforms, needing to switch between red and blue forms swiftly. While the combat is relatively basic, even with the colour-switching element, and the variety of enemies is decent, the game’s boss fights are less compelling, ranging from tedious, like the golem encounters, to frustrating, such as a dragon battle.</p>

<p>Abilities are unlocked progressively in the game, from granting players a charge attack to moving up to a beam attack capable of eliminating multiple enemies or inflicting significant damage on bosses. Additionally, you can unlock environmental features such as teleporters, which provide access to previously visited levels, and leap pads that allow exploration of new world areas. Earning coins by exploring and defeating enemies enables you to enhance the hero’s health and increase the hero’s abilities’ charge capacity. However, obtaining these upgrades in Outland is not straightforward; it’s not merely a matter of accessing a menu and allocating points. Players must venture through Outland to discover upgrade statues, which are often hidden away from the main paths.</p>

<p>Outland’s visual design still holds up today, and there are moments where you see how the decisions made in Outland have influenced the future games, as well as building on the Housemarque games that came before. The final boss has designs elements that would not look out of place from Resogun or Returnal, and you cna see the developer’s trademark style starting to form. The music also deserves a special mention, elevating even those boring fights into something more frantic and engaging. It just sets up that some of these battles are meant to be epic in scale, and the final boss theme is incredible, even if the fight itself is basic.</p>
<p>Outland has become one of those games that’s increasingly difficult to add to your games library. It’s no longer available on Steam or the PlayStation Network, but you can still purchase it on the Xbox Store. Alternatively, you can obtain a physical Xbox 360 copy through the Ubisoft Triple Pack, which includes Outland, From Dust, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil HD, which has backward compatibility.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/16-of-rise-of-the-ronin-players-hugged-every-cat.935679/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-the-ronin-cat-stats<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a set of statistics showing how players engaged with&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>'s various activities, and the game's cat quest has proven surprisingly (or perhaps completely unsurprisingly) popular.</p>
<p>While Sony and Team Ninja's open-world epic has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-showcases-dynamic-storytelling-player-choices-and-bonds-with-characters">deep historical narrative to discover</a> and plenty of the developer's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-combat-deep-dive">signature action</a> to enjoy, it turns out that finding and cuddling every cat in the game is an important activity for a number of players.</p>
<p>According to Sony, 16% of&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>players collected every cat. That's 100 cats in total, which is a lot of wandering around Edo-period Japan. I haven't played this one yet, but I'll definitely be adding to this statistic when I do.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rise-of-the-ronin-cat-stats-gun.jpg?itok=G4wY0kfS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rise-of-the-ronin-cat-stats-gun.jpg?itok=V7EUOzsJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>may have plenty of killing in it, but cats are more diverting.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's cats have proven so popular that in the latest update, a feature was added whereby you can get reacquainted with cats you've already met near Usugumo Dayu, so you can while away your hours simply loving cats and refusing to engage with the story. What a rush!</p>
<p>If you're not a cat lover, then there are plenty of other interesting statistics to pore over. Be aware that minor story spoilers for&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>follow, so if you're looking to go in without knowing anything, avert your eyes.</p>
<p>When given the choice between sparing or killing Gonzo in the main story, 35% of players chose to kill him, while 65% chose to spare him. 62% of players sided with the shogunate and 38% with anti-shogunate forces, which surprises me.</p>
<p>51% of&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>players opted for Dusk, the game's "normal" difficulty mode, while 36% played on the easier Dawn difficulty and 13% opted to challenge themselves by playing on the Twilight mode.</p>

<h2>Give Team Ninja's latest a try yourself with the&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>demo</h2>
<p>These <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/24/explore-the-top-choices-in-rise-of-the-ronin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fascinating statistics</a> aren't all you're getting by way of&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>goodies today.</p>
<p>If you're yet to check out&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>, you'll be pleased to know that a demo is now available <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/rise-of-the-ronin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Store</a>, so you can see whether this one is for you or not.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE (12:05 PM ET):</strong> Humble Games has denied using AI to write the statement put out by the company regarding the layoffs and restructuring. </p>



<p>In addition to that, a spokesperson for the company says that “Humble Games and Ziff Davis are not commenting further about the ongoing restructuring at this time.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: On Tuesday it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/humble-games-lays-off-entire-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed that layoffs were happening</a> at Humble Games, a subsidiary of IGN Entertainment. Despite many believing it was a closure of the publishing studio, the company put out a statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/humble-games-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying that it was a “restructure”</a> rather than a closure of Humble Games.</p>



<p>Now, nearly 24 hours later, the situation is only getting messier. </p>



<p>On Tuesday, former Humble Bundle creative lead Chris Radley <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on LinkedIn</a> that what was happening was “NOT a restructuring of operations. This is a total shutdown of Humble Games.”</p>



<p>He continued: <em>“Operations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left. DO NOT believe this AI message written by the parent company of Humble Games, Ziff Davis, who are trying to mitigate pushback. This was ONCE AGAIN a failure of leadership across the board, and once again hard working talented staff are paying the cost for their poor decisions. Every ex-employee is being gaslit by this narrative and its so disrespectful.”</em></p>



<p>What’s more is that <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aftermath</a> was sent a recording that confirmed that all current Humble Games projects would be handled by The Powell Group, a third-party company.</p>



<p>Steve Horowitz, president of technology and shopping at Ziff Davis, said that the company failed multiple times to sell Humble Games before deciding to shut it down. Horowitz said that attempts to sell the company didn’t produce “a viable offer or outcome”.</p>



<p>He then went on to say that the company has seen “an additional millions increase in development expenses” leading to a “very tough but necessary decision to restructure all of Humble Games”.</p>



<p>“As such, we’re gonna be using a third-party to help us manage the slate moving forward, as well as the back catalog,” Horowitz said. “As a result, all roles within Humble Games are gonna be impacted.”</p>



<p>Despite being called a “restructure”, there are no employees left at Humble Games. The company, for all intents and purposes, is no more aside from a name. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has once again reached out to IGN Entertainment and their parent company Ziff Davis for more clarification. Specially, we have asked about the claims that the statement was written by AI and how the company will move forward with no employees.</p>



<p>Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-desert-biome-possibly-coming-to-reload/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1816128743888609327" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, reliable leaker HYPEX supported leaks by SpushFNBR and KPMisParrot that tease the Desert Biome may be coming to Reload. </p>



<p>Loosely translated from the post <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1816126192711524462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by SpushFNBR</a>, a material with the same codename as Chapter 1’s desert biome was modified in version 30.30. </p>



<p>This implies that the Fortnite team could be working on reintroducing the desert biome. SamLeakss, also notable for Fortnite leaks, further supported the desert biome should be added to Reload “soon.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The desert biome of chapter one remains a beloved and nostalgic area, though it didn’t offer many named locations. </p>



<p>Fortnite Reload is the 40-player Battle Royale game with central reboot mechanics. It continues to thrive well enough, though fans are looking forward to another big update for Reload.</p>



<p>In addition to Reload, other recent Fortnite leaks pointed to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-introduce-a-deadpool-wolverine-bundle-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential tie-in bundle</a> for the upcoming film Deadpool and Wolverine. </p>



<p>Just today, Fortnite did update its X social account with artwork teasing a Deadpool takeover. This adds a lot of validity to previous leaks about the bundle.</p>



<p>Fortnite just released its massive v30.30 update this week. The update introduces a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fall-guys-collaboration-arrives-in-uefn-following-delay/">Fall Guys collaboration</a>, a new season of Rocket Racing, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rocket-league-adding-tesla-cybertruck-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divisive Tesla Cybertruck</a>.</p>



<p>At this time, the Fortnite team did not officially confirm anything about the desert biome making a big return.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/24/dungeons-and-kingdoms-mixes-medieval-fantasy-with-polygonal-dungeon-delving/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We do enjoy a good bit of medieval fantasy at TheSixthAxis, so we welcome with open arms the announcements of Dungeons and Kingdoms, a game that is seemingly about building up your domain, or kingdom, and then adventuring down into some dark, mine-like areas. Possibly dungeons. There’s nothing wrong with a Ronseal-like name for a game though, and if you like both of those things too, we’re off to a good start.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dungeons and Kingdoms | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hrNzDad5Fg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer sees you astride your polygonal mount, surveying the landscape, before giving us a taste of what you’ll need to do to turn a tiny village into a full-blown kingdom, starting with chopping down trees (doesn’t it always?) and building wooden huts, before going off in search of great wealth and treasure by heading into a dungeon to fight off evil creatures like skeletons, giant snake beasts and the odd dragon.</p>
<p>It’s definitely got it’s own unique art style going on, and it’s looks as though you’re going to be able to really get into the nitty-gritty of building and adventuring, with hopefully an array of different tools and building types to work on. You can either work on things yourself, or become a lord by ordering all the lowly serfs to do it for you instead.</p>
<p>Alongside building things up, you can manipulate the landscape, creating hills, mountains, rivers and moats to bring your kingdom to life, and make it truly your own. Besides that, you can farm for crops, hunt wild animals, and create the infrastructure needed for an expanding kingdom</p>


<p>While there’s no set date for release, the development team at Uncle Grouch Gaming are eying up an Early Access launch in either Q4 2024 or Q1 2025, with a demo showcase due in an upcoming Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>You can wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3092110/Dungeons__Kingdoms/">Dungeons and Kingdoms right now on Steam</a>, and stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more!</p>

			<p>Delta Force: Hawk Ops is a free-to-play platformer with tactical shooter elements. The developers behind it have officially announced that the official Alpha Test for the game will be open for players to participate in as of August 6. They are expecting a big turnout for the Alpha test, as over 600,000 people have wishlisted the game on Steam and the Epic Games Store thus far.</p>
<p>For those who want to see what <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-qa-early-access-in-october-release-window-in-q1-2025/">Delta Force: Hawk Ops</a> is all about, you will need to sign up to participate in the <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha test</a>, where you can experience two game modes: Hazard Operations and Havoc Warfare. Signing up for the Alpha test is easy, as you have to go to the official website for Delta Force: Hawk Ops and register your interest in participating. Alternatively, you can go to the Steam webpage for the game and register interest there. Finally, you can follow the developers on X, where they will be announcing a Twitch Drop of codes for people interested in taking part in the Alpha test for Delta Force: Hawk Ops.</p>
<p>The developers behind the newest iteration in the Delta Force franchise have released a small statement expressing their joy with seeing how hugely anticipated this upcoming game is. "We are immensely grateful for the incredible support and enthusiasm shown by our community. Hitting 600,000 wishlists is a remarkable achievement, and we couldn't have done it without our dedicated players," said Shadow Guo, the Game Director at Team Jade.</p>
<p>The two modes available in the alpha test are wildly different. Havoc Warfare is a large-scale battle with multiple teams battling it on gigantic maps. You can utilize an arsenal of weaponry and military vehicles, such as tanks and Aircraft, to get the advantage over your opponent.</p>
<p>Hazard Operations has players split off into rival teams. They have to take on AI-controlled mercenaries and Royal Guards, and random events happen across the map to allow the teams to gain an advantage. There are two maps for players to explore and various PvE challenges to overcome to reign victorious.</p>
<p>The latest iteration of the Delta Force franchise is still in relatively early stages of development. For those interested, the game will be available on PC, Console, and Mobile. Not only will there be a variety of multiplayer activities to participate in, but there will also be a high-intensity single-player and co-op campaign that you can play through if you're looking to get more of a story fix to your game. The campaign is inspired by the 2001 Ridley Scott movie Black Hawk Down.</p>

<p>Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/24/gran-turismo-7-update-1-49-brings-six-new-cars-updated-physics-simulation-model-and-more-on-july-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has announced the next</a> Gran Turismo 7 update for all players, and it includes a number of new cars along with changes to the game’s physics model. </p>



<p>Starting with the new cars, six new vehicles are coming to the game. In a mix of old and new, Gran Turismo 7 will see the following cars added:</p>



<ul>
<li>BMW M3 ’97</li>



<li>Ferrari 430 Scuderia ’07</li>



<li>Genesis X Gran Racer Vision Gran Turismo Concept</li>

</p></figure>



<p>Moving on to the physics model, Sony says it’s a “major update” to the system for the game.</p>



<p>“This update mainly affects the suspension physics model and tire physical calculation model resulting in much more natural weight shifting during cornering,” Sony said. “Tire response has also been improved, along with more realistic tire heating and wear. Look forward to more dynamic car movement and a further polished driving feel.”</p>



<p>Other updates to Gran Turismo 7 include new menus in the GT Cafe, new World Circuits, Pokal wheel brand to GT Auto, and new AI agent named Gran Turismo Sophy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-shareholder-qa<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its latest shareholder Q&amp;A summary, and while some of the questions asked by shareholders are perfectly sane and sensible, there are some that truly beggar belief.</p>
<p>The summary&nbsp;gives Capcom shareholders a chance to ask the company pertinent questions about its operations, and if you ask me, some of those questions truly demonstrate that some Capcom shareholders don't appear to know the first thing about video games or how they're made.</p>
<p>One shareholder, for instance, asks Capcom whether it wouldn't be more prudent, from a profit perspective, to bump the release date of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>up from 2025 to "the December 2024 holiday season". Why didn't every other studio ever think of that?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-shareholder-qa-slope.jpg?itok=CundxPcY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-shareholder-qa-slope.jpg?itok=1zsQ8zqk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A Capcom shareholder wants to know why Capcom doesn't just release&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>earlier. Genius!</figcaption></figure><p>The studio's response is characteristically patient. Capcom simply says that it will announce&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' release date "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-capcom">once preparations are complete</a>" and reiterates the studio's commitment to a goal of 10% or better profit growth each year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, another shareholder asks whether the gaming giant has thought about engaging in a share buyback scheme in order to ensure "the current share price is appropriate" and that share prices aren't "simply left to the market".</p>
<p>Capcom's response to this question is fairly stock; it says that it typically engages in share buyback schemes and the like "after comprehensively considering several factors". Given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-layoffs-share-buyback">state of the industry right now</a>, I can't say I'm particularly sad Capcom doesn't seem to have any plans in this direction.</p>
<p>One shareholder asks Capcom about whether&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>will be limited to "non-portable consoles", which is, on the surface, a reference to the Switch, but which could also be read as an attempt to perhaps tease some information out regarding the Switch's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">much-talked-about successor</a>. No such luck, sadly.</p>

One asks about what's in the pipeline for&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>, for instance, to which the studio responds that it is "considering how to create games" for the franchise.</p>
<p>Another wonders why Capcom hasn't made a cozy game yet, and while I can't say I'm personally sad about this, I can't deny there would be a significant market for it. Who doesn't want to chill with a cute Palico in Raccoon City?</p>
<p>It's worth reading the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/assets/pdf/stock/2024capcom_d.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full shareholder Q&amp;A</a> if you want to see what kind of issues the shareholders hold close to their hearts, and also if you want to know why shareholders probably shouldn't be allowed any kind of creative control over games.</p>
