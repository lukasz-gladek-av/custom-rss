<p>Diablo 4’s Lord of Hatred DLC overhauls skill trees, adds talismans, the Horadric Cube, and introduces long-awaited loot filters.</p>



<p>During the 30th-anniversary Diablo presentation on February 11, it was announced that the Warlock class was coming to 3 Diablo games, including Diablo 4.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was announced that major updates would overhaul parts of Diablo 4, with the Lord of Hatred update coming in April. One of those updates is a major change to how skill trees work.</p>



<p>The team even joked about hearing players call skill trees “skill twigs,” but that is coming to an end.</p>



<p>“We’re adding new customization options to every single skill across the entire tree,” they revealed. “It isn’t just a small tweak, it’s a major disruption to the current class system.”</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-skill-tree-updates-are-coming-to-every-class-in-diablo-4">Skill Tree Updates Are Coming to Every Class in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>It was stated that every class will receive skill tree updates with more than 40 choices and over 80 additional options. Those who purchased the Lord of Hatred DLC will have 20 additional transformative skill options.</p>



<p>Plus, they’re introducing talismans, which will add even more adjustments to your characters. The DLC is also introducing the Horadric Cube, another way to continue shaping your endgame journey. They also excitedly announced that loot filters are finally being added to give players more control over their items.</p>

<p>If you plan on picking up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> on the Switch 2 this week, be ready for a day one update bumping the new software up to Version 1.0.1.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/switch2/software_support/aaaea/101/index.html">Nintendo's official patch notes</a> on its Japanese website, the development team has apparently fixed some issues to improve the gameplay. Like other Nintendo titles nowadays, this launch update is also required to access the game's Switch Online features.</p>
<p>Once you've completed this update, you'll no longer be able to play locally or via LAN with older versions of the game - so make sure you are running the same version when playing together with family and friends.</p><div><figure data-videoid="R703wKSF5X4" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytR703wKSF5X4" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8b0932lkzvhm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>As our reviewer PJ O'Reilly mentioned in his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever review</a>, the main adventure mode is a bit of a letdown, and solo players don't have a lot of options, but there's depth and strategy at the core here that should see this one ace things online for some time to come. So you'll want to get online play up and running!</p>

<p>As part of this launch, Nintendo has also released a new set of Mario Tennis Fever Switch Online icons today. New waves will be available every week until <strong>11th March 2026</strong>. These icons will set you back <strong>10 Platinum Points</strong> each, and as usual, the borders and backgrounds go for <strong>5 Platinum Points</strong> each.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace is a virtual boyfriend game (also known as an otome game) where you play as a character who fights monster aliens while five men fight for her love. It's available to download on iOS and Android and works on the old free-to-play, gacha mechanic. The ultimate aim is to build your relationships with one, two, or all of the men (we listen and we don't judge) by interacting with them, fighting alongside them, texting them, completing their storylines and even… playing with claw machines to collect plushies. It was developed by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/papergames"><u>Papergames</u></a>, which is also the studio behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-review"><u>Infinity Nikki</u></a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What's the plot of Love and Deepspace?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You know how it goes, a Deepspace Tunnel opens up and suddenly alien monsters are causing havoc. As the main character living in 2034, in the fictional Linkon City, it's your job to battle these alien monsters as part of an organisation called the Hunters Association. The Hunters all wield a special ability called an Evol and yours is Resonance, one that works alongside other Evol wielders' to boost their skills. Throw in a shady biotech company called EVER, an organized crime syndicate called Onychinus, the Farspace Fleet, medical experiments and secrets a plenty, and you've got the storyline that makes the average love story look like child's play. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Who are the men of Love and Deepspace?</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Men of Love And Deepspace</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are five potential love interests in Love and Deepspace. Each has a different personality and storyline, but the one thing they all have in common is being obsessed with you. You can choose to focus on just one or play the field, and while they are mentioned in each other's storylines, they don't interact directly. Each has a specific Evol (think superpower) and multiple storylines that take place in both the modern day and in different lifetimes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Light spoiler warnings ahead, although the non-linear way in which you unlock memories means piecing the storylines together is more of a puzzle than a straight path. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Xavier</strong> - Fights alongside you as a Hunter, gentle and caring, is actually a time traveller from the future. His Evol is light. </li><li><strong>Zayne</strong> - A cardiac surgeon with a grumpy outer shell but a sweet toothed gooey middle. His Evol is ice. </li><li><strong>Rafayel</strong> - A sensitive, pouty artist who hates cats and is actually one of the last survivors of an ancient race called the Lemurians. His Evol is fire. </li><li><strong>Sylus</strong> - Powerful and strategic, with distinctive silver hair and red eyes, Sylus is the leader of the crime syndicate called Onychinus. His Evol is Energy.</li><li><strong>Caleb</strong> - The main character's adoptive brother, and a Farspace Fleet pilot. Protective and possessive, he was one thought dead, but returned as a Colonel in the Farspace Fleet. His Evol is Gravity.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What are the mechanics in Love and Deepspace?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a whole bunch of mechanics in Love and Deepspace, and all of them contribute to your relationship with the different male characters. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Combat</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You take on different combat challenges in the storyline to progress, and regular activities like bounty hunts or Hunter training to earn rewards. You're always paired with one of the male characters, and your choice of special attacks will depend on their Evol. Players have the option to set combat to an auto mode where the battle plays out without your input.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Texts and phonecalls</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll receive texts from each of the men at various points, and you're giving a selection of dialogue options to reply with. As your relationship increases you'll also get phone calls from them to discuss various events or check in. You can also comment on their posts on a Facebook like feed, send them emojis, and poke them.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Physical Interactions</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You interact with each of the men in a setting called the Destiny Cafe. You can touch various parts of their body to elicit reactions, feel their heartbeat, or blow on your microphone.  </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Conversation</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In the Destiny cafe you can also prompt them to have different types of conversations with you. You can get them to introduce themselves to your family or friends (a great way to weird your parents out over lunch) or to suggest what you should have for breakfast. Again, the dialogue options are heavily guardrailed so this isn't going to head into AI sexbot territory. Sorry. You can also use the notebook function to ask them to set reminders for you, everything from important dates to tracking your period. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Quality Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically the world's most handsome Pomodoro timers. You can choose to Work, Workout, Study or Sleep for a set amount of time with any of the guys, and you can even do it in AR mode, so that you can reach new heights of comforting delusion by framing them in your real surroundings. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dates</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With Love and Deepspace dates you can go with the guys to try and grab plush toys at a claw machine, play a game called Kitty Cards against them, and go to a photo studio to get video or snapshots with them, or of them. You can style them, change the poses and backgrounds, and they have way more patience than any real life love interest would. In this section you can also update a personal journal with stickers and notes and photos, listen to audio recordings starring them, or access 'Falling for You' videos and visual novels content telling the story of your relationship.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Home </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A recent addition, this mode brings a bit of The Sims to Love and Deepspace. You have a house to decorate with new rooms unlocking as you complete activities in the home, and each of the men can spend time with you there. It's kinda cute to see badass Sylus dusting bookshelves because you've told him to do chores. There's a gardening element too, where you can grow flowers that can be used in flower arranging without or without the boy's input, and new blooms can be unlocked by hybridizing the plants. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/11/1-1-1770854296968.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>How do the gacha mechanics work in Love and Deepspace?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/genshin-impact"><u>Genshin Impact</u></a>, you can buy or earn wishes to speed up your progress in Love and Deepspace, and there's a number of in-game currencies which can be earned or bought. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here the wishes represent memories with the men of Love and Deepspace, with different rarities and values attached to each. Five star memories, for instance, can be used to experience Each memory can be upgraded with Heartsand and crystals which can be earned by taking part in bounty hunts, or completing tasks and protocores, which are collected through combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some memories are only available during special events, though those events are repeated sporadically to allow you more than one chance to grab specific wishes. Previous events have included a Star Wars style Throne of Eros storyline and Mortality's Tenderness, which has a classical Chinese theme. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ghosts-galore-board-game-review-scary-fast</link>
            <guid>1433125</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Deep in an abandoned mine shaft, the still, musty air is filled with the moans of ghosts, clacking of skeletons, and glop-glopping of slime creatures. They’ve been shambling around, unseen, for who knows how long. And quite frankly, it gets boring down there! Do you have what it takes to help them turn eternity into something a little more exciting? That’s the question at the heart of <em>Ghosts Galore</em>, a new board game by Michael Luu! Asmodee USA sent along a copy for me to check out, so ride along for my <em>Ghosts Galore</em> review!</p><h2><strong>What Is </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-game-components.jpg?itok=9YqUjyMR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghosts-galore-game-components.jpg?itok=ob9xnx83 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p><em>Ghosts Galore </em>is a tile-laying board game for two to five players, with an estimated run-time of about twenty minutes. In our play testing, some games (between two players) went even faster than that!</p><p>In <em>Ghosts Galore</em>, you’re here to help those ghosts have a less-boring afterlife, by laying down mine cart track tiles filled with gems and various ghosts. Each type of ghost scores differently, and you’ll want to make clever connections on your tracks to rack up points.</p><p>Comprised of two-sided player boards, a stack of track tiles, a score pad, and mine cart tokens, it’s a quick little game that doesn’t take up much shelf space at all.</p><h2><strong>How Do You Play </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>After creating piles of track tiles, you’ll begin each round by drawing a token and either claiming it for your board or sending it to the general supply. Once there’s only one player left who hasn’t claimed a tile, all of the tiles in the stack are revealed and that player has their choice of the leftovers.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-claiming-tiles.jpg?itok=QQsvNRCj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghosts-galore-claiming-tiles.jpg?itok=H_gECk7S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>Points are awarded for completing tracks (the entire edge of the board is filled with mine shaft doors), with two special doors granting extra points for connecting them.</p><p>But the real point-scoring shindig happens with all the different ghosts on your board. The term “ghost” is a little fluid here, as you’ll find tiles with floating ghosts, werewolves, dragons, bats, and more. Maybe it should have been called Monsters Galore, but points for the <em>Ghosts Galore</em> alliteration.</p><p>These scoring mechanisms all interact with each other in interesting ways, and scores are tallied at the end of the game on a handy score sheet. The skeletons score based on the number of diamonds on your board, each bat scores 5 points if its tile is adjacent to at least one tile with another bat, and dragons score based on the number of dragons on your board (but you get -5 points if you don’t have any dragons).</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-tracks.jpg?itok=GEgh97yk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghosts-galore-tracks.jpg?itok=qwZa2bBq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>This creates an in-depth, interlocking scoring mechanism that encourages thoughtful tile placement and leads to the game feeling deeper than it should for its short run-time.</p><h2><strong>How Does The Gameplay Feel In </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>One of the things I think is most intriguing about the game is that tile selection mechanic I’ve mentioned above in the How to Play section. You can either snatch up that one key piece you need, or hold out to see if something better comes along. This creates a nice little tension you don’t normally see in a game like this.</p><p>One note I have, however, is that - at least in our initial plays, keeping track of how all of the different ghosts scored was a little overwhelming. It ended up being more of a case of us saying “Ehhh… let’s just try to connect tracks, and then see how we score our ghosts afterwards.”</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-ghost-scoring-sheet.jpg?itok=2N627-NP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghosts-galore-ghost-scoring-sheet.jpg?itok=cMYHPj74 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>This is in no way an overly complicated game, mind you, but for those first few plays discerning the scoring of nine different monsters was daunting - just because of how much referencing back to the rules was needed. I’m happy to report, however, that after two or three plays, we had a good sense of what most ghosts did, and gameplay flowed even quicker.</p><h2><em><strong>Ghosts Galore - </strong></em><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Ghosts Galore</em> is a fun, think-y little tile laying game that plays fast once you know what you’re looking for on your tile track. As mentioned above, the complexity of placing the perfect ghosts on your board for the kind of scoring you’re going for could leave players with a bit of analysis paralysis, but I’ve found in our playing of the game that it’s more fun to go with the flow.</p><p>Art-wise, the style in <em>Ghosts Galore</em> may not be everyone’s cup of tea, as it leans into a cutesy, almost chibi-like character design for the ghosts. For players looking for something a little more down to earth (even though we <em>are</em> talking about fantastical creatures here), this design might not quite hit what they’re looking for.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghosts-galore-character-design.jpg?itok=2j8WqX38 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghosts-galore-character-design.jpg?itok=cHBDoUGb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>All in all, if you’re looking for a fun, fast game that encourages thoughtful tile-placement without being too in-the-weeds (especially once you understand how all the ghosts score), <em>Ghosts Galore</em> is definitely worth checking out.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of </em>Ghosts Galore<em> used in the creation of this review was provided by Asmodee USA.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

      <p>Multiple developers from Wildlight, maker of the online shooter <em>Highguard</em>, have posted on Linkedin today that they've been laid off, just two weeks after the game's release.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427501095955914752/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Sound designers</u></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427496511334277121/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>gameplay engineers</u></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427497173774225409/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>tech artists</u></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427500304054693890/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>UI designers</u></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427480816940892161/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>level designers</u></a> are among those affected. While some have only shared their own personal status, two have said in posts that the layoffs impact "most of the team".</p><p>A statement issued by Wildlight says that "a number of our team members" have been let go, while a "core group of developers" works to keep "innovating on and supporting the game". </p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p><p>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together.

</figure><p>If indeed "most" of the team has been laid off, so soon after release, that doesn't bode well for the future of a game that, despite some weird and very 2026 challenges, by all accounts seemed totally fine.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/highguard-release-steam-pc-concord-youtube-shadow-drop/"><div><p>Highguard Is Yet Another Symptom – And Victim – Of A Rapidly Decaying Internet</p><p>In an online ecosystem ruled by cynics, clip farmers, and ragebaiters (and built by those who seek to profit off them), Highguard never stood a chance of having a normal launch</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure><p>This news hits the same week as<a href="https://aftermath.site/2xko-riot-release-console-layoffs/"> <u>news another game (Riot's <em>2XKO</em>) laid off developers just days after release</u></a>, seemingly because of unrealistic expectations from studio leadership. The situation with Wildlight is different, though; the company had self-published <em>Highguard</em>, meaning whatever led to these layoffs, it wasn’t some publisher or giant company demanding numbers go up.&nbsp;</p><p>A free-to-play PVP shooter, <em>Highguard </em>had a strong launch--around <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/?ref=aftermath.site#max"><u>100,000</u></a> people were playing on Steam on its first day--but couldn't sustain those numbers, in ways that...look, you know what, why am I even talking about those figures, writers always do that when talking about layoffs like this, is there even much point trying to dissect the numbers of a game that took <em>years </em>to make, but where ‘most’ of the team gets laid off just two weeks after it came out? Loads of people are now reportedly out of a job, and whatever reasons people can offer or accept for it, none of it seems sane or sustainable.&nbsp;</p>

Initially, at least, it resulted in a wave of positive comments from fans.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">🛠️Attention, Raiders!<br>We've just deployed a new hotfix to address additional reported issues:<br>• Fixed an inventory slot mechanic duplication glitch<br>• Fixed an infinite ammo weapon glitch<br>• Fixed an issue where some quests were missing from the Headwinds update<br>• Fixed an… <a href="https://t.co/xv0k1dIQ1t" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xv0k1dIQ1t</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2021602130323227105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Say what you want about embark,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r1zvfy/comment/o4t6g0y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>, “but this was QUICK!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Dude I was literally in firing range, tried it (successfully), went back to Speranza to grab a bobcat and give it a 100 round mag in practice range, and it just stopped working,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r1zvfy/comment/o4t953g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Insane work Embark, I didn't even restart my client.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders has suffered from those looking to take advantage of dupe exploits since its launch in October, and Embark has played whac-a-mole with cheaters and exploiters since. This was the case earlier this week, when the Stockholm-based studio launched <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-gets-pve-focused-event-and-new-rewards-as-embark-squashes-duplication-bug-in-new-update"><u>an update</u></a> fixing the latest dupe glitch only to find reports of a new one cropping up shortly after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an annoyance for players, who are often forced to confront Raiders who have earned their items and in-game currency through illegitimate means, and it’s apparently keeping Embark up at night, too. As players – and even popular streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/theburntpeanut/clip/KnottyFineSwallowSaltBae-7izWpIHRKvqiEVO6?filter=clips&amp;range=24hr&amp;sort=time" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheBurntPeanut</u></a> – began showcasing examples of the latest glitches, the developer launched the new hotfix, bringing adjustments just one day after its last patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to fixing the inventory slot mechanic duplication glitch and infinite ammo weapon glitch, the update tackles two bugs related to quests. Embark says it is “dedicated to investigating and squashing exploits” in Arc Raiders and will “keep you in the loop” regarding future issues. The problem is, these issues are already here, with what appears to be hundreds of players already taking to various Arc Raiders social media accounts to share that they’ve been impacted by a new problem.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨BREAKING 🚨 Since today's hotfix to fix the infinite ammo glitch, there are many reports of Raiders losing their loot when they extract.

It’s unclear if this is an ongoing issue or if the lost loot bug is only affecting those who were mid-raid while the hotfix was published. The confusion has been enough to see fans directly ask Embark for their loot to be returned, while others worry a new topside run could result in them losing their gear, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Embark,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r20hlf/since_the_infinite_ammo_hotfix_players_are_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player said</u></a>, “come on guys.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Damn, they fix one thing and break something else entirely,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r20hlf/comment/o4tekrs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>. “Good lookin out!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear how the Embark team plans to handle the latest Arc Raiders glitch.

It's an unexpected update that brings the class to all three of today's games, with the full spotlight detailing how each offers different playstyles for different kinds of action RPG fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blizzard Is Summoning the Reign of the Warlock for Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><blockquote data-theme="light">— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021721334435205162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard’s 2021 reimagining might be a mostly faithful remake of a classic game, but that doesn’t mean it can’t add to it. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise, Diablo 2: Resurrected is getting a new expansion called Reign of the Warlock – and it’s out today for PC (including Steam), PlayStation, and Xbox for $24.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The content adds the demon-summoning Warlock as an all-new class not present in the original experience. It allows players to summon, bind, and devour demons, shaking up the Diablo 2 formula for the first time in 25 years.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blizzard Talks Terror Zones in Diablo 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With Reign of the Warlock comes a few tweaks to Terror Zones. Specifically, players can now be stalked by hunters called Heralds of Terror when playing on Hell difficulty. Terrorized bosses beaten on the same difficulty mode also now unveil statues, with players encouraged to combine five of them to access new endgame bosses called the Colossal Ancients.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Quality-of-Life Adjustments Add Loot Filers, Advanced Stash Tabs, and More to Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The new quality of life changes in Reign of the Warlock give you sharper tools for even the darkest of journeys. <a href="https://t.co/yOWzcZ9my6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/yOWzcZ9my6</a></p>— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021717067406487856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, time for what most fans expected when they heard Diablo 2: Resurrected would be featured at the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight: quality-of-life changes. Blizzard now allows players to create, share, and check out community loot filters, all without the use of mods. The update also comes with the ability to stack stash items alongside the addition of dedicated tabs for materials, gems, and runes. Finally, The Chronicle is an item tracker for players who like their Diablo experience to be nice and organized.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A First Look at the Warlock in Diablo Immortal</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/11/diablo-immortal-warlock-1770852504435.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo Immortal Warlock Class. Image courtesy of Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This June, Blizzard is bringing the Warlock to Diablo Immortal. This version of the summoning class utilizes demon skull, a sacrificial blade, and a beast known as the Soulgorger. The Warlock will get her own origin quest explaining her backstory at an unspecified point in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lut Gholein Joins the Warlock in Diablo Immortal</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That previously teased location coming to Diablo Immortal is none other than Lut Gholein. Players will find the iconic location has been split between its Common Ward and High Ward districts, with Blizzard explaining that it pulled inspiration from real-world Moroccan cities when bringing it back to life.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Return of the Demon Queen Andariel</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo Immortal's next "big bad" is the Maidan of Anguish, Andariel. She's sporting a new look, too, with associate art director Emil Salim describing her as "domineering, equal parts regal, and sadistic," adding that "she's driven by nothing less than a desire for dark godhood."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Diablo Immortal Roadmap Sets Fire to 2026</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/11/diablo-immortal-roadmap-1770852022171.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo Immortal Roadmap 2026. Image courtesy of Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Diablo Immortal team has big plans for 2026. A roadmap shared during the 30th Anniversary Spotlight showed off just a few of the updates players can expect in the coming months, with some examples including a new battleground event and updates to classic zones. Expect a new subzone, along with new monsters and bounties, every quarter, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yes, the Second Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred Class is the Warlock</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the leaks and rumors weren’t enough to give it away, the Warlock is officially confirmed to join the Paladin when Lord of Hatred launches for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox April 28. Blizzard plans to share more about the new Diablo 4 class during a developer update that’s set to take place March 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lord of Hatred Is More Than Just a Class Expansion</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight gave fans a first look at how Lord of Hatred expands on Diablo 4 with Skovos and its many mountains and temples. Today’s presentation focuses on Temis, the location’s capital city and an area that holds more information about the Askari, the Prime Evils, and the origins of Sanctuary.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Skill Trees and the Talisman System</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Forge a brand new path through Sanctuary with the all-new skill tree system coming to Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred 🌳 <a href="https://t.co/UBMf4gX5wl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/UBMf4gX5wl</a></p>— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021718519596097808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Major changes are coming to Diablo 4, regardless of whether you choose to pick up Lord of Hatred. Referring to a running joke that has seen players calling the game’s skill trees “skill twigs,” associate game director Zaven Haroutunian unveiled a closer look at the skill tree rework launching with the expansion this April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Blizzard team says it’s about giving players “meaningful choices and options” from the get-go, calling it a “major disruption to the current class system.” One example shown during the presentation highlights the Sorcerer’s Hydra skill, which players can fine-tune to increase attack speed, launch explosions, and even use frost projectiles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Talisman, meanwhile, is a new itemization system with Lord of Hatred that brings back charms and sets. Footage of the foundational update teases more ways for players to customize their builds to their playstyle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">“They’re going to freak out…”</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Game director Brent Gibson closed out the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight with a tease of what’s to come. In a tongue-in-cheek moment just before the event reached its conclusion, Gibson says, “Oh, my god. They’re going to freak out at BlizzCon when we announce—.” There’s no telling what exactly Diablo fans have to look forward to, but it at least sounds like Blizzard has plans to pull back the curtain when BlizzCon takes place September 12 - 13.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

<p>Notably, he says there was a lot of unreleased content that he and the team had designed for the game, which he was looking forward to sharing with the public.</p>



<p>Wildlight shared a statement on<a href="https://x.com/i/status/2021745168387596450" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> social media</a> confirming several layoffs. They confirmed that a core group of developers will continue to support the game.</p>

<p>“We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community,” the statement read.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-bumpy-road-for-highguard">The Bumpy Road for Highguard</h2>



<p>Highguard launched on January 26 and received mostly negative reviews on Steam from the outset. They continued to push forward with updates, including new modes and events, but less than a month later, news broke of massive layoffs.</p>



<p>The game was launched with big hype as the final announcement from the 2025 Game Awards ceremony. However, there was virtual radio silence following that event until the game’s launch.</p>







<h2 id="h-layoffs-becoming-more-common-in-the-gaming-space">Layoffs Becoming More Common in the Gaming Space</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, mass layoffs are becoming a trend in the gaming industry. Ubisoft recently underwent a major restructuring, resulting in the cancellation of multiple projects, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.</a></p>



<p>Wildgate also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wildgate-developer-moonshot-confirms-layoffs/" id="171549">recently announced</a> layoffs. As did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">Riot Games.</a></p>

Now, just a few weeks after the game's launch, most of the team has reportedly been laid off. That's according to former Highguard level designer Alex Graner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh/">who posted on LinkedIn today</a>, stating, "Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today."&nbsp;</p><p>In Graner's post, he says this layoff "really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard." If we take his words literally, it sounds like that content might never be released, which would be shocking but not unprecedented in this industry, which has been under constant disruption due to layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Highguard has been climbing a steep hill since <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/new-fantasy-shooter-highguard-announced-from-former-titanfall-devs">its reveal as the final "world premiere" at The Game Awards 2025</a> back in December. Its reveal didn't go over well with audiences, likely due to its placement as the closing spot during the awards ceremony and its difficult-to-parse style of FPS. Nonetheless, Wildlight released the game for free on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 26.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Game Informer </em>Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller called it a promising contender in his <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/highguard/promising-contender">Highguard review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wildlight Entertainment, the studio behind the new not-hero shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a>, has reportedly laid off “most” of its team just weeks after the game launched on January 26.</p> <p>Level designer Alex Graner posted about the news on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427480816940892161/?originTrackingId=%2FqMD4ALWpJvcsmxWmoXMGw%3D%3D">LinkedIn account</a>, saying he’s looking for whatever’s next after he and an unknown number of his fellow employees have been let go. <em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>has reached out to Wildlight for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p> <blockquote><p>Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today.</p> <p>This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for <em>Highguard</em>.</p> <p>However, I’m excited for my next adventure. If your team or anyone you know needs an experienced Level Designer, hit me up!</p></blockquote> <p><em>Highguard&nbsp;</em>was announced in December during the 2025 Game Awards, and it <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088">didn’t go over very well with some sides of the internet</a>. Then the team at Wildlight went <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-breaks-radio-silence-and-the-internet-reacts-2000662650">radio silent for weeks</a> until the game finally launched at the end of January and press and content creators <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">got hands-on time</a> with the game. The response to the final game was a bit lukewarm, though Wildlight was quick to respond to feedback about the game’s small 3v3 team compositions by <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-surprise-5v5-mode-is-sticking-around-but-its-not-enough-2000665423">adding a 5v5 mode</a> within the first week.</p>

 <p>Though the game seemed to struggle in terms of concurrent players, director and studio head Chad Grenier said in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/highguard-wildlight-interactive-interview/"><em>Polygon</em></a> that the team was less concerned with player counts than it was with making something its player base enjoyed. “Whether it gets a thousand people or a hundred million people, it doesn’t matter,” he said. “What matters most is that the game is loved by the people who played it.”</p> <p><strong>Update 2/11/2026, 7:39 p.m. ET</strong>: More and more developers are speaking publicly about the layoffs, reiterating that most of the studio seems to have been impacted.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today I was laid off from Wildlight along with most of the staff. It was the best team I've ever worked with, and I've never put so much of myself into a project before. I wouldn't trade the past 2.5+ yrs for anything.

            <title><![CDATA[How Blizzard Crafted Diablo 2’s First New Class In 26 Years: ‘We Don’t Want To Mess Up The Mona Lisa’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/diablo-2-resurrected-reign-of-the-warlock-new-class-2000667816</link>
            <guid>1433014</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Blizzard is bringing a new class to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-is-mostly-just-diablo-ii-for-be-1847741744"><i><span>Diablo II: Resurrected</span></i></a><span> for the first time ever, giving players a new way to make their way through the nearly 26-year-old RPG for the first time in decades with the </span><i><span>Reign of the Warlock </span></i><span>add-on launching today, February 11. It’s a big swing for the remaster, as it toes the line between preserving the original experience and creating something entirely new. The team is aware that some might view it as sacrilegious, so it isn’t making this change lightly.</span></p> <p><span>In a group interview on the Blizzard Irvine campus last month that</span><i><span> Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, game producer Matthew Cederquist and game designer Tim Vasconcellos talked about adding to the legacy of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-dev-folks-deciding-if-theyll-buy-1847702995"><i><span>Diablo II</span></i></a><span> and whether or not the Warlock is the last addition fans can expect. It sounds like the Warlock was one of a handful of classes in discussion, but it wasn’t the only one.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We started with maybe, I don’t know, three or four [classes] that were top of mind,” Cederquist said. “But then we kind of shopped that around to the team, and the team was most excited about two specifically out of those, but then we thought, ‘All right, we’re gonna rock out the Warlock just because the team was so excited about it.’ They’re like, ‘oh yeah, we can make this amazing.’”</span></p> <p><span>While they wouldn’t say what the runner-up class was, Vasconcellos says the Warlock’s summon-based blend of melee and ranged functionality lets it take up some unfilled space in </span><i><span>Diablo II</span></i><span>’s line-up. But still, the team worries about “painting over the Mona Lisa,” so to speak. They wanted to find ways to make the Warlock feel like a natural fit, as if it had always been in the game, and the devil is in the details.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We looked at the warlock and said, ‘Okay, so what would make this feel as if we were coming out of </span><i><span>Diablo I</span></i><span> and this is a class that would have launched with </span><i><span>Diablo 2?’</span></i><span>” Vasconcellos said.&nbsp; So you’ll find references […] Did you notice the </span><i><span>Diablo I</span></i><span> icons in the skill tree? Subtle hints like that try to make it feel familiar, as well as something that’s new still in the game. How it’s expressed and what space do you actually have to develop in that are all things that we’ve tried to consider, and we’re eager to hear from the community of whether or not we actually accomplished our design goal.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Blizzard reiterated during the interviews that the people working on </span><i><span>Diablo II: Resurrected </span></i><span>are longtime players who still play the game to this day and want anything new they bring to the package to be additive, but whether or not the studio keeps doing this will depend on whether or not players take to it. Although the team said they would like for this to not just be a one-off marking the series’ 30th anniversary, they had nothing further to announce at this time.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During today’s Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight event, Blizzard announced the series’ newest class is the Warlock, and it’s coming to Diablo II: Resurrected, Diablo Immortal, and Diablo IV — each game featuring a unique interpretation of the demon-wielding archetype. While the Diablo team is holding back details of the Warlock’s class identity in Diablo IV’s Lord of Hatred expansion and Diablo Immortal, it is bringing the new character to Diablo II: Resurrected today via the new Reign of the Warlock DLC.&nbsp;</p><p>Diablo II’s rendition of the Warlock can summon three demons: the Tainted, the Defiler, and the Goatman. The class can also bind (read: tame) themself to almost any demon in the game, benefiting from its unique abilities. Additionally, the Warlock may choose to devour the bound demon, granting themself temporary buffs based on the consumed demon.&nbsp;</p><h2>Diablo Devs Explain New Warlock Class:</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83jfLwGcZ8o"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83jfLwGcZ8o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“From the very get-go, it feels like such a natural extension of Diablo to have a character like the Warlock,” associate game director Zaven Haroutunian tells me. “From a narrative perspective, Necromancers [...] are all about maintaining a balance. They’re almost neutral in tone and in how they think. [...] Warlocks, however, are more ostentatious [...] they’re very loud with all the things they do.”</p><p>“Mechanically, they’re actually very different from Necromancers, which are all about building up an army,” Haroutunian continues. “The Warlock doesn’t do that. [...] All the stuff he’s bringing in is disposable. He doesn’t actually care about them. They are just his tools, right?”</p>

<p>When asked how the disparate teams are differentiating the class’s abilities across three games (while still maintaining a unified theme), Haroutunian tells me that each team did whatever it needed to to make the Warlock fit their game. The associate game director likens the process to the creation of Diablo IV’s recent Paladin class and how his team distinguished it from Diablo II’s standard.</p><p>Diablo II: Reign of the Warlock is available now on&nbsp;<a href="http://battle.net/">Battle.net</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/news/2026/02/11/diablos-new-class-is-the-warlock-and-its-coming-to-diablo-ii-resurrected-today]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The dataminers were right, there is a warlock class coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, as part of the The Lord of Hatred expansion that arrives in April. I played it at Blizzard a couple of weeks ago, and although I can't tell you in detail about it yet, I can say it's the dark complement to the light-bringing paladin class that's also in Lord of Hatred - the yin to its yang, if you like.</p>
<p>But there are more reasons to be excited about the warlock. One, it's a brand new class for the Diablo series, meaning the warlock has never appeared in any previous games. But two, and this is the show-stopping bit, it's coming to two other Diablo games as well: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a> Resurrected. To emphasise the show-stopping bit there: this is the first new character class Diablo 2 has had in 25 years, and it's being released today in a paid Reign of the Warlock expansion for the game. It costs $25.</p>
<p>The warlock's arrival in Diablo 2: Resurrected begins a new era for the game whereby it will progress beyond its classic state with additional ongoing development. There will effectively be two instances of the game, one known as Diablo 2: Resurrected, the time-locked classical version of the game, and a second modern version called Reign of the Warlock, which will push the game on. Is that a dangerous road to walk? Yes, but as Blizzard told a group of press I was in, "We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa." I will write more about this in a subsequent article. </p>

<p>Blizzard announced the warlock triple-drop in a Diablo Spotlight video today. The other notable major Diablo 4 announcements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fishing mechanic,</li>
<li>A skill-tree overhaul, which significantly expands what's there by adding new skills and potential for customisation</li>
<li>A new endgame pursuit called War Plans, whereby you can make bespoke lists of activities you want to do, modify them, and earn rewards for carrying them out. To me it seems like an evolution of Adventure Mode - a new pursuit to keep you busy once the game's campaigns are done</li>
<li>A "hyper-rare" event called Echoing Hatred, which throws infinite waves of enemies at you and gives you loot depending on how long you survived</li>
<li>The Horadric Cube, which lets you combine materials and items</li>
<li>Loot filters</li>
<li>And the return of Charms and Sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred launches 28th April on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The other notable Diablo 2 announcements are: Enhanced Terror Zones for the game, and new quality of life features including much-desired loot filters, advanced stash tabs, and a loot-tracking database called the Chronicle, which notes everything you've found and where you found it, thank god.

</p><p>Each of the three games' warlock interpretations are different, by the way, tailored to their various gameplay styles. Diablo 2's is perhaps the most fiddly - I have played it too - particularly in the demon taming skill tree, which lets you dominate demons you face and either use them like pets or consume them for power. It's another layer of micro-management.</p>
