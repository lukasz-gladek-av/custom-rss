            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24166583/marvel-what-if-immersive-story-apple-vision-pro-interactive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Besides watching movies, there’s not all that much to do with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">Apple’s Vision Pro</a> once you get over the novelty. That’s why I was eager to try Disney and Marvel’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152039/disney-marvel-what-if-immersive-story-vision-pro">new <em>What If…? An Immersive Story</em></a> experience / TV show / video game… thing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162362/marvels-what-if-vision-pro-mixed-reality-story-will-debut-on-may-30th">that’s available on May 30th</a>. The companies promised a mixed reality show that would&nbsp;“push the boundaries of technology.” But what I experienced, while very pretty to look at, ended up feeling like an overlong, no-stakes video game tutorial — with no game to follow it.</p><p>You’ll go through the Vision Pro-exclusive app either by standing in one spot in a virtual environment, watching things play out and participating when prompted to, or in passthrough, where you can move around while cell-shaded 3D AR characters talk to you. You play the “Hero of the Multiverse,” a nameless character who is recruited by The Watcher, narrator on the Disney Plus series, to save the multiverse by acquiring the Infinity Stones.&nbsp;</p><p>But Wong, the Master of the Mystic Arts and friend to Doctor Strange in the MCU, opposes your involvement because, well, who the heck are you? But he reluctantly trains you, and then you go on a journey through realities to acquire each Infinity Stone for vague fate-of-the-multiverse reasons. Along the way, you acquire various abilities, and Wong teaches you special gestures that activate them. You can wave your hands around to banish your opponents to the pocket dimension inside the Soul Stone or clench your hand to shoot fist lasers using the Power Stone.&nbsp;</p><p>This stuff is actually fun to do, but it’s also very constrained by the fact that you can only do it at scripted moments, which sucks. That would be fine if the story was compelling, but it’s not given any room to be. It’s just a series of brief vignettes that serve as setup for the next interactive section, then you’re dropped in to get whichever stone you’re after, at which point you learn a new skill that you may or may not use again later. Each vignette basically follows the same pattern and ends up feeling like it’s building to something that never pays off.</p><p>The biggest disappointment is that so many of the elements feel like they <em>would</em> work in a different package. It looks great, for one, and it’s fun to see The Watcher towering over me in my dining room and to get a sense of how big Thanos is actually supposed to be. I liked shooting fist lasers, too. But the end result — an experience that doesn’t go all the way to full-on video game or movie — sits in a noncommittal, unsatisfying middle zone.&nbsp;</p><p>Dave Bushore, who directed <em>What If...?</em>, told <em>The Verge </em>in an email that the experience is “holistically different than a game.” The interactive bits, he said, are meant to support the story. And Shereif M. Fattouh, an executive producer at ILM Immersive, said the team plans to keep supporting the app and will “be monitoring to see if there are any updates” needed based on user feedback. The app will only be temporarily free, though they didn’t say for how long or how much it will eventually cost. </p><p>There’s potential in the approach for <em>What If…? An Immersive Story, </em>if the team decides to do more with it. It seems clear from Bushore’s response to my questions that the format won’t veer further into game territory, and it’s hard to know from Fattouh’s answer whether the team will make any significant changes down the line to the way the story is presented. (Multiple branching paths through it would be neat, for example). But for now, it will be worth a look after it goes live tomorrow if you have a Vision Pro but don’t expect anything revolutionary. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first week brings another unique Aftermarket Part reward, but you’ll need to conquer at least five tasks to claim it. For a tantalizing glimpse, here are all the <em>MW3 </em>and <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 Week 1 challenges and their coveted rewards.</p>   <h2 id="0-all-mw3-season-4-week-1-challenges" data-injectable="false">All MW3 Season 4 Week 1 challenges</h2> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true"><em>MW3’s </em>Week 1 challenges offer a diverse range of tasks, with a primary focus on Recommended Assault Rifles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-ten-scariest-foreign-language-horror-movies/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-ten-scariest-foreign-language-horror-movies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="399" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The quote, “the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown,” can be attributed to either H.P. Lovecraft or an evil cosmic entity posing as him. There’s truth to it, and one of the best ways for horror aficionados who no longer get a kick from cookie-cutter American horror movies to rekindle their love for the genre is by watching movies made in different countries.</p> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">These movies teach us that there are different techniques and approaches to filmmaking that will catch us off guard, and also that the language of horror is universal and will cross any frontier to get you.</p> <figure data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Shudder</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-cuando-acecha-la-maldad-when-evil-lurks-argentina-2023" data-injectable="false"><em>Cuando Acecha La Maldad (When Evil Lurks)</em> – Argentina, 2023</h2> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false"><em>When Evil Lurks</em> offers one of the most original takes on possession horror that you’ll ever see. Don’t expect to see a good exorcist saving the day here, as the film takes place in a world where all religions have already been defeated by the devil.</p> <p data-characters="607" data-current-count="868" data-injectable="true">If you’re a seasoned horror watcher, US-made horror movies might still scare you, but it’s possible that they also leave you feeling too comfortable because you might’ve already noticed that there are some lines that these movies just won’t dare crossing. I won’t state which lines those are, as that would spoil <em>When Evil Lurks</em>, so let’s just say that its greatest strength is going where no other movie dares going, and then going there several other times. <em>When Evil Lurks</em> is harrowing, even in comparison to other horror movies many already find excruciatingly rough.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by 20th Century Studios</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>The Wailing </em>– South Korea, 2016</h2> <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">Na Hong-Jin’s horror epic invites viewers to be as puzzled regarding who is good and who is evil as the inhabitants of a small village in the mountains of South Korea. <em>The Wailing</em> is a great story about uncertainty that won’t let viewers stop guessing until the very end, but, most importantly, it’s a damn great horror movie that will certainly hit you hard in the gut before the credits roll.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via MUBI</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>Cure</em> – Japan, 1997</h2> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="649" data-injectable="true">Kiyoshi Kurosawa was cursed to the life of a movie director who shares the last name with someone whose popularity will always overshadow his. That sucks, as Kurosawa has put out a lot of bangers over the years. My favorite of the bunch is <em>Cure</em>, a dark detective story where the main character follows a serial killer who doesn’t kill anyone. </p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">What does that mean? I think it’s best if you check it out by yourself, as the movie’s one-of-a-kind atmosphere and mystery should be savored in all of its mystery. 2023 saw a soft American remake with Ben Affleck’s <em>Hypnotic</em>, but this one is just leagues better.</p> <figure data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Apple TV</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>Audition</em> – Japan, 1999</h2> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">Haunting stories are usually about a person or family who unwittingly moves in to a place already inhabited by some evil entity. Takashi Miike’s <em>Audition</em> asks the question of, what if the haunting is an actual person you invite into your life? Instead of traditional jump-scares, <em>Audition</em> takes viewers on a crescendo of creepiness until they reach one of the darkest and most messed-up climaxes ever seen on film. </p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">It’s possible that most already know <em>Audition</em>, as it became one of the most famous horror foreign films of all time, but it’d just be unfair to leave such a unique gem out.</p> <figure data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime Video</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>Noroi</em> – Japan, 2005</h2> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">If you loved <em>Blair Witch Project</em> and feel like no other found footage horror film has managed to scratch that itch, then I’d like to recommend you watch <em>Noroi</em>. Though it follows <em>BWP’s</em> structure very closely, it tells a uniquely atmospheric tale that sinks viewers in a sea of tension that only goes away when the end credits mercifully decide to roll.</p> <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">If I got you hyped about <em>Noroi</em>, I recommend you go watch it without Googling anything about it, as Google will immediately show you a bunch of pictures that will spoil the film’s fantastic climax.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime Video</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>Speak No Evil</em> – Denmark, 2022</h2> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true"><em>Speak No Evil </em>feels like a great adaptation; not of a novel, but simply of the great quote by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, in which he says that “hell is other people”.</p>
 <p data-characters="579" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true"><em>Speak No Evil </em>begins quietly, as any nice tale about a beautiful European vacation should, but quickly turns awkward, and then spends the rest of its runtime descending into horrifying territory. Best of all, the main characters aren’t facing off against a super-powered evil entity, but rather against their own inability to say “no” to the questionable queries of others. This one puts all doubts regarding whether you can have great horror without otherworldly or demonic entities to rest, and will likely make resting a bit harder for anyone who watches it.</p>
 <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false"><em>Speak No Evil</em> has an American remake starring James McAvoy in the works. Though it actually looks pretty good, my recommendation is that you check out the original beforehand.</p> <figure data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime Video</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>La Region Salvage (The Untamed)</em> – Mexico, 2016</h2> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">What if instead of murder, the evil alien is actually interested in sex, but the result is just as horrifying? <em>The Untamed</em> offers one of the most original takes on alien-related horror as it tells the tale of an alien entity that lands in a remote location in Mexico and somehow causes every living creature around it to care only about engaging in sexual intercourse until they die.</p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">The paragraph above could be describing a bad adult film plot, but<em> The Untamed</em> never fails to be scary and weird over steamy. If you haven’t heard about this one, I believe that has less to do with its quality, and more with how hard it must be to market.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfoU_Z1uVfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>Screenshot from Spikima movies YouTube Channel</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>Kairo (Pulse)</em> – Japan, 2001</h2> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">Kiyoshi Kurosawa makes a return to this list with <em>Kairo</em>, a horror gem from the early 2000s that should be as well known as other foreign language horror classics such as <em>Ringu, Shutter, and Ju-On (The Grudge)</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">If you’re into the American <em>The Ring</em>, which absolutely owns, you should also check out Kurosawa’s harrowing and mesmerizing quasi sci-fi take on ghost stories. See the frame above? Be warned that once you see that, you’re about to witness what a large number of horror lovers on the Internet consider the <a href="https://youtu.be/HfoU_Z1uVfc">scariest scene of all time.</a></p> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime Video</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>Martyrs</em> – France, 2008</h2> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">How many times does a horror movie stay mysterious until the end? <em>Martyrs</em> provides one of the very rare instances where viewers are glued to their seats, mortified by what they’re seeing, but can never stop looking because they just need to know what the hell is happening. <em>Martyrs</em> is very tough to watch, but totally worth the pain.</p> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true"><em>Martyrs</em> has an American remake and, even though I don’t consider every single of these remakes trash, I wholeheartedly recommend you stay away from this one.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime Video</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>Goodnight Mommy</em> – Germany, 2014</h2> <p data-characters="610" data-current-count="910" data-injectable="true"><em>Martyrs</em> lets viewers take breaks from suffering with the main character by sometimes giving away some pieces of a <em>Hellraiser</em>-like puzzle to connect, but <em>Goodnight Mommy </em>is a test of resilience from start to finish. This one starts off moody and depressing, and only ever gets <strong>much</strong> worse from there. I don’t want to spoil you, but that would’ve been okay, actually; there’s nothing I can reveal about this one that will make the experience any less harrowing. Watch this one only if you want a movie experience that feels like the movie equivalent of beating the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-final-bosses-in-video-game-history-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">toughest of video game bosses.</a></p>
 <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="137" data-injectable="false"><em>Goodnight Mommy</em> also has an American remake. It’s not terrible as a movie, but it’s nothing compared to this monster-piece.<br></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/log-off-cross-intro<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As much as we all like to sing the praises of touching grass, if you're reading this, maybe you struggle with being Too Online. There's no denying the cursed allure of doomscrolling and shitposting, but in her upcoming book, writer Katherine Cross asks: what is posting really all about? What, if anything, is it good for?</p><p>Below is the introduction to Cross' book <em><a href="https://www.littlepuss.net/shop/p/pre-order-log-off-why-posting-and-politics-almost-never-mix-by-katherine-cross" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Log Off: Why Posting and Politics (Almost) Never Mix</a></em>, coming out June 4 from <a href="https://www.littlepuss.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LittlePuss Press</a>. If you're in New York City, you can go to the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/katherine-cross-presents-log-off-feat-janus-rose-tickets-873656639527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch event</a> on Thursday, May 30, which, coincidentally, features Cross in conversation with recent Aftermath contributor <a href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-remake-rebirth-terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Janus Rose</a>.</p><hr><p>“The end of the world is just a hypothesis.” That lyric from <em>Penguindrum</em>’s opening theme lived rent-free in my head as I lay sleeplessly staring at my Twitter feed throughout the bleak early nights of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yes, hopeless nerd that I am, I consoled myself with a soothing refrain from an anime song. The words were easy to say, far harder to believe in those long hours and longer days that made up the temporal sludge of 2020.</p><p>This was before a <em>New Yorker</em> cartoon popularized the word doomscrolling, so I didn’t quite have a name for this compulsive flipping through terrible news story after terrible news story that I seemed unable to refrain from. As the novel coronavirus spread out from the world’s major cities like red ink blots from a leaky pen, I became intimately acquainted with statistics about Italian, Iranian, and Chinese administrative regions. I couldn’t sleep, I could barely eat, I wept. But there was one pinprick of light that gave me some hope (perhaps equally hard to believe now, in 2024): public health experts on Twitter.</p><p>In the midst of this seeming-apocalypse, these scientists, doctors, scholars, and journalists were performing heroic feats of science communication, opening up a free, limitless-capacity graduate seminar in fields like epidemiology, virology, infectious disease, internal medicine, and more. Twitter’s capacity for allowing dorky obsessives to write fifty-tweet-long threads about Romanian stamps from the 1920s, or sixteenth-century Dutch cheese, or lost Doctor Who episodes, was being mobilized for the public good. People needed answers yesterday about this deadly new virus and what they could do to protect themselves. Like angels crowned with coruscating halos made of the Matrix itself, these experts moved among us, offering the best advice they could on how to interpret the barrage of new stats we were receiving (we became newly minted experts in what R-nought meant!), and how to practise pandemic-era hygiene.</p><p>Even better? Some of these experts were calling for radical reorganizations of society, for seizing the moment to finally realize long-held dreams that had been deferred by artificial political gridlock and transnational capitalism.</p><p>If ever there was a moment that tested the ability of social media to take the lead in changing the world, in organizing and mobilizing us to press for lasting, structural change, COVID was it. Had this pandemic happened in 1990, we’d have been stuck indoors sending letters and using MCI long-distance to stay connected to our loved ones and communities. But now? Now we had the world in our pockets — instant communication, HD video, crowdsourcing, and the thoughts of millions streaming through our consciousness at any given moment. Because COVID happened in 2020, we at least had the tools to get around the loss of in-person contact, and could redouble our efforts to change the world. Or so it seemed.</p><p>Then it all became Extremely Online.</p><hr><p>By the time we reached our strange pandemic summer, fissures were already beginning to form, with some experts maintaining the need for the strictest possible interventions, like long-term lockdowns, while others began to advocate for a “harm reduction” approach that would leave parts of society open. Advice became contradictory—don’t mask, then mask up; parks should be open, no they should be closed—and their priors became more ideological, with libertarian-leaning scientists proving more sceptical of government intervention, as for instance with the so-called “Great Barrington Declaration”.</p><p>Meanwhile, the public was growing unhappy with the slow and furtive pace of scientific investigation. Is it safe to send my kids to school or not? Can I go to my grandmother’s funeral or not? People wanted The Truth, and science had to remind them that research could only provide partial answers at the best of times. And who in the name of the Goddess and Her Consort could’ve mistaken these for the best of times?</p><p>It wasn’t long before the experts began openly bickering. Among their fandoms, things were worse still: complex theories and analysis were reduced to slogans like “wear a fucking mask!” or “back to normal” or “vaxxed and relaxed.” Experts themselves became subject to virulent threats against their lives, livelihoods, and families, especially if they were women. Some medical experts I knew personally began retreating from Twitter or quitting it altogether due to harassment —not just from right-wing extremists, who by now were breathing massive new life into the anti-vax movement, but from their own colleagues who considered them either too lax or too strict in the advice they gave.</p><p>In every case, the once-broad horizon of building a better world on the ashes of the pandemic was narrowed to a blazing pinhole of individual, politically charged actions. We asked how to change the world and got told how to best protect ourselves and little else. Twitter’s structural individualism had come back to haunt us with a vengeance.</p><hr><p>I will admit, my faith in social media had already been dwindling even before this. I’d watched its myriad flaws and abuses over the previous decade, from harassment campaigns like GamerGate to explosive privacy violations like the Cambridge Analytica scandal at Facebook. However, I still held out hope that some hashtag campaigns and co-ordinated communication could lead our societies to a better place, <em>so long as these campaigns succeeded in getting us to do meaningful things in the physical world and not just on our phones or at our desks.</em></p><p>That turned out to be the sticking point. And in 2020 it was what finally snuffed my last remaining embers of faith in the ability of these platforms to help us achieve noble, collective aims. In a few months we went from “free, universal health care in America now!” to “wear a fucking mask!” and we couldn’t even achieve the latter.</p><p>Many, of course, advocated for both. But, in addition to the basic physics behind there only being so many hours in a day, social media was a far better conduit for one of these types of demands. Social shaming around individualistic behaviours—even those with a collective benefit, like masking up during COVID surges—is far easier to pull off with the platforms available to us than building the kind of political power necessary to achieve universal health care. Social media quickly reduces any sort of radical aspiration to a slogan, mere signalling, but it can be used very effectively to harangue an individual for their perceived poor choices.</p><p>It also allows you to endlessly vent your spleen about your grief, fears, and anxieties in order to soothe yourself—and who didn’t need that amidst the worst pandemic in over a century? In the process, the ferment for structural change dissipated and all that energy followed the path of least resistance—into the personal and the individualized.</p><p>All we succeeded in doing was terrifying the people who listened into a quiescent paralysis that presented them with yet more social media as the only solution to their problems, creating a small cadre of Twitter power users who pored over the details of medical journals they barely understood, steeped in confirmation bias as they sought to prove COVID was either a mislabelled common cold or the Andromeda strain that would leave us all with long COVID within a few years.</p><p>The pandemic left me convinced that social media presented us with only an illusion of collective action—we’re all online together sharing the same ideas, memes, and hashtags, how could that not be collective?—while instead isolating us in our own oubliettes of confirmatory terror. To the extent that Black Lives Matter has found any traction at all, it’s precisely to the degree that it sought to make an impact beyond social media, beyond merely “raising awareness.” #MeToo, meanwhile, is emerging as a dismal failure precisely because it became little more than a bitter harvest of our deepest traumas, ready to be liked, shared, and quoted—a strip mine of #content.</p><p>The whole point was to show our scars as women. We gave Jezebel and BuzzFeed some headlines, which fed right back into the social media ecosystem to start the life cycle anew. There were a handful of high-profile victories—who couldn’t cheer at the demise of Harvey Weinstein?—but what really changed? Perhaps a few token policies here and there, but nothing that actually protects us. COVID-posting too was quickly reduced to a similar parade of anecdotal traumas and the viral emotions that surrounded them.</p><hr><p>The question I hope to try to answer with this book is, why? But also, I want to examine how we, especially among the political left and its constituent movements like feminism, came to believe that the revolution had to be live-tweeted. This myth of social media’s indispensability to our movements, not just as a tool but as the forum for change, is dangerous. If we internalize it too deeply, it actually demobilizes our movements, lulling us into mistaking quote-tweet wars and “clapbacks” for meaningful political action, seducing us into seeing nanoseconds of digital catharsis as an adequate substitute for change. It seduces us into mistaking the profitable content we generate for truly resistive speech—as well as tying our worth and our success, as people and activists, to the engagement metrics created by large tech corporations.</p><p>It’s old hat by now to say that social media is problematic or that tech is political. Technological historian Langdon Winner argued “certain technologies in themselves have political properties” in 1980, before I was born. But I want to modify this argument a little bit. I don’t want to tell you that screen time is bad for your kids or that social media is rotting your attention span; I don’t even want to focus too much on the social problems of online harassment and disinformation. Instead, I put to you the following: the idea that tech is political sometimes obscures the ways in which social media may be <em>anti-political</em>.</p><p>You may be sceptical of such a claim. Social media is chock-a-block with political content, hashtag activism, and disinformation that turns grandparents into fascists. How could it be anti-political?</p><p>Because it demobilizes and scatters the polity; it makes it much harder to come together, deliberate, and effect change in our communities. Worse, social media tricks us into thinking that that’s exactly what we’re doing. What results is a “public square” where real people can get hurt but nothing ever really changes. If social media has power to do good, it lies in its ability to act as a conduit between different domains of the physical world—in other words, how it can help you act in your community. Where it’s failed us most dramatically, however, is that it has become predominantly self-referential, keeping us stuck on platforms obsessing over things that only really matter <em>there</em>—a problem made worse when internet drama is dressed in the stolen valour of genuinely weighty political issues.</p><p>This all matters for a few reasons. First and foremost, one of the ugliest side effects of terminal COVID-posting that proliferated amongst the Extremely Online was a deepening mistrust of their fellow human being; every time they fell for outrage-bait about some wanker being a dick about not wearing a mask, their inevitable response was, “I don’t trust people anymore!” This is a neat fit for conservatives, whose entire movement is built on a notion of Original Sin, developed through two centuries of monarchism, fascism, nativism, and lesser varieties of know-nothingism, that treats strangers as essentially threats. But for anyone to the left of Mussolini, such contempt for your fellow human being, such unwillingness to reach out to one’s neighbour for fear they’ll be like That Bitch from Panera Bread I Saw on TikTok, is extraordinarily dangerous—and fatal to realizing the ideals we share, which are necessarily collective.</p><p>Secondly, speaking of TikTok, which may already be banned in parts of the US by the time this book reaches your hands/screen, I am finding myself watching history repeat itself. If you’re in your early twenties, you may be too young to remember former vice president Al Gore, among others, waxing poetic about how platforms like Twitter were going to change the world because of protests in Iran in the late aughts, or how the Colour Revolutions that proliferated across Eastern Europe—which continue to haunt the dreams of autocrats across Eurasia—showed that the internet had come of age, creating self-organizing communities that were invincible against the onslaught of sclerotic state actors and tyrants.</p><p>Twitter was often cast as indispensable to these movements. The Arab Spring, and all its attendant Twitter use, represented the culmination of this mythology, but protests in Greece against the EU’s immiseration of that country, the occupation of Istanbul’s Gezi Park, and Occupy Wall Street were other high-water marks. Twitter seemed to be the secret sauce.</p><p>Yet where are we now, exactly, in the wake of all that? Ukraine’s democratic project was given new life not by hashtags but by a war for its very survival. Elsewhere, the hard, slow, grinding work of politics continues, long after local protest movements ceased to appear on the “trending” pane of Twitter.</p><p>TikTok has taken over the role that Twitter once had as the supposed agent of change. What Twitter was for millennials like myself, TikTok is for GenZ: synonymous with the generation of youth who will single-handedly save us all from the coming car crash of apocalypses. Consider this a warning from a girl born in 1986 who’s watched this cycle play out after being flattered, scape-goated, and forgotten by her elders: TikTok will not change the world in the way you hope. It is a trap to pretend it will. The proposed US TikTok ban is both a catastrophic intrusion on free expression and totally idiotic, but some arguments being made against it—namely, the idea that the progressive movement can’t live without Tik-Tok—are steeped in a mythology of social media indispensability that has already turned the last decade into sociological wreckage. I hope to use this little book to challenge the myth that we need these platforms more than they need us. After all, Twitter was supposed to be a change agent, and look at it now.</p><p>Don’t blame Elon Musk, either. He’s merely Twitter’s all too Dantean punishment: an Extremely Online man who became so addicted to the platform that he spent US$44 billion buying it just to post ten-year-old memes without the risk of getting banned for irredeemable cringe—and so that he could roll back Twitter’s already threadbare policies protecting trans people. This Most Divorced Man in the Universe is, in many ways, the avatar of everything Twitter is: nasty, churlish, obsessive, abusive, prejudicial. But the site was already in steep decline when he bought it, already a shell of its former self that had become known as the Hellsite even to those who remained hopelessly in its thrall. If you think Twitter is for old people, then I hope to tell you some of the story of how it got old. But if you don’t, then I hope to show you why Twitter has aged poorly and why you should do as the title says.</p><hr><p>Speaking of, let’s talk about the title.</p><p>When the idea for this book was batted around between me and my editors, one of the possible title concepts was “Delete Your Account.” But I stuck with my original idea of “Log Off” because, as one of the hopelessly online people I’ll be talking about in this book, I’m sensitive to the contextual differences between the two phrases. “Delete your account” means to fuck off into the sun, disintegrating your platform presence with it. “Log off” can mean this, but other times it’s a form of tough love. Or even regular ol’ love. It can be a way of telling someone they’re being Too Online and need to step away.</p><p>“Touch Grass” conveys the same sentiment and was another title idea. But that phrase is usually hurled as invective at someone who is obsessively fixated on internet drama, like Jesse Singal or half the columnists at the New York Times. “Log Off” can be a loving plea as well as invective. It can be a way of saying, delicately, that there is some grass in your area desperately in need of touching without actually shouting that at you. And that, in the end, is what the title means: You don’t need to give up social media. You just need to use it rather than letting it use you. Sometimes that means finding other tools for the jobs you need to do.</p><p>I do not intend to be an old woman shouting at clouds, but as both a scholar and a poster, I’ve learned the hard way that there are limits to what these platforms can do. That does not mean they have no utility whatsoever. There are some things that social media can do very well, and that it should be used for; there are positive possibilities for what the internet <em>can</em> look like if we get over the myth of social media’s indispensability. You can reduce the harm to yourself and others by stepping back a bit, using social media less, and using it for fewer purposes than you once did without completely deleting your web presence. Information technology is here to stay. We need to be involved and engaged with it to shape it for the betterment of humanity. Primitivist fantasies merely cater to the gaggle of libertarian “disruptors” who already wield far too much power in Silicon Valley.</p><p>But the worst people in the Valley also thrive on all the demobilizing disengagement that their platforms have slowly led us towards. They have alchemized activism into toxic Twitter beefs and seduced us into thinking that we’re one viral campaign away from solving some massive socio-structural problem, which makes it all the easier to devote our energies to pursuing these digital white whales in lieu of more tangible goals in our lives and communities. The self-soothing they offer, free at the point of delivery, actually comes at a great cost to our ability to see ourselves as real political actors—a cost I see every day when I see someone (often people who should know better) doomposting about how there’s no hope for humanity.</p><p>We’re not condemned to this. You probably sense it in your own life every time you look up from your phone or step away from the computer: the sense that the world you see through the scroll of Twitter or TikTok or Instagram isn’t the world you see when you step away. Sometimes for the worse, but often for the better. On Twitter, it’s Apocalypse Forever; in your life, the apocalypse competes for purchase with all that is good and wonderful in your life. Staying in touch with that reality is what’s going to prepare you for challenges we face — and those that await us.</p><p>One of the things I really can’t forgive social media for is how deeply it has corroded our sense of sincerity, making it uncool to care. Yes, it’s allowed us to treat everything in our lives like an episode of <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>, because it often deserves it. My graduate school cohort has a Slack where we backchannel and make memes about the vicissitudes of grad student life because it’s fun, funny, and a release valve. But then I think of my work as a teacher, which reminds me that “citizenship” means something far more than describing what passport you hold. It means that you’re part of a community, with duties and obligations towards your neighbours, as well as inherently possessed of rights and dignity for yourself. One of the most grievous sins of anti-immigration discourse in Western countries is how deeply it buries this understanding. Over the next few chapters, I hope to help you see the value in that dignity—and how social media is so often beneath yours.</p><p>Social media acts as a self-organizing collective that foments citizenship far less often than it denies it to you—making you something less than what you are, spackling over the cracks with a lot of (admittedly sometimes very good) humour. But you don’t need to make that trade-off. This, in the end, is something I pray is a hopeful message: by logging off more than you do, you can get the jokes and benefits, and you can get the rewards of citizenship.</p><p>Logging off is woefully insufficient, but it is an essential first step.</p><hr><p>That said, I understand how much I’m asking here, even if I do mean “log off” in a very limited, time-bounded way. There is an essentially Roach Motel quality to these platforms, what I would describe as <em>open social media</em>; it’s easy to enter and almost impossible to leave. They’re open when you come in, but when you want to go, it turns out they’re a <em>walled garden</em> instead. Indeed, what these two apparently opposite paradigms turn out to be, it seems to me (and this is a metaphor I’ll return to), is a Möbius strip: you carry on far enough along one side of the opposition and suddenly you find yourself on the other.</p><p>What makes these platforms “open” is a combination of their ease of access and their ubiquity. Posting is public by default; locking your account or making it less public necessarily cuts you off from many of the platform’s greatest benefits, and you’re generally speaking to an entire crowd — the entire platform’s user base, potentially, rather than merely a curated audience of devoted followers. But the longer you stay, the more you <em>need</em> to stay; your friends are there, your career may rely on the platform now. Moving your followers, your networks, your community becomes hard or impossible. The garden suddenly has walls.</p><p>It’s easy to mummify oneself in lofty justifications for the fulfilment of these basic—but very much real, valid—needs. Politics is the first and best justification for sticking around: you’re not just clinging to a platform you’ve become dependent on, you’re making yourself “visible,” making your “voice heard,” holding malefactors “accountable.” As we’ll see, this quickly leads to dark places, to a species of online “activism” utterly divorced from any kind of mind-independent reality.</p><p>The reason for that is that platforms like Twitter, far from being unique change agents, can only effectively solve problems that they themselves create—and then only those problems that exist primarily on the platform. Call it the unspoken iron law of social media: the more you look at recent history, the more you realize social media has not meaningfully addressed social problems. To the degree it <em>creates</em> them, it does so because the problems in question are uniquely well-suited to the way social media points individuals at other individuals. Twitter can facilitate hate speech and hate crimes; it cannot get us to build, say, a community centre. For that, we need real politics: pavement-pounding, letter-writing, town-halling, street-protesting, ballot-casting politics.</p><p>But even the splashy, attention-getting street protests of the last decade, not unreasonably attributed to social media’s unique crowd-sourcing abilities, are not sufficient, and their decade of failures makes that abundantly clear—with one Spring or Colour Revolution or Occupy movement after another yielding no meaningful change or, worse, far-right governments and dictatorships. Social media has made it all too easy for us to focus on the wrong things, on trivial, private, cathartic non-victories at the expense of things that might last. And it is terrible at organizing us in the kind of leadership-driven, hierarchical fashion that would be ideal for channelling masses of people into collective, unitary projects. It is, however, good for cleaning up a few of its own messes.</p><p>As we’ll see, we haven’t been the gainers from that particular trade. Instead, social media has seen us become worse at and more contemptuous of politics, in exchange for the feel-good purism of online humour and a catharsis-driven sense of our own deeply private virtue. These sentiments are many things, but they are not the cornerstones of a community worth living in.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Regarding AI Druckmann said:</p><div><blockquote><p>“Moreover, AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we’re reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games.”</p></blockquote></div><p>Druckmann also expanded on other uses for AI, saying, “AI will allow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities. However, it’s crucial to precisely direct these tools to achieve the intended outcomes.”</p><p>Additionally, Druckmann shared his aspirations for future games, expressing excitement for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735862/naughty-dog-new-single-player-game-multiplayer">Naughty Dog’s next project</a>: “I’m eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of <em>The Last of Us</em>, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.”</p><p>However, his comment about “redefining mainstream perceptions of gaming” is what appears to be the cause for Sony pulling the interview. Shortly after Sony published the Q&amp;A, Druckmann wrote on social media stating that he had been misquoted.</p><p>“In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with Sony, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost,” <a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837">he posted on X</a> sharing his full, unedited comments.</p><p>A few days after making this statement, Sony announced that rather than add Druckmann’s clarification, it had removed the interview entirely, stating, “[We] have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don’t represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects).” </p><p>Although <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/29/update-sony-pulls-down-heavily-misquoted-neil-druckmann-interview-and-apologizes-for">some</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming-update">media</a> <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/neil-druckmann-says-new-naughty-dog-title-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming/">outlets</a> did focus on the potential of Naughty Dog’s latest project “redefining gaming,” it was Druckmann’s comments on AI that caused the most backlash. The use of AI in creative spaces like video game development has caused a lot of controversy with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23700619/ai-game-development-jobs-gdc-2023">concerns that the technology has the potential to exacerbate</a> the already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065868/a-dark-shadow-falls-across-the-gaming-industry">depressed video game labor market</a>. Notably, the clarification Druckmann posted didn’t include any mention of AI while Sony’s retraction statement did. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167147/discord-gaming-focus-redesign<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Discord wants to steer its app back to gaming, and it’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7V5jdOjWVU4">rolling out an app redesign</a> to help make that happen. The new look features reworked group messages, voice chats, video calls, and more.</p><p>In <a href="https://discord.com/blog/discords-next-chapter">a message to users</a>, Discord CEO Jason Citron says the company realized it needs to  narrow its focus from “broadly being a community-centric chat app” to a service that “helps people deepen their friendships around games and shared interests.”&nbsp;The company now wants to make it easier to connect before, during, or after playing a game.</p><p>This year, Discord will make some changes to the app that will let users reach their conversations faster, as well as improve the reliability of its voice, video, and streaming technology. The company also plans to bring more of Discord’s features to a broader range of devices. </p><p>By turning its attention back to gaming, Discord is reversing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308194/discord-gaming-users-safety-center-video-voice-chat">the plan it set in motion in 2020</a>. As the covid pandemic increased the need for messaging platforms like Discord, the company wanted to become a more general chat app that allowed users to “spend quality time with people, whether catching up, learning something, or sharing ideas.”</p><div><p>A lot has changed since then. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034705/discord-layoffs-17-percent-employees">Discord laid off 17 percent of its staff</a> after growing its headcount too quickly. Citron was also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981662/meta-x-tiktok-ceos-testify-us-senate-child-exploitation">one of the five CEOs who testified</a> in front of the Senate over concerns about child safety. Lawmakers are currently pushing for legislation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/29/24086559/kids-online-safety-act-schatz-tech-groups">like the Kids Online Safety Act</a>, which would require platforms like Discord to roll out measures to protect kids.</p></div><p>During an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308194/discord-gaming-users-safety-center-video-voice-chat">interview on <em>Decoder</em> in April</a>, Citron hinted at turning the company’s attention back toward gaming. “Going forward, we are very focused on gaming as our core use case — group chat around gaming,” Citron said at the time, adding that 95 percent of its users play games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I played <em>Persona 5 </em>and <em>Royal </em>on PlayStation, but when the <em>Persona </em>games came to PC, I was most excited about the prospect of a mod to let me romance Ryuji after headcanoning my version of Joker as in love with him. I don’t know that I have time for another 100+ hour trip to the Metaverse, but if I do ever replay <em>Royal </em>down the line, I may just download it on PC to install this mod.</p><p><em>Persona</em>’s relationship with queerness has been fraught, but recent games have turned things around a bit. <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-trans-scene-beautiful-lady-beach-1851206294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-trans-scene-beautiful-lady-beach-1851206294">takes out an infamous transphobic scene</a></span> in the remake, and it also retools other scenes to be explicitly queer.

<p>The highly talked about — and someone controversial — Stellar Blade was the best-selling gaming in the United States for April 2024. That’s according to <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1795803862571376655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data research firm Circana</a>.</p>



<p>The company released its latest sales numbers for April 2024 (April 7 – May 4), and with it came a number of games jumping up the list. Of the 20 games, only one — Stellar Blade — was a new release. </p>

Those for games jumping into the Top 20 for the month were Sea of Thieves, which just launched on PlayStation 5 in April; Fallout 76 and Fallout 4, both jumping in popularity due to the success of Amazon Prime’s Fallout TV show; and Grounded, which also released for PS5, PS4, and Nintendo Switch in April after being an Xbox exclusive.</p>



<p>As far as year-to-date sales, Helldivers 2 remains the best-selling game of 2024 in the United States. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Dragon’s Dogma 2, MLB: The Show 24, and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth round of the top five for the year so far.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-mk-20-ssr-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant.884241/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-mk-20-ssr-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-mk-20-ssr-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="149" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Players have yet to come around fully, but the MK 20 SSR is not only the best marksman rifle, but also one of the most powerful weapons in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">According to stats provided by <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/xd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TrueGameData</a>, the MK 20 SSR has a faster time-to-kill speed up to 35 meters away than the ACR 6.8, AK-47, M16A4, and M60. You must consider that the MK 20 SSR is a single-shot rifle with only a 10-bullet magazine. However, if you are accurate with your aim, it’s possible to take down an enemy in two shots, or even one on an already weakened enemy. This marksman rifle requires a bit of a learning curve, as you will get punished with missed shots. </p>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Despite being a marksman rifle, the MK 20 SSR does not thrive in long-range engagements. A massive damage dropoff after 40 meters means you should prioritize shorter gunfights. In saying that, it’s hard to find a better weapon than the MK 20 SSR offers from most ranges. </p> <h2 id="h-best-mk-20-ssr-loadout-and-class-setup-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Best MK 20 SSR loadout and class setup in <em>XDefiant </em></h2> <figure data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Barrel Extender </li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Pistol </li> <li><strong>Optics: </strong>Reflex </li> <li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Fast Mag </li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Lightweight </li> </ul> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true">Our loadout focuses on making the MK 20 SSR more mobile without sacrificing recoil control or damage range. This marksman rifle barely moves when firing, so all the attachments can be used in other areas. As mentioned earlier, the weapon only has 10 bullets per magazine, so the fast mag improves reload times. All of the other attachments improve ADS and movement speed. \</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best faction to use for the MK 20 SSR </h2> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">The Libertad faction works with every weapon, as it’s always helpful to have abilities that heal you and your teammates throughout a match. But we wouldn’t recommend using the Echelon Faction, as the stealthy skills are more useful while using an SMG. Since the MK 20 SSR thrives in medium-range engagements, using the Phantoms or Cleaners Faction makes the most sense. </p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="759" data-injectable="false">As a Cleaner, the MK 20 SSR deals more damage and kills from further away thanks to the incendiary rounds passive ability. Additionally, the Incinerator Drone is great for drawing enemies out from behind cover and the Firebomb is one of the best grenade options in the game. For the cherry on top, the Purifier Ultra ability is a flamethrower that melts players almost instantaneously.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/sony-pulls-its-own-interview-with-naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-due-to-several-significant-errors/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sony-pulls-its-own-interview-with-naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-due-to-several-significant-errors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="303" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Last week, Sony published an interview with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann that included some controversial comments about the use of AI in game development and the potential for Naughty Dog’s next game to shake up the gaming industry. Now, the interview has been banished to the Internet Archive.</p> <p data-characters="114" data-current-count="114" data-injectable="false">Sony has retracted the entire interview, and if you try to pull it up, you’ll instead find a message that says: </p> <blockquote data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true"> <p>“In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don’t represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects).” The statement goes on to apologize to Druckmann for misrepresenting his comments and says that the decision to remove the interview was made “in coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE.”&nbsp;</p> </blockquote>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">The interview caused quite a stir when it was first published, and Druckmann caught heat online for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/neil-druckmann-hypes-up-using-ai-for-storytelling-but-plenty-fellow-devs-disagree/">comments he made about AI</a> and its potential for use in game development. In the interview he came across as being very enthusiastic about developers adopting AI, and his main concern about the tech seemed to be making sure it was given proper direction.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="754" data-injectable="true">People were obviously upset to hear someone like Druckmann gloss over widespread concerns about AI being used in game development, but not long after Sony published the interview, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-last-of-us-director-reveals-discrepancies-in-comments-from-recent-sony-interview/">Druckmann </a>cast doubt on its accuracy. He shared a <a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187392183898408">post on Twitter</a> pointing out how, “In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with Sony, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">The example Druckmann gave was from a section where the original interview quoted him as saying Naughty Dog’s next game “could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.” The full quote that Druckmann shared made it clear he hadn’t said anything close to that. Unfortunately, Druckmann still hasn’t addressed the part of the interview where he talked about AI. </p> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="false">Maybe we’re supposed to assume, now that it’s been removed, the published interview misrepresented all of Druckmann’s statements, but the looming threat of AI to actual workers in the game industry is big enough that some specific clarification is absolutely warranted.</p>

<p data-characters="88" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A game like <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> can always work well on services like EA Play.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">The upcoming college football simulator features online modes, including its variant of Ultimate Team. If EA Play subscribers can play the game from day one, it will ensure a lot of online traffic. However, it’s almost certain that the only option for gamers will be to buy a copy on a console of their choice (available on current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles).</p>  <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">The EA Play Pro tier is a pricier version of the base membership and includes all Electronic Arts’s latest releases from day one of their launch. However, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/does-ea-sports-college-football-25-support-cross-play/">EA Sports College Football 25</a></em> will not be available on either the base or Pro version at launch.</p>
 <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">Usually, games released on PC are included in the Pro membership. <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Play-Console/EA-Play-Pro-to-PS5/m-p/12241291#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20EA%20Play,is%20not%20available%20on%20consoles).">As per EA’s website</a>, the Pro service isn’t available on consoles. Similarly, <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> currently isn’t set for PC, although pro football counterpart <em>Madden 25</em> is already listed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2582560/EA_SPORTS_Madden_NFL_25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>. This is perhaps the main reason the upcoming college football video game is absent from any kind of subscription service.</p>
 <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">This is par for the course with EA’s offerings, though. The <em>Madden </em>games frequently don’t hit the EA Play service until the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/02/15/ea-play-february-madden-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">season has essentially wrapped up</a>, and other sports games follow similar schedules.</p> <figure data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false">However, there will be some benefits for EA Play subscribers if they’re interested in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/ea-play">As stated on EA’s website</a>, all active subscribers will enjoy the following privileges:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>10-hour early access trial starting July 16</strong></li> <li><strong>10% discount on College Football points for recurring purchases</strong></li> <li><strong>Monthly packs</strong></li> </ul> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="false">You can pre-order the game on your consoles – <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-sports-college-football-25-editions-overview-which-to-buy/">there are two different editions</a>. The Standard Edition is priced at $69.99, while the Digital Deluxe Edition costs $99.99. As an alternative, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-pre-order-ea-sports-college-football-25-prices-standard-edition-deluxe-edition-mvp-bundle/">EA Sports MVP Bundle</a> offers the Digital Deluxe Editions of this game and <em>Madden 25</em> at a discounted price of $149.99. It’s a great choice for anyone looking to invest a lot of time and resources in both games. </p>

            <p>With an effectively infinite universe to fill in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man’s Sky</a>, developers Hello Games have certainly risen to the challenge of trying to fill it with as much stuff as they possibly can over the last near-decade, still managing to add major new features and modes eight years on from the sci-fi exploration game’s release. Next update Adrift is taking things right the way back, though, by emptying the expansive cosmos of almost everything except you, your ship and planets to visit.</p>
<!--more-->

</div>
<p>The incoming expedition was apparently inspired by No Man’s Sky as it was pre-release, where the player was alone to explore a vast galaxy. Adrift will recreate that sensation of being a lone galactic traveller, taking all other lifeforms - aside from sandworms and fiend eggs - out of the game. That also presents a new survival test, as there won’t be any NPCs to ask for aid - including no shops. Shortcuts are also out, as is trading and other help.</p>
<p>“There’s so much we love about the game now, but there was something unique at release in how alone you felt in the universe,” Hello Games wrote in their <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/05/expedition-thirteen-adrift/">announcement blog</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to the eerie feeling of being alone in the abyss is the presence of broken and abandoned buildings, graves of other travellers, and the addition of new ghostly frigates to recruit. You’ll have a new ship to zoom around by yourself in, too: the chunky Iron Vulture hauler. That’ll mean new customisation options <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-orbital-update-brings-full-ship-customisation-and-a-complete-space-station-overhaul">as introduced in last update Orbital</a>, to boot.</p>

<p>Surviving the solo challenge will net you new rewards including a scuttler companion, stealth paint for your ship and both the Iron Vulture and ghost frigate, which can be used across all your saved games via the Quicksilver Synthesis Companion. The Adrift expedition will run for around seven weeks, during which you can give it a go via the Expedition Terminus on the Space Anomaly (or by starting a new save, which you can convert to a normal save once it ends).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24164155/thelma-movie-preview-action-comedy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="FpkZGy">Everyone knows summer is the domain of the action blockbuster. It’s a time for gunfights, car chases, death-defying stunts, and nefarious crimes that have to be thwarted. And while all those things have largely fallen to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24102009/edge-of-tomorrow-tom-cruise-streaming-doug-liman">stars like Tom Cruise</a> to handle, this year’s hilarious action-comedy <em>Thelma </em>is passing the mantle off to 94-year-old Oscar-nominated actress June Squibb. </p>
<p id="6MRk2o"><em>Thelma</em> is the first feature film from director Josh Margolin. It’s about a 92-year-old woman named Thelma who loses $10,000 to a scammer pretending to be her grandson. But instead of taking the scam lying down, she jumps on her scooter, recruits a friend, and sets off on a quest to take back her money.</p>
<p id="7GS3a5">In an interview with Polygon, Margolin explained that the story is based on a real incident that happened to his own grandma — though thankfully, in real life, she didn’t actually send the money to her would-be scammers. But if that premise sounds familiar, Margolin is very aware of the happy accident of his movie’s proximity to Jason Statham’s recently released <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24031441/beekeeper-review-jason-statham-movie"><em>The Beekeeper</em></a>, which was also about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24035803/beekeeper-david-ayer-interview-jason-statham">a phone scammer getting a very different kind of comeuppance</a>. </p>
<p id="zZMqML">“It was so funny to see that trailer,” Margolin says with a laugh. “I was like, <em>Oh my god</em>, <em>we’re a little bit like</em> The Beekeeper. I definitely watched it because I was like, <em>I have to see this</em>. And it was wild and crazy and fun. [...] I’m glad we can continue the grand tradition that <em>The Beekeeper</em> started.”</p>

<p id="KErOUm">But while <em>Thelma </em>might be significantly less violent than <em>The Beekeeper</em>, it’s even funnier and no less thrilling. For Margolin, one of the most important parts of the movie was translating the language of action filmmaking to this less-than-traditional cast, which also includes the late Richard Roundtree (<em>Shaft</em>) in a fantastic and fun performance. That means high-speed chases on scooters, fistfights at more manageable speeds, and high-tension heists with hearing aids. </p>
<p id="pjdPFz">“I’m a big fan of action movies. I always have been,” says Margolin. “The idea [was] trying to tell the story of my grandma, and this ode to her and celebrate her grit and tenacity, [using] those tropes and ideas and shrinking them down to an everyday scope and scale, but treating them with real stakes.” </p>
<p id="DQEBL6">Margolin says he wanted to find a way to dramatize what he calls the everyday heroism of “moving through the world as you get older and things get harder, and smaller things present more danger.”</p>
<p id="6J8ouR">Of course, slowed-down action scenes with older people in chases and fights could easily come off as parody — or worse, poking fun at its terrific cast of older actors. But Margolin brilliantly walks the line of laughing with our characters rather than laughing at them. They’re the stars of a true action movie here, not the butt of a joke.</p>
<p id="ytbSyL">“It’s so easy for anything sending up those tropes or referencing them to feel like parody, and especially stuff with older characters,” Margolin says. “Something that me and my producers were very cognizant of protecting was the tone, and trying to make sure that all of the action, all of the tension, all of the fun was always born out of a sincere and earnest care for what was happening. </p>

<p id="yQ51BS">“We never wanted it to feel like it was punching down or poking fun. We wanted it to be funny in a way that felt like we’re along for the ride.”</p>
<p id="CFm2UD">Part of that earnestness also comes from Margolin’s own favorite action movies. He says he prefers an actioner that “treats its stakes sincerely, isn’t just winky and referential, but action that’s fun and surprising and tense and just treats things with a certain sincerity. Obviously, the Mission: Impossible movies are a big influence on [the movie]. Watching <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23780290/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-supercut-running">Tom Cruise hurl himself at various moving objects</a> for our entertainment is a source of inspiration for [our] ethos.” </p>
<p id="dFhwZ2">Thelma watches a Mission: Impossible film during the movie, and her Tom Cruise inspiration is not just there in spirit, but in the text itself. After she gets scammed, it’s seeing Cruise’s face on a magazine that inspires Thelma to take justice into her own hands. But that kind of sincerity wouldn’t work without <em>Thelma</em>’s terrific and committed performances, particularly from Squibb and Roundtree. Both actors are terrifically funny, and Roundtree’s charm gives the movie a tremendous amount of heart. For her part, Margolin says Squibb was adamant about owning the Tom Cruise mantle and doing as many stunts as she could herself. </p>
<div id="9DbRcc"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFAFsDEM0j4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="1F2G2B">“She did!” Margolin laughs. “And increasingly so as we went on, because we were pretty nervous and careful and conservative about all those things. With the help of our really awesome stunt team, as the shoot progressed and she got more comfortable with the scooter and things like getting onto the bed and rolling, we sort of developed a shorthand for what she was or wasn’t game for. It was really cool. She used to be a dancer; she was doing Pilates pretty rigorously in the lead-up to the movie. There’s a lot of physical prowess to her as a performer, and it was really cool to see her tap into that, even at this moment in her life, and use that in the movie.” </p>
<p id="hvvEs1">It’s rare that a summer action movie also happens to be one of the funniest and sweetest movies of the year, but <em>Thelma </em>manages to pull it off. So if you’re feeling the lack of Tom Cruise at movie theaters this year, just remember that <em>Thelma </em>and June Squibb are there, carrying the torch in his honor. </p>
<p id="9XnHt6"><small><em>Thelma </em></small><small>will be released in theaters on June 21.</small></p>

<p data-characters="153" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC is the latest special challenge in <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team. It’s another with lower requirements and a single, easy task. </p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">For tonight’s content, EA Sports has decided to release a TOTS item from the NWSL. She can be a great fit with other items like Alex Morgan and Sophia Smith, who are available in different packs. To get this card, you’ll have to complete Huerta’s SBC before it expires from Ultimate Team. </p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-ea-fc-24-sofia-huerta-tots-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">What are the EA FC 24 Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC tasks?</h2> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">The latest TOTS SBC is extremely easy to complete, as it has only one task. The solo task does have certain conditions, but this is a perfect challenge to complete for beginners. </p>
 <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Sofia Huerta</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="107" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW</li> <li>Min. Team Rating: 83</li> </ul> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">You’ll need to use at least one TOTS or TOTW item, and my suggestion will be to use the latter. The 83+ TOTW Pick SBC allows players to craft as many items as they want in exchange for lower-rated fodder. TOTS items have higher ratings, and are far more expensive to get. It’s best to save them for SBCs that require higher-rated squads. </p>

This will help you to preserve in-game resources, or use them in other content like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-henrikh-mkhitaryan-tots-sbc-solutions-tasks/">Henrikh Mkhitaryan TOTS SBC</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Sofia Huerta</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true"> <li>Melvine Malard 82</li> <li>Jadon Sancho 82</li> <li>Leah Galton 83</li> <li>Alana Cook 82</li> <li>Klara Buhl 83</li> <li>Mathilde Bourdieu 83</li> <li>Joao Palhinha 83</li> <li>Sophie Schmidt 83</li> <li>Gaetan Laborde 82</li> <li>Jorginho 83</li> <li>Nicolas Otamendi TOTW 84</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">The Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC certainly offers a lot of value in <em>EA FC 24</em>, and the 92-rated RB item can play in several positions. It also has the Whipped Cross+ and Intercept+ playstyles, along with H/H work-rates. This item, in many ways, is a cheap beast like last evening’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-albert-gudmundsson-serie-a-tots-sbc-tasks-solutions/">Albert Gudmundsson Serie A TOTS card</a>. </p>

            <p>Tavern Keeper has been kicking around for a good number of years now, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/game-dev-tycoon">Game Dev Tycoon</a> developers Greenheart Games polished up their charming mixture of Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy bartending with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/theme-hospital">Theme Hospital</a>-style sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">management</a>. Almost a decade from Game Dev Tycoon’s release, Tavern Keeper is now finally approaching its early access release later this year.</p>

<p>Tavern Keeper pops you in the beer-splashed boots of publican orcs, who as you’d imagine must juggle keeping locals happy with the business of running and expanding their enterprise. That includes laying out the tavern’s rooms themselves, filling them with furniture, ensuring that stock levels are kept up and hiring more staff - who you must also keep happy - to help you out with cooking meals (such as flambé swamp rat), cleaning and meeting the demands of patrons.</p>
<p>The game’s campaign throws up both some fun simulation-sandbox events - whether fires caused by errant fireplace ashes or an outbreak of the plague - and more crafted dialogue options with characters that help form its story. The simulation layer certainly seems to run deep, taking into account everything from the brightness of your torchlit cabin and filth levels to the unique environments and local cultures surrounding taverns in different locations. If you prefer to just decorate, there’ll be a design mode too.</p>
<p>Tavern Keeper is somewhat unbelievably only Greenheart Games’ second game after Game Dev Tycoon, which came out way back in 2012 and won over folks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-game-dev-tycoon">including Nate</a> (RPS in Peace) for its charming and comical trip through the history of video game development.</p>

<p>Tavern Keeper looks to keep that same charm and lightheartedness at its core, going by the first gameplay trailer, which immediately had me dreaming up my ideal pub <a href="https://youtu.be/6tVIabRBKmY">like that episode of Peep Show</a>. (You can even christen your fantasy tavern, though I’d personally recommend not following the naming conventions of Super Hans.) If there’s higher praise than that, I can’t think of it.</p>
<p>Tavern Keeper will pull its first pints in Q4 this year, when it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436780/Tavern_Keeper/">throws open its doors on Steam early access</a>. See you at the bar.</p>

However, it hasn’t quite lived up to that since relaunching on May 28. </p><h2 id="h147248"><a id=""></a>Poor performance and laggy combat</h2><p>I hopped into <em>MultiVersus </em>last night, excited to check out the game’s new character, <em>Friday the 13th </em>killer Jason Voorhees. Playing on an Xbox Series X, I encountered frame dips and lag during the opening tutorial sequence featuring Shaggy and Batman. After that, I ran into lag while just using the game’s menus and had performance issues during AI fights. Online, I had two matches disconnect and had other matches slow down to a crawl due to a combination of lag and performance dips. It all felt bad! </p><p>Looking online, it seems I’m not alone. I’ve found countless clips from players complaining about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ChrisHenares/status/1795782840551874837&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ChrisHenares/status/1795782840551874837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poor performance on different platforms</a></span>.

During the game’s extended beta, the option to use any character in local play offered a fun way for folks to test out characters before buying them, and provided tournament organizers a way to let everyone have access to the full roster without having to fork over a ton of money. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1795629888109768821&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1795629888109768821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MultiVersus </em>game director Tony Huynh suggested on Twitter</a></span> that the team was looking into this specific issue, but it’s still unclear if characters will be unlocked in local play in the future. </p><p>This isn’t the only negative change made to the full game after its open beta. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/comments/1d2tccz/everything_that_changed_for_the_worse_from_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/comments/1d2tccz/everything_that_changed_for_the_worse_from_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As documented on the <em>MultiVersus </em>subreddit</a></span>, a lot has changed in the full release of the online fighter, and most of it sounds like a big step back.</p><p>For example, leaderboards at the end of matches have been removed, there is no longer an advanced tutorial mode, cheaper characters have had their in-game prices raised, battle pass XP can only be earned from challenges and not from playing matches, and you can’t remove the red/blue team color effects on characters seen in 2 v 2 matches. Players are also unhappy with how much slower and clunkier the game feels compared to the beta. </p><p>The overall vibes online after the game’s first full day back seem mostly negative, though a lot of fans are hopeful that the developers can fix some of these problems and make gameplay feel more like it did during the extended beta in 2022. Hopefully, WB won’t have to kill the game for another 10 months or so to fix this stuff.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of our favorite video game franchises exist in a sad state of limbo. It’s only natural that after decades of companies making games and trying to earn the most money from them, that some good titles would fall through the cracks, never to become a big, annualized franchise like <em>Call of Duty </em>or <em>Madden</em>.<br></p><p>But what are some of those games that deserve another shot? We’ve rounded up a handful of dead franchises we want to see spring back to life.</p></div></div><div><p>The maddening thing about the death of the <em>Sly Cooper </em>franchise is Sucker Punch’s PlayStation 2 platformer series was done at one point and we could have just left it alone and not ended up in this mess. The trilogy ended on a high note in 2005 with <em>Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves.</em> Then, Sanzaru Games, who worked on the PlayStation 3 remasters, pitched a fourth game to Sony all about traveling to the titular thief’s ancestors’ times and pulling off heists across the timeline. <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em> was a solid new entry that managed to modernize the formula while staying true to its roots.. The problem was: It ended on a devastating cliffhanger. Sly was trapped in the timeline and has been stuck in Ancient Egypt ever since.</p><p>Sanzaru planned to wrap things up with a DLC set in Egypt, but Sony <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/sly-cooper-egypt-dlc-cancelled-give-me-sly-5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/sly-cooper-egypt-dlc-cancelled-give-me-sly-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refused to greenlight it</a></span>. Since then, there has been a planned film and TV series, neither of which got off the ground. Sucker Punch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-infamous-sly-cooper-sequel-release-date-1849135478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-infamous-sly-cooper-sequel-release-date-1849135478">confirmed in 2022</a></span> that there were no plans to revive the series, so Sony damned one of its PS2 mascots to a life trapped in a different time. They’ll <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-classics-ps4-ps5-tomb-raider-star-wars-1851503467&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-classics-ps4-ps5-tomb-raider-star-wars-1851503467">slap him on promotional material</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gear.playstation.com/Product/1535734-Sly_Cooper_20th_Anniversary_Poster&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gear.playstation.com/Product/1535734-Sly_Cooper_20th_Anniversary_Poster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">throw a party for his 20th anniversary</a></span>, but won’t save him. Give me <em>Sly Cooper 5 </em>Sony. Or make an animated short or even just an official art piece of him escaping Ancient Egypt. Save him! — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div><div><p>Sure, there was an arcade <em>Bionic Commando</em>, but let me be clear: The <em>Bionic Commando </em>everyone loved was the face-meltingly awesome NES game, the one in which you fire a bazooka right at Hitler’s face and watch it explode. (If you’re unfamiliar with this classic moment in video game history, see the above video.) Violence like that may be fairly par for the course today, but in 1988, it was totally metal. This was a game that went all out. Adding to its sheer, unrelenting awesomeness were all the incredible tunes and, most of all, the thrilling movement of our titular hero. There are still few games that have ever felt so satisfying to control, as you master the timing of your swings to swoop through the air and infiltrate enemy strongholds like the elite soldier you are. Yes, it got a sequel of sorts with the 2009 game of the same name, but it just didn’t deliver on the same level or make the most of the signature grappling mechanic. Rather than a new big-budget 3D game, I’d love to see a fresh take on the classic side-scrolling (and side-swinging) action. Let some inventive, crackerjack indie studio take the reins and see what they can do with that delicious movement. If <em>Prince of Persia </em>can get a sweet new 2D game in 2024, then I think <em>Bionic Commando </em>can get one, too. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Capcom’s <em>Onimusha </em>games carved out a distinct niche for themselves in the gaming landscape of the early 2000s. Superficially, they were reminiscent of the <em>Resident Evil </em>games with their pre-rendered backgrounds, fixed camera angles, and environmental puzzles, but they also fused sword-swinging samurai action with elements of demonic horror, giving them a vibe all their own. (At one point they even pulled French actor Jean “<em>The Professional</em>” Reno <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/o-aAPg_Ajjk?si=EtBxIb6mGazhKpGa&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/o-aAPg_Ajjk?si=EtBxIb6mGazhKpGa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">into the proceedings</a></span>, and I gotta say, I respect the sheer audacity.) With the recent success of the TV miniseries <em>Shogūn </em>and more high-profile games than ever before being set in the era of samurai, I think the time is ripe for a new <em>Onimusha </em>game as well. Give us a tightly focused 8-10 hour game along the lines of Capcom’s recent <em>Resident Evil </em>remakes that lets us slash demons and vanquish evil without going the route of colossal open-world adventures like <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>or the forthcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span><em>. </em>— <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Watching that intro movie above still gets me pumped for this moody 1998 role-playing game which<em> </em>showed that developer Square was willing to take big swings and depart from the norm with a modern-day, real-world setting and unconventional combat. <em>Parasite Eve </em>is great for many reasons, not least because of its outstanding use of New York City. Yes, absolutely bananas stuff happens in the game, and at least one key character crosses the line into stereotypical caricature at times, but New York itself feels authentic and layered here, as your journey takes you from high-society operas to museums to streets where the downtrodden reside. Protagonist Aya Brea’s quest is both thrilling and haunting, with explosive moments right out of an action movie and others that suggest low-budget body horror, all playing out in a near-empty city in that strange, liminal time between Christmas and New Year’s.</p><p><em>Parasite Eve </em>got a few follow-ups but neither was as original or memorable as the first. I’d love to see Square Enix bring the series back today and try to create something that matches the desolate, moody tone of the 1998 classic, while also doing something fresh and original with the combat to create a greater fusion of role-playing and survival horror action. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div><div><p>Full disclosure: I really liked <em>L.A. Noire</em>, but I’m also someone who has a weakness for the style and atmosphere of the period, and for stories of hard-boiled detectives operating within the all-consuming corruption of the L.A.P.D. (<em>L.A. Confidential </em>is one of my favorite films of all time.) I recognize that there were things about this game that felt unsatisfying to many players, and that’s a big part of why I think the concept of a detective game set in 1940s L.A. deserves another chance. There’s still so much potential in it! I think there must be tons of people out there who would love to play a great noir crime saga that sees you investigating murders, chatting up dames in smoky jazz clubs, and finding yourself in way over your head as the trail of evidence leads you to run up against some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the city. Let’s give it another shot, with clearer, more refined interrogation mechanics and character models that don’t inhabit the uncanny valley quite so blatantly. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Look, I take no pleasure in writing about <em>Titanfall</em> here in this list of d e a d franchises. But ya’ll, we’re nearing 10 years since <em>Titanfall 2</em> came out and, you know, sometimes ya just gotta accept that something you really want in life just ain’t gonna happen for you.</p><p>I get it, in a world of repetitive, mindless shooters, <em>Titanfall</em> was (and is) something special. On paper, it could’ve easily been Just-Another-Shooter™ stock with gimmicks to try and stay unique, but its wall-running and titular Titans worked exceedingly well. The guns felt good to shoot and reload, and the extra jump kit abilities allowed for unique traversal and combat scenarios rarely seen elsewhere. Add in the Titans, and <em>Titanfall</em> skirmishes were dynamic and explosive. True, some of that still lives on in developer Respawn’s <em>Apex Legends</em>, but you and I both know that’s no substitute (though you should give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-can-t-stop-playing-this-titanfall-f-e-a-r-killzone-d-1850772277&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-can-t-stop-playing-this-titanfall-f-e-a-r-killzone-d-1850772277">indie title <em>Sprawl</em></a></span>, easily one of my favorite games of 2023, a shot as it contains some engaging wall-running action and so much more).</p><p>It would be wonderful to see another <em>Titanfall</em>, complete with a great single-player experience that takes everything learned from the first and second games, and <em>Apex Legends</em>, and delivers an energetic, gravity defying shooter punctuated by epic and engaging gameplay with mechs. — <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>NanaOn-Sha’s rhythm game about a rapping dog may not be the most complex take on the genre, but the <em>Parappa the Rapper </em>series is still incredibly distinct. Parappa is a regular teenager dealing with regular teenage problems, but he gets through them by rapping alongside different teachers. A dog rapping alongside a sentient onion as he learns karate or taking his driver’s test with a moose shouldn’t work, but <em>Parappa the Rapper </em>pulls off each of these scenarios with style, an incredible soundtrack, and a deceptively simple rhythm game with hidden perks for improvising. The sequel doesn’t have as many bops, but the jump to the PlayStation 2 let the team flex and create cooler music videos to accompany each song.</p><p>It’s all very silly, and even though there hasn’t been a new game in over 20 years, the main character and his silly little songs have persisted over the decades through merchandise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/discover/step-on-the-gas-meme&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/step-on-the-gas-meme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and memes</a></span>. A <em>Parappa the Rapper 3 </em>makes perfect sense as something Sony could drop on PlayStation Network for relatively cheap. This is the exact kind of project that digital storefronts are made for. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div><div><p>One of the all-time best feelings I’ve felt in any game I’ve ever played is free-falling in <em>Gravity Rush</em>. The series’ protagonist Kat is one of the most gorgeously drawn and animated characters I’ve ever seen, and she is never more expressive than when she is dropping from the sky. <em>Gravity Rush</em>’s camera swings anywhere you want it to go, allowing you to frame Kat’s free fall however you please. You can follow her from afar, ascribe to cinematography’s rule-of-thirds and frame her dramatically, or stick the camera comically close to her. Kat’s hair and clothes catch in the wind, which rushes past her as she twirls through the air and spreads her arms with reckless abandon. She’s like a little kid realizing that she can fly for the first time.<br></p><p><em>Gravity Rush </em>had a lot going for it, like its gravity-defying combat, its beautifully drawn world which lifted design elements from classical French architecture, and its charming cast of characters, but its biggest draw is that it’s simply <em>the </em>most liberating game. Tons of games allow me to do far more than <em>Gravity Rush</em>, but few of them have ever matched the high of being suspended above a town and then just letting it go. There’s something intoxicating and empowering about Kat’s ability to reduce the world to a blur around her as she zips past it all. It’s just best-in-class movement, and it’s criminal that Japan Studio and Team Gravity aren’t around to give us more astounding worlds to float around in. — <strong>Moises Taveras</strong></p></div><div><p>Putting Banjo and Kazooie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/surprise-banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-smash-ultimate-1835415834&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/surprise-banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-smash-ultimate-1835415834">in <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a></span> was a no-brainer, but I’m always wary of companies cashing in on a beloved franchise with zero commitment. It’s been 16 years since the last <em>Banjo-Kazooie </em>game, and even that wasn’t the platformer fans have been asking for since <em>Banjo-Tooie</em> in 2000. The company is busy with <em>Sea of Thieves </em>these days, but if Microsoft has enough money to acquire a bunch of studios then promptly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192">gut them</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685">shut them down</a></span>, it could instead nurture the IP and talent it already has. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Speaking of Rare, <em>Viva Piñata</em> is a perfect video game. You’re telling me a garden simulator in which you build a home for living piñatas that reproduce by dancing doesn’t sound like the tightest shit you’ve ever played? Then maybe you should boot up the <em>Rare Replay</em> collection and see for yourself. <em>Viva Piñata</em> should have been huge. The games were great (well, with the exception of the <em>Party Animals </em>mini-game compilation) and Microsoft made it a multimedia franchise, so we got a pretty funny television show out of the deal that lasted a few years. But we tragically haven’t seen anything out of the series since 2008’s <em>Trouble in Paradise </em>and <em>Pocket Paradise</em> launched on the Xbox 360 and Nintendo DS, respectively. Unfortunately, I can’t imagine a version of <em>Viva Piñata </em>on modern platforms that doesn’t succumb to some insufferable live-service bullshit like microtransactions to buy in-game supplies or your character becoming “tired” if you don’t pay for an extension that day. But I can dream of another trip to Piñata Island in 4K. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong><br></p></div><div><p>How do we live in a timeline with hyper advanced ray-tracing graphics technology and no new <em>Splinter Cell</em> game? For that matter, how is that the case and we don’t have a major AAA stealth title that takes advantage of this tech? Or just one that exists period? (Sorry, I don’t count <em>Hitman</em>. Cry about it).</p><p>What little I had of a happy childhood was often spent between <em>Metal Gear Solid </em>and <em>Splinter Cell</em>. I came to <em>MGS</em> for the great gameplay and mind-bending story. But <em>Splinter Cell</em> was the more sophisticated stealth experience that got better with each game (until around <em>Double Agent</em> where things got kinda meh). Light, sound, precision movement through hostile territory, and, of course, impressive graphics that weren’t just flashy ways to show off your hardware, but were actually dynamic parts of the stealth action.</p><p>Gaming tech has only gotten more sophisticated since the last <em>Splinter Cell </em>games. I usually don’t beg for bleeding edge tech, but a new <em>Splinter Cell</em> (which apparently, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-remake-concept-art-sam-fisher-free-game-1849798206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-remake-concept-art-sam-fisher-free-game-1849798206">maybe, might, sorta happen</a></span>—and god help Ubisoft if Michael Ironside isn’t voicing Sam again), would have me salivating over how advanced lighting and rendering techniques could make the game look and feel amazing to play. — <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>The first <em>Killzone </em>came along when I was far too young to reasonably play it, but the second struck at just the right time. Touted as PlayStation’s next big thing, the visually sumptuous shooter represented the very cutting edge of technology, and I took that bait <em>hard</em>. <em>Killzone 2 </em>was the game that taught me about the importance of visual fidelity and it just so happened to be an incredibly weighty and hardcore multiplayer FPS as well. I was forged in the insanity of <em>Resistance</em>’s all-out wars and <em>Killzone’s </em>tight-knit and punchy encounters.<br></p><p><em>Killzone </em>was probably ultimately brought down by its ridiculously high production values, but some of the stuff in that game is still top tier all these years later. The brutal melee executions of <em>Killzone 3 </em>instilled a love of animation in my friends and I that we still haven’t shaken. I can still recall the satisfying pound of the shotgun in <em>Killzone 2, </em>and the brain-tickling tick that confirmed a kill in it and <em>Killzone: Mercenary</em>. Speaking of, <em>Mercenary </em>is one of the finest adaptations of a series to a handheld platform that I’ve ever played, and a criminally overlooked game in that series and on the PS Vita.</p><p>I’m the first person to often bemoan something that feels overproduced, but if I may be self-indulgent, I’d love to see another shot at <em>Killzone </em>sometime in the future. — <strong>Moises Taveras</strong></p></div><div><p>My first <em>Deus Ex</em> was its first sequel: <em>Invisible War</em>. It’s an entry that’s not terribly popular with enthusiasts of the original game, but it remains a competent immersive sim that likely was my personal introduction to the genre and franchise.<br></p><p>I would eventually go on to play the original (though not to completion, which I really ought to do something about) and came to understand why it was so memorable. Its thick atmosphere of enigmatic conspiracy theories and gripping, unpredictable gameplay of interlocking systems—finding keys and codes for rooms, staying out of sight of enemy patrols—was a perpetual motion machine of espionage and high-concept science fiction themes that I just couldn’t get enough of.</p><p>But while Adam Jensen’s pair of imsim adventures were solid, they felt like they were leading to an eventual third release that’d combine the best of <em>Human Revolution </em>and <em>Mankind Divided</em> into an excellent, moody cyberpunk-esque adventure to save the world. Sadly, that’s unlikely to happen. Sure, there was a solid eight-year gap between <em>Invisible War</em> and <em>Human Revolution</em>, and we’re right around eight years since the last game, <em>Mankind Divided</em>. But tumultuous brand management seems destined to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-3-adam-jensen-actor-stop-talking-sequel-eidos-1851252201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-3-adam-jensen-actor-stop-talking-sequel-eidos-1851252201">keep us from another <em>Deus Ex</em> title</a></span> for some time yet. Perhaps forever.</p><p>It’s a shame because there’s just nothing like <em>Deus Ex</em> and the world is starved of great immersive sim titles. — <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>My friends used to make fun of me because I liked <em>Red Faction</em>. I don’t know why. But I do know that their distaste of this futuristic, working-class revolution-themed shooter franchise was their loss. To be fair, my memories of the earlier days of this franchise are a little fuzzy as I get on in years, but the more recent <em>Red Faction: Guerilla</em> remains a satisfying game to play. Sure, it falls victim to the condition of having a large open world that is a little too empty, but the destructive physics systems which detail intricate and satisfying collapses of buildings and objects never gets old.</p><p>And hey, with a game that is about literally <em>smashing</em> the status quo to build a better future, there’s a narrative cohesion between the game’s systems that makes the whole experience just more entertaining and immersive. It’s also been 15 years since <em>Guerilla</em>’s release date (it was re-Mars-tered six years ago), and 13 years since it’s so-so follow-up <em>Armageddon</em>, so it’s safe to say this one’s probably gonna continue sleeping for the unforeseeable future. Which, like many other dead franchises, is a shame given how computing power has grown since <em>Guerilla</em> arrived on PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 release a decade-and-a-half ago. I mean, look at stuff like <em>Teardown</em>!</p><p>Our gaming machines are so much more powerful these days and I long for more wildly destructive physics simulations while uniting the Martian working class. — <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>Hello, it’s me, your resident PlayStation FPS freak. At the outset of the PS3 era, Sony had two major franchises fostering entirely unique shooter experiences. One of them was viscerally realistic and grim <em>Killzone</em>, and the other was my beloved off-kilter <em>Resistance</em>. I didn’t play the original, but one of my older cousins had picked up the second title on PS3. If you ask most folks my age, the formative FPS title of their youth is probably a <em>Call of Duty </em>title, specifically <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>. While I’ve certainly got room in my heart for that legendary game, my love for the genre is entirely predicated on <em>Resistance 2</em> and the sleepless nights me and my cousin spent duking it out in its massive 60-player Skirmish matches with one of the greatest armories of any FPS title.<br></p><p><em>Resistance </em>was simply everything to me. It was massive and it was weird as hell. In the brief time that we had with the series, it ran the gamut of tones. The bookends of the trilogy were bleak post-apocalyptic shooters (<em>Resistance 3 </em>is particularly great), but the middle installment was cartoonish and all over the place. Nathan Hale and Joseph Capelli, the trilogy’s protagonists, could not be a greater representation of the series’ unique schisms across entries. <em>Resistance</em> was, above all else, fun as hell though, and it’s where I got my sea legs. <em>Resistance</em>’s weaponry, which took inspiration from Insomniac’s main series, <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>, also remains burned into my brain. The Augur remains one of my favorite weapons in any game and I learned trigger discipline while carefully placing tags on enemies and shooting them from around corners with the Bullseye.</p><p>Letting the series go has been one of the hardest pills to swallow over the last decade, especially because <em>Resistance 3 </em>really felt like it finally settled on a tone and formula that worked. Sure, it also brought the story to a pretty natural close, but there were enough interesting threads, especially as far as the origins of the invading alien species known as the Chimera, to expand upon the series and turn it into a pulpy sci-fi saga. I miss you all the time, <em>Resistance</em>. — <strong>Moises Taveras</strong></p></div><div><p>In the ‘90s, I didn’t play <em>Syphon Filter</em> nearly as much as I played another sneaky, espionage title: <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>. And you know, for good reason. <em>MGS</em> was just more on my wavelength, but I enjoyed cheering <em>Syphon Filter</em> on from the sides. It didn’t seem to have the narrative-heavy experience I craved, and wasn’t as sneaky, but to me that always made me more curious about it.</p><p>It’s been some years since I gave the first <em>Syphon Filter</em> a try, and I’m feeling a return to it is necessary for me. But I’m also kinda bummed that the franchise doesn’t exist prominently in Sony’s catalog. As has been exhibited with <em>Resistance</em>, <em>Killzone</em>, and <em>SOCOM</em>, PlayStation has been home to off-beat shooters that I wish the company would maintain a presence in instead of just prestige AAA titles of the kind they mostly invest their money in.</p><p>And in a world without an active <em>Splinter Cell</em>, and whilst <em>MGS</em> still wrestles with its post-Kojima identity crisis, what an opportunity for <em>Syphon Filter</em> to make a return with excellent espionage action, tense shootouts, world-ending consequences, and insurmountable odds that you’re expected to sneak, shoot, and survive your way through.</p><p>Gabe, I never got to know ya like Snake and Sam, but damn if right now isn’t a perfect time for a new espionage thriller from this classic franchise, I don’t know when is. — <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>Looking back on <em>Viewtiful Joe</em>, Capcom’s short-lived side-scrolling beat-em-up, I was surprised at just how quickly the series came and went. The first game in 2003 was part of the “Capcom Five,” a five-game initiative from the company to bring original games to the GameCube (it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/remembering-capcoms-great-nintendo-promise-betrayal-5806800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/remembering-capcoms-great-nintendo-promise-betrayal-5806800">a whole drama back in the day</a></span>). The sequel solidified <em>Viewtiful Joe </em>as a series the next year, but the spin-offs that followed in 2005 failed to set the world on fire. In the years since, creator Hideki Kamiya (who went on to co-found <em>Bayonetta </em>developer PlatinumGames) has said he would like to return to the franchise, whether that be with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.siliconera.com/hideki-kamiya-wants-viewtiful-joe-dmc-remake-dante-x-bayonneta-crossover/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.siliconera.com/hideki-kamiya-wants-viewtiful-joe-dmc-remake-dante-x-bayonneta-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remake of the first game</a></span> or with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/03/hideki_kamiya_would_love_to_release_viewtiful_joe_3_and_finish_that_trilogy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/03/hideki_kamiya_would_love_to_release_viewtiful_joe_3_and_finish_that_trilogy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third entry</a></span>. For now, we’ll just have to be content with the title character being playable in <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em>…oh wait, they took him out in <em>Infinite</em>. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong><br></p></div><div><p>For a time during the PS2 era, the <em>SSX </em>games offered up awesome extreme sports action, letting you do sick snowboarding tricks while listening to “It’s Tricky” by Run-D.M.C. It’s been over a decade since EA tried to bring the franchise back with the more realistic and well-reviewed <em>SSX </em>for Xbox 360 and PS3. Even though that last entry sold well, it seems EA isn’t convinced the world wants zany snowboarding action anymore. What a shame.</p><p>While I’m not sure a big AAA <em>SSX </em>game would sell in 2024 or is the right move, I don’t think that’s the direction the franchise should take. Instead, look to <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater</em> and its recent remake of the first two games as inspiration. I bet there are a few studios out there that would be willing to remaster or remake the first three games into one rad package for modern consoles. Or just make a new <em>SSX </em>that is free-to-play and borrows its economy from <em>Fortnite</em>. I don’t know, just bring it back in some form EA. Let me do a sick 2160 off a snowy cliff again as Eddie. — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>Some franchises on this list feel like they were never given a chance to become something big and successful. Then you have a series like Capcom’s <em>Dead Rising</em>, which feels like it’s been given a few chances and yet has exploded in the way you’d think a game about killing thousands of zombies would have. I think the problem isn’t just zombie fatigue, but that <em>Dead Rising</em> as a franchise is extremely inconsistent. Beyond the crowds of zombies and the ability to kill them all using anything you find, the games have changed a lot and that’s made it hard to develop a fanbase.</p><p>If I were to give Capcom some advice, it would be to look back at that first game and try again. But this time, embrace the harder and less flexible format of<em> Dead Rising 1</em>. People love that shit nowadays. Games like <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>show that players crave challenges and difficulty in a way that maybe they didn’t back in the early days of the 360. And leverage the newer consoles to make the biggest zombie game yet, too. Imagine an open-world zombie game 10x bigger than any previous <em>Dead Rising</em>, but as hard and unforgiving as <em>Dark Souls</em>. That shit would sell like hotcakes! — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>Sure, <em>technically </em>Valve has sort of (kind of) continued to update <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>, sometimes with the help of fans, but I still consider this franchise dead, like most other Valve franchises. Which is sad, because <em>Left 4 Dead</em> ruled.</p><p>Valve did what Valve does best, and crafted two online co-op shooters that were perfect to play. Shooting down hordes of zombies with friends or hunting down other players as a special infected was a blast. Even if you played online without a mic, Valve built <em>L4D1 </em>and its sequel in a way that made it totally possible to play without talking. (Though chatting did help!) It also crafted characters, like Zoey and Ellis, that people cared about. I still think about Bill sacrificing himself in the final <em>L4D1 </em>DLC to this day. Hopefully, someone else at Valve is also thinking about <em>Left 4 Dead</em>. I hope so, because this franchise and its fans deserve a third entry. — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>Okay, hold on. Come back. What if I told you Sony’s attempt at a <em>Smash Bros. </em>crossover fighter ruled, actually? Yes, it didn’t take off the way Nintendo’s brawler has, but it had some cool ideas, and in between the characters clearly added to advertise an upcoming project, the roster is pretty fucking solid. But even if you think <em>PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale </em>was a garbage copycat, we’re not here to retread the mistakes of the past. We’re envisioning a better future.</p><p>In the 12 years since <em>PlayStation All-Stars </em>launched on PS3 and Vita, Sony has gathered a lot of new, much-loved characters like Astro, Ellie, and Aloy to add to the roster, and has more cultural cache than they did during the PS3 generation to negotiate better guest characters. What if we got actual Dante instead of the <em>DmC: Devil May Cry </em>one because Capcom was clearly trying to make the game an ad for its upcoming game? Sony could secure egregious omissions like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro to properly represent the PlayStation brand’s history. I just want them to get a second chance to do it right, and PlayStation’s certainly in a better place to do that now than they were when the PlayStation 3 was in last place. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It was a few days ago that news surfaced regarding a potential Fallout x Call of Duty crossover bundle. Given the recent success of the Fallout TV show and the ongoing effort by Activision Blizzard’s studios to collaborate with every brand in the pop culture market, it seemed like it was only a matter of time before it surfaced for real.</p>



<p>Dataminers recently leaked an image online showing the ‘Fallout Vault Dweller Tracker Pack’. This pack looks as though it’ll contain a blueprint for the M4 and M16, and ‘Vault Suit’ skins for Gaz, Soap, Price, and Ghost.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-apocalyptic-w-or-l">Apocalyptic W or L?</h2>



<p>Many were expecting something a little more substantial from this crossover, given how overwhelmingly successful the Fallout TV show has been since it was released on April 9. For instance, there’s an upcoming Fallout collaboration in Fortnite that’s already looking infinitely better than this leaked COD crossover.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1795854134223970702/photo/1">the leaked art</a> that was found by dataminers, Modern Warfare’s core squad – Ghost, Soap, Price, and Gaz – have donned iconic Vault Suits modelled on those found in the new TV show. They’ve also got some Vault-Tec branded weapons – but that seems to be the full extent of the Fallout Vault Dweller Tracer Pack. It’s a safe assumption that there will also be the usual charms, emblems, and player cards associated with bundles, and the tracer pack element will most likely replicate the laser-focused weapons commonly found across the Fallout universe.</p>



<p>Will you be investing in the Fallout Vault Dweller Tracer Pack in Call of Duty?</p>

        <p>Introducing a battle system mixing <a title="Genres > Action [1,857 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> and strategy to allow you to play the way you like.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>On a planet called Era, people are bound to one of the Seven Deadly Sins before their first birthday via a religious ceremony called the Nexus Ritual. All their life, the inhabitants of Era have to fight against their urges. Should they fail and succumb, they transform into mindless and aggressive beasts. The Unio religion representatives – the Arkhons – ensure that everyone follows the rules and put down any monsters that appear in the cities.</p><p>One day, a woman gives birth to twins, something that never happened before. The Prime Arkhon, supreme leader of Era, conducts the Nexus Ritual himself. However, something goes wrong, and one baby is bound to all seven sins, while the other receives none.</p><p>The twins are taken to the capital, Avilah, where they are brought up as Arkhon apprentices. They are never allowed to leave the walls of the sanctuary…<br>But one day, Leht, the twin bound to the seven sins, manages to leave the city. His brother Cyphel is sent on a mission to find and bring him back. He is accompanied by two seasoned Arkhons, Gram and Enki.</p><p>The journey of Cyphel and Leht is one of self-discovery, one that will allow them to grow and become the people they were destined to be.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cyphel Fyrbrand</strong> – Since Cyphel was not bound to any Sin during the Nexus Ritual, his childhood was significantly easier than his brother’s. He grew up to be a kindhearted, yet naive young man. Cyphel is usually obedient but he willingly follows Leht when he is up to some mischief.</li><li><strong>Gram Stoneheim</strong> – This strong woman taught the art of fighting to the twins. She can be harsh sometimes, especially with Leht, because she sees great potential in him. She is an Arkhon and works closely with Enki.</li><li><strong>Enki Taillevent</strong> – Enki is an Arkhon and a teacher to the twins. He is less strict than Gram, sometimes he can even be seen as lax. His kind demeanor and his sense of humor make him a great person to be around.</li><li>More to be announced.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Lost Hellden</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,097 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,382 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [26,731 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2355020/Lost_Hellden/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a title="Companies > Epic Games [338 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/epic-games">Epic Games</a> Store, and GOG in 2025.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><h2><span>Commented Gameplay Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Lost Hellden - Gameplay Commenté Combat | AG French Direct 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJtqgXO4KIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
