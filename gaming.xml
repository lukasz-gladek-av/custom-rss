<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Bounty Hunter&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on August 1st, and it'll sport improved environment textures and new dynamic lighting. It'll also allow you to use a flashlight to navigate dark areas.</p>
<p>What's more, if you manage to complete the game's campaign, you'll unlock a Boba Fett skin, allowing you to play through the entirety of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter&nbsp;</em>as another of the most notorious bounty hunters in the galaxy.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>terms, you might recognize Aspyr's name from the recent&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-update-1">drew fan ire</a> for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response">network connection issues</a>, the presence of bugs and issues that weren't problems in the original games, and more.</p>
<p>The studio was also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jason-schreier-confirms-kotor-remake-done-by-aspyr-media">the original developer</a> on the long-awaited&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-knight-of-old-republic-remake-kotor-remake"><em>Knights of the Old Republic&nbsp;</em>remake</a>, although development on that project was apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/theres-new-knights-of-old-republic-studio-taking-reins">taken over by Saber Interactive in August 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Outside the galaxies of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>, Aspyr has ported a number of other games to modern systems, the most recent of which being&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered"><em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em>, it's a 2002 shooter originally developed and published by LucasArts.</p>
<p>The game sees bounty hunter Jango Fett hired by a Sith Lord to take down a Dark Jedi. Along the way, he becomes embroiled in a criminal conspiracy, because hey, what else is a Fett to do?</p>
<p>The remaster of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on August 1st. Watch this space for more info.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/albatroz">Albatroz</a> is a "backpacking adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>" that takes place in The Forbidden Lands, a photogenic wilderness "where two worlds converge". You are jaded city worker Isla, and you are here to search for your missing brother, who was himself searching for the mystical mountain of Albatroz - locally known as "the walking mountain", for reasons that you will never guess. There's no combat, and no enemies that I can see - instead, you'll occupy yourself with equipment management, repairing your dinky car, and improving your hiking skills using points earned by doing favours for villagers along the way.</p><!--more-->
<p>This, truly, is a combination of elements precision-tooled to entice the long-haul <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> fan burned out on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It's a game of verdant valleys and big skies, whose otherworldly elements are kept in check by the practicalities of travel and survival. It's on show at Gamescom Latam 2024 at the São Paulo Expo centre - the first Latin American edition of Gamescom - and they've released a new trailer below.</p>

<p>Speaking as somebody who can't finish a workday without wanting to hurry Bilbo Baggins-style out the door and straight into the nearest moderately-sized national park, I am dead keen on the "backpacking RPG" getup. I am considerably less keen on the game's being presented as a big vibrant metaphor for wrestling with loss and the process of self-discovery.</p>
<p>The trailer dialogue is so on the nose it gives me a nosebleed, and well, when is heading off into the wilderness <em>not</em> some variation on the act of letting go in order to find yourself? I'm probably being very condescending and unkind to developers Among Giants, here. I'm sure the sentiments are heartfelt. But I'm fervently hoping the full version involves much less poignant self-reflection and philosophising, and a lot more silent hiking and beholding.</p>
<p>The writing isn't all monuments to mortality. There are those villages, each of which has its history and spread of personalities. Providing these trips into town are appropriately spread out, I can imagine them being a nice change from the isolation of hiking - it depends how "vast" the environments are in practice. As for the survival elements, you can pass out if you run out of supplies, but it doesn't look like you'll be limping back to town with broken ankles and a case of dysentry. This feels much closer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons</a> than The Revenant.</p>
<p>Albatroz is out this year. There's a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2171880/Albatroz/">Steam</a>, which I'll be trying out later, unless I do succumb to the call of the open road, in which case I'll probably get as far as the local Dominos before heading back home to watch House Of The Dragon. If you enjoy going for long walks but would prefer a bit more friction, why not go for a stroll in Sons Of The Forest? Alice O (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pretty-walking-simulator-sons-of-the-forest-offers-peaceful-seclusion">says it's lovely in there</a> and she has yet to lie to my face.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24187358/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-copies-sold</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-reaches-5m-players-in-first-week.913404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24187358/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-copies-sold<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="jCH23B"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> sold 5 million units in its first three days of availability, publisher Bandai Namco announced Thursday, an impressive figure that equates to about one-fifth of the original game’s overall fanbase. </p>
<p id="YUp9Tc">Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware announced in June, nine days ahead of the DLC’s launch, that <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1800890964925366476"><em>Elden Ring</em> had sold 25 million copies</a> since its release in February 2022. (It was the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23070948/elden-ring-sales-chart-npd-call-of-duty-best-sellers">bestselling game in the U.S. that year</a>, according to analysts.)</p>
<p id="3ZSoqi">That some 20% of all <em>Elden Ring</em> players have jumped into the notoriously difficult DLC is impressive, especially when you factor in the completion rate of the feats required to even access <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. Two weeks prior to the DLC’s launch, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176047/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-preparation-achievements-completed">more than half of all <em>Elden Ring</em> players across multiple platforms hadn’t defeated the two bosses</a> — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Starscourge Radahn</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Mogh, Lord of Blood</a> — required to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24087766/how-to-access-dlc-start-location-requirements">access the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> map</a>.</p>
<p id="wDdokG">Even today, more than 20% of <em>Elden Ring</em> players haven’t accomplished the most basic of feats: reaching the Roundtable Hold, where many of the game’s NPCs reside.</p>
<p id="icqjKG">Completion rates for felling Starscourge Radahn and Mogh, Lord of Blood have gone up since then, but, in some cases, only by a fraction of percentage points. It appears that the most dedicated <em>Elden Ring</em> players are the ones continuing into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which isn’t much of a surprise. But that stick-to-itiveness hasn’t prevented some players from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24186312/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-difficulty-too-hard-git-gud">complaining that the DLC is unfairly hard</a>.</p>
<p id="ERQdww"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s early success only serves to reinforce what FromSoftware has already said: that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22980899/elden-ring-new-franchise-fromsoftware">Elden Ring is a new franchise</a> for the developer that it hopes to “[expand] beyond the realm of games.”</p>
<p id="p72EeD"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. If you’re struggling, check out Polygon’s extensive <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree </em>guides</a> to finding the all-important <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178006/scadutree-fragment-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Scadutree Fragments</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24183189/dlc-remembrance-all-rewards-how-to-get-sote">boss Remembrances</a>, and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180256/all-new-dlc-weapon-locations">weapons</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180257/all-spell-locations">spells</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24177999/talisman-locations-all-dlc-sote">talismans</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180255/all-new-dlc-armor-set-locations">armor</a> you’ll need to make the <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC slightly easier.</p>

Many shared screenshots of an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hard-drive.net/hd/video-games/nintendo-holds-12-hour-meeting-to-decide-if-company-can-survive-selling-donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-for-less-than-60/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hard-drive.net/hd/video-games/nintendo-holds-12-hour-meeting-to-decide-if-company-can-survive-selling-donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-for-less-than-60/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old <em>Hard Drive</em> parody</a></span> titled “Nintendo Holds 12 Hour Meeting to Decide if Company Can Survive Selling ‘Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze’ for Less Than $60.” Fans on Reddit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dpf4m2/donkey_kong_country_returns_hd_is_priced_at_60_usd/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dpf4m2/donkey_kong_country_returns_hd_is_priced_at_60_usd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were also flummoxed</a></span>. “I don’t understand why Nintendo gets away with this,” wrote one user. “If Ubisoft or EA pulled this type of stuff, you’d see dozens of boycott posts a day.”</p><p>You can see the logic in the company’s thinking. Since the sequel,<em> Tropical Freeze</em>, was priced at $60, doing the same for <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em> helps signal that it’s a similar value proposition, and deserves the same premium. On the other hand, <em>Tropical Freeze </em>was a Wii U port that added more to the previous version. It was also arguably a better game. </p><p>You can see a lot of examples of Nintendo experimenting with variable pricing for its back catalog. <em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong </em>was a remake of a Game Boy Advance Game and it was only $50. <em>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp</em> was $60 but it included visual overhauls of two games. And then there was <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em>, an immaculate re-rendering of the GameCube classic that was only $40. </p><p>That’s the one that has people scratching their heads the most in comparison to <em>Returns HD</em>. Does Nintendo just have less faith in the <em>Metroid</em> brand or did it just want to see what would happen if it sold <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>’s predecessor at a much more aggressive price? <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, another remaster of a GameCube game, was $60 after all. Such is the power of the mustachioed plumber, even when he’s a 2D cutout. Then again, the <em>Super Mario</em> <em>3D All-Stars</em>, a collection containing <em>Super Mario 64, Sunshine, </em>and <em>Galaxy</em>, was $60 for three games. Who can know the mind of Nintendo? Not me. </p><p>It’s hard to get too mad at the company for trying to preserve the value of its back catalog, even if I’ll stick to my 3DS copy of the game at that price. But what it does do is make the anomaly of <em>Metroid Prime</em> feel like even more of a steal. The game’s even on sale right now for just $34 on the eShop. Hopefully, some potential <em>Metroid Prime 2</em> and <em>3 </em>remasters keep the trend going. Maybe they’ll even get bundled for $60 for both. A Nintendo fan can dream. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But new players aren't the only ones having trouble mastering the game's intimidating combat system. From Software president and Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki struggles with the game's difficulty, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Miyazaki recently revealed that while he's very hands-on in terms of playing his games while they're being developed, he tends not to play his games after release.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"After the release, I tend to not want to touch it, because I know I'm going to either find things that I left on the table or issues that will bug me," he said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki" rel="nofollow ">The Guardian</a>. "And once I become a player, I'm powerless to do anything significant to change it. So once a game is out in the wild, I tend to not play."</p><p dir="ltr">But things changed when it came to the development of the game's new DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>. To prepare for the release of the DLC, Miyazaki played through the entirety of Elden Ring's main storyline, and just like many players, he faced some serious struggles.</p><p dir="ltr">"I want to preface this by saying I absolutely suck at video games, so my approach or play style was to use everything I have at my disposal, all the assistance, every scrap of aid that the game offers, and also all the knowledge that I have as the architect of the game," he explained. "The freedom and open-world nature of Elden Ring perhaps lowered the barrier to entry, and I might be the one who's benefiting the most from that, as a player, more than anyone else."</p><p dir="ltr">Historically, Miyazaki's games haven't had sequels (with Dark Souls being the exception), and it seems that Shadow of the Erdtree is the end of the road for Elden Ring--at least for now. But Miyazaki did claim he'd be open to a film project set in the Elden Ring universe, saying, "I don't see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring--a movie, for example."</p><p dir="ltr">That said, Miyazaki and From Software aren't in a rush to sell off film rights to just anyone. If an Elden Ring movie happens, Miyazaki wants it done right.</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't think myself, or From Software, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium," he said of the potential for a film adaptation. "So that's where a very strong partner would come into play. We'd have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure."</p><p dir="ltr">As for his next game, there's no telling what Miyazaki is planning, but he did hint that future games will likely try to follow Elden Ring's slightly more forgiving game mechanics, as the game's open world allowed players to retreat from challenges that were too difficult, then return once they were better equipped to handle them.</p><p>"Traditionally, we've always liked the higher-difficulty curve type of games and experiences," he recently told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-talks-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapons-and-more/#google_vignette">CNET</a>. "But I think that nature in and of itself alienates a portion of the game-playing audience, whereas Elden Ring succeeded in casting a wider net but at the same time keeping that core high learning curve."</p><p>Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is available now and earned a rare 10/10. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">GameSpot's Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>, we said the new DLC "makes the game hard again." For players in search of a bigger challenge, Shadow of the Erdtree will not disappoint.</p>

These elements are essential for customization and gameplay orientation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Traits </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">act as statistics that give a hero a specific history and role, slightly orienting their build. They allow you to differentiate each character from the outset by assigning them unique characteristics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Perks </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">are powerful gameplay elements, the most exciting feature in character customization. They are chosen as you level up and allow you to customize your hero's build significantly. Perks offer passive advantages that can radically change the way a hero is played. There are eight perk collections available per hero:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Three fixed Archetype collections: Warrior, Archer, Mage.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two Specialization Perk collections, chosen randomly from a pool of 4: Engineer, Plague, Hexer, Assassin.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Three miscellaneous collections, which select Perks from a pool.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="How can we embed the Dwarf Race into this system?">How can we embed the Dwarf Race into this system?</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We, therefore, have access to two powerful tools for customizing a hero. The first is changing attributes. By modifying them, we can better reflect the gameplay utility of the race. If we have a race with fewer hit points and a lot of dodging, we can easily project ourselves onto a nimble but frail race. However, certain Traits should be excluded for certain races, to avoid imbalances. For example, if a race has few health points via its attributes in conjunction with Traits that further reduce maximum health, you're going to have a major balancing problem.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Perks, we decided on a collection based on the same principle as weapon collections (a collection of ten Perks, two Perks per tier), which will replace the "Miscellaneous" collection. The creative line of Perks should reinforce the unique identity of this race.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, a change of attributes doesn't offer a distinctive enough gameplay right from the start. That's why we're introducing an additional race-exclusive element: the racial Perk.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Racial Perk"><span>Racial Perk</span></h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The racial Perk is designed to offer a unique gameplay experience right from the start. A hero of one race should feel and play differently from a hero of another race. This Perk, available from the outset, brings a significant modification to gameplay that reflects the fundamental characteristics of the race. As a result, the player must immediately understand and adapt to the specifics of the chosen race. The racial Perk is the key to differentiating each race and offering varied gameplay strategies.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="What defines a race in The Last Spell?">What defines a race in The Last Spell?</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A new race in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last Spell</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is defined by several elements:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Race-specific starting stats: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">these stats give initial direction to the gameplay.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A racial Perk: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">this unique Perk fundamentally changes the way the hero is played.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A new collection of Perks: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">these Perks are designed to reinforce racial identity and offer rich and varied customization options.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Humans</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>: before embarking on the creation of new races, it's important to consider the race that’s already present in the game: the Humans. Although character customization allows for many variations, the basic characters are Humans. After careful consideration, we've decided to leave Humans unchanged so as not to disrupt player habits and to maintain a solid base for balancing. Humans serve as a stable reference for the introduction and balancing of new races.</span></span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Step 2: Designing a race in The Last Spell">Step 2: Designing a race in The Last Spell</h3><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Imagining a race">Imagining a race</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To illustrate our process, let's look at the creation of the Dwarves of Runenberg.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Dwarves of Runenberg are designed around five keywords: Robust, Brutish, Festive, Group, Slow.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These keywords guide the entire creation of their characteristics and gameplay. Once we've defined our guiding principles, all we have to do is transfer them to our race system:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starting statistics: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Dwarves have fewer movement points but more defense, reflecting their robustness and endurance. This also echoes the "Dwarf Blood" Trait that was already in the game, reinforcing their unique identity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Racial Perk: "Toss Me"</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - inspired by an iconic scene from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Lord of the Rings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, this spell allows a nearby ally to throw a Dwarf, bypassing their natural slowness. This unique mechanic requires a nearby ally to activate, adding a new strategic dimension. "Toss Me" replaces the "Leap Frog" spell, an important skill (and highly appreciated by the community) for controlling your position on the battlefield.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Perk Collection: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the Dwarves' Perk collection fully expresses their characteristics:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Jolly Drinker" counterbalances their slowness with a festive aspect, reinforcing their stamina.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Look At My Muscles" emphasizes their gruffness, enhancing their brute strength.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Warcry" and "Heart of the Party" emphasize the race’s robustness and togetherness, offering buffs to all allies.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p>Image via DANGEN Entertainment.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These Perks have been designed to integrate seamlessly with Dwarf gameplay and offer unique customization options. But that's not all: care must be taken to ensure they also integrate with all other non-racial Perk collections without favoring one Perk collection over another when generating the character. For example, we avoided having a Perk collection that focuses too much on poison and ends up having too strong a synergy with the existing poison collection, pushing the race to perform only with the available poison collection. It's all part of the bigger picture of balancing.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Balancing">Balancing</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Introducing a new race is a real challenge. One of the main ones is to ensure that the new race is balanced with the other races and does not create major imbalances in gameplay. To achieve this, we extensively tested the Dwarves in different game configurations, adjusting their stats and Perks as necessary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last Spell</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can be broken down into several configurations or phases during a game. For example, there's the beginning of the game, the middle and the end. You don't want a hero to be too strong at the start of the game, nor do you want them to be too weak at the end. Scaling is an important part of a hero's progress in the game. Then there's another configuration element to consider: scenarios where the player has one hero located all alone on one side of the Haven to individually defend against a wave of enemies, while having their other heroes far away on another side of the base defending against a different mob. This is where the perks that boost other heroes come into play, as well as a hero's mobility, etc. Last but not least, there's defense near/in the Haven and defense outside of the Haven. These configurations are not mutually exclusive, so you'll need to test each case several times, and with different hero setups... but it's impossible to cover every possible case. We also have to rely on the data we have on our spreadsheets, which are very precise, to get an overall idea of our balancing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also took feedback from the community into account to fine-tune details and ensure that the race is both fun to play and competitive. The exercise is made all the more difficult by the integration of previously unknown mechanics. For example, "Warcry" and "Heart of the Party" are Auras, which are Perks that influence all Heroes on the map, not just the Perk holder. So far, there was no such mechanic, and it's a Perk that's cumulative </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> affects all the heroes on the map. We need to find a good middle ground. It's a fine balance, because you can quickly go from useless Perk to far too strong a Perk. This is where the testing and iteration phase comes in.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Iterating and testing">Iterating and testing</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every change made to stats or Perks is carefully evaluated for its impact on gameplay. We have used combat simulations and in-game tests to observe how Dwarves behave in relation to other races. These tests have enabled us to identify potential imbalances and correct them before release. However, you have to remain humble with your work and be open to criticism. Beyond the initial design intent and our tests, we still need to listen to our players and be ready to make changes if necessary.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Visual and thematic design">Visual and thematic design</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to the gameplay aspects, the visual and thematic design of Dwarves was a key element of the creative process. We worked closely with our artists to develop designs that captured the essence of the Dwarves. Their morphology, faces, skill VFX and animations were carefully crafted to reflect their story and character. Their visual design reinforces the player's immersion and complements the gameplay aspects to deliver a coherent and engaging experience.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Community feedback">Community feedback</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The community plays a crucial role in the balancing process. Their feedback has been invaluable in adjusting aspects of gameplay and improving the gaming experience. For example, following a private Beta and since the release of the DLC, we were able to fine-tune the Dwarf race and ensure that it met our community's expectations. And even today, we're continuing this work to ensure the best possible version.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="In conclusion"><span>In conclusion</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By following this methodical and creative process, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last Spell</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> manages to introduce its first new race and enrich the game while maintaining balance and coherence with existing elements.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was no simple task, as balancing such a game is a difficult one: you have to bring relevant and interesting novelty to a systemically complex and complete game. Players can thus discover new ways of playing and new strategies, making the game experience even more captivating and varied. The creation of races such as the Dwarves demonstrates our commitment to offering innovative content and continually improving the gaming experience for our community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The successful integration of the Dwarves of Runenberg into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last Spell</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> illustrates how a thoughtful and detailed approach can give rise to rich and engaging gameplay elements, offering players new challenges to overcome. We look forward to seeing how our players will continue to exploit the peculiarities of this new race, and how we will continue to enrich the world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last Spell</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, the 2002 action-adventure game, is getting a remake courtesy of Aspyr.
</p>
<p>
The developer describes this as "a new title that brings the original Star Wars: Bounty Hunter to modern platforms with visual enhancements, improved environmental textures, new dynamic lighting effects, and a new flashlight tool."
</p>
<p>
It's set for release on 1st August across Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC (Steam). It'll be priced at $19.99 (£TBA).

<p>

The game has players in the role of Jango Fett shooting and gliding his way across the galaxy, though in this version players will be able to unlock a new Boba Fett skin too as part of an Easter egg from the original game.
</p>
<p>
Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-swbountyhunter-ps2">Star Wars Bounty Hunter review</a> from back in the day described the game as "pretty and stylish" but the Star Wars setting "can't mask the shallow, unexciting gameplay from view".

</p>
<p>
Aspyr, part of Embracer Group, has released a number of Star Wars re-releases and remakes, including most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/players-criticise-star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-for-bugs-server-woes-at-launch">Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</a>, which was plagued with bugs and server woes at launch.

</p>
<p>
It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2-the-sith-lords-restored-content-dlc-has-been-cancelled">cancelled expected DLC for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 - The Sith Lords</a>, which would have restored lost content.

</p>
<p>
Outside of Star Wars, the developer was mostly praised for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review">Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered collection</a>, but courted controversy with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered-will-restore-pin-up-posters">inclusion of pin-up posters</a>.

            <p>YouTube is a stocked repository of hours upon hours of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> lore. Ranni’s ending? No worries. Miquella and St. Trina? We got you. Mohg and the Formless Mother? Say no more. Turtle Pope? Sit back. The frenzied flame? Make yourself comfortable. The Elden Ring itself? One page is not enough to contain it all.</p>
<p>And yet, what use are any of you when I cannot find a single solitary lore snippet about these idiot worms?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here is everything I know about these worms:</p>
<ul>
<li>They like to hang out near gravestones, but so do a lot of things.</li>
<li>They seem to be somehow connected to the spirit jellyfish in the Lands Between. They even glow red when they’re angry.</li>
<li>I found a bunch of them protecting a turtle once.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m honestly ravenous for lore here. They’re so numerous and prominent in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> that I’m convinced that they’re absolutely vital to the entire setup. They don’t seem to drop any items. None of the NPCs will shut up about Miquella long enough to give me a scrap of information about them. I tried asking one some questions and it just very slowly retreated into the dirt.</p>

<p>I’m lost. Rudderless. Completely stranded in a world in which I understand zilch about its most interesting inhabitants. This is not subtle worldbuilding - it’s deeply unethical. Please, help me understand. First person to tell me something good gets a fiver. I mean, not really, but you know.</p>

You are allowed to restart them if you haven’t died or completed all of the objectives already, but if you happen to do either of those, you will be locked out of the mission. So if you’ve got some shit to take out on McGregor in the game, you best make your shot count.</p><p>McGregor will be appearing in <em>Hitman </em>as a, you guessed it, MMA fighter known as The Disruptor, and will actually be facing off in a match against a character previously featured in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hitman-3-the-kotaku-review-1846083354&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-3-the-kotaku-review-1846083354"><em>Hitman 3</em></a></span> on a map from <em>Hitman 2</em>. It is apparently Agent 47’s responsibility to take him out before the match actually begins, and according to the trailer, it doesn’t sound like the other guy stands a chance against The Disruptor.</p><p>The Disruptor is not only modeled after Mcgregor, but is in fact, fully voiced by the fighter-turned-movie-star too. Earlier this week, McGregor revealed he would be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dualshockers.com/conor-mcgregor-says-new-video-game-announcement-this-week/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dualshockers.com/conor-mcgregor-says-new-video-game-announcement-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starring in a game</a></span> that’d be announced sometime in the next few days before deleting his post on X (formerly known as Twitter). Now I guess we know what he was talking about!</p><p>McGregor has not only made a name for himself in the ring, but outside of it too. He’s taken on quite the reputation for mouthing off about opponents outside of fights, earning him the moniker “The Notorious,” and on top of that, the guy has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/conor-mcgregor-ufc-champion-timeline-arrests-abuse-1234772835/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/conor-mcgregor-ufc-champion-timeline-arrests-abuse-1234772835/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courted controversy after controversy</a></span>, including sexual assault allegations against him, as well as the most assault charges I’ve ever seen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on a Wikipedia page</a></span>.

<p>There were talks for a Grand Theft Auto (GTA) movie, but it never got much further than that.</p>



<p>Dan Houser, the co-founder of Rockstar Games and former head writer at the studio, recently <a href="https://theankler.com/p/dan-houser-absurd-ventures-hollywood-videogames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke to The Akler</a> where he talked about the time Rockstar met with Hollywood executives about making a possible film.  These “awkward dates”, as he called them, had him never being convinced howa movie could benefit Rockstar more than the games themselves would.</p>



<p>“[W]e’d ask [the executives], why would we do this?” Houser said, to which the response would always be along the lines of, “You get to make a movie”.</p>



<p>“And we’d be like, no, what you’ve described is&nbsp;you&nbsp;making a movie and us having no control and taking a huge risk that we’re going to end up paying for with something that belongs to us,” he said.</p>



<p>He then continued to talk about how it felt like the executives pitching a movie to Rockstar thought the company would be “blinded by the lights” of Hollywood. Houser said, however, that the company never wavered on what it knew it had with the GTA franchise.</p>



<p>“We had what we considered to be multi-billion-dollar IP, and the economics never made sense,” he said. “The risk never made sense. In those days, the perception was that games made poor-quality movies.”</p>



<p>He did admit, though, that times have changed, especially with quality adaptations of games into TV shows such as The Last of Us and Fallout.</p>



<p>Houser left Rockstar Games in 2020. He now leads a new studio, Absurd Ventures, that is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dan-houser-rockstar-studio-open-world-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working on new third-person open-world game</a>.</p>

internet</a> are wondering if Rockstar Games is doing this as a test of sorts prior to Grand Theft Auto VI's release next year (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-online-just-locked-a-quality-of-life-feature-players-have-wanted-for-ages-behind-the-gta-paywall-and-fans-worry-it-sets-a-dangerous-precedent-for-gta-6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar)</a>. From Rockstar and parent company Take-Two's perspective, GTA+ is another revenue stream beyond the initial game sale and standard microtransactions to become a third prong for making money. The thinking from fans goes that if putting features behind a paywall like GTA+ leads to more sign-ups to the service, then Rockstar/Take-Two might be encouraged to expand even more in this area.</p><p>In addition to the new Vinewood Clup App, GTA+ subscribers get an infusion of $500,000 worth of in-game cash for GTA Online every month, along with member-only Shark Cards that include 15% extra GTA$. Members also receive extra GTA$ multipliers for some GTA Online missions and modes, along with regular discounts on in-game vehicles, upgrades, properties, and more.</p><p>Beyond the GTA Online perks, a number of Rockstar Games titles are included with GTA+. Right now, the library of free games for subscribers includes L.A. Noire, Red Dead Redemption, GTA The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, GTA Chinatown Wars, and GTA Liberty City Stories. Rockstar's action game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/la-noire-and-bully-free-for-gta-members-this-year-along-with-millions-in-gta-online-cash/1100-6522333/" data-ref-id="1100-6522333">Bully will join the GTA+ catalog later this year.</a></p><p>Earlier this year, Rockstar Games raised the price of GTA+, pushing membership fees from $6/month to $8/month, or an increase of 33%. There is no multi-month or yearly membership option for GTA+.</p><p>Given the enormous success of GTA Online, many are wondering what kind of multiplayer mode Rockstar Games might offer in GTA VI. Also unknown is how GTA+ might factor in to the next GTA game. Hopes are high in general for GTA VI, as some believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">it's the most important video game release in history. </a></p><p>GTA VI is set for release in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-highly-confident-in-fall-2025-release-window/1100-6523562/" data-ref-id="1100-6523562">Fall 2025</a>, but it would be surprising if it doesn't slip, given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">nearly all of Rockstar's releases in the past decade have been delayed beyond their original target dates.</a></p>

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.</p>

<p>Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:</p>

<p>“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.</p>

<p>11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions <span><span>to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/05/27/breaking-the-ice"><span><span><span><span>here</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>. </span></span></p>

		<p>Frostpunk 2 has been delayed to a new release date on 20th September, developer 11 bit studios has announced, as they look to address feedback from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> Beta held a couple months ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/07/frostpunk-2-release-date-25-july/">Previously planned for launch on 25th July</a>, 11 bit is taking an extra two months to try and refine the game in key areas identified by players of the beta – they say the game had an 8/10 from the post-beta survey, which is pretty solid for a work in progress game. There will be changes to game mechanics to help things proceed more smoothly, and improvements to the UI and UX so that it’s the core decision making that gives you pause, not figuring out where that management feature is. And in response to players no longer feeling a connection to the actual citizens of their frozen city, there’s new Zoom Stories to cut back down to the personal level while retaining the broader scope of this diesel-powered sequel.</p>


<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<p>1. Additions to the game mechanics</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Changes to temperature, Heat and proximity-based gameplay, including new and rebalanced Hubs, that will make the city-building gameplay deeper and more impactful,</li>
<li>More detailed and flexible workforce management,</li>
<li>More direct-use abilities in the game loop, to allow you to react to crises more dynamically,</li>
<li>A new resource to make city-building and expansion more strategic, helping you stabilise the city’s economy,</li>
<li>Ability to reshape your districts after their construction,</li>
<li>Factions’ behaviour that is better aligned with their lore,</li>
<li>A more thorough and complex approach to dealing with protests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Extensive UI &amp; UX enhancement</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Improving the HUD (Head-Up Display) to make it clearer and more intuitive,</li>
<li>Adding a new construction menu along with five new city Hubs,</li>
<li>Improving the clarity, readability and look &amp; feel of the Idea Tree and frostland.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. A new city feature called ‘Zoom Stories’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Zoom in on specific city parts to watch the day-to-day life of citizens</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the above features have already been previewed and tested by a select few players, while 11 bit state that these are not the full extent of what they’re working on over the next few months.</p>

<p>Looking back at that original game, Jason wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk review,</a> “Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-top-5-million-in-under-a-week.913281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>sales have hit a major milestone less than a week after the long-awaited DLC's release, publisher Bandai Namco has revealed.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/eldenring/status/1806326803276906929" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly known as Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>has sold five million copies since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">release this past Friday</a>. The publisher extends its "heartfelt gratitude" to those who are treading "the path left by Kindly Miquella".</p>
<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>itself has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">sold 25 million copies</a>&nbsp;at last count, that means around 20% of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s players have picked up the DLC so far. It's likely that more players will discover the Land of Shadow as time goes on, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fire.jpg?itok=6cKNkUAt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fire.jpg?itok=XPazlTWn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is selling very well.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is the first - and probably also the last - expansion for From Software's huge open-world masterpiece&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. The DLC adds a number of new bosses to fight, as well as new lands to explore and new weapons to collect.</p>
<p>Since it's a From Software project,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>boasts a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer">typically obscure story</a>, but on the face of it, you're journeying to the mysterious Land of Shadow to follow in the footsteps of the Empyrean Miquella and discover the reason behind his journey.</p>
<p>Along the way, you'll have to reckon with the terrifying Messmer and his all-encompassing flame, plus plenty of other creatures that would love to kill you and display you on their mantelpiece.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fight.jpg?itok=XLYWjjXS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fight.jpg?itok=Iv2jCOEy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For more of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s excellent combat, look no further than&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>On release,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>garnered <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16525/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/reviews" rel="noopener" target="_blank">universal acclaim amongst critics</a>, who praised its rich exploration, wealth of new weapons, and highly difficult bosses.</p>
<p>However, the difficulty of the DLC proved a sticking point for many players;&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>debuted to a Mixed rating on Steam (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=41005067#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now sitting at Mostly Positive</a>), with many players complaining about its difficulty being too high.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Bandai Namco <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-easier">issued an update for the DLC</a> to address this issue, and while it doesn't address things like boss attack patterns, it does make Blessings more potent, thereby potentially increasing players' damage while lowering the damage they take from enemies.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/9PMPZZLKQM43" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-try-out-steams-new-game-recording-tools-right-now.913278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-game-recording-beta<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced a new suite of Steam game recording tools which will allow you to record, clip, and share game footage directly within Steam.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/6087258371786989397" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official announcement</a>, the aptly-named Steam Game Recording feature offers two ways to capture your footage. You can either grab it in the background without needing to press record, or you can set the feature up to record on-demand according to your input.</p>
<p>Once footage has been captured, you can easily and quickly replay it, grab clips from it, and share those clips either to Steam chat or to external platforms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-game-recording-beta-timeline.jpg?itok=P9BGPYhz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-game-recording-beta-timeline.jpg?itok=VFkWZ4Es 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Steam Game Recording lets you grab footage direct from Steam without needing third-party apps.</figcaption></figure><p>The tool's Timeline feature appears while you're recording, and if a game is "Timeline-enhanced", it'll automatically generate markers for certain events, like killing bosses or discovering new areas. Of course, you can also add your own markers.</p>
<p>Right now, two games are Timeline-enhanced, and it won't surprise you to learn they're both Valve games:&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-surprise-releases-counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>.</p>
<p>Once you've got your footage, you can save it as a clip or export it as an MP4, and you can also send clips between a PC and a Steam Deck. Oh, that's right: Steam Game Recording is completely functional on Steam Deck as well.</p>
<p>The new Game Recording tool works across any Steam game; as long as you can access the Steam overlay, you can access Game Recording as well, which is pretty neat. Not all games are Timeline-enhanced, though.</p>
<p>You can also tell Steam how much disk space you want footage to take up, as well as for how long you want the tool to record if it's set up not to need your input.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're not using the beta, just head to your Steam settings, then Interface, then Beta Participation. Pick one of the two betas to participate in, then update and/or restart your client as needed.</p>
<p>As well as announcing the Game Recording beta, Valve also released some interesting Steam Input <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4142827237888316811" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stats</a> yesterday. According to Valve, controller use on Steam has tripled since 2018.</p>
<p>59% of controller sessions are using Xbox controllers, Valve says, while 26% are using PlayStation controllers and 10% are Steam Deck users.</p>
<p>Presumably, some of them will also eventually be users of the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/hpc/hpc-055/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newly-announced Wireless Horipad</a>, which is launching in October in Japan. No word yet on a Western release, so stay tuned for more.</p>

That is hilarious when you think about how the games he and FromSoftware have become famous for have garnered a community known for fawning over difficulty and creating the hateful phrase “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679">git gud</a></span>.” The director reveals that once he’s developed a game, he typically doesn’t pick it up as a player, but ahead of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> he forced himself through <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p><p>But if Miyazaki sucks so much at video games, how did he get through <em>Elden Ring</em>? “My approach or play style was to use everything I have at my disposal,” he says, “all the assistance, every scrap of aid that the game offers, and also all the knowledge that I have as the architect of the game.” While that last part about designing the game doesn’t apply to other players, Miyazaki’s play style has some great lessons for anyone hitting a wall in<em> Elden Ring</em>: It’s ok to use something if the game provides it. </p><p><em>Elden Ring </em>takes the Soulslike formula and opens it up, quite literally, in the form of a sprawling world players can explore at their own pace. Per Miyazaki, this “lowered the barrier of entry,” and made the game more accessible to players. For some, that open design and the inclusion of mechanics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-curseblade-meera-spirit-ash-where-find-1851554428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-curseblade-meera-spirit-ash-where-find-1851554428">Spirit Ashes</a></span> (which let you summon NPC aid) took away from the need to ‘git gud.’ Those people then began to accuse players who use those tools of not playing the “right way” or playing on easy mode. But with Miyazaki playing with those offered aids, it’s pretty clear that the right way to play is any way you want, and that the ‘git gud’ argument is bullshit. </p><p>Miyazaki and the developers at FromSoftware created every system with the intent that it would support players in surmounting the challenges they face, there is nothing wrong with using them. That is true in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>as well: summon as many co-op players and Spirit Ashes as you need to pummel enemies into the ground. Just remember, it’s what Miyazaki would do.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The news dump contradicted <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.resetera.com/threads/pyoro-leaks-switch-game-announcements-part-4.860007/page-23&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/pyoro-leaks-switch-game-announcements-part-4.860007/page-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pyoro’s vague expectation-setting</a></span> ahead of time, and seemed to expose them as out of information.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-21/rumors-go-dark-as-video-game-leakers-face-a-reckoning?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-21/rumors-go-dark-as-video-game-leakers-face-a-reckoning?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> reported at the time, fans quickly realized that unlike previous Nintendo Directs, many of the games announced didn’t immediately have store pages go live on the eShop, suggesting that perhaps backend data from those listings was part of how Pyoro had been getting their information. The leaker then took the incredibly odd step of leaking their own source to <em>Bloomberg</em>, stating that source was a Nintendo employee in Japan and  that the “backend theory is a reasonable guess” about where that person got their information from. Even more surprisingly, Pyoro later locked their account after stating they hadn’t expected their comments to a reporter to be included in a news article. </p><p>Store pages for the games announced last week have only recently started going live, including the one revealing the unexpected $60 premium for <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>. It’s possible that this is one of the steps Nintendo is taking to crack down on leaks, alongside potentially shifting how it engages with video hosting services like YouTube. We’ll have a better sense of how those strategies are working when and if we <em>don’t</em> hear about future upcoming announcements, including for likely Switch 2 launch games. </p><p>In the meantime, the video game leaking scene is still in shambles. Midori, another mysterious leaker, was recently revealed to be well known male <em>Persona</em> fan posing as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/midori-mysticdistance-leak-persona-6-kingdom-hearts-4-1851536988&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/midori-mysticdistance-leak-persona-6-kingdom-hearts-4-1851536988">a mysterious Japanese woman</a></span>. Until a new hero rises up, super fans will just have to wait for the eventual press releases like everyone else. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(If you’re still hoping to play, check out IGN’s guide on <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Prepare_for_the_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">How to Prepare for the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Many would assume this to be an issue for developer FromSoftware and Bandai Namco, given the game itself is essentially stopping more than half its player base from accessing the DLC and therefore wanting to spend more money. But Bandai Namco Europe's chief marketing and sales officer Anthony Macare told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bandai-namcos-most-ambitious-expansion-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GI.biz</u></a> that Elden Ring sold so many copies that it doesn't matter.</p><p>"That statistic does present a unique challenge," he said. "However, with over 25 million units sold, even a fraction of our player base constitutes a substantial audience. Our marketing efforts have been tailored to engage this significant segment effectively."</p><p>Five million sales after just three days on sale is an incredible result for Shadow of the Erdtree, and suggests an impressive 20% of Elden Ring base game owners paid another $40 for the DLC. Sales will surely increase over time, as Elden Ring's did over the course of 2022 and 2023.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>After an initial ‘mixed’ Steam user review rating for Shadow of the Erdtree, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance">sparked by a feeling its bosses are too hard as well as performance problems</a>, the DLC is now up to ‘mostly positive.’ Shadow of the Erdtree has certainly enjoyed critical acclaim, and has become the highest-rated video game expansion of all-time by overtaking Witcher 3 DLC Blood and Wine on Metacritic. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review"><u>Shadow of the Erdtree review</u></a> returned a 10/10. We said: “Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Speaking to IGN's Ryan McCaffrey at IGN Live earlier in June, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">Spencer briefly commented on the shock decision</a> to shut Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks as part of the sweeping layoffs.</p><p>"The closure of any team is hard obviously on the individuals there, hard on the team," Spencer said. "I haven't been talking publicly about this, because right now is the time for us to focus on the team and the individuals. It's obviously a decision that's very hard on them, and I want to make sure through severance and other things that we're doing the right thing for the individuals on the team. It's not about my PR, it's not about Xbox PR. It's about those teams.</p><p>"In the end, I've said over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make.</p><p>"We will continue to go forward. We will continue to invest in what we're trying to go do in Xbox and build the best business we can, which ensures we can continue to do shows like the one we just did."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>Microsoft has a long list of video games in development at its various studios, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty Black Ops 6</a> at Activision, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> at Obsidian, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> at id Software, and many more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/meet-the-nintendo-3ds-fans-hoping-to-finally-beat-puzzle-swap-by-tracking-down-its-rarest-puzzle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I vividly remember from young adulthood the thrill of pulling my 3DS out of my bag at the end of the day and seeing the familiar blinking light indicating I’d received a StreetPass while I was out and about. I’d open the app and see the Miis of the different people I’d passed that day, with cute messages and silly hats. And every time, I’d immediately open Puzzle Swap to see what puzzle pieces they had given me.</p><p>When I first started Puzzle Swap, I entertained delusions that I might someday complete every puzzle just by passing fellow 3DS owners on the street. I quickly learned this was a nigh-impossible fantasy for a number of reasons, one of which being that several of the available puzzles couldn’t even be unlocked unless I traveled across the globe for special, limited-time events where unique puzzles were being handed out. I settled for trying to finish the various Mario, Kirby, and Zelda-themed puzzles that came by default on the device, or through occasional online updates. Admittedly, I never managed that either.</p><p>Now, my 3DS is gathering dust in a cabinet somewhere, its online services having been permanently shut down earlier this year and my motivation to use it having long since dried up. But a dedicated group of fans are still trying to realize the dream of collecting every Puzzle Swap puzzle, and they’re doggedly working to find their white whale: ANA: the rarest puzzle of them all.</p><h2>Chasing ANA</h2><p>The missing puzzle is a bit of a strange one. It’s called ANAでDS, ANA for short, with ANA standing for “All Nippon Airways.” It’s a special puzzle distributed way back in 2012 from July 21 to September 30 in Japan, but only at three select airport locations: Haneda Airport Terminal 2 (Tokyo), New Chitose Airport (Hokkaido), and Naha Airport (Okinawa). What’s more, the puzzle itself cannot be passed to others via StreetPass. You can collect pieces from others who have them if you already have the puzzle unlocked, but with the event having concluded over a decade ago, there’s no “legitimate” way to acquire the puzzle if you didn’t receive it at the time. As a result, the puzzle is exceptionally rare compared to other puzzles distributed more widely, eluding many hunters over the years. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/26/20-ana28jap29-1719439427538.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>An image of the completed ANA puzzle, courtesy of the Nintendo fan Wiki. Notably, while all the other puzzles have high quality images, all we have of ANA is a photo of a 3DS screen. <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Puzzle_Swap">https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Puzzle_Swap</a></figcaption></figure></output><p>Which is where Benny and his fellow puzzle hunters come in.</p><p>Benny runs a Discord server called The Search for ANAでDS, where roughly 20 individuals have been collaborating over the last several weeks to track down the final missing puzzle. Benny tells me he became interested in finding ANA only recently, after his love for the 3DS was reignited thanks to a homebrew application called NetPass, which allows players to receive StreetPasses over the internet.</p><p>Through his interest in NetPass, Benny stumbled upon and joined the search for the Japan-exclusive マックでDS ビッグマック (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetPassNetwork/comments/1cyb3bg/japanese_big_mac_puzzle_%E3%83%9E%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%81%A7ds_%E3%83%93%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%83%9E%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF_is_now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a picture of a McDonald’s Big Mac</u></a>), which was only just officially cataloged last month. Just before that, others in the community managed to track down another time-limited puzzle, EU-exclusive <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetPassNetwork/comments/1cmgtrp/european_puzzle_swappers_obtain_the_event_puzzle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mario &amp; Happy</u></a>. With the inclusion of both Mario &amp; Happy and the Big Mac, 62 of Puzzle Swap’s 63 total puzzles were officially uploaded online and available for anyone to download. With just one puzzle left, Benny’s next objective was clear: ANA.</p><p>“Those puzzles were easier to recover because the required SpotPass data had already been dumped by users on the Internet; it was essentially just a matter of finding the data,” Benny explains. “In this case, it is more difficult because to the best of our knowledge, the ANAでDS puzzle data has not been publicly dumped anywhere, so we have to search for someone who has the puzzle so we can recover the required data from them directly”</p><p>What Benny and his fellow hunters need to document ANA is simple on its face: they just have to find one individual who has the puzzle unlocked on their 3DS who is willing to upload a file from their SD card to the internet. That’s it! No homebrew or modding required, and the individual doesn’t even need to have the puzzle completed. Just a single piece is enough.</p><p>Since May, the group has been spreading the word to news outlets, subreddits, forums, and other communities in an effort to find ANA. Once the file is uploaded, the community will take matters from there and incorporate the puzzle into a larger file with all the other puzzles, enabling anyone who wants a complete puzzle collection and doesn’t mind a bit of homebrew to download all 63 puzzles at once.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Do you have the rarest StreetPass puzzle? ✈️</p><p>In summer 2012, Nintendo collaborated with All Nippon Airways to distribute the Puzzle Swap puzzle “ANAでDS”. Currently, this is the only lost puzzle out of the entire collection.</p><p>(a 🧵; 1/?) <a href="https://t.co/XqogPwQvSD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/XqogPwQvSD</a></p></div>— The Search for ANAでDS (@PuzzleSwapANA) <a href="https://twitter.com/PuzzleSwapANA/status/1805680588524818567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“If someone has the puzzle, they can contact us by email at puzzleswapana@gmail.com, send us a Twitter/X direct message at @PuzzleSwapANA, or join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/JTAJF3DgxY and we will guide them through completing the simple steps needed to recover the puzzle's SpotPass data (it should only take at most 10 minutes),” Benny explains.</p><h2>Puzzle Preservation</h2><p>It may seem strange that a community has rallied around a game like Puzzle Swap especially after Nintendo officially <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>discontinued online communications</u></a> for the device earlier this year. While local communications are still possible, meaning StreetPass itself still works, not a lot of folks are carting 3DSes around in their bags in 2024.</p><p>But a number of those I spoke to in the community tell me that it was Nintendo’s discontinuation of services for the 3DS that motivated them to pick up the handheld device again.</p><p>“I’m personally using it about as much as my switch, but I think the shutdown motivated a lot of people (me at least) to start archiving, modding, getting replacement services (ie Pretendo), etc,” said Croton, another community member who’s been heavily involved in the hunt, “like I forget when the shutdown was announced but I only just modded on a random Tuesday in October, and when the SpotPass archival server started recovering game data I modded my family’s 4 other 3ds’s to archive more data.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even if it’s a relatively unknown or niche part of the legacy of the 3DS, it still matters.</p></div><p>Some of those in the community are in it simply for the collect-a-thon. One community member, MrNoobingtonThelll, tells me that after the Big Mac puzzle was found some of the energy for puzzle hunting started to die down. “[T]he missing puzzles topic kinda died but Benny was one of the few one [sic] actively searching for it, so with my collectors anxiety of [100 percenting] a game I started to offer a little help.”</p><p>Others, like Ninja Squid, see the hunt as critical to game preservation. “It’s rewarding to be a part of this team and see all the amazing work we’ve done,” he said. “Finding this puzzle is important because, even if it’s a relatively unknown or niche part of the legacy of the 3ds, it still matters and is a big part of eventually archiving most of the history of the 3ds. [I]t’s a very neat novelty from an interesting time in Nintendo’s history that I would love to know is accessible to anyone. Being a part of this gives me the opportunity to help archive an important and rare piece of this amazing console’s history, and it’s nice to know that we are getting to be one big step closer to archiving as much of the 3ds as possible.”</p><p>At the time this piece is being written, the ANA hunters do have one lead – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/random-streetpass-fans-are-hunting-for-a-super-rare-puzzle-swap-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a comment on a NintendoLife article from a user claiming to have ANA on their DS</u></a>. The community has reached out and is waiting for a response. In the meantime, they’re keeping their eyes open for other leads on ANA in case this one falls through. But overall, the mood is hopeful.</p><p>“[D]ude since the file for every puzzle combined is new the first person to complete ana ds would be the first to actually beat puzzle swap,” observed MrNoobingtonThelll.</p><p>He may just be right – and it only took 13 years.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

You have the power to see them all. Help the spirit community to thrive again and use their magic – fly with the Harpien, dive with the Nixen, run through the Grasslands with the Zlatorog. Blend foraging, farming and crafting with heartfelt relationships and a community rich with stories. Embark on a serene journey to bring harmony to the worlds of humans and mountain spirits, transforming Kindred Vale back into a haven of peace and beauty.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_895537"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Bridge the Two Worlds</strong> – The Spirits and humans of Kindred Vale lived in harmony for many years before a tragic rift came between them. Ever since, more and more of the town has slipped into the magical fogs the folkloric creatures use to protect their home. This divide has led people to lose touch with the spirits. You, alone, can still see them all, interact with and communicate with them. You have the chance to mend old wounds and rebuild the trust that has been lost. It is up to you to bring the two communities back together.</li><li><strong>Encounter the Spirits</strong> – Kindred Vale is full of spirits inspired by the folklore of our home in the Austrian Alps. Wolpertinger, Perchten, the Tatzelwurm and many more are a part of life in Kindred Vale and always have been. By interacting with the spirits and exploring their needs, you’ll be able to befriend them and rebuild their trust in humanity, as well as unlocking strange and wonderful abilities that only you can harness.</li><li><strong>Use the Spirits’ Magical Gifts</strong> – Each spirit has a unique gift that allows you to explore Kindred Vale like never before. After befriending them, fly up to the peaks of the Alps with the Harpyien, dive down to the depths of the lake with the Nixen​, venture to the hidden places of the forest with the Wolpertinger​, or speed through the grasslands with the legendary Zlatarog. Use these gifts to help restore Kindred Vale to the peaceful and harmonious place it once was.</li><li><strong>Meet the Townspeople</strong> – Kindred Vale features a diverse community of townspeople. Like the Spirits, they have their own unique personalities, likes and dislikes. Each brings a distinct story and perspective to the town, which will be added to as we bring more and more updates to the game. Who you befriend is completely up to you. Among them, you may even find that special someone who makes your heart flutter, with relationships adding yet more depth to each character.</li><li><strong>Forage, Cook, Craft, and Decorate</strong> – <em>Kindred Vale</em> reimagines the cozy game classics! Once you’ve settled into town, you can forage and fish ingredients to cook, craft furniture to decorate your home, and give a range of gifts to your fellow townies. Unlock and discover more recipes through your interactions, explore the surrounding areas to find parts of Kindred Vale’s long history, and take them back to be celebrated in the local museum.</li><li><strong>Uncover the Secrets of the Vale</strong> – Kindred Vale is truly unique—nestled in the heart of vast mountains, lush grasslands, a beautiful lake and a mysterious forest. And in town, each district has much to offer; its own look and unique spirit. Explore at your own pace and enjoy the amazing views and vistas the area has to offer.</li></ul><p>But, there is more to Kindred Vale than meets the eye. The protective fogs that cover much of the town hold secrets that many don’t know and some don’t speak of. By working with both people and spirits to unify the town, you can uncover the truth of what happened many years ago, mend the rift between the two communities and—maybe—even learn something about yourself along the way…</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

                <p>For anyone looking to explore a beautiful post-apocalyptic Earth ruled by menacing machines, you can now get a great discount on the PC port of Horizon Forbidden West. Developed by Guerrilla Games, the sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn launched a few months ago and was priced at $60, but right now, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fhorizon-forbidden-west-complete-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhorizon-forbidden-west-gets-big-discount-on-pc%2F1100-6524557%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can grab it for $42 at Fanatical</a>. This is the complete edition of the game, and it includes the expansion Burning Shores.</p><p>This deal will be available until June 29, so you only have a few days to take advantage of it. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/horizon-forbidden-west-review/2300-6457347/" data-ref-id="2300-6457347">Horizon Forbidden West review</a>, we said, "Horizon Forbidden West sometimes packs in so much that it gets in its own way, but the many well-drawn characters populating its quests keep it compelling."</p><p>While the core gameplay experience is the same on PC as it is on PS5, there are some big visual upgrades for this release. If you have the right hardware, you can play the game with unlocked frame rates and in an ultra-wide resolution, while Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FSR upscaling technologies allow you to get the maximum bang for your graphical buck. If you have a DualSense controller, you'll get all the cool haptic-feedback features, but only if it's connected to your PC via a USB-C cable.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fhorizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhorizon-forbidden-west-gets-big-discount-on-pc%2F1100-6524557%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Horizon Zero Dawn is also on sale right now</a>, as the complete edition of that game has been discounted by 78%.
