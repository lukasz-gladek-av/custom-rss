		<p>Sony registers hundreds of&nbsp; patents each year, and almost none of them ever make it to market, but the latest idea is quite odd.</p>
<p>US20260021409 is described thusly “Artificial intelligence (AI) models are disclosed to generate unique, personalised podcasts of news that a particular gamer would find interesting. The podcasts can present the news in a voice of a video game character of a video game already played by the respective gamer.”</p>


<p>Or in other words, if you are playing God of War, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=kratos">Kratos</a> will make you a personalised podcast about the God of War series, or Aloy may pop up and tell you about her day hunting robotic beasties. The mind boggles as to what the Helldivers 2 podcast would sound like, probably a lot of shouting.</p>
<p>The podcast may also include video, and use data collected from your PlayStation to work out where you are in a specific game and give you some tips on how to progress.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting idea, but certainly not one that will happen any time soon. Sony does not own the rights to the actors’ voices, and Christopher Judge isn’t going to allow his gravelly tones to be used without a big fat pay cheque. Most actors are very much against their voices being used in AI anyway; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%932025_SAG-AFTRA_video_game_strike">2024–2025 SAG-AFTRA video game strike </a>was a response to AI concerns.</p>

<p>Previously, Sony have filed patents for a virtual controller which allows you to use any object instead of a DualSense, the patent design specifically showing a banana. An AI Emotional Modulator was patented in 2021, which would monitor your in-game chat and would automatically mute you if you got angry, and there was also a patent for a fluffy cloud-like robot that could sit beside you on the couch and analyse your emotions and offer condolences when you get beaten in a boss battle.</p>
<p>Or just have a cat. Almost the same thing.</p>

            <p>Valve’s upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> reboot might not be as troubled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">ongoing memory shortages</a> as previously feared. Or, at least, not as delayed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-says-steam-machine-is-on-track-to-ship-early-this-year-and-xbox-2027-soc-work-is-progressing">VideoCardz</a>, AMD – who provide the custom processor nestled within the Steam Machine’s matte black walls – recently held a quarterly earnings call, in which CEO Dr. Lisa Su declared Valve to be "on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year." While still vague, that’s in line with Valve’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">originally announced</a> "early 2026" release window, suggesting that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">soaring RAM and SSD prices</a> haven’t pushed the new Machine back by much, if at all.</p>
<p>Now, a pessimistic mind might not be entirely reassured. Earnings calls can be helpful for illustrating a company’s past fortunes, but when predicting the future, the audience being full of shareholders can incentivise optimism over hard realism. And as one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-its-gaming-hardware-contingent-ces-2026-was-a-good-week-to-bury-good-news">tech industry’s leading AI peddlers</a>, AMD are also partly responsible for the memory shortage – in which rich firms are hoarding RAM, storage, and GPU products to build gigantic AI data centres – that caused delay concerns in the first place.</p>
<p>Still, it’s also in AMD’s interest to get the Steam Machine into as many waiting hands as possible, and since component shortages are widely expected to continue all the way into 2027 and beyond... well, if I were Valve, I probably would prefer to start selling at a higher-than-preferred price instead of leaving an untouched mountain of GabeCubes stacked in some warehouse, making a profit of precisely zero. Unless I could build a fort out of them, obviously.</p><p>Anyhoo, the Steam Machine itself remains <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-a-new-steam-machine-when-the-first-ones-flopped-because-this-time-valve-say-itll-actually-have-games">an intriguing piece of kit</a>: a little bit customisable PC, a little bit lounge-dwelling console, with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>-inspired <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-stress-again-that-therell-be-more-steam-machine-verified-games-than-steam-deck-ones-with-fewer-constraints-in-their-testing-programme">compatibility programme</a> and a redesigned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a> to make besties with. I’m looking forward to playing it some more, whenever it ends up escaping RAM purgatory.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Sees a Price Cut, Moving Closer to Its Pre-Surge Pricing After Last Year’s 50% Increase]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sees-a-price-cut-moving-closer-to-its-pre-surge-pricing-after-last-years-50-increase-2000665433</link>
            <guid>1425421</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For a long while, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate was colloquially known as the best deal in gaming—and for a good reason. Unlimited access to tons of awesome games, big and small, for a pretty reasonable price. But then in late 2025, Microsoft announced a staggering 50% price hike, bringing the service from $20 per month to $30 per month. By the end of the year, that’s an extra $120 out of pocket you would not have had to spend had the price stayed the same.</p>
<p>The service is still great, it’s just a little more expensive than most folks would like it to be. Though right now, it’s come back down a bit when you buy from StackSocial. It’s not back down to its original price, but it’s partway there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7033/">The StackSocial deal brings the one month price down from $30 to just $25, and it brings the three-month price down from $90 to just $74.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7033/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<p>What’s really good is that the membership is stackable as well as not being region locked. This means you can load up on a bunch and set yourself up with Game Pass Ultimate for the foreseeable future at the reduced rate.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="377">If you own a Samsung TV from 2023 or later, you don’t even need to own an Xbox. Thanks to Samsung Gaming Hub, these newer TVs can stream games directly from the cloud, no console required. Pair an Xbox controller, sign into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and you’re instantly playing major releases like <em data-start="326" data-end="337">Starfield</em> or <em data-start="341" data-end="356">Halo Infinite</em> straight on your TV.</p>


<h2 data-start="379" data-end="419">A Library That’s Easy to Get Lost In</h2>
<p data-start="421" data-end="654">Game Pass Ultimate opens the door to more than 500 games, covering everything from experimental indies to blockbuster releases.</p>
<p data-start="656" data-end="1346"><em data-start="656" data-end="663">Tunic</em> is a standout. At first glance, it looks like a charming throwback to the early <em data-start="744" data-end="751">Zelda</em> era, with an isometric view and a cute fox hero. Dig a little deeper and the game reveals its clever hook: the entire world speaks in a fictional language. Menus, dialogue, and instructions are all unreadable at first. As you explore, you discover pages from an in-game instruction manual, styled after the booklets that used to come tucked inside game boxes. Those pages slowly teach you how the game works, while also hinting at its secrets and lore. The result is a constant stream of satisfying revelations.</p>
<p data-start="1382" data-end="1707">Indie gems like <em data-start="1398" data-end="1405">Tunic</em> share space with major AAA titles. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate regularly delivers high-profile games on day one, including recent additions like <em data-start="1547" data-end="1583">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. The subscription also includes EA Play at no extra cost, adding popular series such as <em data-start="1672" data-end="1682">The Sims</em> and <em data-start="1687" data-end="1695">Madden</em> to the mix.</p>
<p data-start="1709" data-end="1980">On top of that, Game Pass Ultimate bundles in Xbox Live features, unlocking online multiplayer for any supported game in the catalog.</p>

Fans will know that one of Derpy’s quirks is that he knocks down plants like a regular cat, but becomes fixated on trying (and, without thumbs, failing) to set them back up. The set will come later in 2026, with more planned to launch in 2027. There’s no sign yet of Huntr/x, the titular Kpop demon hunter group, but the trio did show up in Lego form in last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536"><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span>, so we’ll probably be getting minifigures of Rumi, Mira, and Zoey at some point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>While Netflix and Sony were clearly not prepared for just </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>how big </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>was going to be last year</span></a><span>, the merchandise and collaborations that have been slowly trickling out over the past eight months or so have been pretty great.

Many of the products we’ve seen are expensive collector’s items, however, so hopefully we see more stuff that is actually appropriate for the film’s younger fans, too.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-netflix-release-date-2029-2000641414"><span>getting a sequel</span></a><span>, but it sounds like it’s a long ways away, as Sony and Netflix are currently aiming for a 2029 release. The first movie is still having a moment, though, as it’s been cleaning up this award season on both the film and music side. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why PIONER Could Only Be An MMO, And What Comes Next]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/why-pioner-only-mmo-what-comes-next/</link>
            <guid>1425415</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I fell in love with PIONER when it was released in early access on December 16, exclusively on Steam. It’s a post-apocalyptic MMORPG with serious potential, which is what I alluded to in my full review of the game. It has an unmistakable charm, despite being rooted in an irradiated, glum, and perilous world, fraught with mutants, bandits, and lethal anomalies.</p>



<p>PIONER was pieced together by GFA Games, a small studio with roots in the likes of STALKER and Metro. Recently, I had the opportunity to interview the studio’s founder and CEO, Aleksandr Nikitin, about the future of his game and why PIONER simply <strong>had to be </strong>an MMORPG, despite a troubling climate for the genre.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-post-apocalyptic-pioner-had-to-be-an-mmo">Why Post-Apocalyptic PIONER Had To Be An MMO</h2>



<p>Talking to Aleksandr Nikitin, I was curious to learn why PIONER wasn’t a single-player game, given that it’s the studio’s debut title, and soaring out of the gate with a PvPvE MMORPG seemed like one hell of a bold ambition. According to Nikitin, opting for the MMO format was a strategic choice as much as a creative one.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Single-player games can certainly be self-contained as complete works or replayable like a movie you can rewatch multiple times.</p>



<p>However, much like the difference between a movie and a TV series, MMOs have clear advantages: beyond delivering new content and expanding the world, we can develop the story in front of players and allow them to become a part of it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nikitin suggested that the choice to develop an MMO was an intentional one from ‘the very beginning’ of the studio’s foundations. From a rocky origin that saw the studio traverse a financial downturn, the COVID-19 pandemic, and an outbreak of <strong>war</strong>, GFA Games stayed true to the notion of making a stellar MMORPG for an eager audience.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have both large-scale content already in progress, and active development of new content for future patches and expansions.</p>



<p>If players say they want more raids and we see that this mode is statistically more popular than expected, we need to be ready to postpone something else and increase the priority of what players want, because we are making this game for them.</p>



<p>It is important to preserve our vision that brought players to us in the first place, and finding this balance is truly critical for an MMO.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-review-early-access-mmo-ambition/">my PIONER review</a>, I revealed how well the game works as an MMORPG title, and how it can be compared to something like Fallout 76. It’s grittier and more serious in how it delivers content, but it’s just as entertaining and is loaded with enough original content to keep players <strong>engaged</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gfa-is-aware-of-the-struggles">GFA is Aware of the Struggles</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PIONER looks fantastic on screen</figcaption></figure>







<p>The MMORPG space is a rocky, tumultuous one, and the sentiments of the genre ebb and flow. It was just a few days ago that we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ashes-of-creation-collapse-entire-intrepid-studios-laid-off/">Ashes of Creation</a>, an early access MMORPG that raised millions of dollars, implode as the entire studio was laid off.</p>



<p>Nikitin is wholeheartedly aware of that but is willing to compete with the downturn to create something special:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Even legendary giants like Lineage 2 and World of Warcraft are facing serious challenges right now. Next-generation giants like TESO, FF, and F76 are also going through a rough period, while AAA projects like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rust-director-offers-25-million-to-keep-new-world-alive/">New World</a> are simply shutting down.</p>



<p>The MMORPG genre truly struggles to survive and compete with session-based games.</p>



<p>In our view, the only viable path forward is to combine genres, taking their strongest elements and creating a mix.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s what GFA Games did with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-roadmap-revealed-ambitious-few-months/">PIONER</a>. It has arena-based elements like traditional multiplayer matches, some battle royale mechanics, the classic MMO vibe, and the post-apocalyptic action-RPG feel you get from games like Metro and Fallout. It’s an open-world construct with multiple maps, countless threats, and stacks of missions to solve, and progression is everywhere.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-pioner">What’s Next for PIONER</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a showcase of post-apocalyptic vibes</figcaption></figure>







<p>Nikitin was generous enough to give me a look behind the veil of what comes next for PIONER.</p>



<p>There are plenty of aspirations to go above and beyond at GFA Games, which is great news for anyone neck-deep in PIONER, but also for anyone curious about the game and wanting to experience it on other platforms.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have ambitious plans to lay the foundation for a console release, further develop the game’s story, and create new modules.</p>



<p>We plan to focus on developing and optimizing the in-game economy.</p>



<p>We also plan to delight players with new content that was not ready for inclusion in the intitial early access version but already has strong groundwork. This includes new locations such as Big Earth and Shadowlands, new world bosses, and a number of features that are only now beginning development based on player requests.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Throughout the interview, it’s clear how much Nikitin and his team value community feedback. That’s the gist that I got from the game when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-launches-again-new-trailer/">I was testing it</a> ahead of the early access launch and experiencing it <strong>after </strong>it dropped. It’s the <strong>only way </strong>to develop a game that only survives if people are actively playing it.</p>



<p>In my opinion, PIONER is an underrated gem of the MMORPG space that deserves way more attention.</p>

            <p>A Netease spokesperson has told Eurogamer that statements made by Suda 51 on its generative AI policy are not correct, and that the company continues to work with the technology.</p>
<p>The spokesperson has also pointed to an upcoming GDC talk hosted by Netease covering generative AI."The assertion that NetEase Games has closed an AI department or that we've mandated teams or studios not to use AI is not true," said a representative speaking on behalf of the publisher. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-has-told-their-studios-not-to-use-ai-at-all/">Elsewhere</a>, NetEase has offered a comment saying: "The situation described did not occur, and we have not published any related policies".</p>
<p>Suda 51, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-melting-faces-generative-ai-jazz-band">talking to Eurogamer as part of an interview on Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming game Romeo is a Dead Man</a>, stated the following: "They originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff, but at one point they decided not to do that any more. They folded that section and told their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all."</p>
<p>"I don't know, they never explained directly why," Suda continued. "If I had to assume, it was probably one or both of two things. A lot of gamers out there don't like AI and having it in their games. Another thing is issues with copyright infringement. That can be tricky to get around, and clear before making something. That was probably part of it too - it would be easier to get rid of it altogether. But, again, that's my assumption. No one told me directly."</p>

<p>As for Grasshopper's own involvement with generative AI, Suda 51 also stated the company had not done any research into AI, and he believes there's something in the human brain that tells them something is off when they see it.</p><p>Suda told Eurogamer: "At some point there may be this thing I've heard be called the "New Reality", but even if it does get to that point and it's really good and realistic, I feel humans have something in their brain that tells them something is off. So while I don't have a strict opinion either way on people using it in their own games, that's not the way we do it. That's one of the things that bring people to Grasshopper games - they can feel people's efforts themselves. It's something we're proud of.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon To Kick Off 30th Anniversary Celebrations At The Super Bowl]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-to-kick-off-30th-anniversary-celebrations-at-the-super-bowl</link>
            <guid>1425391</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> will be at the Super Bowl! No, they're not taking to the field — we're not sure we'd want to see some cute critters get trampled on during the biggest night in sports (though we reckon Machamp could sack Drake Maye or Sam Darnold), but the franchise will be bringing a commercial to the show.</p>
<p>Super Bowl commercials are usually a big deal, and with Pokémon about to celebrate its 30th anniversary, what better time to kick off the party than on 8th February 2026, during the game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. As an aside, the <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> is <em>also</em> meant to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/super-bowl-movie-trailers-preview-2026-1236705023/">be getting a trailer</a>, so that's two things to keep an eye out for.</p>
<p>For Pokémon, at least, we have a little teaser to go on that shows Jigglypuff in what looks like a comfy backstage area. The pink Pokémon is mostly chilling on the sofa, but they move around every so often. We also get another look at the 30th anniversary logo, a simple Pikachu face with 3 and 0 replacing its red cheeks.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-30th-Celebration-Teaser">press release</a>, The Pokémon Company International says that the commercial is intended to kick off a yearlong campaign for the franchise, and that "More details about the yearlong campaign will be unveiled following Super Bowl LX, including fan-focused activations."</p>
<p>But, ahead of Sunday, if you head over to the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/30th-celebration">Pokémon Center</a>, you can check out a whole range of 30th anniversary apparel and goods, which are on sale right now.</p>
<figure data-uuid="52c1591b86339"><a title="Pokemon 30th anniversary apparel" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/52c1591b86339/pokemon-30th-anniversary-apparel.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don't expect any big announcements from the commercial itself, though. We expect we'll be getting the usual Pokémon Presents on the 27th February, which is when some of the bigger gaming news will hit.</p>
<p>For now, just enjoy Jigglypuff. And if you happen to be in New York later this month, then why not plan a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-30th-anniversary-nintendo-store-event-announced-us">trip to the Nintendo Store for some 30th anniversary goodness</a> on the date?</p>

It was even one of Wccftech's picks for the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2025-weird-and-wondrous-tales/">Best Adventure Games of 2025</a></strong> and one of our picks for the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Best Games of 2025</a></strong> overall. Everything was coming up roses, and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/">a <strong>Nintendo Switch </strong>and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> port</a> coming in January 2026, it seemed like developer <strong>AdHoc Studio</strong> was about to add another million copies sold to its tally.</p>



<p>That was until it actually arrived on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, and players discovered that not only the small bits of nudity included in the game, but all of the instances of swearing (of which there are a lot) <a href="https://wccftech.com/dispatch-out-nintendo-switch-2-but-nintendo-censored-it/">were <strong>censored</strong>, with <strong>no way to turn the censorship off</strong></a>.</p>



<p>When it was released, and players began to realize that not only was the game censored, but the censorship was permanent, AdHoc Studio's first statement on the matter said, "<em></em><em>Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually. We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release.</em>"</p>



<p>A day later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-comments-on-dispatch-censorship-on-nintendo-switch-switch-2-says-it-does-not-make-changes-to-partner-content/">Nintendo issued its own statement on the matter</a>, saying, "<em></em><em>Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations</em>."</p>



<p>Following Nintendo's comments, AdHoc Studio's chief operating officer, <strong>Nick Herman</strong>, issued another statement, this time adding that the studio is "<em><strong>working with Nintendo on a path forward</strong></em>" and that it is "<em><strong>confident </strong>we'll be able to push an update to address at least<strong> some of the censored content</strong></em><strong><em>."</em></strong> </p>



<p>The statement clears the air that it was AdHoc, not Nintendo, who made the censorship changes to Dispatch to meet Nintendo's guidelines, and even added that, similarly to players, AdHoc and Herman didn't think the instances of nudity and swearing in Dispatch would be an issue when games like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077</a></strong> are available on Nintendo Switch 2 without any censorship.</p>



<p>And, perhaps most importantly for AdHoc, Herman also clarified that the studio always had a disclaimer on the Nintendo eShop store page for Dispatch, which stated that the Switch and Switch 2 versions of the game would be different from the versions on other platforms. It just wasn't where players could more easily spot it, and the studio took full responsibility for that error.</p>



<p>"<em>As Nintendo states, any game that's going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to 'meet [Nintendo's] established content and platform guidelines',"</em> Herman begins. "<em>This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn't meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em><strong>That's what happened here</strong></em><strong>.<em> </em></strong><em>Honestly, we thought this would be obvious since we're the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms</em>. <em>We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like <strong>Witcher 3</strong> and <strong>Cyberpunk</strong> are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same. During the porting process it became clear that was not the case. So we asked that we include a disclaimer on the store page to inform customers that content would be different than on other platforms.</em> <em>We worked with Nintendo to get storefront language approved.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored. Wires got crossed and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled 'Disclaimer,' instead of the 'About the Game' section. We didn't catch this until after the launch when we saw people saying we should have called out the changes on the</em> <em>store page, and we went to go make sure it was there. It technically has been the entire time, just in the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This is 100% our mistake and it was fixed in the Americas' store pages a few hours after launch to give more visibility. We've also added a disclaimer before purchase. As of writing this, other regions have either published this change or are in the process of review</em>." Herman added he and the studio are "<em>truly sorry"</em> for the situation, and that "<em>people have a right to be pissed. Lots of lessons learned here</em>."</p>



<p>It's good that Herman's statement mostly clears the air on how all of this shook out, with the studio's biggest mistake clearly being the placement of the eShop disclaimer, which should have been more prominently displayed to begin with. The statement also implies that the studio's only other discretion is that it's a small indie team who don't have the resources of a <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong>.</p>



<p>Because if you're wondering why Cyberpunk 2077 is still on Nintendo Switch 2 without the same level of censorship Dispatch has, it's because CDPR went out of its way to make an entirely separate version of the game to release in regions that would have forced Cyberpunk 2077 to be censored, including regions like Japan. </p>



<p>There's a Japan-only release of Cyberpunk 2077 that doesn't include the nudity we see in the base game, and while CDPR can afford to produce and sell a separate version of their game in one specific region, AdHoc doesn't have those kinds of resources. It can only afford the one version of Dispatch for all regions, meaning that version has to comply with the guidelines of the Nintendo platform, and every region where the game is available.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the studio will find some kind of compromise if it can't get to a point where it can release an entirely uncensored version of the game. Even then, if you're choosing between getting Dispatch on Nintendo Switch or any other platform, you're better off getting it on PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X/S for the full experience.</p>

            <p>
Another year, another opportunity to do some ghost busting. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> is still trucking along all these years on, and now its devs have outlined a roadmap for the year ahead, providing a few teasing details as to what you can expect, including that long awaited 1.0 launch.
</p>
<p>
Before that, at some point in Q1 the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game will receive a player character overhaul update. This one will allow you to deck at your ghost hunter with an array of free cosmetics, for starters, but it also introduces some new character models with "fine-tuned animations" being added for things like equipment swapping, injecting tier three sanity medication, and some new death and revive animations. Love to die and be revived, but fine-tuned!

<p>
Outside of that, there'll be a couple of map reworks, one for Tanglewood and another for Willow, but there'll also be an entirely new map to look forward to as well. For Tanglewood specifically, the map layout will apparently generally be the same as it currently is, though there will be a few small changes here and there, alongside some new bits to interact with and some kind of incredibly vague mystery.
</p><p>
A number of events are planned, with seasonal events such as Cursed Hollow, Crimson Eye, and Winter's Jest all set to return, alongside a (once again very vaguely mentioned) "new one time event," that I assume, given the temporary name, will only happen once. You can also expect the game to run a bit smoother thanks to a Unity 6 and network update arriving somewhere along the line too.
</p>
<p>
No specific dates or even release windows were affixed to any of these incoming additions, so you'll get them when you get them! The 1.0 launch will obviously be the biggest update for the game this year, also referred to as Horror 2.0 (numbers!) which since its announcement has also been scant of details, all for the purpose of allowing us to go in with fresh eyes. Whenever it drops, just prepare yourself for… something different I suppose!

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> has lost another veteran member of the Assassin’s Creed team.</p>



<p>In a post on social media on Tuesday, Luc Couture announced that he was leaving Ubisoft Montreal after 24 years with the company. According to Couture, the move comes due to his desire for a change.</p>







<p><strong>“Today was my last day at Ubisoft Montreal,”</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424588173462183936/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. <strong>“It’s been an incredible journey that lasted more than 20 years….During that time, I have learned a lot about game development, relationships and myself.”</strong></p>



<p>Couture continued, saying he was “in need for some change”. That will come in the form of joining a new studio that’s smaller and consists of “other veterans”.</p>



<p><strong>“Times are exciting,” </strong>he said. <strong>“So stay tuned!”</strong></p>







<p>Couture started with Ubisoft in 2002 as a level designer working on the Prince of Persia franchise. Eventually, he would move on to being a senior level designer and level design director on games like the Assassin’s Creed franchise, Watch Dogs 2 and Legion, Far Cry 4, and more. </p>



<p>His departure comes during a tumultuous time for Ubisoft. Not only is the company going through a massive restructure with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds or more layoffs likely</a>, but it’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-vote-to-strike-against-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing striking employees</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-union-ceo-yves-guillemot-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls for CEO Yves Guillemot to resign</a> from his position.</p>



<p>The former head of the Assassin’s Creed series, Marc-Alexis Côté&nbsp;also left after two decades in September due to changes at the company. In Côté’s case, however, he claims <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he was forced out</a> and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-million-damages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suing the company</a> for $1.3 million. </p>



<p>What do you think of Couture leaving Ubisoft? Is this the start of an exodus of veteran developers and leaders leaving the company?

            <title><![CDATA[7 Secret Loot Spots You Need To Know In ARC Raiders]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/7-secret-loot-spots-you-need-to-know-in-arc-raiders/</link>
            <guid>1425364</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Looting and shooting is the name of the game in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and there are plenty of places to find the best gear. Typically, you’re best off searching the high-tier loot zones, the areas outlined in red, but not a lot of people know that there are tons of hidden stashes littered throughout the maps.</p>



<p>These aren’t marked as POIs, and they can often appear unassuming, but these hidden loot spots can spawn numerous searchable containers—including weapon cases. It’s not always a guarantee, but if you’re passing by some of these places on your next raid, do yourself a favour and check them out.</p>







<p>Here are seven secret loot spots that you need to know about in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pve-mode/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pve-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>.</p>







<figure>

<figure><figcaption>Careful with the drop. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>To kick things off, load into Dam Battlegrounds and head to the North East part of the map. Here, you’ll see the bridge has collapsed; what you’ll need to do is run to the very end of the bridge—and drop off the edge.</p>



<p>That might sound like a death wish, or at least a twisted ankle, but tucked underneath the bridge inside the concrete is a secret room. If you slowly shimmy off the edge and spam your jump button as you’re falling, you should catch onto the ledge of the hidden room and be greeted with an assortment of searchable containers. </p>







<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Don’t get caught in the open. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Worth the trek. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>You’ll want to stick around in Dam Battlegrounds and go to the Red Lakes. It’s a fairly open area, so be careful of any roaming Rocketeers or Leapers. What you’re looking for are the two ruins you can see pinpointed on the map above.</p>



<p>You can get inside one of them, and tucked away at the back, a weapon case can spawn. Additionally, just across the water are some more breachable containers, which have a chance to spawn some blueprints.</p>







<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Far South. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Easy to find. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>To wrap things up in Dam Battlegrounds, you’ll need to head all the way to the South of the map. As is the case with most of these locations, this one isn’t a marked POI on the map, but you’ll want to head towards the electrical tower and work your way to its platform. </p>



<p>Here, you can find another weapon case, as well as a medical bag. It’s definitely one of the easier loot spots to find, but because it’s on the outskirts of the map, it’s often left untouched. </p>







<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Start here, but they’re scattered around. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>This raider got there first. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Always check high up. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Just across the road. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>This one’s easily missed. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Most hidden spots tend to have one or two weapon cases maximum, but if you go to Marano Station in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buried City</a>, there’s a chance you can find five! </p>



<p>To get started, go to the actual station. There’s a breachable door that can spawn a weapon case, and once you’ve checked there, use the train to climb onto the roof, where another one can spawn. </p>







<p>The next few are scattered around the station. One case can spawn in the nearby bus, whilst another can appear slightly East of the station, tucked next to a bench.</p>



<p>Finally, head over to the nearby Library POI and make your way to the roof. Up there, a weapon case can spawn on top of the ventilation shafts. If you’re incredibly lucky, all five could spawn, and you could walk away with a backpack full of guns.</p>







<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Be careful when breaching the door. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>On the back of a van. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>After five weapon cases, there’s still more to find in Buried City. Make your way to the Parking Garage, and go down to the lowest level. Breach the door, and you’ll see a zipline. Instead of going up, drop down onto the sand below, and you’ll find a hidden floor of the Garage.</p>



<p>Inside, you’ll find a variety of breachable containers, including numerous metal crates and hopefully a weapon case. Overall, it’s just a great loot spot, and it’s one you should add to your routine.</p>







<figure>
<figure><figcaption>You might need a Zipline. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Hidden in a vent. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>There are two ways to access this hidden weapon case on Spaceport: you’ll either need the North Trench Tower Key if you want to maximise the loot, or simply a zipline if you’re just after the case.</p>



<p>Either way, make your way to the very top of the North trench Tower, and look around for a vent shaft. You can climb inside, and you’ll hopefully see a weapon case hidden under the concrete lip. If you brought the Key with you, feel free to loot the rest of the Tower—there are plenty of containers to search.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-blue-gate-maintenance-wing-hidden-location-in-arc-raiders">The Blue Gate—Maintenance Wing Hidden Location In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Drop down the zipline. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Number 1. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Number 2. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>To wrap things up, load into The Blue Gate. Technically speaking, these cases are located in a high-tier loot zone, but they’re so commonly missed that it’s always worth checking. </p>



<p>The easiest way to get these cases is to find the zipline shafts on the surface, which are highlighted on the map above. Drop down and search atop the vents for the first weapon case. Next, look down, and on top of some piping for the second weapon case. And finally, all the way on the ground floor, next to the large yellow pipe, a third and final weapon case can spawn.</p>



<hr>



<p>Remember that not all of these are guaranteed to spawn, but you should certainly keep an eye out for them in your next raid.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> is about to turn 10 this month and I'm turning to literal dust as I type this sentence. However, that isn't stopping Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) from updating the incredibly successful life/farming sim in big ways.</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-alive-the-game-is-still-in-development-stardew-valley-creator-concernedape-gives-update-on-haunted-chocolatier">quick update</a> on the state of his new game, Haunted Chocolatier, IGN had the opportunity to sit down with Barone to discuss Stardew Valley's past, present, and future. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">full interview</a> is long and deep, a must-read for anyone interested in the hit game, but those looking for an excuse to get back into the cozy grind of this modern indie classic are waiting for news on what's coming with the 1.7 patch, and we thankfully have two biggies to share.</p>
<p>While it's going to be a while before we get a definitive release date and full patch notes, the developer was kind enough to share a couple of nuggets of information even if he wants the update to be a "surprise" for the most part. Think of it as a big 10th birthday gift.</p>
<p>First, following fan noise, he's worked on an upgrade of sorts to the children, who will be "a little more interesting" after the patch arrives. What that entails is currently unknown, but it's not unreasonable to expect a deeper family experience on that front. Players had been saying for the longest time that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/15klpr3/is_there_any_point_to_children/">there was no point to them</a> and they mostly felt like "set dressing" when compared to other social elements in the game, so that's a victory.</p><p>A second update to families will arrive in the form of "two more marriage candidates" that he wasn't ready to reveal yet. You'll have to wait until 26th February to learn about those, and you can start placing your bets now. Will they be new characters or veterans that players have been wanting to romance for ages? Everything's possible.</p>
<p>In any case, it's nice to see Stardew Valley receiving extra love after 10 years that many indie studios would kill for. At this point, it's reminding me of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a>'s endless "actually, more patches are happening" state, and you won't be hearing me complain even if the massive game sits barely touched in my Steam library.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Amazon Echo Dot Max is an extremely compact Alexa speaker that lets you better manage your smart home and enhances room audio capabilities compared to past Echo Dot speakers. It produces room-filling sound, and its new, larger, rounded design is covered in 3D-knit fabric that blends easily into a shelf or side table without drawing too much attention. Inside, the AZ3 chip supports Alexa+, and a built-in smart home hub lets you treat this speaker as a central point for both audio playback and smart home control.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">You can pick up the Amazon Echo Dot Max on Amazon.com for $80, which is $20 off the normal $100 retail price, or 20% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A full-featured smart speaker with a variety of features</h2>
<p>One of the speaker’s strongest features is its ability to deliver a focused sound in each room, with emphasized low frequencies, clean highs, and very clear vocals. It delivers room-focused sound thanks to the auto-tune feature, which adjusts how the speaker plays back sound based on its location. In addition to streaming music using Amazon Music or Spotify, you can connect an unlimited number of compatible Echo products in order to have the exact same audio playing at the exact same time, effectively expanding the overall stereo experience or even creating a compact home theatre system through the connection of a second Echo Dot Max or pairing with a variety of Fire TV products.</p>



<p>The Echo Dot Max offers more than just playing your music and enabling multi-room audio. It allows you to connect directly to many of your smart home devices from the speaker, without a central hub. You can also group smart devices and create smart home routines that perform tasks based on both schedules and triggers. With OmniSense technology, you can also use presence or temperature detection as triggers, letting the room automatically warm up or cool down, or turn lights on and off based on your activity.</p>
<p>You can control much more than simply playing playlists on your Echo Dot Max through Alexa and Alexa+. This device lets you set a timer or reminder, check the weather, do quick math , or turn on/off your smart home devices with just your voice, without grabbing your smartphone. If you sign up for Alexa + Early Access, you will have a proactive assistant that can respond to layered requests and help you accomplish long-running or complicated tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">At $80, down from the original $100 price, the Echo Dot Max offers a compelling option</a> if you want a compact Alexa speaker with improved audio, built-in smart home capabilities, and support for Alexa+ at a lower cost.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anti-Cheat CEO Reveals The Desperate Truth Behind Cheating in Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/anti-cheat-ceo-desperate-truth-behind-cheating-in-games/</link>
            <guid>1425295</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever played a multiplayer game, the chances are you’ve brushed up against a <em>cheater</em>. If not in the conventional sense, then at least in the realm of someone doing something <strong>malicious </strong>to disrupt the entertainment of legitimate players. It’s a bigger problem than people realize, and it’s costing some developers millions of dollars to combat.</p>



<p>In recent years, the plague of cheaters impacting the many multiplayer games out there has become an increasingly complex issue. As cheat manufacturers become more intelligent, traditional firefighting routes are being overwhelmed, and it’s now up to companies like <strong>Play Safe ID </strong>to find alternate ways to push back against the onslaught.</p>



<p>I recently sat down for an episode of Access Granted with Andrew Wailes, CEO and co-founder of Play Safe ID, to learn about the shocking truth behind cheating in games, and how we might all be overwhelmed if something doesn’t change soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-old-ways-are-gone-and-cheaters-are-unstoppable">The Old Ways Are Gone, and Cheaters Are Unstoppable</h2>



<p>For those developing a multiplayer game, few things are more critical than securing a solid anti-cheat engine that <strong>genuinely </strong>prevents malicious players from surfacing – and <strong>punishes them accordingly </strong>if they do. It’s not a cut-and-dry topic, though, as it has been likened to fighting a multi-headed hydra at times.</p>



<p>In 2025, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov, the face of Escape from Tarkov, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheating-situation-nikita-speaks/">described it as a ‘never-ending battle’</a>. His game is an extraction shooter, and it’s one of the most commonly-targeted titles in the gaming space, because there’s money to be made via RMT (real-money trading).</p>



<p>When Embark Studios released ARC Raiders in October 2025, a similar concept surfaced. On social media platforms, groups surfaced promoting RMT circles, and where that exists, cheaters surely follow. If they can get into a game, secure some rare loot via nefarious means, and sell it on some pseudo black market, <strong>they will</strong>.</p>



<p>In a drastic turn of events, one popular streamer named ARC Raiders <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/">‘worse than Call of Duty for cheaters’</a>, and that’s saying something.</p>



<p>But why is the situation getting worse all the time? Is it because more people than ever are playing on PC and have easier access to cheats, or is it because our world is becoming increasingly technical and more gamers know how to break games with complex hacks?</p>



<p>According to Andrew Wailes, the CEO and co-founder of Play Safe ID, an anti-cheat and player protection company, the truth is much more concerning.</p>



<h2 id="h-hundreds-of-thousands-of-cheat-developers-are-out-there">Hundreds of Thousands of Cheat Developers Are Out There</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cheaters can often easily see everything.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Andrew Wailes joined me in the most recent episode of Access Granted to talk about the state of play for <strong>cheating in gaming</strong>. Play Safe ID is revolutionizing the space by ensuring <strong>accountability </strong>takes precedence, working directly with developers and publishers to foster stronger communities where cheaters simply cannot prosper.</p>



<p>When I mentioned the ‘cat-and-mouse’ concept of the cheat development industry, Andrew assured me I’d hit the nail on the head.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a company like Battlestate or Embark, or any studio. You’re really well-funded, you’ve got a really successful, lightning in a bottle game, you’ve maybe got twenty people working on DevOps, anti-cheat detection, stuff like that.</p>



<p>You’ve got Easy, or BattlEye, VAC, Punkbuster, whatever. You’ve got this suite of tools.</p>



<p>But no matter how hard you’re working and all of your employees are working, there are <strong>thousands, to tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands </strong>of developers who make way more money than any of your staff ever will for cracking this puzzle.</p>



<p>Cheat developers aren’t necessarily <strong>bad people</strong> or evil, they’re usually very intelligent software developers that like complex, ever-changing problems and they like making a lot of money from solving them. </p>



<p>It’s just a business for them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the words of Sun Tzu, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.” That’s the concept that Play Safe ID is working with, and Andrew has built a solid profile of the entities he’s trying to help eradicate.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There are so many cheat developers who are so smart and who have a much more vested interest in getting their cheats to work than the anti-cheat does to be reactive and defeat it.</p>



<p>It’s not even like it’s an even fight, where you have the same number of cheat devs fighting as the number of people working to defend it. You have an overwhelming force of people trying to generate these cheats and break the system, and a minority force trying to fight it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The modern go-to for anti-cheat companies is to use artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven tools to combat cheaters. But Play Safe ID recognizes that even <strong>they </strong>aren’t silver bullets or a catch-all solution to fighting malicious operators.</p>



<p>Wailes said, ‘Do you know who also has AI? The people developing the cheats, and now that they can iterate and test much quicker, much more aggressively… There is no easy solve to this.”</p>



<p>Play Safe ID wants to make people <strong>accountable</strong>, using a data-driven ecosystem to empower players to represent themselves more transparently. They use a zero-retention data system to identify players across a range of integrated games, and if they cheat and are detected and subsequently banned on one platform, <strong>they’ll be banned across the suite of games</strong>.</p>



<p>Some developers, like Gamepires (SCUM), have used Play Safe ID to generate <strong>protected servers </strong>populated <strong>only </strong>by players registered with the platform. It’s a way to guarantee only verified, detectable players are using those servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-play-safe-id-the-solution">Is Play Safe ID The Solution?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can Play Safe ID combat cheaters in games like Escape from Tarkov?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Play Safe ID is trying to innovate in a very tricky space. Talking to Andrew, I learned more about the most litigious organizations that are using the power of the courts to chase down cheat manufacturers, but dipping back to the hydra analogy, for every company shut down, two more surface.</p>



<p>In some countries, such as South Korea, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-issues-thousands-of-10-year-bans-to-clamp-down-on-cheaters/">cheating in video games</a> is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison or the imposition of a massive fine. Wailes labelled it ‘a great attack vector’, but stressed you need to also encourage <strong>personal accountability</strong> on the end user and not just on those building the cheats.</p>



<p>It might not be the <strong>ultimate </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/">solution to cheating</a>, but it’s a sorely needed implementation that’s set to make waves. Some huge updates are coming to Play Safe ID’s corner of the market, and the hope is that the company can make a large enough impact to bring about tangible changes.</p>

<p>It seems the Nintendo Switch 2 price increase will be carefully considered with the surge in memory costs. </p>



<p>With the recent increase in memory costs, the industry has been concerned about a rise in hardware prices. We have already seen AMD <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase the prices of its graphics cards</a>, NVIDIA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-reportedly-no-longer-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinue some of its GPUs</a>, and the questions about console prices are looming. However, it seems we have somewhat of an answer for the Switch 2. </p>







<h2 id="h-switch-2-price-increase-will-be-carefully-considered-says-nintendo-president">Switch 2 Price Increase Will be Carefully Considered, Says Nintendo President</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://jp.reuters.com/markets/world-indices/TUUSCEPJHBPUHI4W2N5VLZTRAA-2026-02-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> report, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa recently addressed the effects of rising memory costs on the company and the pricing of the Switch 2 during the latest earnings call Q7A. He stated that Nintendo does not expect this cost increase to have a “major impact” on its performance in the current fiscal year.</p>



<p>Coming to the Switch 2 price increase, Furukawa stated that they will “carefully consider the matter while taking a comprehensive look at the state of adoption of the platform, current sales trends, costs, profitability, market environment, and other factors,” (translated by Google)</p>



<p>Talking about the current profit margin situation, Furukawa stated that the company doesn’t see it as a “major issue.” Their priority is to “popularize the hardware” and then try to improve profit margins by maximising software sales. </p>







<p>In other news, Nintendo’s earnings call yesterday revealed that Switch 2 remains the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-crosses-17-million-units-sold-to-remain-fastest-selling-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s fastest-selling platform</a>, and that nearly half of Switch game sales <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nearly-half-of-nintendo-switch-games-sales-are-phyiscal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were physical</a>. Additionally, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-partner-direct-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a> for the Nintendo Partner Direct tomorrow has finally arrived.

            <title><![CDATA[Nikita Confirms COR3 Isn’t Related to Escape from Tarkov or Battlestate Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-confirm-cor3-not-related-battlestate-or-tarkov/</link>
            <guid>1425289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On Sunday, the mysterious project that Nikita Buyanov is connected with, known as ‘COR3’, was unveiled with a first-look trailer. It has already been compared to ‘Escape from Tarkov in space’, which is a concept fuelled by similarities and some ‘easter egg’ nods in the one-minute trailer that the shrouded team posted this weekend.</p>



<p>Today, Nikita emerged on social media to quell the rumors, stating clearly and simply that COR3 is <strong>not </strong>connected with Battlestate Games <strong>or </strong>Escape from Tarkov. It might look similar in some ways, but it’s totally unrelated.</p>







<h2 id="h-cor3-is-not-escape-from-tarkov-in-space">COR3 is NOT Escape from Tarkov in Space</h2>



<p>Weeks ago, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio that makes Escape from Tarkov, started posting cryptic teasers and puzzles related to COR3. This <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cor3-first-trailer-revealed-shooter-tarkov/">secretive new sci-fi game</a> has emerged after what’s believed to be a couple of years of development, but all we’ve seen so far is that first-look trailer and an interactive website that boasts a little lore about the project.</p>



<p>Until now, nobody in the world except Nikita has promoted COR3. That was enough to assume that it’s a project <strong>away </strong>from Battlestate Games and Escape from Tarkov, but it took the man himself taking to social media to set the story straight to quash the questions.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nikita also confirmed (in a Russian comment translated by Grok) that Escape from Tarkov isn’t being abandoned, so he can work on whatever COR3 is. The ongoing development of Escape from Tarkov’s post-launch period continues, and there are expansions on the horizon, including the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-dlc-scav-life/">first major DLC, <strong>Scav Life</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-duckov-collaboration-confirmed/">a new collaboration</a> is preparing to surface between Escape from Tarkov and Escape from Duckov, a parody extraction title that has joined forces with Battlestate Games in the <strong>best way</strong>.</p>







<p>We still don’t know much about what COR3 is, but we have confirmation now that it’s <strong>not </strong>linked to Escape from Tarkov.
