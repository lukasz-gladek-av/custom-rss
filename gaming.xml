<p>Bethesda has released a new launch trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> on Switch 2, celebrating the release of what might be the ultimate version of the post-apocalyptic RPG.</p>
<p>It gives us a proper good look at some of the characters and locations you'll see on your journey through The Wasteland, and while the recent announcement trailer admittedly did little to excite us, this one is pretty darn cool.</p>
<p>The Anniversary Edition contains the main game itself along with six official expansions, including Far Harbor, Automatron, Nuka-World, and more. There are also over 150 Club Creation items included in the bundle, so plenty to tinker around with.</p>
<p>We'll have our own review of the game soon, so if you're waiting to see how it holds up on Nintendo's console, then we'll have all the answers for you. And after what happened with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> on Switch 2, you never know what to expect, hm?</p>

			<p>It's that time of year again, as we're back to yet another <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong> filled to the brim with demos of upcoming games, some of which could be some of the year's biggest games when they finally arrive. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">As I have done previously</a>, I've gone through a slew of demos that are available as part of the festival, and curated my findings into a list of a few that I highly recommend you spend some time playing throughout the festival's remaining run time. It's also worth noting that even if you don't catch this list until after the festival is over, it's up to the developers as to whether they want to take their demos down once the festival is over.</p>



<p>That means a lot of the demos that debut at Steam Next Fest will remain available to download and play long after it's over. So if something catches your eye, it's still worth your time to head over to Steam and see if the demo is still there for you to play. That said, if we have an indication from a developer that the demo will only be available for a limited time, I'll be sure to note it.</p>



<p>Before getting into the rest of the list, there are two games I got to check out ahead of their demo releases that I really wanted to take a bit more time digging into. The first was <strong>Luna Abyss</strong> from <strong>Kwalee Labs</strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/luna-abyss-hands-on-preview-doom-returnal-a-good-time/">you can check out my preview of that here</a>. The second was <strong>Zero Parades: From Dead Spies</strong>, the new upcoming game from the <strong>Disco Elysium</strong> studio, <strong>ZA/UM</strong>. You can <a href="https://wccftech.com/zero-parades-for-dead-spies-hands-on-preview-za-um/">check out my preview of that demo here.</a></p>



<p>You can add both of those games to this list of recommendatinos, none of which are placed in any kind of ranking order. These are just 10 games I've played that are participating in Steam Next Fest that I absolutely recommend you check out.</p>



<h2 id="h-steam-next-fest-february-2026-edition">Steam Next Fest February 2026 Edition</h2>



<h3 id="h-replaced-sad-cat-studios-release-date-april-14-2026"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/">Replaced</a> - Sad Cat Studios - Release Date: April 14, 2026</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REPLACED Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuUo7_VaboE?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Starting with a game you've likely heard about, developer <strong>Sad Cat Studios'</strong> upcoming 2.5D pixel-art platformer, <strong>Replaced</strong>, has a demo that went live more than a week ahead of Next Fest, so if you already had this game on your radar, chances are you've checked the demo out. If you haven't or have never heard about Replaced before, then you should be sprinting to your Steam account to wishlist this game and add the demo to your library.</p>



<p>Replaced is not only one of the slickest-looking games coming; after getting my first hands-on with it through this demo, I'm extremely happy to say it's also one of the smoothest gameplay experiences. Admittedly, I do wish that your player character moved a little faster in between encounters, but their walk speed could get faster later in the game and is only that slow for the first mission, or there's a sprint function coming that we don't experience in its opening moments. </p>



<p>But that's a nitpick in the grand scheme of things, and while I was a tad <a href="https://wccftech.com/replaced-delayed-a-few-more-weeks-sad-cat-studios-cyberpunk-platformer/">disappointed to see it get delayed again recently,</a> that delay could be the thing that resolves those nitpicks. Replaced is one of the most intriguing narrative-driven platformers I've seen in a long time. Yes, I am an absolute sucker for platformers; I'd probably label them as my favourite genre of games, based on how much I enjoy them and how many I've played over the years. But with that experience, I would like to think I've developed a keen eye for which platformers have the sauce, and Replaced certainly seems to have it.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-weappy-studio-release-date-tbd"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254950/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman/">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a> - Weappy Studio - Release Date: TBD</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Eternal Life of Goldman | Steam Demo Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0AYKM6YjY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I know I just gushed about one platformer, but I'm going to gush about another. Not since <strong>Cuphead</strong> have I been so impressed with a game's animation and art style. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/weappy-studio-debuts-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-gameplay-no-release-date/">The Eternal Life of Goldman's</a></strong> cartoon-style storybook-themed game is overflowing with charm and is one of the most striking games I've ever played. </p>



<p>It's not just the visuals, though, that make it worthwhile. Even in the demo, I can already see how the game's platforming mechanics, specifically with how you swap different parts of your cane on the fly to change how you interact with the world, could make for some incredible platforming challenges. I can already see levels where you're paying attention to shifting platforms and environments while also ensuring to swap between appropriate cane parts to successfully make it through to the next section.</p>



<p>My one fear is that everything happening on screen could generate too much visual noise. While a large part of me is frankly still in awe over how impressive the art and animation are, I did have a couple of moments where I couldn't immediately recognize what was in the foreground and what wasn't. I hope that's something that doesn't continue to happen in the full game, or could be cleaned up ahead of launch. Still, I cannot recommend trying out The Eternal Life of Goldman enough. This game had my eye ever since its initial reveal, and even though this is just a demo, I'm happy to see that my first hands-on impression is as impressive as I hoped it would be.</p>



<p><strong><em>NOTE: Weappy Studio has confirmed that the demo for The Eternal Life of Goldman will be up for a limited time beyond March 2, 2026 (the final date of Steam Next Fest), but has not given a specific date at the time of this publishing.</em></strong></p>



<h3 id="h-denshattack-undercorders-release-date-tbd"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2524850/Denshattack/">Denshattack!</a> - Undercorders - Release Date: TBD</h3>



<figure><p>

Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLxd2T05UQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Some games you just have to try after seeing them for the first time. That's part of the fun of Steam Next Fest - all the demos are free, and they're demos, so they're short. It's just a taste, and that could be all you ever want from a game, or make you hungrier. </p>



<p>I don't know where I've landed on Denshattack!. I might want more after some time passes, but on first glance and spending some time with the demo, I know that I'm very intrigued by it, especially as an <strong>OlliOll</strong>i veteran dating back to its original PS Vita days and an original <strong>Temple Run</strong> enjoyer. Denshattack felt like it was mashing those two games in a brightly coloured anime-style package while turning the speed up to 11, with a nod to <strong>Subway Surfer</strong> by making you play as an actual train competing against other people who race and do kickflips with trains, just cause it's cool as heck to do, instead of some miscreant running on train tracks.</p>



<p>On paper, and even on first glance, I thought it would instantly click with me. That's not the experience I had, but I've also not been able to stop thinking about it after sitting down with the demo for a lot less time than I spent with some of the other demos on this list. It feels great to play, it's extremely fast, and it's just too weird and fun to ignore.</p>



<p><em><strong>NOTE: This demo is only available until March 2, 2026.</strong></em></p>



<h3 id="h-planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf-wishfully-release-date-march-5-2026"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2997230/Planet_of_Lana_II/">Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf</a> - Wishfully - Release Date: March 5, 2026</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NksRtFjpYGI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>Planet of Lana II</strong> is everything I could have hoped it would be. After playing Planet of Lana for the first time in <a href="https://www.psu.com/reviews/planet-of-lana-review-ps5-ps4/">2024</a> with its arrival on <strong>PS5</strong> and <strong>PS4</strong>, I walked away from the first game in love with its art style and its touching core characters, but it was far too slow and repetitive. As much as I'm clearly a sucker for narrative-driven platformers, even ones that slow things down with more puzzle platforming like <strong>Limbo</strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/inside-review-what/">Inside</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gris-anything-but-grizzly/">GRIS,</a></strong> and <strong>Neva,</strong> there just wasn't enough going on in the first game outside of its narrative chops to make it easy to recommend unless you're already tuned to enjoy these kinds of games.</p>



<p>The same cannot be said for Planet of Lana II, even in a demo that takes less than an hour for you to run through different snippets of the game. The puzzle platforming has clearly been given a huge upgrade, and there are a lot of interesting mechanics I'm hoping get combined in unique ways to create more interesting puzzles. If you fall into the same boat as me and generally like these kinds of games but didn't fully click with the first one, this is absolutely a demo you should check out during Steam Next Fest.</p>



<h3 id="h-outbound-square-glade-games-release-date-q2-2026"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2681030/Outbound/">Outbound</a> - Square Glade Games - Release Date: Q2 2026</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Outbound | Official Demo Sneak Peek" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MrRlZGJk1Gk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Ensuring that this list isn't just chock full of games where jumping is your main action, <strong>Outbound</strong> is another game that slows things down in a different way. It is quite literally about survival-crafting your way through a never-ending camping trip after your player-created protagonist decides to drop life in the big city for the open and free outdoors. </p>



<p>It's just you and your camper-van, and at least based on the key art, a dog, at some point. You make your giant caravan your mobile home, and simply enjoy the change of pace and the view. You can play it with up to three other friends, which I'm sure will be a major draw when the game is out in full force. The amount of TLC you can give your camper-van as the game goes on honestly reminds me of <strong>Pacific Drive</strong>, another driving game that takes a very different turn with its survival-crafting-centred-around-driving approach.</p>



<p>A quick look through the screenshots on its Steam page reveals how much more complex the game gets compared to what you can experience in its Steam Next Fest demo, which is exciting to consider. That said, and I say this with full awareness that part of the point of Outbound is to slow down, it feels like it runs the risk of being too slow. At least for my tastes, and if this even remotely sounds like something you might like, I would still highly recommend giving Outbound a shot.</p>



<h3 id="h-mole-off-black-creations-release-date-q2-2026"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4064510/MOLE/">MOLE</a> - Off Black Creations - Release Date: Q2 2026</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="MOLE | Official Demo Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzbJzNxZViA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Another game that's here to ensure that this isn't just a list of games where you jump, despite that being the front-loaded theme of it, is <strong>MOLE.</strong> As a fan of psychological horror games, this first-person horror adventure grips you right off the rip, setting up its dark and suffocating atmosphere that makes you feel like you actually need to hold your breath for fear of being caught by something lurking in the dark.</p>



<p>The idea that you're also digging further underground in a giant metal drill adds another layer to its environmental horror, intensifying the suffocating feeling. As scary as horror games set in space or deep underwater can be, there's just something far more tangible and relatable in a game about being deep underground. I also love how it's using its lighting - or more accurately, how it's using darkness - to keep the tension and your anxiety at a heightened level.</p>



<p>If you've played as many first-person horror games as I have, then you know it can sometimes be easy for these games to start off strong and fade out as they go on. Obviously, after just playing a demo, it's impossible to know if MOLE will fall in that category. But horror fans should definitely be keeping their eye on this game and check out this Steam Next Fest demo, to say the least.</p>



<h3 id="h-gridbeat-ridiculous-games-release-date-march-26-2026"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3243370/GRIDbeat/">GRIDbeat!</a> - Ridiculous Games - Release Date: March 26, 2026</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="GRIDbeat! — Indie Fan Fest Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2btGf5KPlI8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>GRIDbeat!</strong> was one of the initial batch of nine games that publisher <strong>Acclaim</strong> revealed when it held its big comeback showcase back in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/acclaim-returns-playacclaim-showcase-nine-titles-katanaut-launch-today/">September 2025</a></strong>, and it's the only game from that batch that has a demo in this festival, even among the few games from that batch that have already been released. </p>



<p>It's a move-to-the-beat-grid-based game that you can start flying through once you get the hang of how levels work, and the music is engaging enough to keep you head-bopping along while you solve the puzzle of how to clear the path in front of you to the end of the level.</p>



<p>The levels are fairly small and contained, which makes the pacing of getting through them as upbeat as the music. I really enjoyed how the mechanics evolved even in my time with the demo, and I hope the rest of the game only gets deeper from there.</p>



<h3 id="h-croak-woordrunner-games-release-date-tbd"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2616540/Croak/">Croak</a> - Woordrunner Games - Release Date: TBD</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Croak Trailer - DEMO Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iFj07xnArBQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I know, I know. This list is officially half platformers. But this is arguably the best one (right alongside The Eternal Life of Goldman) if what you're looking for is something that is focused on how you move more than any other mechanic. Also, if it's any consolation, there are platformers I checked out that did not make the list, so these really are just the curated few I really enjoyed.</p>



<p><strong>Croak</strong> feels and looks great; I love how it uses spitting out your frog tongue as a way to launch yourself at a wall and bounce off of it, flying in the opposite direction. It's frankly hilarious to look at your frog being so bouncy and cheerful after smacking its face against a wall a hundred times, because I couldn't get a jump right as I adjust to the mechanics. I hope that the level design throughout the full game can match the charm coming off its character design and gameplay mechanics, because if so, this has the potential to be one of the most engaging and fun platformers of 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss-big-bad-wolf-april-16-2026"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2760560/Cthulhu_The_Cosmic_Abyss/">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</a> - Big Bad Wolf - April 16, 2026</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss | Investigation Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iyYlAQ1b74o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The second first-person horror game on the list, <strong>Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</strong> is on this list for more than just its spooky strength. There are a lot of investigation mechanics to wrap your head around, but altogether they seem to make the foundation for what could be one of the most interesting detective games out there.</p>



<p>I love how you can pin and keep track of clues, how you sonar out not just for any points of interest around you, but only for specific kinds of items you're looking for. How you only have a certain amount of what are essentially 'action points' to analayze items. For someone else, the manual and minimal approach might be limiting and frusturating, but for me the limits presented a more intriguing gameplay pitch than what you might find in something that is also trying to offer a solid puzzle-solving in a 3D space horror experience.</p>



<p>Now, its real test will be how it balances its horror elements with its puzzle solving. While it took me far too long to solve the opening puzzle, it dawned on me fairly quickly that this game could run into issues where the next 'horror' part won't actually kick in until you've solved what is in front of you, potentially breaking up the pacing in a way that could dramatically impact how you experience the next scene.</p>



<p>It's a 'me' issue that the first puzzle took longer that it probably should, I'm just hoping that the rest of the game will include puzzle sections that are better at weaving in the horror elements.</p>



<h3 id="h-armastus-counterplay-games-release-date-tbd"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660710/Armatus/">Armastus</a> - Counterplay Games - Release Date: TBD</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Armatus | Demo Out Now Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hTCsnkI5xpw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Rounding out the list is something unlike the rest of the games here, <strong>Armastus</strong>. This third-person rougelike shooter from <strong>Counterplay Games</strong>, the people behind the PS5 launch title <strong>Godfall</strong>, is pretty much what you would get if you took the gameplay of <strong>Returnal</strong> and gave it the aesthetics of <strong>DOOM: The Dark Ages</strong> but set in Paris.</p>



<p>Initially revealed during an <a href="https://wccftech.com/godfall-developer-counterplay-games-debuts-armatus-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox Partner Preview event</a> last year, as someone who loves Returnal, this game instantly caught my eye, and after having played the demo I'm glad it did. Now, as is the case with all of these games, these demos are not the full picture, and there's always a chance these games fall off after the promising potential shown in these demos.</p>



<p>But Armastus feels like it has a solid-enough gameplay foundation that whether the story is able to keep me awake or not, the gameplay certainly will, and so far it feels like a strong blend of third-person shooting and rougelike mechanics. If it's even half as good as Returnal overall, it'll be one of the best games of 2026.</p>



<hr>



<p>Those are my Steam Next Fest recommendations for the February 2026 edition of Steam's demo lolopalozza. There are still plenty more demos to check out through the rest of the week as the festival continues, so let us know waht you're enjoying in the comments below.</p>

Curiously, it's the second playtest being run this week for a <strong>PlayStation Studios</strong> title, since <strong>Bungie's</strong> open server slam test for <strong>Marathon</strong> is <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-will-host-a-marathon-server-slam-test-just-ahead-of-launch-next-month/">also taking place this weekend</a>. But at least in the case of Horizon Hunters Gathering, it's a closed-beta test you have to be invited into, so they theoretically won't cannibalize each other.</p>



<p>That said, it still feels odd that <strong>Sony </strong>would opt to have them on the same weekend. Regardless, if you head to the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/beta-program-at-playstation/">PlayStation Beta Program</a> page, you'll be able to sign up for a chance to participate in the closed playtest for the new multiplayer Horizon title if you want to play it on your <strong>PS5</strong> console. If you're on PC, then you can just head to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4244910/Horizon_Hunters_Gathering/">Steam page</a>. </p>



<p>Similar to other closed beta tests, just registering for it doesn't guarantee you a spot. Once you've registered, you'll be sent an email (or not) letting you know how you can participate in the playtest with a code to download the beta test on your preferred platform.</p>

<p>As for what you'll get to experience in the playtest, should you be chosen to participate, the test will include three playable heroes: <strong>Axle, Rem,</strong> and <strong>Sun</strong>. You'll choose one of these characters for two different mission types, <strong>Machine Incursion</strong> and <strong>Cauldron Descent</strong>, both of which will be hosted on only one of the maps included in Horizon Hunters Gathering, <strong>Colorado Springs</strong>.</p>



<p>The test will officially kick off on <strong>February 27, 2026,</strong> and run until <strong>March 1, 2026,</strong> which is right in the middle of Marathon's test that runs from February 26 to March 2. Let us know which of the playtests you would choose if you had the chance to play both.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s producer Alexia Christofi has spoken about the game's meta-progression overhaul, which needed a rework following player-feedback shortly after the game's launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/battlefield-6-s-meta-progression-needed-a-little-bit-of-a-rework-says-producer?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Speaking to Game Developer at DICE</a> earlier this year, Christofi told the outlet about the team's approach to making substantial changes to how players unlock weapons and other in-game items through challenges in Battlefield 6. Their initial approach faced criticism after many found the requirements too daunting or unrewarding.</p>
<p>Players didn't like feeling they were forced into specific modes," Christofi stated. "We took a step back, re-evaluated, and as we're launching future seasons, we've changed our ethos a little bit to challenges and player progression in general."</p>
<p>Following this shift in approach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-challenges-are-being-made-far-easier-following-intense-community-feedback">meta-progression requirements were drastically reduced</a>. Within a short period of time, what was once difficult became far easier, allowing players to unlock specific tools in a relatively short amount of time, without feeling the frustration of a long grind or arduous task. This, according to Christofi, has influenced other aspects of the game experienced today.</p><p>"There have been times when I've woken up in my morning, we've seen something, we've got some bugs we need to fix for the next patch, and we haven't got around to fixing it by the evening... and then we've been able to hand it over to someone in LA to take that on and carry on working on that," Christofi explained.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-season-2-first-reactions">Battlefield 6 players are entrenched in the game's second season</a>, which added a new map as well as various other activities to engage in. There's also the game's battle royale mode — RedSec — <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-redsec-battle-royale-makes-me-miss-peak-pubg">which was initial received with mixed reception from players and critics alike</a>. This too, has undergone a suite of changes and tweaks in response to feedback.</p>
<p>If you've not had a chance to play Battlefield 6 yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>. In it, Rick Lane wrote: "Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-hunters-gathering-is-a-three-player-tactical-co-op-game-that-looks-a-bit-like-dauntless-with-a-closed-playtest-coming-soon">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a> wasn't exactly what we were expecting when we first heard about Guerilla Games tackling an online multiplayer Horizon game for Sony, but the PS5 and PC "tactical co-op" title certainly looks interesting to enough to warrant a closer look. Now, it appears the first closed beta test is about to happen, and its timing is a bit funny.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/wait-some-fans-will-be-playing-horizons-divisive-ps5-pc-multiplayer-game-this-weekend">Push Square</a> and social media posts, we've learned the first Horizon Hunters Gathering test will be happening during certain time slots this weekend. More specifically, from 7:00pm to 10:00pm CET in Europe, and 4:00pm to 7:00pm PST in North America; it'll "get underway from 27th February and run until 1st March." At the time of writing, it seems other regions are not part of this test.</p>
<p>To access, you'll need to both be part of the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/?">PlayStation Beta Program</a> and get lucky. The good news is the closed test seems substantial, as it'll include access to three different characters: Axle, Rem, and Sun. Two modes, Machine Incursion and Cauldron Descent, come with this test, which will happen exclusively "on the previously announced Colorado Springs map." Moreover, the Gathering social space and a customisable camp site will also be available, which suggests development on the game is further along than many thought.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sony and Bungie will be hosting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">Marathon's "server slam" weekend</a> to test the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-outlines-marathon-networking-and-security-features">online infrastructure</a> ahead of its launch on 5th March. Unlike the closed Horizon Hunters Gathering test, Marathon's pre-release weekend is free for everyone and open, so we're gonna assume Horizon's little event is <em>really </em>limited when it comes to player numbers, as overlapping them (and the ensuing conversations) seems a bit silly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The recently announced live-service spin-off game <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-new-live-service-game-is-coming-at-just-the-worst-possible-time-2000666078"><em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em></a>&nbsp;is holding its first closed beta test this weekend. Meanwhile, during that same time period, Bungie’s upcoming <em>Marathon</em> is holding an open beta server slam. This is a bit awkward as the studios and games involved are both owned by Sony.</p> <p>On February 24, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mfmjd74s222v">as spotted by deals guru Wario64</a>, some players who signed up to beta test the <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041">colorful co-op action game <em>Hunters Gathering</em></a> have started receiving emails revealing the first closed beta period. The beta will start on February 27 and will be available until March 1 on both PlayStation 5 and Steam. The closed beta will include two game modes and three playable characters.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, the Sony-owned Bungie is getting ready to launch its long-in-development live-service shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956"><em>Marathon</em></a>. And as previously announced, it will hold an <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-free-demo-beta-weekend-server-slam-2000668383">open beta server slam across Xbox, PS5, and PC</a> from February 26 until March 2. Now, if you’ll get your calendar out—don’t worry, I’ll wait—and mark both beta dates on it, you’ll notice something odd: They overlap quite a bit.</p>

 <p>I guess it was inevitable that, as Sony keeps pushing to launch more live-service games, a few of them would start to step on each other’s toes. And it’s not like they’re directly competing. I imagine the player base for <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> will be fairly different than the group of people interested in playing an extraction shooter like <em>Marathon</em>.</p> <p>Still, I’m not sure why these betas had to happen at basically the same time. It just feels like more evidence that Sony’s struggling to balance its live-service plans and ambitions. Maybe it won’t matter. But the optics are bad, and after <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">recently shutting down a beloved remaster studio</a> because of a cancelled live-service <em>God of War</em> game, the last thing Sony needs to be doing right now is giving players—<a href="https://kotaku.com/?p=2000672040&amp;preview=true">who are already blaming <em>Marathon</em> for Bluepoint’s death</a>—even more reason to be concerned about how <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404">PlayStation’s multiplayer-only games are being handled</a>.</p>

"When we, the dveelopment team, first saw it in our hands, we were skeptical too, so we had to do a triple take. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We thought to ourselves, 'Oh, is this really running on Nintendo Switch 2?'" he continued. "It all worked so smoothly that we decided to just go ahead with the game as-is and make it for the system. With specs like these in handheld mode, it looks great."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches this Friday, February 27 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day. While many recent Resident Evil games have found their way to Nintendo platforms, Requiem marks the first time since 2012's Resident Evil Revelations that a new entry in the series has debuted on a Nintendo console at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's been a really long time since we've had a new Resident Evil game released on a Nintendo platform on the same day as other platforms," Nakanishi noted, "so I'm hopeful that this will give people who don't normally play Resident Evil a chance to try it out. I would be happy if these people could realize things like 'So this is what Resident Evil is like as a game' or 'This is what's interesting about it.'"</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/24/scarmiglione-1771945001274.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Resident Evil: Requiem's Scarmiglione enemy, inspired by Zelda's Iron Knuckle.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, Nakanishi confirmed that a classic enemy from earlier game Resident Evil: Revelations was actually based on a foe from The Legend of Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link. The armored Scarmiglione, pictured above, moves its shield-like arm to block your aim — a tactic Nakanishi says was copied from Zelda's knights (technically they're called Iron Knuckles) who also moved their shield to stop Link's arrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Actually, when I was making Resident Evil Revelations, there was an enemy called a Scarmiglione who carried a shield, and if you aimed at them, they would move the shield up and down," Nakanishi revealed. "The truth is, this enemy was inspired by the armored soldier from Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link. This is the first time I've said that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With just days to go until the game's release, full spoilers for its story have flooded the internet, and Capcom has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-pledges-firm-action-following-widespread-resident-evil-requiem-leaks-begs-fans-not-to-ruin-excitement-for-others"><u>promised "firm action" against those responsible</u></a>. The company said it believed the "large number of gameplay videos" now floating around the internet — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-faces-uphill-battle-to-stop-resident-evil-requiem-leaks-as-ending-spoilers-and-videos-appear-online"><u>some of which contain huge spoilers and clips of the game's finale</u></a>, which IGN verified as legitimate — originated from copies obtained "through illegal means." Yesterday, Resident Evil 2 director and famed developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-leakers-deserve-a-thousand-deaths-hideki-kamiya-says">Hideki Kamiya said those who revel in ruining surprises for others "deserve a thousand deaths"</a> and "be cursed to never be able to play games again."

And it seems Blizzard isn’t keen on letting that momentum slip anytime soon, with the announcement of the whole new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch Rush is a “top-down hero shooter designed specifically for mobile set in the Overwatch universe” that is crucially not just a port of the PC and console game, but its own project being crafted by the Diablo and Warcraft studio.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch Rush Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overwatch Rush is being developed by a dedicated team at Blizzard, separate from Team 4, all of whom have deep mobile experience,” a press release states. “Team 4 remains fully focused on Overwatch, which will continue to bring exciting and fresh new experiences for PC and console players in its recently launched Season 1 and beyond!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A short previewvideo showcasing early development gameplay has also been shared, which shows that classic Overwatch action from a new perspective, as the camera hovers above fan-favorite heroes like Mercy, Reinhardt, and Tracer as they compete on the South Korean Busan map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A control scheme can also be seen on screen, suggesting that your left finger will be used to control the movement of these characters, while their primary fire and skill buttons sit to the right of the frame. From this early glimpse, it certainly looks like Overwatch’s frantic 5v5 action, albeit at a slightly more casual pace.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Updates on the project are promised soon, with Blizzard going on to confirm that “as we prepare for testing Overwatch Rush in select countries and regions, check out our official Discord server for updates on the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While there remains a lot of work to do, we’re eager to see how players enjoy what we’ve built so far, and to hear from them on what we should focus on in the coming phases of development. Our mission is to continue to expand the Overwatch universe by bringing fresh new adventures to players across all platforms.

            <p>The two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prototype">Prototype</a> games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/incredible-hulk-ultimate-destruction">The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/simpsons-hit-run">The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</a> were all great open-world games  before open-world games became a thing, and they all have one thing in common: Radical Entertainment was their developer. Now, after being shut down by Activision over a decade ago, the studio seems to have returned. </p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-simpsons-hit-run-and-prototype-developer-radical-entertainment-appears-to-have-returned-and-fans-are-hyped-for-fresh-remakes">IGN</a>, we've learned of the existence of New Radical Games, which already has a <a href="https://www.newradical.ca/">shiny website</a> highlighting the "new" studio's origins and pedigree. Radical co-founder Ian Wilkinson is serving as CEO, with ex-Capcom Vancouver exec Tim Bennison joining the venture as New Radical's COO (he worked at Radical back in the day). New Radical Games is also the result of joining forces with <a href="https://www.hotheadgames.com/games">Hothead Games</a>, which was founded by ex-Radical devs.</p>
<p>Considering all the cumulative experience the resulting studio is packing, it comes as no surprise its leaders are positioning it as "available immediately to take on full game, metaverse, or realtime VFX projects" that involve full development, co-development, remastering efforts, ports, or any other kind of endeavour. It's currently unknown if the developers are already at work on a main video game.</p>
<p>Other underrated games developed by the original Radical Entertainment included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scarface-world-is-yours">Scarface: The World Is Yours</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-tag-team-racing">Crash Tag Team Racing</a>, and entries in the Crash series post-<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>. Of course, all those credentials also raise the question of whether The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run and the Prototype games could get substantial remasters; it's not the first time <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prototype-remaster-may-be-on-the-way-after-new-credits-were-quietly-added-to-the-steam-version">players have received hope on that front</a>.</p><p>In fact, buzz about a potential Prototype remaster has been a thing for quite some time now, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/">pointing to Iron Galaxy (Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4) being involved</a> too. Could New Radical Games be leading such an effort?</p>

<p>Alo there</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Super Evil Megacorp has continued to support its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a>-inspired roguelike, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_splintered_fate">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate</a>, ever since it first arrived on Switch back in 2024. We've already seen new fighters and game modes get in on the action since launch, and today, the team has revealed that it has even more in store for 2026.</p>
<p>Splintered Fate's first DLC of the year is out right now, adding the assassin mutant fox, Alopex, as a playable character. This newbie looks like a pretty nimble fighter, packing a punch at close range with her kama main weapon and dealing explosive damage with throwable kunai.</p>
<p>The paid DLC also includes five new artifacts, letting you add extra modifiers to your runs. Here's a list of each of them, and a brief description of what they're all about:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Polar Bear Netsuke</em>- Every 10 seconds, Final Strike will throw out a line of flames. Cooldown is halved under half health.</li>
<li><em>The Maltese Hamster</em> - Your Tool charges slower, but deals extra Damage.</li>
<li><em>Channel Six Mini Camera</em> - Your Special charges slower, but deals extra damage.</li>
<li><em>Hot Cocoa (with Marshmallows)</em> - You have -1 dash. When you dash, gain a burst of movement speed.</li>
<li><em>Buddy the Wraith</em> - You have an allied Utrom Wraith, which levels up and evolves over a run</li>
</ul>

<p>It's not all paid extras, mind you. The dev has also released a free update today, which adds four challenging new 'Pepper Runs' to Arcade Mode, a Ninja Ranks prestige system, new combat rooms in the main campaign's Sewers, Docks, Streets, and Rooftops locales, and a slew of balancing tweaks.</p>
<p>It all adds to a game which, while perfectly fun at launch, always felt like it was sitting in Hades' shadow. "Despite the power of the IP and a co-op addition," we said in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate">our review</a>, "it doesn't pack enough of a punch to avoid unfavourable comparisons to Supergiant's classic and constantly feels like it's on the back foot because of it".</p>

<p>The next multiplatform game that is likely to leave most users impressed is <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></em></strong>, which runs so well on the <strong>Switch 2</strong> that the development team almost couldn't believe it.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://youtu.be/XJ8BrLpv3AQ"><strong>Creator's Voice video</strong></a> released today, Game Director <strong>Koshi Nakanishi</strong> revealed how the team was originally skeptical of how the new generation Nintendo system could run the game.</p>



<p><em>"Nintendo Switch 2 has improved graphical specs, so we wondered if Requiem could run on it – and it did, with ease,"</em> <strong>Nakanishi-san</strong> said. <em>"When we, the development team, first saw it in our hands, we were sceptical too, so we had to do a triple take. We thought to ourselves, ‘Oh, is this really running on Nintendo Switch 2?’ It all worked so smoothly that we decided to just go ahead with the game as-is and make it for the console. With specs like these in handheld mode, it looks great."</em></p>



<p>Besides stressing how <strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></strong> runs well on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, <strong>Nakanishi-san</strong> also praised <strong>GameChat</strong>, noting how it's a good fit for the game. <em>"Even for those who think playing alone is too much, they can just invite a friend to watch, and they can get excited together. I feel like it was almost made specifically for Resident Evil,"</em> the game director said.</p>

You'll be getting a refund either way; the two studios say "all players" who bought <em>King of Meat </em>will get their money back "in the coming weeks".</p><figure role="group">

<p>As of yesterday, it's no longer possible to buy <em>King of Meat </em>on any storefront, and you can't buy in-game Stamps either, so if you don't own the game, you've missed your chance to check it out.</p><p>However, there's a silver lining if you did buy <em>King of Meat</em>; not only will you be entitled to a full refund for the game, but the Stamp packs you purchased will also be refunded. You can, of course, also continue to spend Stamps you do have on in-game content if you want.</p><p><em>King of Meat </em>represents the latest game to fall foul of Amazon Game Studios' chopping block. It follows the likes of MMO <em>New World</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazons-ill-fated-mmo-new-world-to-shut-down-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fa9fca01-ebe1-4d7d-9d03-0b8eab5c442a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shutting down next year</a>, and ill-fated hero shooter <em>Crucible</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-takes-crucible-off-life-support-and-kills-it" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9b063179-6c1f-4568-bfca-bb65e787d1f1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shut down in the same year it was released</a>.</p><p>In general, it looks like Amazon is pivoting away from the kind of full-throated development represented by <em>King of Meat</em>, <em>Crucible</em>, and <em>New World</em>, and towards more casual experiences like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4199f9c-3f78-478b-b2f3-b566d7133e1b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">recently-redesigned Amazon Luna service</a>.</p>
<p>This is usually where I'd tell you where you can check out <em>King of Meat</em>, but, well, you can't anymore. If you did already buy it, though, the game will remain online until April 9th.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-7-and-village-are-damn-near-perfect-switch-2-ports-2000673230</link>
            <guid>1444903</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2017’s <em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em> and its 2021 sequel, <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em>Resident Evil Village,</em></a> have arrived on Switch 2. I was curious how these big, graphically impressive horror games would run on Nintendo’s hybrid machine. Well, the good news is that these are two of the best Switch 2 ports yet, and a damn fine way to play or replay either game.</p> <p>Both of these <em>Resident Evil</em> sequels starring Ethan Winters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/someone-at-capcom-really-hates-ethans-hands-1846852678">a man with hands that Capcom hates</a>, received Switch “ports” back in the day. But these weren’t native ports of the survival horror sequels. Instead, they were powered by the cloud and were only available via streaming. Bleh. They were fine enough with a decent internet connection, but finally, Capcom has righted that wrong and natively ported both <em>RE7</em> and <em>Village</em> to a Nintendo platform, and the end results are impressive, even if one port is a bit better than the other.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-7-the-kotaku-review-1791658385">Let’s start with <em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard.</em></a> This soft reboot of the <em>Resident Evil</em> franchise went first-person, ditched most of the old characters and storyline, and was a grittier, scarier game than many of the then-recent entries in the series. It was a big risk, but it paid off. And now this game is fully playable, offline and natively, on Switch 2. Of the two horror ports, this is the better one.</p>  <p>Performance, image quality, and stability in <a href="https://kotaku.com/everyone-in-resident-evil-7-has-amazing-teeth-1791784702"><em>Resident Evil 7</em></a> are all damn near flawless. Textures and edges are sharp while lighting is impressively moody and realistic. And all of this runs at 60FPS in both docked and portable mode. I wasn’t counting frames with a tool, but my eye only caught a handful of tiny drops that I bet most folks won’t even notice.</p>

 <p><em>RE7</em> on Switch 2 is one of those ports that makes me just sort of forget what platform I’m playing on, and it just works perfectly. In that regard, it is an even better AAA port than <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> or </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>,</em> which are great, but do feel compromised compared to the PS5 versions of those same games. I guess it helps that <em>RE7</em> is a nearly decade-old PS4-era linear horror game and not a massive current-gen open-world epic.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-is-proving-a-great-intro-to-the-s-1846911538"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a> turns in a nearly-as-good experience on Switch 2. Visually,<em> Village</em> looks even better than <em>RE7</em>, with more detailed textures and even better-looking lighting. But <em>Village</em> is also a bigger game set in larger environments, and this combo proves a bit too much at times for the Switch 2. The moment I stepped into the titular village in this <em>Resident Evil</em> sequel, I started noticing consistent frame drops. As werewolf monsters poured in during a large fight early on, I noticed these drops more frequently. This happened both handheld and docked.</p>  <p>To be clear, it never got unplayable, but it did feel far less stable than what I saw in<em> Resident Evil 7′</em>s port. I also feel like the game ran a bit worse when playing in third-person mode, but that’s fine with me because I would never play <em>Village</em> in third-person. This game was so clearly designed to be a first-person experience, and playing it any other way seems silly. Still, the performance issues in <em>Village</em> almost make me wonder if Capcom could offer up a toggle to turn down some of the game’s effects and lighting in order to hit 60FPS more consistently.</p>

 <p>It’s actually quite odd to me that neither port includes any sort of performance- or quality-mode-like settings or toggles. In the case of <em>RE7</em>, that’s fine, as that is a near-perfect experience. But in <em>Village</em>, well, I’d love a 40FPS option on 120hz TVs or a performance toggle or something. Perhaps a future patch will smooth out some of these FPS drops. If not, <em>Village</em> is still a great port that only seems less than stellar when compared directly to <em>RE7</em> on Switch 2. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-iphone-15-pro-review-performance-1850973260"><em>Village</em> also runs 100x better than how it played on iPhone.</a>)</p> <p>Both games are totally worth playing on Switch 2 and finally make up for those disappointing cloud versions Switch 1 owners were given. <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-release-date-re7-2000625335">I have high hopes for future <em>Resident Evil</em> ports and the upcoming <em>Resident Evil Requiem o</em>n Switch 2</a>.</p>
