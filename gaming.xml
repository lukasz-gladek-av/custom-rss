<p>It's Tomba time (again)</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Limited Run Games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-limited-run-games-showcase-2024-every-switch-announcement-and-physical">announced</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomba_2_the_evil_swine_return_special_edition">Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return Special Edition</a> way back in June 2024, and while a good chunk of time has passed us by since then (including a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/poll-tomba-special-edition-is-out-but-have-you-been-able-to-play-the-thing-on-switch">rather buggy</a> release of its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomba_special_edition">platforming predecessor</a>), the release date is almost upon us!</p>
<p>Tomba 2 will arrive on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomba-2-the-evil-swine-return-special-edition-switch/">Switch eShop</a> on <strong>15th December</strong> for <strong>$19.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent), marking the first time that the 3D PlayStation platformer has been available on Nintendo systems.</p>
<p>For those who didn't try this one out in the early 2000s, Tomba 2 took the same jungle platforming precedent as the first game in the series, but moved things into the wonderful world of 3D. With the now-chiselled Tomba given an extra dimension to play with, the game packed in new weapons and power-up costumes on top of a huge number of fresh missions and events.</p>
<p>This Switch 'Special Edition' throws in a museum gallery mode, <em>and</em> the chance to rewind and save at any time, so while the polygonal visuals remain, there are at least some ways to get around the game's less favourable nostalgic elements.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the new release's key features and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• Gorgeous 3D graphics that instantly transport you to Tomba's world<br>
• All new weapons, items and costumes to collect and use against the Evil Pigs<br>
• A massive 137 different missions to complete<br>
• New exclusive features such as rewind and save anywhere<br>
• A museum filled with rare artwork and much more</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the original Tomba would go on to be a perfectly acceptable slice of throwback platforming on Switch, it launched in such a state that some of us found it essentially unplayable on the hybrid console. Let's hope that things get off to a smoother start with its sequel.</p>

            <p>Right, so. There's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, the official Oblivion remaster which released earlier this year. There's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, the fan-made Oblivion remake mod which still currently looks due out relatively soonish, despite its release window having been a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivions-2025-release-goal-is-pointless-and-unachievable-claims-longtime-dev-accuses-two-leads-of-rushing-the-mod-out">source of drama a few months ago</a>. There's also <a href="https://beyondskyrim.org/project/cyrodiil">Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil</a>, another massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">Skyrim modding</a> project, but this time seeking to re-create the province in which Oblivion's set as it might be at the time The Elder Scrolls five takes place. Simple. The last one of those has just released a fresh teaser.</p>

<p>Despite having already released one of its regions as a very well-received and popular forerunner - that'd be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> map expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyrim-beyond-bruma-mod-released">Beyond Skyrim: Bruma</a> - the same team's full version of Cyrodiil doesn't look as far along in the development process as Skyblivion. That said, is devs have still been sharing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ar__IhI5cs">regular progress updates</a> over the past couple of years. Their latest is a teaser of the mod's questline surrounding Anvil, with getting the gold coast city up and running having been a key focus of their work this year.</p>
<p>What's afoot in the picturesque southern port town? Well, two important-sounding dudes are having a chat about birds in front of Anvil's count. One of them is called Ramon and the other's Anvil's viscount. The former's concerned about a mysterious idealist/criminal dubbed The Wren, who's threatening to throw a spanner into the works of the trade which keeps Anvil running. There's also some courtly bickering going on about succession, with debate over whether a lad named Corvinus, seemingly the viscount's son, is fit to rule the city and deal with its fowl predicament.</p><p>As that chat plays out, the modders show off a bunch of shots in and around their version of Anvil. It looks lovely, if suffering from the unavoidable limitation of looking more like Skyrim in a new hat than a game built from scratch would. The Discord post accompanying the teaser also offers an intro to one of the side quests Anvil'll offer. It's about you becoming an entrepreneurial child's minion.</p>
<p>"The city of Anvil is home to many up-and-coming business dealers, though some fall further outside the norms than others," the modders' blurb for this quest reads. "Meet the future saltwater business owner; Jinol! He has plans for creating a business run and owned by the children of Anvil and he is looking for any would-be business partners passing through Anvil to help him in this innovative endeavour." God, imagine what the Elder Scrolls equivalent of those terrible CEO grind-themed podcasts would be.</p>
<p>The Beyond Skyrim lot plan to show off more during an Anvil stream set to take place on their YouTube channel on December 6th, and they're keen to recruit folks for the following roles: "Animators, writers, editors, navmeshers, concept artists, 3D artists, experienced exterior landscapers, dungeon designers, creation kit implementers, sound effects artists, and quality assurance".</p>
<p>By the looks of their last update, the areas which include Leyawiin, Bravil, Cheydinhal, and the Imperial City all have plenty of work that needs doing once Anvil's sorted. I'm intrigued by the idea of returning to Cyrodiil down the line for something that isn't trying to repackage TES IV and have really dug the time I've spent with their Bruma mod, so I'll be keeping an eye on the Beyond Skyrim folks' progress.</p>

            <guid>1369054</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The biggest sale of the year is coming to an end, but with a bang. Cyber Monday is here, offering one last chance to stock up on the items you missed grabbing during Black Friday. Most of the hefty discounts we saw during Black Friday are still available, but the deals bid adieu tonight. Whether you’re after a multi-port charger or are finally ready to grab a 100-inch TV to enjoy better movie nights during the holidays, today is your day to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Those after a reliable storage solution for their Xbox Series X|S should consider grabbing the Seagate 2TB SSD, which is going for 29% off on Amazon.</a> It normally retails for $260, but the current deal drops the price to $185. Both Prime and non-Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their orders, so there are no extra costs to worry about. Be sure to grab it quick, as the retailer has marked the discount as a fast-selling one. With this speed, it might not even be around after just a couple of hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Capacity, No Compromises on Performance</h2>
<p>No one likes deleting old titles to make room for the latest releases. This SSD gets you a massive 2TB storage capacity, which is enough to house a bunch of games that won’t squeeze into your console’s internal storage. It’s the sweet spot for most casual gamers who are looking to enjoy fresh releases without feeling limited. There’s a 1TB, plus 4TB version of the SSD too, going for $121 and $380, respectively.</p>
<p>The SSD is designed in partnership with Xbox. It uses the Velocity Architecture and lets you play Xbox Series X|S games directly from the expansion card without sacrificing graphics, latency, frame rates, or load times. Thousands of Original Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One games offer the exact same experience as the console’s internal SSD, so you won’t feel a difference when you switch between them. You’ll just have way more space, while still enjoying ultra-fast load times and stunning visuals for a truly immersive experience. Additionally, Quick resume support means you can hop between multiple titles from the internal SSD or the expansion card within seconds, without those annoying wait times that kill the momentum.</p>



<p>The setup is plug-and-play. Start by locating the storage expansion slot on the back of your console. Remove the protective cover from the card, and insert it into the slot. Once it clicks into place, you’ll know it’s ready to use. The console will recognize the card and display a notification confirming it. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed. You can also head to your console’s Settings, then choose System &gt; Storage devices to verify the installation. Once everything is set, start playing without feeling limited by storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Amazon throws in a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase, which provides some extra peace of mind.</a> If anything goes wrong, the retailer will replace or repair your expansion card. All things considered, if you’re looking to game better without storage issues coming in your way this holiday season, now is a great time to make the move. This Cyber Monday deal brings the price down of this 2TB expansion card by $75, letting you grab it for $185. If it’s more than you need, consider the 1TB option. Those looking for even more space can grab the 4TB version. Both of these are also discounted. Just make sure to get your orders in fast, because Cyber Monday wraps up tonight.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Beach Brutus Boss Location—Where to Find & All Loot]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-beach-brutus/</link>
            <guid>1369051</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A fresh beginning has occurred in Fortnite with the launch of Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings with it a new map and new bosses to defeat, and this guide has all the location details on where to find Beach Brutus.</p>



<p>Beach Brutus is one of three bosses waiting to be encountered on the Fortnite map, alongside the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-human-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Bill</a>, and offers unique rewards that can turn the tide in any match, so he’s well worth hunting down.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming is here to help you track down the boss location, along with details on the loot dropped once Beach Brutus has been defeated.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-beach-brutus-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">Where to Find Beach Brutus in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s go to the beach. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Like the other bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, there isn’t a single location guaranteed to have Beach Brutus waiting. Instead, there are several spawn points across the map.</strong></p>



<p>While it can be frustrating to have rotating bosses with a list of several spawn locations, it adds additional variety to each Fortnite map. Additionally, Beach Brutus is possibly the easiest to find, as the majority of the spawn points are located near each other.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of where Beach Brutus can be encountered in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ripped Tides</li>



<li>Classified Canyon</li>



<li>Painted Palms</li>



<li>Paws Inn (East of Wonkeeland)</li>



<li>Sunset Falls (Southeast of Wonkeeland)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Beach Brutus, Painted Palms is a good place to start as he is often found here, and other spawn locations near Paws Inn and Sunset Falls are not too far away. However, he’s often found in Ripped Tides and Classified Canyon, both of which are popular initial landing locations, so competition to defeat him can be fierce.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-beach-brutus-loot-drops-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Beach Brutus Loot Drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>Beach Brutus drops a host of valuable loot when defeated in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including the ability to transform into the boss.</strong></p>



<p>Transforming into Beach Brutus provides a boost to maximum Health and Shields, along with a special ability in the Beach Brutus Kit that allows you to regenerate shields without needing to consume Shield Potions, which provides a huge boost in any combat situation, and you can also spawn Henchmen to assist in battle.</p>



<p>The downside, however, is that transforming into a boss like Beach Brutus will permanently mark your location to nearby players in a more precise manner than Medallions have done in previous Chapters and Seasons.</p>



<p>In terms of weapons, Beach Brutus drops The Brutus’ Twin Hammer Shotguns, a Mythic weapon that has a much faster reload speed than the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-Mythic variant</a>. While they have a limited range, they are extremely lethal and can either be fired at the same time, or individually.</p>



<p>Finally, defeating Beach Brutus will also drop a Chug Jug, a valuable item that restores both Health and Shields—and it’s even more useful with the boosted amounts you’ll receive of both when transformed into the boss.</p>

<p>If you know the name Ron Gilbert, it’s probably for his decades of work on classic point-and-click adventure games like <i>Maniac Mansion</i>, <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/review-return-to-monkey-island-is-must-play-point-and-click-brilliance/">the Monkey Island series</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/thimbleweed-park-review-nostalgic-to-a-fault/"><i>Thimbleweed Park</i></a>. Given that pedigree, October’s release of the Gilbert-designed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3773590/Death_by_Scrolling/"><i>Death by Scrolling</i></a>—a rogue-lite action-survival pseudo-shoot-em-up—might have come as a bit of a surprise.</p>
<p>In an interview from his New Zealand home, though, Gilbert noted that his catalog also includes some reflex-based games—<a href="https://www.backyardsports.com/">Humungous Entertainment’s Backyard Sports titles</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/07/its-funny-because-its-poop-ars-reviews-deathspank/">2010’s <em>Deathspank</em></a>, for instance. And Gilbert said his return to action-oriented game design today stemmed from his love for modern classics like <i>Binding of Isaac</i>, <i>Nuclear Throne</i>, and <i>Dead Cells</i>.</p>
<p>“I mean, I’m certainly mostly known for adventure games, and I have done other stuff, [but] it probably is a little bit of a departure for me,” he told Ars. “While I do enjoy playing narrative games as well, it’s not the only thing I enjoy, and just the idea of making one of these kind of started out as a whim.”</p>
<h2>Gilbert’s lost RPG</h2>
<p>After spending years focused on adventure game development with 2017’s <i>Thimbleweed Park</i> and then 2022’s <i>Return to Monkey Island</i>, Gilbert <a href="https://www.grumpygamer.com/dbs_history/">said</a> that he was “thinking about something new” for his next game project. But the first “new” idea he pursued wasn’t <i>Death by Scrolling</i>, but what he told Ars was “this vision for this kind of large, open world-type RPG” in the vein of <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>.</p>
<p>After hiring an artist and designer and spending roughly a year tinkering with that idea, though, Gilbert said he eventually realized his three-person team was never going to be able to realize his grand vision. “I just [didn’t] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that,” he said. “You know, it’s either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources.”</p>
<p>And Gilbert said that securing that “bunch of money” to build out a top-down action-RPG in a reasonable time frame proved harder than he expected. After pitching the project around the industry, he found that “the deals that publishers were offering were just horrible,” a problem he blames in large part on the genre he was focusing on.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>“Doing a pixelated old-school Zelda thing isn’t the big, hot item, so publishers look at us, and they didn’t look at it as ‘we’re gonna make $100 million and it’s worth investing in,’” he said. “The amount of money they’re willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this.”</p>
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              While crowdfunding helped <em>Thimbleweed Park</em> years ago, Gilbert says Kickstarter is “basically dead these days as a way of funding games.”

      </figure>

<p>For point-and-click adventure <i>Thimbleweed Park</i>, Gilbert got around a similar problem in part by going directly to fans of the genre, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thimbleweedpark/thimbleweed-park-a-new-classic-point-and-click-adv">raising $600,000 of a $375,000 goal via crowdfunding</a>. But even then, Gilbert said that private investors needed to provide half of the game’s final budget to get it over the finish line. And while Gilbert said he’d love to revisit the world of <i>Thimbleweed Park</i>, “I just don’t know where I’d ever get the money. It’s tougher than ever in some ways… Kickstarter is basically dead these days as a way of funding games.”</p>
<p>Compared to the start of his career, Gilbert said that today’s big-name publishers “are very analytics-driven. The big companies, it’s like they just have formulas that they apply to games to try to figure out how much money they could make, and I think that just in the end you end up giving a whole lot of games that look exactly the same as last year’s games, because that makes some money.</p>
<p>“When we were starting out, we couldn’t do that because we didn’t know what made this money, so it was, yeah, it was a lot more experimenting,” he continued. “I think that’s why I really enjoy the indie game market because it’s kind of free of a lot of that stuff that big publishers bring to it, and there’s a lot more creativity and you know, strangeness, and bizarreness.”</p>

<h2>Run for it</h2>
<p>After a period where Gilbert said he “was kind of getting a little down” about the failure of his action-RPG project, he thought about circling back to a funny little prototype he developed as part of a 2019 game design meet-up organized by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-cook-8086973/">Spry Fox’s Daniel Cook</a>. That prototype—initially simply called “Runner”—focused on outrunning the bottom of a continually scrolling screen, picking up ammo-limited weapons to fend off enemies as you did.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>While the prototype initially required players to aim at those encroaching enemies as they ran, Gilbert said that the design “felt like cognitive overload.” So he switched to an automatic aiming and firing system, an idea he says was part of the prototype long before it became popularized by games like <i>Vampire Survivors</i>. And while Gilbert said he enjoyed <i>Vampire Survivors</i>, he added that the game’s style was “a little too much ‘ADHD’ for me. I look at those games and it’s like, wow, I feel like I’m playing a slot machine at some level. The flashing and upgrades and this and that… it’s a little too much.”</p>

      The 2019 “Runner” prototype that would eventually become <em>Death by Scrolling.</em>

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>But Gilbert said his less frenetic “Runner” prototype “just turned out to be a lot of fun, and I just played it all the time… It was really fun for groups of people to play, because one person will play and other people would kind of be laughing and cheering as you, you know, escape danger at the nick of time.”</p>
<p>Gilbert would end up using much of the art from his scrapped RPG project to help flesh out the “Runner” prototype into what would eventually become <i>Death by Scrolling. </i>But even late in the game’s development, Gilbert said the game was missing a unifying theme. “There was no reason initially for why you were doing any of this. You were just running, you know?”</p>
<p>That issue didn’t get solved until the last six months of development, when Gilbert hit on the idea of running through a repeating purgatory and evading Death, in the form of a grim reaper that regularly emerges to mercilessly hunt you down. While you can use weapons to temporarily stun Death, there’s no way to completely stop his relentless pursuit before the end of a stage.</p>

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>“Because he can’t be killed and because he’s an instant kill for you, it’s a very unique thing you really kinda need to avoid,” Gilbert said. “You’re running along, getting gold, gaining gems, and then, boom, you hear that [music], and Death is on the screen, and you kind of panic for a moment until you orient yourself and figure out where he is and where he’s coming from.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>Is anyone reading this?</h2>
<p>After spending so much of his career on slow-burn adventure games, Gilbert admitted there were special challenges to writing for an action game—especially one where the player is repeating the same basic loop over and over. “It’s a lot harder because you find very quickly that a lot of players just don’t care about your story, right? They’re there to run, they’re there to shoot stuff… You kind of watch them play, and they’re just kind of clicking by the dialogue so fast that they don’t even see it.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, though, Gilbert said he’s seen that skip-the-story behavior among adventure game players, too. “Even in <i>Thimbleweed Park </i>and <i>Monkey Island</i>, people still kind of pound through the dialogue,” he said. “I think if they think they know what they need to do, they just wanna skip through the dialogue really fast.”</p>
<p>As a writer, Gilbert said it’s “frustrating” to see players doing the equivalent of “sitting down to watch a movie and just fast forwarding through everything except the action parts.” In the end, though, he said, a game developer has to accept that not everyone is playing for the same reasons.</p>

<p>“There’s a certain percentage of people who will follow the story and enjoy it, and that’s OK,” he said. “And everyone else, if they skip the story, it’s got to be OK. You need to make sure you don’t embed things deep in the story that are critical for them to understand. It’s a little bit like really treating the story as truly optional.”</p>
<p>Those who do pay attention to the story in <i>Death by Scrolling</i> will come across what Gilbert said he hoped was a less-than-subtle critique of the capitalist system. That critique is embedded in the gameplay systems, which require you to collect more and more gold—and not just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_for_the_dead">two pennies on your eyes</a>—to pay a newly profit-focused River Styx ferryman that has been acquired by Purgatory Inc.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>“It’s purgatory taken over by investment bankers,” Gilbert said of the conceit. “I think a lot of it is looking at the world today and realizing capitalism has just taken over, and it really is the thing that’s causing the most pain for people. I just wanted to really kind of drive that point in the game, in a kind of humorous, sarcastic way, that this capitalism is not good.”</p>
<p>While Gilbert said he’s always harbored these kinds of anti-capitalist feelings “at some level,” he said that “certainly recent events and recent things have gotten me more and more jumping on the ‘Eat the Rich’ bandwagon.” Though he didn’t detail which “recent events” drove that realization, he did say that “billionaires and all this stuff… I think are just causing more harm than good.”</p>

<h2>Is the point-and-click adventure doomed?</h2>
<p>Despite his history with point-and-click adventures, and the relative success of <i>Thimbleweed Park</i> less than 10 years ago, Gilbert says he isn’t interested in returning to the format popularized by LucasArts’ classic SCUMM Engine games. That style of “use verb on noun” gameplay is now comparable to a black-and-white silent movie, he said, and will feel similarly&nbsp; dated to everything but a niche of aging, nostalgic players.</p>
<p>“You do get some younger people that do kind of enjoy those games, but I think it’s one of those things that when we’re all dead, it probably won’t be the kind of thing that survives,” he said.</p>

<p>But while the point-and-click interface might be getting long in the tooth, Gilbert said he’s more optimistic about the future of adventure games in general. He points to recent titles like <i>Blue Prince </i>and <i>Lorelai and the Laser Eyes</i> as examples of how clever designers can create narrative-infused puzzles using modern techniques and interfaces. “I think games like that are kind of the future for adventure games,” he said.</p>
<p>If corporate owner Disney ever gave him another chance to return to the Monkey Island franchise, Gilbert said he’d like to emulate those kinds of games by having players “go around in a true 3D world, rather than as a 2D point-and-click game… I don’t really know how you would do the puzzle solving in [that] way, and so that’s very interesting to me, to be able to kind of attack that problem of doing it in a 3D world.”</p>

<p>After what he said was a mixed reception to the gameplay changes in <i>Return to Monkey Island</i>, though, Gilbert allowed that franchise fans might not be eager for an even greater departure from tradition. “Maybe <i>Monkey Island</i> isn’t the right game to do as an adventure game in a 3D world, because there are a lot of expectations that come with it,” he said. “I mean if I was to do that, you just ruffle even more feathers, right? There’s more people that are very attached to <i>Monkey Island</i>, but more in its classic sense.”</p>
<p>Looking over his decades-long career, though, Gilbert also noted that the skills needed to promote a new game today are very different from those he used in the 1980s. “Back then, there were a handful of print magazines, and there were a bunch of reporters, and you had sent out press releases… That’s just not the way it works today,” he said. Now, the rise of game streamers and regular YouTube game development updates has forced game makers to be good on camera, much like MTV did for a generation of musicians, Gilbert said.</p>
<p>“The [developers] that are successful are not necessarily the good ones, but the good ones that also present well on YouTube,” he said. “And you know, I think that’s kind of a problem, that’s a gate now… In some ways, I think it’s too bad because as a developer, you have to be a performer. And I’m not a performer, right? If I was making movies, I would be a director, not an actor.”</p>

            <p>A recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> update has added an inventive new solution to the problem of players breaking into locked rooms. If you manage to break into one of these locations full of valuable loot, but without using the required keycard, you're cooked alive.</p>
<p>This was first teased cheekily <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-4-0">in last week's patch notes</a>, describing it as "a very hot fix" to locked room exploits. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p7ytbc/locked_rooms_now_turn_you_into_a_fireball_if_you/">Videos of this measure</a> quickly spread across the internet like wildfire, with the Arc Raiders community celebrating the apparent death of one of the game's more frustrating quirks.</p>
<p>If you don't know, locked rooms are few and far between on each map, and generally require a keycard to open. By using the keycard, you unlock the room for everyone, allowing you to get in there and loot through a space saturated with high-rarity gear.</p>

</figure>
<p>This can be dangerous though, not only because keycards are themselves rare, but other players can wander in and kill you while you scavenge, or while you make your way to the extraction. It's a core part of the risk and reward loop present in Arc Raiders and extraction shooters in general.</p><p>However, exploiters were finding inventive ways into these rooms without the keycard. This could be clipping through the locked door, hopping through open windows, dropping through the ceiling, etc. Not only does this keep the door locked while you loot, it also means if another player goes to the locked room with the keycard as intended, they could find it barren, wasting their keycard for nothing. This, as you can imagine, sucked.</p>
<p>This new anti-exploit measures detects whether or not players are inside the locked room <em>while</em> the door is keycard locked. If they are, it kills them without a hope of escaping in slow, scorching fashion. Then, if a player does turn up with a keycard and opens the door, they'll find a bonus body alongside their locked room loot. Nice.</p>
<p>This is far from the only major fix made to Arc Raiders in recent days. In the same patch as this locked room exploit measure, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-patch-removes-weapon-swap-exploit">Embark Studios killed double pumping</a>, a technique terrorising innocents across Stella Montis. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-cameo-in-south-park">The game also recently made an appearance in South Park</a>, of all things.</p>

            <guid>1369024</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="d891c00a7cd74"><a title="xc2 8th birthday" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d891c00a7cd74/xc2-8th-birthday.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Monolith Soft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Has it really been eight entire years? Yes, it really actually has, so sit up and pay attention at the back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a>, which as every <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_definitive_edition">Xenoblade</a> nerd worth their salt knows is actually the third game released in the series, dropped into existence on this very day back in 2017, and it's a bit good. We gave it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">well-deserved 9/10</a> in our review, so it's a bona fide banger as officially ordained by the bona fide banger squad™.</p>
<p>To celebrate this eighth birthday (they get big so quickly these days), Monolith Soft has been sharing a lovely bit of artwork over on its social media. Which is great.</p>

<p>For reference, here's the Google translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On this day in 2017, "Xenoblade 2" was released.<br>
#MonolithSoft's Development History #WhatDayIsItToday<a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/games/"><br>
https://monolithsoft.co.jp/games/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, happy birthday. Very good. Now *pulls out ice-cream machine gun* make with the Switch 2 version, wiseguys. Come on. Open your jackets, show us the goods. Where is it?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems this writer's dream of an all-new, 60fps, 4K, enhanced-graphics, 100%-more-volumetrics-version of XC2 especially for Switch 2 might have to wait just a little bit longer. Unless they drop it later today (there's still time!).</p>
<p>Indeed, as much as we're just having a bit of birthday banter, it <em>has</em> been something that's been asked for repeatedly and rather loudly from franchise fans since Nintendo's new console dropped. With so many games getting boosts from the Switch 2, you may have hoped this epic action-RPG might have brute-forced itself into a better situation, even without an official upgrade.</p>
<p>However, unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disaster_report_4_summer_memories">Disaster Report 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a>, and a whole bunch of other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/33-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">games that got nice free boosts on the Switch 2</a>, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, whilst a little more stable in its 30fps now, still suffers from issues and hasn't benefited in any meaningful way. It's still a gorgeous, absolutely must-play thing, make no mistake, but it feels like it could be more.</p>

<p>This is a series, too, that really does tend to sing extra-specially loudly when it's unshackled from any technical limitations. We've all seen how improved the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_definitive_edition">first game</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> have been in their revamped, Definitive forms. So it stands to reason that we're all chomping at the bit to see Alrest and the Driver of the Aegis looking and feeling their best in a Switch 2 upgrade of some sort.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the meantime, happy 8th birthday, Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Enjoy your day. Just don't come down here dressed like that for your 10th.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>’s legions of fan weather-watchers spotted <a href="https://streamable.com/r96864">a portfolio reel</a> created by former Rockstar animator Benjamin Chue that includes what appears to be some WIP stuff from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>. Assuming the leak is legitimate, this isn’t nearly an eruption on the scale of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-gta-6-leaks-benefit-precisely-no-one">the 2022 GTA 6 leaks</a>: it contains a couple of extremely non-final animations from the forthcoming open world game. 
</p>
<p>One is of deuteragonist Lucia Caminos jumping out of a pick-up truck, which seems like a thing she’d do, though official GTA 6 trailers suggest she’d do it with a lot more bum jiggle than this. Another is of a placeholder baldy man – let’s christen him something appropriately generic, like Jean-Luc Picard – undocking a bike from a public bicycle hire station. Yes, GTA 6 has Boris Bikes.
</p><!--more-->
<p>I call them Boris Bikes because that’s what they were nicknamed when they came to London a few years ago, during the mayorship of tactically “bumbling” clown-emperor Boris Johnson. Since then, they’ve switched sponsors and been rebranded as Barclays Bikes and Santander Cycles, neither of which has the same ring, nor the same mild notoriety. In GTA 6, the bike hire scheme appears to be named LomBikes, a division of LomBank, a bank that <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Lombank">already exists</a> in the world of GTA. That’s what it’s called in the animation reel. You can also make out a LomBike docking station in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kvaqks/looks_like_gta_vi_will_have_rental_bikes_like/">one of the leaked 2022 images</a>, which Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-confirm-gta-6-leaks-but-say-it-wont-have-any-long-term-effect-on-development">have confirmed as genuine</a>. 
</p>
<p>The presence of public bike hire stations in GTA 6 gives me a weird pang. It might be the only thing that has given me a weird pang, to be honest, save for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-first-trailer-reactions">the Tom Petty music in the announcement trailer</a>. I used to live in a block near central London and the local kids were always doing experiments on the bikes. There was always a jailbroken Boris inside the security door that was covered in unidentifiable substances. The vehicle would deteriorate further as the weeks went by, eventually migrating to its final resting place beneath a stairwell. When riding the Boris Bikes, there was the thrill of trying to reach a docking station with a vacant slot inside the free usage period. At least one of these anecdotes feels like a natural basis for a GTA sidequest.
</p>
<p>GTA 6 has recently been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">delayed again</a> – it’ll now launch in November 2026. In the meantime, Rockstar face a lawsuit from a UK union after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">firing around 30 people on charges of leaking confidential information</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Chapter in Fortnite means new bosses to track down and defeat, but finding the specific boss locations is tricky if you don’t know where to look. Fortunately, this guide can direct you straight to Human Bill.</p>



<p>Human Bill is one of three bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, offering powerful items when defeated that can change the course of a match and put you on course to secure victory, but the blue alien can be tough to track down.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has detailed where to find Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, along with the loot offered once defeated.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-human-bill-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">Where to Find Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The hunt is on. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Human Bill does not have a single set spawn in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, and can instead appear in several locations across the map.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite has adopted travelling bosses with varying spawns in the past, including in The Simpsons mini-season, and it seems this mechanic will remain. Although it can be frustrating if you want to farm the boss, it does make every match more interesting with no single set spawn that all players can flock to.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of where Human Bill can be encountered in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ripped Tides</li>



<li>Classified Canyon</li>



<li>Painted Palms</li>



<li>South/East of Wonkeeland</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Human Bill, the areas around Wonkeeland are a good place to start, particularly Sunset Falls. The benefit of starting your search here is that Painted Palms, another potential spawn location for Human Bill, is a short distance away if you’re unsuccessful in your initial search.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-human-bill-loot-drops-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Human Bill Loot Drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>The most important loot dropped by Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is the boss transform item, transforming you into Human Bill and providing a special ability.</strong></p>



<p>Human Bill’s Kit can be activated for Low Gravity for a short period, making traversal to hard-to-reach places much easier and providing a quick escape. Transforming into Human Bill also provides an increased bar for Health and Shields, making you tough to beat.</p>



<p>Beware, though, as transforming into a boss will permanently mark your exact location to nearby players, in a more precise manner than Medallions have done in previous Chapters and Seasons.</p>



<p>Weapon-wise, defeating Human Bill drops Human Bill’s Arc-Lightning Gun, a Mythic version of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapon introduced this season</a>. It takes significantly longer to overheat, making it easier to defeat enemies without needing to switch weapons or wait for the Arc-Lightning Gun to cool down.</p>



<p>Finally, Human Bill also drops a Chug Jug when defeated, which is always a useful item but is even more so when transformed into a boss, as it restores the higher amount of Health and Shield you have earned.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over the weekend, a very small amount of animated footage widely believed to be from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> was featured in a demo reel by a Rockstar employee, which highlighted their work for the company.</p>
<p>The Rockstar footage itself appeared to come from animator Benjamin Chue and was pretty minimal in the grand scheme of GTA 6 things. However, along with clips from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, there was also a short montage of incomplete work showing a character taking a bike out from a rental kiosk, and then riding it.</p>
<p>The background from this footage was entirely grey, and the bike itself, which was yellow, also looked to be in the early stages of animation. On its frame, the word LomBike could be seen, likely a play on the real-world micromobility company Lime, <a href="https://www.electricvehicleshq.com/post/micromobility-fleet-expansion-lime-launches-limebike-and-limeglider-to-grow-electric-fleet">and its own LimeBike rental</a>. This trend would, of course, follow earlier GTA 6 leaks. Back in September, a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-leak-reveals-potential-in-game-sites-that-parody-uber-and-more">leaked in-game websites and apps appeared to parody the likes of Uber and WhatsApp</a>.</p>

<p>Another two incomplete clips featured within the demo reel showed a female character – which was likely one of GTA6's dual protagonists Lucia– with a pickup truck. In the first snippet, the character could be seen sitting on the back of the truck before swinging her legs around to jump out. In the second clip, the same character started off on the roof of the truck, before she jumped into the boot, and then onto the road beside the vehicle.</p><p>And, that's it. So, what's the big deal? Really, the footage doesn't show us anything <em>that </em>major. However, the fact that the footage was once available online and has since been removed has garnered attention from the GTA 6 community. You see, in removing the footage from the internet, developer Rockstar has essentially confirmed it was a legitimate leak from its upcoming game, rather unlike the AI efforts that have been making the rounds recently.</p>
<p>One of these supposed 'leaks', for example, showed a character meant to be GTA 6's Lucia making her way around Vice City. Another AI 'leak' showed Lucia getting up and out of a pool, before cutting to scenes in a bar. All of this sloppy AI footage is still available online, and is clearly no threat to Rockstar.</p>
<p>Chue's footage, meanwhile, has been removed from Vimeo where it was initially hosted. If you try and find it on that platform now, <a href="https://vimeo.com/1115554961/purgatory">you will be met with the message: "Sorry, we couldn't find that page"</a>.</p>

<p>Along with leaks and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">GTA 6 game delays</a>, developer Rockstar is currently making additional headlines following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">firing of staff members in a move seen by many as 'union busting'</a>. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">over 200 employees from Rockstar North signed a letter to management</a>, in which they condemned its actions. Rockstar's controversial dismissal of its employees has since been brought up in UK Parliament, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine urging "Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again"</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, a report suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">former Rockstar Games staff were fired due to internal company messages being discussed on a Discord server shared privately between staff and union workers</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>CD Projekt Red has reaffirmed plans to release an entire new trilogy of The Witcher games within six years.</p>
<p>Joint studio <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">CEO Michał Nowakowski told investors as much during a recent financial call</a>.</p>
<p>"In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time," Nowakowski said. "As we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>] and [The Witcher 5], between TW5 and TW6 and so on."</p>
<p>That means, assuming The Witcher 4 launches in 2027 (I'll come back to this point), that this entire new trilogy of Witcher games could be released by 2033 - perhaps one in 2027, one in 2030, and one in 2033. Note, we do not know when The Witcher 4 will launch. The only concrete date-related information we have is that the game will <em>not </em>be released in 2026.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHuw6gZxqcg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>As Nowakoswki said during the investor call: "As we have already stated, The Witcher 4 is in the full-scale production phase. We're not disclosing any details regarding the target release date, so there's not a point in time I could refer to when answering such a question. The only thing we're commenting is that we're not launching in 2026..."</p><p>The Witcher 4 <em>could </em>launch in 2027, then - that's the earliest it could appear. But it could be released in 2028 as well, or later. Perhaps CD Projekt Red will take longer to release the first game of the trilogy to ensure the foundations are laid for smoother and speedier development of games two and three.</p>
<p>Remember, one of the biggest challenges with this new trilogy is transitioning the studio to Unreal Engine 5. The Witcher 4 is the first game in decades that CD Projekt Red has used an engine other than its own to make; the last time was using BioWare's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neverwinter-nights">Neverwinter Nights</a> Aurora engine to make The Witcher 1. Since then, the studio has used iterations of its own internally made Red engine.</p>
<p>"We've been using UE5 for The Witcher 4 for almost four years now and we're very happy with what we've achieved," Nowakowski said during the investor call. "I think you could have seen some of that with your own eyes with our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">tech demo reveal at Unreal Fest a couple of months ago</a>, and we're very happy with the results of that as well – we've already said that, but I'm always happy to say it again – and we're happy with how the engine is evolving through the Epic team's efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as TW4 is meant to be."</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red is also using Unreal Engine 5 to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-1-remake-will-be-open-world-modern-reimagining">remake its first Witcher game</a> - a project inextricably linked to The Witcher 4, given the shared engine, and the up-front work that needs to be done tailoring it for the studio's needs. Because of that, most of the Fool's Theory team - the studio handling The Witcher 1 remake; a studio made up of former CDPR developers (which made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-thaumaturge-review-a-refreshingly-different-polish-rpg">The Thaumaturge, a pretty decent original RPG</a>) - has been shuffled to help with The Witcher 4, which presumably takes precedent over The Witcher 1 remake.</p><p>"I think we stated in the past that the majority of the team is currently involved in the other project, and also support for The Witcher 4," Nowakowski said, "so there is some limited team working on TW1, but since it's very much tied with TW4 development, this is also why we made this move, and we have explained that in the past. So, for TW1 per se, it's a smaller group of people."</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure which other project he's referring to, by the way. It's an unannounced project, but whether it has anything to do with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">Hadar, the codenamed new IP</a> that a small team is working on, I don't know.</p>
<p>To return to the question in the headline: can CD Projekt Red release three Witcher games in six years? We haven't seen another RPG studio do a similar thing since BioWare released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> trilogy in five years. Typically, most projects of this size these days suffer delays. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-delayed-again-now-due-may-2015">The Witcher 3 was delayed three times</a> until it eventually came out in May 2015, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-delay-necessary-for-last-minute-work-on-current-consoles-dev-says">Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed four times</a> until it arrived in December 2020. Even assuming CD Projekt Red doesn't delay The Witcher 4, 5, or 6, those previous games highlight lengthening development times - five years between Witcher 3 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and seven years between Cyberpunk and The Witcher 4, assuming it releases in 2027. To believe CD Projekt Red can suddenly narrow that gap to three years between games is a leap of faith to make.</p>

            <p>November is...done! The tawdry moveable feast that is Videogaming shudders and rolls beyond the canopy, out into the whitening dunes and fathoms of December. Now for revelry! Strike your trumpets! Blow your drums! Possibly the other way round! The folk of game development exit their wagons and sprint weeping amongst the dissipating trees. A bunch of narrative and game designers put on eight-inch stilettos and form a high-kicking cabaret line. The stilettos fly off and perforate Take-Two's entire executive board. A miracle! Saint CJ be praised! 
</p>
<p>What wonders await us out here in the climactic month of the year? More PC games, apparently. Here are a few that deserve scrutiny, maybe even celebration.
</p>
<h2>Monday 1st December</h2>
<ul>
<li>People keep yelling at me in comments that Dotemu's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753970/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> (pictured) is an awesome throwback beat 'em up and we are perfect dunces for ignoring it. Fine, those people. Here's an Official RPS Mention. Now get the hell out of my office.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2467850/Wild_Growth/">Wild Growth</a> is an intriguing and snazzily pigmented incremental fantasy strategy game in which you play healer to a Norse warband. I like games that explore the healing profession. I'm not massively into idle clickers, though.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 2nd December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tingus-goose">Tingus Goose</a> is that frightful game about goose trees that sprout babies. Mark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/humans-birth-geese-who-birth-mutants-to-pay-for-elaborate-sky-mating-in-tingus-gooses-steam-next-fest-demo">inflicted this on us a few months ago</a>. The very title gives me hives. I'd successfully obliterated it from my memory, but then Julian went and recommended it over Slack this morning.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sleep-awake">Sleep Awake</a> is the horror game in which people vanish when they sleep, and everybody has accordingly gone nuts for want of shuteye/energy drinks. Wimps! </li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horses">Horses</a> is Santa Ragione's grotesque psychosexual farming fable inspired by Surrealist film and featuring human slaves.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 3rd December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2692990/DONT_SCREAM_TOGETHER/">Don't Scream Together</a> is not a polite reminder to only scream by yourself in the privacy of your own home, but a Blair Witchy co-op horror game with mandatory mic usage. Don't talk too loud or you'll become what's chasing you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 4th December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3884520/Blood_Refreshed_Supply/">Blood: Refreshed Supply</a> is Nightdive's revamp of Monolith's 1997 Build engine shooter, featuring 42 levels of demonic mischief, a new scenario, and originally cut features such as weather.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/routine">Routine</a> is a long-in-development sci-fi horror in which you explore a trashed Moonbase from the 1980s. One for the Alien: Isolation and Observation lovers.</li>
<li>Floating city-builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flotsam">Flotsam</a> leaves early access today. Sim Waterworld, they're calling it, despite the commendable absence of Kevin Costner.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveller 0</a> is a town-building prequel to Square Enix's "HD-2D" throwback RPG that includes stuff from the free-to-play Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 5th December</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3757210/Agreeee/">Agreeee</a> is about trying to agree to the terms and conditions so that you can play the dang game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also coming this week: some new DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer III</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, and Mechwarrior V. Plus: various embargoed things. We are entering the final Events season of the year. The silvery shoals and drifts of December hide many secrets. Like hungry sand fleas, they wriggle towards the footfalls of the game devs carousing on the forest's edge. Eesh! Anyway, let us know if there are any promising new games we're missing.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new chapter has kicked off with Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings a new map into the fray with a variety of NPC characters to find, and this guide has details on them all.</p>



<p>Chapter 7 kicked off after a dramatic end to Chapter 6 with the Zero Point live event, which led to significant changes in gameplay, including the removal of several modes. However, the dates for their return have been revealed by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-roadmap-blitz-reload-og-delulu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 7 Season 1 Roadmap</a>.</p>



<p>NPCs can be of real assistance in every season in Fortnite, and it’s worth knowing their locations and what they offer, so Insider Gaming has all the details of where they are found in Chapter 7 Season 1.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-npc-characters-amp-services">All Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 NPC Characters &amp; Services</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to find. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 10 NPC Characters scattered across the map in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, with additions and removals likely as the season progresses.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous chapters and seasons, not all of the NPC characters have defined services and, instead, their offerings will vary each match. There are four potential options for each of the non-specialist characters to offer in a match, which are as follows.</p>



<ul>
<li>Gain Gold based on your match performance (Free)</li>



<li>Spawn a Rift (500 Gold)</li>



<li>Restock Ammo (500 Gold)</li>



<li>Health &amp; Shields (500 Gold)</li>
</ul>



<p>Specialists, meanwhile, are NPCs available to hire that will follow you for the remainder of the match, providing support based on their class, like ammo and health items, and will attack enemy players. Hiring a specialist costs 600 Gold.</p>



<p>A full list of all NPC characters in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is shown below. This article will be updated with any additions and removals as the season progresses.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>Kingston does not show as discovered on the Fortnite map this season after interacting with him, but this should be fixed soon. </p>

            <p>The developers of Metal Gear Solid Delta are yet to decide what their next project will be, be it another remake or something entirely new. A remake of Metal Gear Solid 4, though, would be "pretty hard".</p>
<p>Following Delta, released back in August, series fans are keen to hear what's next for the developers. After all, it was developed as a way of re-introducing the series to new fans, as well as bringing the game up to modern standards.</p>
<p>"Right now, I'm thinking about what to make next. With Metal Gear, I've been able to create an opportunity for new people to experience my work, so I want to continue doing this," said series producer Noriaki Okamura in a new interview with <a href="https://realsound.jp/tech/2025/11/post-2232566.html">Real Sound</a> (machine translated).</p>

</figure>
<p>"However, we haven't yet decided what we'll be creating," he continued. "There may be remakes, but we may also try new works.</p>
<p>"The Metal Gear series is like the history of video games, and it ranges from pixel art to cinematic expressions, so the remake method and expression method for each work is different. We don't intend to apply the methodology we created for MGS Delta to all of our works, but rather we will consider the best method for each work."</p><p>Prior to Delta, many of the original developers left Konami, but Okamura is pleased to have gathered a team to produce the remake. "As a team, we are confident that we have achieved a quality that will be enjoyable for modern players without compromising the appeal of previous titles," he said. "We are currently exploring specific plans for our next steps."</p>
<p>It would seem <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-patriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a> would be a struggle to remake, however.</p>
<p>"The hardware at the time required some pretty special construction to deliver 3D performance with the technology available at the time, and MGS4 also had some pretty special code... It would be pretty hard to bring it up now," said Okamura.</p>
<p>While Metal Gear Solid 4 does numerically come after 3, chronologically it wouldn't really make sense as the next remake for Konami to tackle. More pertinent is the existence of Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2, which is where we're likely to see MGS4 make an appearance.</p>
<p>While the first Master Collection included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid 1</a> - 3 along with some other classics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-includes-references-to-peace-walker-mgs4-and-5">dataminers did find reference to 4, 5, and Peace Walker in its code</a> shortly after its release in 2023.</p>
<p>Then, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stay-tuned-for-metal-gear-solid-4-in-master-collection-vol-2-says-konami">Konami told fans to "stay tuned" for news on MGS4 in Master Collection 2</a>, teasing its likely inclusion. As the game was exclusive to the PS3 and hasn't been released again since, fans are certainly keen to experience it again in some form.</p>

            <p>So, an ambitious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> multiplayer mod called CyberMP has been in development for a little while now, and the folks behind it have just concluded its "most stable and successful" closed beta test yet. Tweaks to key elements like vehicle and player synchronisation, as well as a new interface and custom lobbies went down well with testers, while technical gremlins were minimal.</p>
<p>If this is your first time hearing about CyberMP, it's a project that's currently being worked on by a team of 10, having first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod-gains-traction-following-successful-playtest">come to prominence</a> last summer. Its goal is to offer multi-person deathmatches and races to Cyberpunkers, rather than full GTA Online-style co-op missioning or gigging.</p>

<p>That brings us to now and the mod's latest closed beta test, which the modders had <a href="https://discord.com/channels/868154037332226058/924208769309761567/1404067462986731571">previously teased</a> would be a "pivotal stage in the project's evolution". As shown off in the video above, the CyberMP team invited a group to give some races and shootouts a go, as well as cruise around Night City.</p><p>According to the modders' <a href="https://discord.com/channels/868154037332226058/924208769309761567/1444762474581590148">latest Discord post</a>, the key goals included making sure progress had been made on getting players and vehicles to sync up seamlessly, with the CyberMP folks having reworked both systems. Thankfully, that work's paid off, with characters and cars reportedly translating more smoothly across players' screens, while moving about on foot feels "more responsive".</p>
<p>Also under the microscope were a new interface overlay, which provides everything from chat functions to the ability to teleport around the world, and the option to create custom lobbies for the mod's races and battles. Finally, testing out a new JavaScript module and how CyberMP runs on Linux were on the to-do list. The modders say all went well, adding in terms of those last two technical bits: "several minor bugs that were found have already been fixed, and we will continue working on optimisation".</p>
<p>"In summary, we can confidently say this was the most stable and successful test in the project’s history," the CyberMP team wrote. "Over the few days, only a handful of game client crashes were recorded, some of which were not directly related to the CyberMP client. All discovered gameplay bugs have either already been fixed or are being fixed now. We feel we’re reaching a new level and are preparing for even more extensive changes."</p>
<p>As of writing, the mod's still without a release date, but its creators did tease here that more updates on on the way soon. So, I guess all we can do is keep out weird robo-eyes peeled for news of when multi-merc meetups might open up to everyone.</p>

<p>The Gulag became a popular meme when Warzone first released, and Fortnite could be set to bring its own version of the infamous battle arena to the colorful world.</p>



<p>‘1v1 me in the Gulag’ is a line (and meme) associated with the Covid era. Many took shelter from the pandemic in their homes and sank hundreds and thousands of hours into CoD Warzone as a means of escape. Warzone’s Gulag became the new Rust, and whenever you died in Warzone, the Gulag was your main entry point back into the game.</p>



<p>Now, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-bus-wheels-pump-n-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> Gulag could finally be following suit.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-gulag-takes-inspiration-from-call-of-duty-warzone">Fortnite Gulag Takes Inspiration From Call of Duty: Warzone</h2>

<p>It’s fair to say that Fortnite doesn’t need to copy anyone’s homework. Epic’s shooter is still ridiculously popular nearly 10 years later, and keeps finding ways to freshen up the gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 7 Season 1</a> brought <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-leaks-reveal-driveable-reboot-vans-bots-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">driveable reboot vans, a Bots Mode</a>, along with a wingsuit, and many other ideas. According to renowned leakers Shiina and <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX"></a>HYPEX (through <a href="https://x.com/l3stei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@l3stei</a>), a Fortnite Gulag is on the way.</p>







<p>It will reportedly be called ‘Restarter Island’ and will have players compete in a series of mini-games to determine the winner. The traditional Gulag is basically a quick 1v1 gunfight where it’s the first player to eliminate the other.</p>



<p>In Fortnite, you will allegedly battle in Rock, Paper, Scissors, some kind of Shockwave Grenades mini-game, and more.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Fortnite does feel like an amalgamation of every top battle royale idea at this point, and why not? Millions of players still hop in every day. As long as it’s implemented right and in a fun way that doesn’t detract from Fortnite, is a new Gulag a good idea?

As an encore, Team Cherry has confirmed that there will be DLC released for Silksong. Just don't expect it too soon.</p><p>"I don't really know what else people would necessarily want to hear other than what we're already saying," Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "Yes, we're continuing to work on the game, we're pursuing the things that excite us ... I think what people might want to hear is: There will be new stuff coming in a reasonable timeframe and not seven years from now."</p><p>Gibson went on to explain that he and Team Cherry co-founder William Pellen "might have some vague ideas" for the DLC, but added that he didn't want to "overpromise" and underdeliver to the game's fans. He also teased the return of Steel Assassin Sharpe, an enemy character from the first game.</p><p>"[Sharpe is] just waiting in the wings," said Gibson. "Waiting to arrive is probably the best way to say it. One of those enemies, a little suite of Sharpe and their companions, they got tucked away for a while because the game had so much in it. And all of these pieces need polish, and polish takes time. We're excited to reintroduce Sharpe. We just have to get to them."</p><p>In the meantime, Team Cherry has continued to support Silksong with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">PC patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>, and an update that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-new-patch-finally-nerfs-the-muckmaggots/1100-6536098/" data-ref-id="1100-6536098">nerfed the Muckmaggots</a> and replaced the game's unpopular Chinese translation with a fan-made translation that has been much better received than its predecessor.

Team Cherry also explained that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-is-harder-than-hollow-knight-and-its-hornets-fault/1100-6534856/" data-ref-id="1100-6534856">the reason Silksong is so difficult</a> is because they made the leading character, Hornet, so powerful.</p>

But these NPCs aren't necessarily smarter because they're AI. In fact, players have discovered some easy-to-exploit loopholes in the chat model that convinces NPCs to hand over their side-quest loot or money even when you haven't done anything at all.</p><p>Players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1p13j9w/at_first_i_tried_to_speak_normally_to_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> noticed that the AI-powered chatbot NPCs often put their emotional responses and actions in parentheses. That led to the discovery that telling an NPC that you did something to fulfill their quest inside of a parentheses will cause the NPC to believe you've already done it. And the game rewards players for that deception by having the NPC hand over whatever item they promised the player for their help.</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1p13j9w/at_first_i_tried_to_speak_normally_to_the/" rel="nofollow ">At first, I tried to speak normally to the chatbots, but then I realized you have the power of (divine truth)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Proximis/" rel="nofollow ">u/Proximis</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/" rel="nofollow ">WhereWindsMeet</a></blockquote><p>While Everstone may eventually fix that workaround, it's not the only way to mislead the NPCs. Another user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1p5aqyk/the_metal_gear_method_unironically_works/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> found that repeating the NPC's last statement as a question can eventually wear it down until it hands over the item. The user called it, "the Metal Gear method."</p><p>While the AI chatbots may be technically superior to standard NPC behavior, traditional NPCs wouldn't fall for the same tricks due to their programing. They simply don't have the option to do or say anything outside of their scripted dialogue and actions. The NPCs of Where Winds Fall currently lack those limitations that would have protected them from this exploit.</p><p>Where Winds Meet had its official launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile earlier this month.</p>

<p>The Q3 earnings call for CD Projekt Red revealed a ton of fun details. One of the most eye-catching statements mentioned The Witcher 4, letting us know it’s not releasing in 2026, but giving us a full launch window for the three new The Witcher games.</p>



<p>It feels like a millennium has passed since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 3</a> launched. The RPG of a lifetime will go down as an all-time great, and after the development of Cyberpunk 2077, its release, and the vast clean-up operation following its debut, we’re all ready for The Witcher 4 and beyond.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-hits-new-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 has hit a new sales milestone</a>, showing the incredible turnaround of the game’s fortunes following its horrific 2020 release. Phantom Liberty was another hit, but it’s high time CD Projekt Red turns its full focus back ot The Witcher franchise.</p>







<p>During the company’s <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 earnings call</a>, speaker Michał Nowakowski (Joint CEO at CDPR) was asked: “Can you share more detail about where you are in The Witcher 4 development process? What are the key technical/design risks that could shift the release window?”</p>



<p>Nowakowski respodned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re not disclosing any details regarding the target release date, so there’s not a point in time I could refer to when answering such a question. The only think we’re commenting is that we’re not launching in 2026, and we’re also not typically getting into any specifics regarding technical or design matters. There’s nothing out of the ordinary, I’d say, in that area happening with TW4 – it’s just full scale production proceeding at its pace, as per our internal plans. I think that’s as much as we can say.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was probably to be expected, as you’d imagine CDPR doesn’t want to repeat the mistakes of Cyberpunk 2077. On the other hand, it was quite surprising to learn that CDPR intends to stick with its trilogy release plans:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time – as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between TW4 and TW5, between TW5 and TW6 and so on.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Again, The Witcher 4 in 2026 would be great, but the year is going to be stacked enough with games. As for the remaining games in the trilogy, as long as they’re well-made and exude that typical CDPR premium quality, three full-scale The Witcher games in six years would be special. Let us know if you think this is unrealistic, and you can do so through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/01/duskpunk-review/</link>
            <guid>1368943</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Duskpunk is a dice-based RPG putting you in a world where misery roams the streets of the city of Dredgeport, thanks to a combination of a seemingly never-ending war, criminal gangs, and the sway of the most powerful including the Emperor. You are a nobody who somehow escaped the butchery of the Front, but need to find your footing in a city where luck is thin and where relationships can turn sour quickly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Duskpunk release trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EcXl0rwyjWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You have a choice of four classes in Duskpunk – Veteran, Writer, Criminal and Engineer – each of which has different starting stats. The veteran is a solid pick if you want to fight your way out of situations, with the disadvantage of not having the charisma or intuitiveness to find other solutions. The criminal class is for those who want to sneak around and use intuition. Engineers can construct workarounds for problems but are useless in a fight, while writers use their words to win arguments and bring people round. As you progress through Duskpunk you will earn ability points by completing tasks to up each skill, so can raise all of the stats to deal with most situations, as well as earning additional abilities.</p>


<p>Duskpunk’s gameplay is similar to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/04/citizen-sleeper-episode-purge-review/">Citizen Sleeper</a>, but with different issues to keep track of and worry about. &nbsp;Groat, the game currency that you use, is a big one as it will determine if you can buy food, shelter, and drugs to deal with stress. Groats go as quickly as they come, so you won’t ever feel financially comfortable. Stress can be raised by pushing beyond your character’s limits and through nightmares. As the stress meter builds, dice faces break, meaning your rolls as less likely to give you good outcomes. Initially, the only way to reduce stress is to take a drug which is expensive and hard to acquire, but as you explore more of Dredgeport different ways to reduce stress open up including meditation and talking to others. A wanted level can also appear depending on your actions, so you have to figure out ways to evade the authorities before they catch you. Health is another attribute to watch and if it reaches zero then a skill becomes broken. These skills can be fixed by recuperating, but that costs time and Duskpunk is a game where time matters a lot.</p>


<p>You will find yourself mixing with different factions through Dredgeport, each with their own goals, from controlling the drug business, unionising, all the way to toppling the government. As you become familiar with these groups you will be given aims, aka missions, to undertake which can vary wildly from handing out pamphlets to digging up corpses. A majority of the aims are time sensitive and it doesn’t seem possible to complete them all, so you need to decide which factions appeal to your character more.</p>
<p>The representatives of each of these factions, such as Zai of the Machinists and Dresden of the Lich Dealers, are decently written but, for me, did not quite have the depth to pull me in to build a real connection with them. There are some powerful groups in Duskpunk, but the decisions you make are what really impacts the wider world, even through inaction or not completing an aim. While there are a number of choices to make, there are only a few real endings that your actions can lead to. It offers some replayability, but also shows that some actions you take will not have an overbearing impact on the final outcome, though they can impact the fate of individual characters.</p>

<p>A bit more of the world treating you as a just one person where events happen without your involvement would have been good too, making Dredgeport feel more like a real city that moves around you and not because of you. The story is pretty engaging and does explore a number of themes including workers rights, the balance of power in society, isolation, segregation, and survival. Again it is not the most in-depth look at these themes, but Duskpunk does provide an accessible way to learn about these issues and tie them to our own experiences.</p>

<p>For much of Duskpunk, you will either be looking at a map of Dredgeport to pick locations to visit, or reading the conversations you have with the different characters to advance the game. I like the user interface of Duskpunk, finding it easy to navigate and understand. You have the map, the aim journal, and an inventory to show what you are carrying. Aside from groats, you can also trade rumours, tip-offs, and rare goods for money or influence. The characters are nicely drawn too with each one having a really distinctive look, while the map has small details like birds flying around, the flow of the river, and smoke rising from the factories. A lot of work has gone into making the world seem alive, even if it is a map.</p>

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have announced that an extraordinarily low number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> games were ruined by cheaters in a recent blog post.</p>
<p>The post, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251">shared on the Battlefield Comms Twitter account</a>, broke down the performance of EA's Javelin kernel-level anti-cheat. Roughly 98 percent of online matches in the first week post-launch were cheater free in Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>Part of the anti-cheat's success has been attributed to the "invaluable" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">Battlefield 6 open beta</a>. EA states that over 1.2m cheat attempts were blocked. In addition, users' adoption of Secure Boot leaped from 62.5 percent to 92.5 percent, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bios-shock-getting-past-battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-error-was-the-faffiest-thing-a-pc-game-has-ever-required-of-me">a feature that proved frustrating for many</a> but nonetheless is core to Battlefield 6's anti-cheat system.</p>

</figure>
<p>EA stated the anti-cheat efforts continue, with the total block figure now up to 2.39m (each block meaning an individual attempt to use cheating software). Sadly, there are still 1.5 percent of impacted players unable to activate Secure Boot on their PCs, meaning they can't actually launch and play Battlefield 6 even after troubleshooting efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, EA is aware of 190 cheat-related programs, hardware, vendors, and resellers. The post states: "183 of them (96.3 percent) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely."</p>
<p>The post concluded by laying out a variety of steps the EA team will take to improve the anti-cheat moving forward, the war between cheaters and anti-cheat software being an endless struggle. Still, as it stands today, these are impressive statistics that show Battlefield 6 should be a largely fair and enjoyable game to play online. Here's hoping EA can keep this momentum through to the foreseeable future.</p><p>

Battlefield 6 remains very popular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-dominates-steam-charts-ahead-of-worldwide-release-as-analyst-estimates-over-100m-in-pre-launch-sales">even as the staggering launch drifts into the past</a>. If you've not tried it out yet, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Eurogamer's Battlefield 6</a> review to get an idea of what EA's latest AAA shooter is like.

            <p>Over the weekend, The Game Awards organiser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> set social media tongues wagging with three words: regal.inspiring.thickness.</p>
<p>No, despite what I first thought, these are not the three words he used to describe himself on his Tinder profile. Rather, they link to a location via a What3Words address. And, that location leads to a spot near Joshua Tree, California.</p>

<p>As you can see in the image I took this morning from the What3Words app, regal.inspiring.thickness is a rather barren looking area in California.</p>
<p>Well, at least, it may have once been, but others have since ventured forth to the spot, and discovered a large and rather imposing statue now standing proudly in a field in the Mojave Desert, on the corner of 29 Palms Highway and Yucca Mesa Road.</p>

<p>The statue itself shows a group of demonic creatures all surrounding a hellish-looking portal type design. This portal area lights up at night, as you can see via the second image below, with a fiery and quite ominous glow.</p>
<p>Many have surmised that this is all part of a tease for The Game Awards 2025, which is set to kick off later this month, on 11th December. But, what is it teasing exactly? The current most popular theory out there is an expansion or something similar for Blizzard's Diablo series. The statue's hellish iconography certainly would fit the bill.</p>

<p>Others have speculated the statue could be related to God of War, with earlier rumours suggesting the series would be heading to Egypt. Housemarque's next game Saros has also been mentioned in various replies and social media posts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many wishful thinkers have suggested it could be a statue leading up to a big Elder Scrolls 6 reveal, or perhaps a new Doom installment. I have also seen others mention Half Life 3.</p>

<p>Whatever it may all end up being, there is not too much longer to find out. The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Leading the nominations at this year's event is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">which is up for 12 awards</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-control-trademark-sparks-speculation-remedy-will-be-making-a-the-game-awards-announcement">trademark for something known as Control: Resonant was registered in Europe</a>, leading many to speculate developer Remedy has something up its sleeve for The Game Awards.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update is settling in nicely, but players are finding that things are unfolding a little haphazardly. Ahead of the launch of 1.0, the world of Tarkov was introduced to Black Division, a new and high-tier faction that was reportedly set to patrol Terminal, the new ‘endgame’ map.</p>



<p>However, in recent hours, players have started encountering Black Division and RUAF, another new faction, on multiple maps, <strong>including Factory</strong>. Presently, it seems that they’re only roaming in PvE, which has led many to believe that Battlestate Games is using the PvE platform as a testing base before releasing into PvP.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-division-is-roaming-in-tarkov">Black Division is Roaming in Tarkov</h2>



<p>In a series of shots shared by VeryBadSCAV on social media, we see clear evidence that Black Division fighters are being spotted on maps <strong>outside </strong>Terminal, the mysterious environment yet to be revealed by any Escape from Tarkov player.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Black Division fighters were found in a Factory raid on the PvE platform, which has many thinking that Battlestate is using the mode to prepare for PvP drops of the newest factions, Black Division and RUAF. Users have also reported spotting RUAF fighters roaming on various maps in large packs.</p>







<p>VeryBadSCAV continued in later posts, suggesting that Battlestate Games is ‘sneaking in’ Terminal and the recently teased Winter Update that will blanket Tarkov in snow, just as it has the last few years.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First image is the patchnote, which is too small for 6 hr downtime.<br>I call this Red herring, just like Labyrinth update was a surprise.<br>Since Black division &amp; RUAF members suddenly started to spawn in multiple maps right before the update (SS &amp; multiple reports).<br>Its very likely… <a href="https://t.co/eMDY8uluDu">pic.twitter.com/eMDY8uluDu</a></p>— VeryBadSCAV (@VeryBadSCAVR) <a href="https://twitter.com/VeryBadSCAVR/status/1995363538408477037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Some players are sceptical about the imminent arrival of Terminal, and many are confused about the ‘soft lock’ situation. No Escape from Tarkov player has managed to make it to Terminal, with many having completed the game’s new story and sitting on a ‘wait objective’ that instructs them to hold fire until an escape path is outlined.</p>



<p>Until then, Tarkov players will need to be satisfied with Black Division and RUAF gunning for them at random across other maps.</p>
