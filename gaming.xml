                <p>In October, Bethesda announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-and-fallout-new-vegas-are-getting-anniversary-editions/1100-6535649/" data-ref-id="1100-6535649">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a>, an updated version of the game that was released 10 years ago this month. What was meant to be the definitive version of the game launched with numerous bugs and other issues that sparked a backlash against Fallout 4. Now, Bethesda is releasing an update for November and looking ahead to a December update as well.</p><p>Bethesda shared the patch notes on social media. The message didn't directly address the negative response to Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, but it did thank players for their "continued communication with us on your current Fallout 4 experience." The dev team notes that it's focused on DLC installation issues, occasional crashing, and general user experience in the patch.</p><p>The team added that it still plans to add a mod storage expansion on Fallout 4's console versions. However, the devs state that more time is needed before that feature is ready to be released. Beyond that, the team promised to share details about the December patch in a few weeks.</p><p>Additionally, the devs promised "several free Fallout 4 Creations coming to players," including the first one, The Varmint Rifle. To get that one when it arrives next week, players will have to fall down a manhole before they discover the unique rifle, solve a series of puzzles, and fight their way out of enemy territory.</p><p>The release date for Fallout 4's November patch hasn't been announced yet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>If you predicted ten years ago that Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson would grow his YouTube channel into an empire that spans snacks, toys, an anime meant to sell those toys, and now a theme park, I would very much like for you to come lottery ticket shopping with me. Despite the long odds, it’s all come true, with the latter materializing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia after a frenzied couple months of construction. It looks… <a href="https://kotaku.com/beast-land-mrbeast-theme-park-saudi-arabia-2000645495?ref=aftermath.site"><u>really bad</u></a>! But a lot of things about MrBeast look bad when put under a magnifying glass, like his many <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-chaos-1235217834/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>recent scandals and controversies</u></a> – as well as his whole <a href="https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games/"><u>persona</u></a> of being a Willy Wonka wannabe meets Jigsaw from <em>Saw</em>. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss why none of those issues have managed to meaningfully chip his armor.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by two of the finest internet culture reporters to ever lace up their boots and wade into the muck, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kattenbarge.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kat Tenbarge</u></a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/asarch.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Steven Asarch</u></a>, to talk about why MrBeast’s new theme park, Beast Land, is so bad – and why quality was never the point in the first place. Spoiler alert: It’s a giant ad, as many so-called theme parks, activations, and experiences are these days. We live in an era of flimsy disposability where nothing – whether it’s a short-form video or a branded IRL pop-up – is built to last.</p><p>Then we discuss the latest platform to go all in on invasive age verification tech: <em>Roblox</em>, which will <a href="https://www.polygon.com/roblox-age-verification-id-check-user-issues-child-safety/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>require use of a facial age estimation system and ID checks</u></a> to access chat. On one hand, <em>Roblox </em>has had more than its fair share of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>child predation scandals</u></a> at this point, so it has every incentive to at least perform comprehensiveness here. On the other, <em>Roblox</em>’s real problems run much deeper, and a suite of data-hungry surveillance tools won’t solve them.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Kat shares a wild story about the time someone commissioned her, then an ASMRtist, to make a video in which she turned them into a puppet.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can build our own theme park in Australia (or maybe just the cozy little countryside office <a href="https://aftermath.site/aurumek-simon-hintermann-new-shirt-print-design-aftermath/"><u>featured in our latest piece of merch</u></a>, available now!)</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> It’s weird to think that YouTube, in a way, has this incestuous relationship with [MrBeast]. They want the views his content brings, so despite the personal controversy he might start, YouTube as a company are willing to relentlessly promote him and invest in him. The last person I can remember them having that kind of relationship with was Shane Dawson before his fall. The CEO of YouTube would go to his house and hang out with him, and that was not really a relationship YouTube had with a lot of people.</p><p>But I think with MrBeast, we’re almost in a post-controversy era, because previously in a different decade, you’d think major multinational corporations would be scared by the types of things MrBeast has been credibly accused of doing. But now they’re actually less scared of working with him even when now the general public consensus around him is that he’s kind of a bad guy.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Why do you think that is? What do you think made brands in general go from being very squeamish around these creators – being very brand safe in their approach – to being like “Now that people’s opinions have soured, this is actually safer for us”?</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> When we were talking about MrBeast’s controversies, it’s like, in a certain sense, now that he’s had them, they know that it doesn’t really matter anymore. Of course there are still worse things he could do; there are still things that could bring down the empire. But I think these companies and brands realized over the past five years in particular that the longevity of the influencer does not depend on how bad the controversy gets.</p><p>I imagine that the lesson from Logan Paul, for example, was [that cancellations don’t stick]. At a certain point after the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42644321?ref=aftermath.site"><u>suicide forest video</u></a>, it seemed like Logan would never make money again. But the reality is that he makes exponentially more money now than he ever did before or during that controversy. In a weird way, I feel like the brands almost push the creators more than the audience pushes the creators.</p><p><strong>Steven:</strong> Cancellation in general when it comes to this style of influencer is now a myth. I don’t think an influencer – outside of an extreme grooming or sexual assault scandal – can’t bounce back from any sort of controversy at this point. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/trisha-paytas-past-drama-mom-life-1234983378/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Trisha Paytas</u></a> is doing better than she’s ever done before. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffree-star-sexual-assault-allegations-violence-accused-predator-myspace-payments-2020-9?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jeffree Star</u></a> is still thriving.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper/"><u>Dr Disrespect</u></a> still exists.</p><p><strong>Steven: </strong>Guy Beahm is doing photoshoots and thriving with his weird audience. You can’t really be cancelled anymore, because all it takes is a weird niche audience that can fund your content for a really long time. You don’t need to go mainstream. Guy Beahm – I’m not calling him The Doc, I refuse – is never going to hit that same level he hit in the pre-2020 TwitchCon era. He’s now sort of cemented himself as an anti-cancel culture warrior, and the audience that’s fallen for it is willing to give him enough that he can survive. Influencers don’t need to be for everyone anymore. They can find their niche and thrive in a way that didn’t work just five years ago.</p><p>I think when it comes to MrBeast, his scandals only reached the level that they did because he couldn’t talk. He claims there was a law firm looking into his company. I believe that from talking to people inside. But in general, these influencers can’t be canceled. There’s no such thing. Brands are full of older folks who see a big name and think “Oh, I can throw my thing behind them.” I don’t think Jack Link’s Beef Jerky – which is now doing a MrBeast collab – really cared too much about the Ava [Kris Tyson] controversy from last year when they signed that seven-to-eight-figure deal to slap his name on a bunch of meat sticks.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Just to give people an idea of what we’re talking about here – especially as you have been kind of the chronicler of MrBeast’s many scandals – what are the most egregious things he’s done?</p><p><strong>Steven:</strong> I’ve been reporting on MrBeast since 2018, when I interviewed him about a real-life battle royale he decided to do. I would say up until 2024, MrBeast was uncancellable. Criticism was not even allowed of MrBeast because he did philanthropy; he helped people. He helped cure blindness singlehandedly, according to his video thumbnail.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the summer of 2024, it came out that Ava Kris Tyson – who was his second in command and his closest friend – had been talking inappropriately with minors on a Discord and had allegedly sexually assaulted their assistant while they were working. This led to a series of other controversies coming out. A YouTuber named DogPack made a whole bunch of videos. Other YouTubers came out claiming they were tortured trying to film a video.&nbsp;</p><p>All these controversies grew on top of each other to the point that when the first season of The Beast Games came out, I <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-chaos-1235217834/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>reported</u></a> that the crew members were treated very poorly. They were underfed, they were overworked. One crew member I spoke with was hit by a 200 lb piece of wood that fell on his neck, causing him to fall backward and hit his head with blood shooting out of his mouth. He is still recovering. His left side doesn’t work very well. When he was in the hospital, a MrBeast executive offered him $1,000 in Uber Eats and DoorDash gift cards as a way to make amends.</p><p>In general, all those controversies didn’t really mean much. MrBeast was sort of able to just continue posting content and wave it all away with a law firm investigation into the company that found, yeah, there was some bad stuff, but overall they did their best. You’ve gotta remember that MrBeast for a while was just a bunch of teenagers running around and doing wild stuff. Now it’s a major corporation that has just hired a bunch of executives from Shopify and NBC to try to change their image, and it’s clearly working. I would say if Ms Rachel is for the really young kids, MrBeast is for the young kids. Scandals are now unimportant when looking at MrBeast, because they didn’t really stick.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-independence-day-ship-build-2000646306</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-built-the-independence-day-ship-in-no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-and-it%E2%80%99s-as-terrifying-as-it-is-awesome.1361323/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since <i>No Man’s Sky</i>’s Voyagers update, players have been obsessed with making some incredible ships. And with the help of some mod tools, the most daring of ship builders out there are pushing the boundaries of Hello Games’ procedurally created universe. One of the most impressive demonstrations I’ve seen of this yet is this <i>NMS</i> player’s tribute to <i>Independence Day</i>.</p>    <p>Built by Vilxir, this build is reminiscent of his epic, and perhaps equally terrifying, <i>No Man’s Sky</i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-death-star-star-wars-2000635367">Death Star I highlighted last month</a>. Like the Death Star before it, Vilxir’s <i>Independence Day </i>“Destroyer” leveraged the power of open-source 3D modeling software Blender and the handy <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/984">Base Builder mod</a> that allows users to import 3D models from Blender into <i>No Man’s Sky</i>.</p>

 <p>While <i>NMS</i>’ in-game ship-building tools can produce incredible results, Vilxir tells me that the ability to use Blender is a game-changer, “Blender has opened up an entirely new level of creativity for me. It lets me make things I genuinely didn’t think were possible in <i>NMS</i>, so huge shoutouts to the creators of the Blender Plugin and the Base Editor.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646307" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646307"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646307">© Screenshot: Hello Games / Vilxir</figcaption></figure> <p>The Destroyer took about four hours to build, according to Vilxir. One of the most interesting challenges? Nailing the dome-like flying saucer structure of the <i>Independence Day </i>ship. “Anyone who’s made a dome in <i>No Man’s Sky</i> or worked with Blender spheres knows the pain,” he told me. “You get merged pieces, overlaps, and a bumpy surface. To get something closer to a smooth dome, I had to build it in individual layered rings instead of using a single sphere.”</p>

 <p>Impressive though it may be, the ship isn’t finished. Vilxir now has his sights set on building out the interior of the ship, but he’s not looking to crash anyone’s console or PC with aggressively complicated ship architecture. “I’m aiming for something optimized for performance and fun, especially if I share it publicly,” he said. “Right now my plan is to build dedicated spaces for the core, the hangar, and a command deck. I also want to experiment with making a separate Corvette that acts as a small fleet of the fighter ships that Will Smith and the others flew in the movie.”</p> <p>Vilxir’s reign of building impressive ships to stalk the procedurally generated vacuum of Hello Games’ galaxy won’t conclude with the Destroyer. “For the next big project,” he told me, “I’m considering tackling Thanos’ Sanctuary II, or the Crimson Dawn ‘First Light’ yacht from <i>Solo</i>. I’ve also thought about the Lucrehulk battleship from <i>The Clone Wars</i>. My goal is to build ships that nobody has tried yet, or that hasn’t been done at this level of detail.”</p>

<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is coming sooner than some might think.</p>



<p>As first mentioned on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQeluxqHMIE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest episode</a> of Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast, Insider Gaming has learned when the remake of the 2003 action-adventure game is set to release.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-releasing">When Is Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Releasing?</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson has regularly reported that Ubisoft’s plans called for the Prince of Persia remake to release prior to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake</a>. And, as of publish, that remains the case.</p>



<p>According to sources close to the game, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is <strong>scheduled to release in mid-January 2026</strong>. In addition to the release plan, sources believe it’s likely that the next look at the game will come at The Game Awards on December 11, 2025. That’s always where the official date could be revealed.</p>



<p>First announced back in 2020, the Sands of Time Remake has had an up and down development cycle. It was originally scheduled to release in January 2021 but was delayed to March 2021 in December 2020. A month before its March release, the game was delayed again to an unspecified date.</p>



<p>After that, Ubisoft went silent for a while until it was announced that development was being moved to Ubisoft Montreal in May 2022. When Ubisoft Montreal took over, development on the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was completely restarted</a>. The restart included a more ““realistic approach” to the game, including a graphical overall, new animations, and new mechanics for both combat and parkour. </p>







<p>Another two years later, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-joins-development-on-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Toronto had joined</a> the development and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the game was planned</a> for a 2026 release.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Developer Roblox Corporation recently introduced a new face-scanning feature as a way to increase child safety protection on its game creation platform, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a>. CEO David Baszucki is very excited about this initiative, giving some rather intense and questionable answers during a new podcast episode about the age-gating technology.</p><p>Baszucki sat down with The New York Times journalists Casey Newton and Kevin Roose for an episode of their Hard Fork podcast. Posted on November 21, the three engaged in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wide-ranging conversation</a> that started with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-will-try-harder-to-keep-kids-from-talking-to-strangers/1100-6536311/" data-ref-id="1100-6536311">the face-scanning feature</a>, moved to misnomers about data, and peaked at disgreements regarding the use of AI for moderation. Newtown opened with an inquiry about the problem with predators on Roblox, which Baszucki said is a good and bad dilemma.</p><p>"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well," he said. "How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together? How do we build the future of communication at the same time? So we, you know, we’ve been, I think in a good way, working on this ever since we started. And when we were--this was almost 18 or 19 years ago--when we first launched the company and we had just four of us sitting in a room, we were literally the moderators, like we would rotate all the time."</p><p>Baszucki continued, saying that with the scale Roblox has grown to, the company decided that "the latest tech" (that is, "using facial age estimation with A.I.") is what it's looking toward to complement its moderation tools with. He mentioned text filters as one example, particularly since chatters tend to use "hashtag, hashtag, hashtag" and other keyword tricks to bypass the system.</p><p>"With A.I., these filters have gotten better and better," Baszucki said. "The state of where we are now is primarily getting into the blocking of adversarial attempts to broach the filter, and adversarial attempts to try to share PII [personally identifying information], which we're getting better and better at as well. On the age estimation, it's just--I would say--recently come of age to the point where we would complement it. But I would say our strategy is always [to] complement with whatever technology is out there to put that together."</p><p>Before long, the three were interrupting each other, interjecting statements and questions to get a leg up. Baszucki "categorically rejected" the assertion in recent lawsuits claiming predators use Roblox to find kids. He said the platform is doing "an incredible job at innovating" when compared to other online social platforms, repeating that the company is "constantly getting better" at protecting kids' ability to chat in-game.</p><p>"There's enormous benefits for having people be able to communicate, and we think we see those benefits," Baszucki explained. "There's a lot of kids who find their peeps on Roblox. There are a lot of kids when they're lonely or isolated actually--I'm not going to use it as an excuse or anything--but I get a lot of calls from famous parents who said, 'Look, my kid would be dead if it were not for finding a community on a platform like Roblox to stay connected with.' And I would also say we do take it as an enormous responsibility to design for not the sophisticated parent who goes in and says, 'Look, I'm going to turn off who you can chat to and all of that.' We have to design for all parents and think through that. But we do believe we have enormously great technology up and down the stack. We think it's part of building an experience like this. You know, if you go out there in the gaming space, I think it is very common to support communication. I'm not going to list any other games. And typically, we are way beyond in, I'd say, our innovation level, responsibility level, on both the filtering, on the image sharing, on all of these things."</p><p>After more tense exchanges around the 150 million daily active users--which Baszucki claimed is now "self-reported [to be] almost two-thirds over 13"--Roose asked about <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hindenburg Research's October 2024 findings</a> on the company allegedly disregarding child safety in the name of profits. He deflected, instead opting to focus on the fact that the activist fund "went out of business for some reason" and asked the hosts if they've researched that information themselves. He then responded by saying that AI is making everything better.</p><p>"So it's really interesting, because I think we're diving into a situation where we're getting better, better, better," Baszucki said. "But would you ask the same situation of someone who converted from maybe hypermanual labor making cars by hand to an assembly line? The assembly line might be infinitely better and at the same time not have so many people. So, I think what they're referring to is moving more and more and more and more to A.I. Arguably, is it better to have A.I. systems reviewing every image, every piece of text, all of that, or to keep doing that manually? So I think that was a misnomer. And I think if you interview anyone in our safety team or safety systems, that would be just part of making our systems better."</p><p>It's at this point that Baszucki's mood became a little flustered--though not "frustrated," as he said on multiple occasions--as he apparently went around high-fiving Newton and Roose for "aligning" with the company's decision to use AI tools for content moderation and "supporting our Roblox decision matrix."</p><p>"Is this a stealth interview where actually you love everything we’re doing and you’re here to stealthily support it?" He asked the hosts, later adding that he's "excited to talk." </p><p>"I thought we were going to be talking about fun, funny things in the industry and all of that," Baszucki said. "So I'm not frustrated, I’m just kind of figuring out how much fun time I have with you guys and how much fun time we have versus kind of this superfocus. But I'm happy to talk about whatever you guys want."</p><p>Something fun that Baszucki started talking about was a hypothetical "prediction market inside Roblox" that Roose tossed out. A "terrible idea," Roose thought, he wondered if the company would ever consider letting children place bets with the Robux in-game currency." Baszucki called it a "brilliant idea" he loves.</p><p>"I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal," he said. "And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it."</p><p>In the end, Baszucki seemed adamant in defending the fact that Roblox's content moderation tools are ever-evolving, pointing to text filtering in the past and face-scanning in the present as ways the company cares for the safety of its user base.</p><p>Roblox Corporation has come under intense scrutiny in recent months following a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">June 2024 Bloomberg investigation</a> that revealed the platform is rampant with predators. States like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/florida-ag-alleges-roblox-is-a-predator-breeding-ground-opens-investigation/1100-6535594/" data-ref-id="1100-6535594">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/texas-sues-roblox-over-child-exploitation-and-grooming-concerns/1100-6536037/" data-ref-id="1100-6536037">Texas</a> have sued for what lawmakers say is the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/" data-ref-id="1100-6533929">not doing enough to protect kids</a> from child exploitation and grooming.</p><p>Whether or Roblox or not, the problem with child predators is beginning to reach a fever pitch. According to the European law enforcement agency Europol, European society is seeing a sharp rise in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/children-are-weaponized-through-online-games-to-commit-murder-europol-claims/1100-6536430/" data-ref-id="1100-6536430">criminal networks weaponizing children</a> to commit violent crimes.</p>

      <p>On October 28th, 2025, Aftermath had a party, and you were all there.</p><p>Okay, not <em>all</em> of you were there—but on a Tuesday night in October, nearly a hundred Aftermath fans went to a venue in Queens to celebrate the site, hang out, and eat cake. It was the biggest party I’ve ever thrown and an incredible success. Hopefully, attendees have put their exclusive Aftermath stickers somewhere special.</p><p>Despite the fact that no one other than me and one very enthusiastic couple danced (shout out to y’all!),&nbsp; being at this party was one of the best nights of my life. I kept saying to my husband “I feel like it’s my birthday.” I could barely talk to people because so many people kept coming up to us to say how much they love our website and how much our work has touched their lives. The energy in the room was infectious; I felt like I was walking on a cloud.</p><p>The Aftermath Party was all the more special because of the people who helped us bring it together. Thanks to TV Eye, the venue in Ridgewood that housed us. Thank you also to Rudy’s Bakery for baking the lovely chocolate cake that we all enjoyed. Thank you to DJs Janus Rose, Alien D and Actuator—I truly wish that more people had danced, because these sets were incredible. And especially thank you to <a href="https://decristophoto.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Carmen DeCristo</u></a>, our photographer for the night.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>All photos by Carmen DeCristo</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure><div></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>All photos by Carmen DeCristo</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>And also, thank <em>you </em>for coming to the Aftermath Party.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>On the heels of releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-title-update-1-1-2-0-new-map-aim-assist-change/">the second major update</a> to Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">in its Season 1 roadmap</a>, EA will let players who haven't yet bought into Battlefield this year try it out for themselves with a week-long free trial of the game's classic multiplayer, specifically its flagship All-Out Warfare.</p>



<p>The free trial will kick off on November 25, 2025, and last for a full week until December 2, 2025. Players will be able to play five different game modes across three maps, including the two most recently released maps, Blackwell Fields and Eastwood.</p>



<p>"<em>From November 25 to December 2, ultimate all-out warfare is free for everyone</em>," a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-california-resistance-mid-season-roadmap">blog post on the Battlefield 6 website reads</a>. "<em>Fight in intense urban combat on the streets of Cairo. Drop into iconic SoCal landscapes turned into battlegrounds on Eastwood and Blackwell Fields. Enter Battlefield's iconic massive scale warfare</em> <em>in Conquest or Breakthrough</em>."</p>



<p>The free trial goes live less than two weeks after the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which is reportedly missing the mark when it comes to commercial sales, according to early sales reports. In the EU specifically, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">Black Ops 7 was 63% behind the first week EU sales for Battlefield 6</a>.</p>

The Witch is notable since the class originally showed up in The Void as playtest material. This means there is precedent for other material to make the jump to official material such as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-playtest-material-messes-with-monstrous-transformation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">monstrous transformations</a> or the <em>Daggerheart</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/darrington-drops-new-daggerheart-blood-hunter-playtest-material" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Blood Hunter</a>, appearing in a more horror-adjacent supplement down the line.</p>

<p><em>Daggerheart: Hope &amp; Fear</em> will be available in two versions. The standard edition is a normal printing of the book. The deluxe edition will sport a variant cover and additional accessories. If you pre-order either version, you will receive a PDF copy two weeks before the book's full release. Both versions of the book are expected to ship Summer 2026.</p>

<p>Daggerheart has had a major impact in the TTRPG space. In addition to strong reviews and sales, the game has garnered a lot of industry talent, including former <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> designers Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford, Eberron creator Keith Baker, and <em>Phoenix Dawn Command</em> designer Jenn Ellis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the game's cultural impact has only continued to expand. This can be seen with its recent collaboration with the miniature printing platform, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hero-forge-launches-new-collaborator-collections-series-featuring-daggerheart" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hero Forge</a>, and the runaway success of the <em>Daggerheart</em> conversion of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-of-drakkenheim-daggerheart-triumphs-on-kickstarter-hitting-funding-goal-in" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em></a>.</p>

<p>The standard edition of <em>Daggerheart: Hope &amp; Fear</em> is available at an MSRP of $39.99 not including shipping. The Deluxe Edition, which includes Fear tokens, 10 d12s, a GM screen, and a giant d20, is available for $119.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>I spent several hours over the past weeks trying to think of a single remake that’s comparable to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D Remake</span></i><span>, and I couldn’t. I thought about 2023’s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 </span></i><span>remake, which changes the controls, the tone, and even the content of 2005’s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4</span></i><span>. However, I could still use my knowledge of the original game to progress through the remake, which for the most part I can’t with </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i><span>. I thought about </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake</span></i><span>, which dramatically overhauls the core systems of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span> and changes the narrative in ways that deliberately play with fan expectations. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i><span>, however,</span> <span>clearly </span><i><span>does </span></i><span>want to be recognized as the first two </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games, not as a riff or commentary on them, as it primarily adds to each game’s overarching story rather than changing it outright.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Even 2024’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</span></i><span> is a tangibly different beast than this, as it still generally adhered to the NES-era storytelling of its source material in ways that </span><i><span>I+II</span></i><span> do not. I realized my best point of comparison for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>was actually movies like </span><i><span>Clueless </span></i><span>(1995) and </span><i><span>10 Things I Hate About You </span></i><span>(1999). Those adaptations are directly based on the works of Austen and Shakespeare respectively, but they are not bound to those works. Instead, they are movies made unapologetically for the audiences of their time, treating their source material as an outline to follow rather than something to “remake.” </span><i><span>Clueless </span></i><span>is a more interesting flick if you’ve read </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>and can compare the two works. However, if you told someone “I’ve experienced </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>because I watched </span><i><span>Clueless</span></i><span>,” they’d tell you to at least pretend to read </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>like everyone else who sleepwalked their way to a Bachelor of Arts in English.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>is similarly disinterested in recapturing the essence of the first two </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games. As a package it instead strikes me as more akin to a modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>game, with enough retro sensibilities to appeal to fans of Square Enix’s greater “HD-2D” catalogue (like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-gacha-champions-continent-remake-1851787459"><i><span>Octopath Traveler</span></i></a> <span>or the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/philabieldia-switch-nintendo-direct-elliot-jrpg-1851787431"><i><span>The Adventures of Elliot</span></i></a><span>). Given that these two games have seen countless remakes that mainly iterate on 1993’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I &amp; II</span></i><span> for the Super Famicom, a more transformative take on these classics feels overdue. But </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>rides such a fine line between honoring its source material and reinventing it for the modern era that I’ve found myself completely changing the way I even look at the two games it’s based on. To explain what I mean by that, we’ll have to look at these games next to their former counterparts and answer a simple, yet overwhelming question: What even is </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>?</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646279" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646279"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646279">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest I</em>: The bones are the RPG</b></h2> <p><span>The first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, released in Japan in 1986, is sometimes called “the first RPG.” However, that isn’t really true. Series like </span><i><span>Wizardry</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Ultima</span></i><span> were already several games deep by the mid 80s, and gamers in Japan could enjoy region-exclusive hits like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-arpg-review-guide-1851684251"><span>Falcom</span></a><span>’s </span><i><span>Dragon Slayer</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>The Black Onyx</span></i><span> on PC about two years before </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> debuted. The real claim to fame of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> isn’t </span><i><span>inventing</span></i><span> the video game RPG, but distilling this mouse-and-keyboard genre into a form that could fit on the more mainstream Famicom. It’s objectively not the first Japanese RPG, but it is arguably the first “jRPG.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As a result, the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>boils down to an exceedingly simple loop: fight monsters, buy equipment, level up. If you cross a bridge and die to strong monsters, do something else to get stronger. Talk to townsfolk, gather hints to find key items, and eventually you will reach the final boss. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>hones in on a gradual power fantasy, one in which time invested translates directly into strength gained. These mechanics aren’t a result of the RPG genre freshly emerging out of its primordial goo. Rather, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> is a statement about RPGs as a whole—strip the genre to its most essential parts, and this is what you get.</span></p>

 <p><span>To this day, that loop of “do an activity, level up, repeat” that drives RPGs remains the basis of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-d4-loot-reborn-season-4-helltide-1851482897"><span>major video game franchises</span></a><span>. You can even find </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3127000/Splintered/"><span>brand new games</span></a><span> that specifically iterate on the look and feel of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, simply because the core formula is still compelling. The remakes and remasters of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> have only homed in on that fundamental loop harder, with rebalanced EXP and Gold gains that get players to that sweet dopamine rush of leveling up even faster. The most recent mobile versions of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> even highlight the location of key items, nullifying that aforementioned element of hint gathering to get players back to grinding slimes and skeletons until they’re strong enough to overcome their next obstacle.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ll be honest, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-games-where-to-start-guide-1851700491/5"><span>I’m a sucker for these iterations of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i></a><span>. It’s now a concise RPG that you can start after breakfast and finish before dinner, which is a refreshing change of pace for a genre associated with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-part-3-remake-length-how-long-2000637274"><span>wildly long runtimes</span></a><span>. The game can feel tough, especially for kids who were expecting a </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span>-like experience after getting it from </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/24/15410710/dragon-quest-heroes-ii-square-enix-japan-us-release"><span>a Nintendo Power giveaway</span></a><span>. But once you learn the basic rules, I’d say </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is just as soothing as it is epic (by 1986 standards, anyway). Meanwhile, “soothing” is the last word I’d use to describe </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646280"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646280">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</em>: So are the worms</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> separates itself from its source material right after you select “new game.” Following a series of cutscenes that introduce a few major characters, the hero embarks on a quest that is not driven by accruing strength, but by traveling to set locations to advance the plot. This is now a story-driven game, and the story it tells is practically the antithesis of the original game’s loop. You are not a mighty warrior embarking on a power fantasy. You are alone in a world devoid of hope, where death and defeat are always a breath away.</span></p> <p><span>These feelings permeate the combat of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>. In the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, battles are quick 1vs1 skirmishes in which your actions typically consist of attacking, casting a spell, or healing.” In </span><i><span>HD-2D Remake</span></i><span>, the hero now faces full groups of enemies at once. This pushes you into the role of the wary tactician, perpetually one bad turn away from defeat. Battles are now drawn out affairs in which individual enemies can attack multiple times per turn as if to reinforce how heavily the deck is stacked against you. If an enemy scores a single critical hit on you, a game over is likely to soon follow.</span></p>  <p><span>To compensate, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>now lets you utilize a plethora of modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>spells and abilities. In the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, the hero learns ten spells in total. By the time I finished </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>, the hero had forty-seven. Weapons and armor now boast unique properties, a far cry from the static stat increases of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. Even in regular encounters, I found myself swapping my equipment nearly every turn to exploit weaknesses and optimize my elemental resistances. And </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-how-to-beat-lu-bu-chapter-2-1851765372"><span>lest you think I’m just doing hard mode things</span></a><span>, this is all on the default normal difficulty!</span></p>

 <p><span>The irony of these new battle mechanics is that they do feel retro-inspired, just not in a way that’s specifically faithful to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. There’s a heavy emphasis on dice rolls, where a single status effect landing on either side can single-handedly determine the outcome of combat. Missing an attack with a whip on a group of enemies feels crushing. Enemies spam instant death moves as frequently as they would in a proper full-party </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. Were it not for this remake’s generous autosave system, dungeon exploration would probably feel tense in a way hardcore dungeon crawlers often do, but the cheery, inviting </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>series typically does not.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646281">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest</em> 0.2 – A Fragmentary Passage</b></h2> <p><span>You may be wondering how one could make a story-driven version of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, a game that has virtually no story. The answer, of course, is to write an almost entirely new story that integrates the major beats of the NES classic. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D Remake</span></i><span> is completely treated as a sequel to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span>. Plot elements that only appeared in that third game now take the forefront here and completely recontextualize the story. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>originally spent a lot of time talking about the heroic deeds of the first Erdrick. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> proclaims that you </span><i><span>know </span></i><span>the first Erdrick, and it spends the entirety of its 15-hour run time acting as a bridge between </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>In fulfilling this role, the tale of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> becomes somewhat darker than it has seemed in past incarnations. Princess Gwaelin, once the prototypical damsel-in-distress, is now blessed with powers, though they’re still insufficient against the villainous Dragonlord, costing the lives of her protectors before she is flung into a dungeon where she is psychologically tortured. At least one named character dies in a demon attack that feels as cruel as it is pointless. The soldiers who escape with their lives are broken by their helplessness, wondering what they can possibly do to defend against the powers that could target their loved ones next.</span></p> <p><span>Through these threads, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> focuses on one of the oldest themes in jRPG history: don’t give up hope. The solution for many of these struggles isn’t to go out and take on the world without aid; instead, people move forward by focusing on what they </span><i><span>can </span></i><span>do, which in turn creates the conditions for the hero to succeed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“… You’re only one person. You can’t keep the whole world safe single-handedly,” a character tells the hero after her village wards off a deadly invasion. “We can’t give in to fear. If we run, then what happened to us will happen to others. The world won’t be safe. So we have to be strong. And we have to keep going.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This is where I feel </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> strains a bit in its identity as, well, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. In </span><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145759/masaaki-hayasaka-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-interview-gamescom"><span>an interview with </span><i><span>Shacknews</span></i></a><span>, remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka discusses how the team originally pitched series creator Yuji Horii on the idea of giving the hero more party members. However, according to Hayasaka, Horii was adamant that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>remain a solo adventure, stating “… </span><i><span>Dragon Quest 1</span></i><span> is a story about one man’s adventure, one journey, and it’s the history of the series.” This is a true statement about the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but it is not true of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest HD-2D</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> is very much </span><i><span>not </span></i><span>one man’s journey. It’s the story of people coming together to ward off a fearsome, overwhelming evil. It’s a celebration of small victories, like a father realizing that he can be a hero just by defending his family. It’s a game about a princess doing what she can to protect her kingdom, and it legitimately feels awkward that she doesn’t become a party member when she outright asks to join the hero. Frankly, more companions could have smoothed out some of the rough edges in this remake’s modernized combat system too, as it’s clearly designed for a full party.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I’m not here to argue with Yuji Horii about a video game that he made in the 1980s. It’s just that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> is not that game. I can’t state enough that I love the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, and I sincerely recommend that you find the time to play any past iterations of the game if </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D </span></i><span>was your first exposure to it. Yet as I watched the credits roll, I found myself curious about the vision Hayasaka’s team had in mind when they pitched the idea of adding more party members. Could we have seen a deeper relationship blossom between the hero and Gwaelin outside the “love at first sight” premise of the original? Is there a world in which Robbin ‘ood could have worked as a playable character? I find these possibilities much more interesting than the idea that the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest must </span></i><span>be a solo journey, especially when virtually everything else about it has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That said, I’ll admit that limiting the game to one party member gives greater thematic significance to the second game in this package.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646282">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure>  <p><span>After all my passion for the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, forgive me if I don’t sound as enthusiastic about </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>. I didn’t play it as a kid, and most of the western hemisphere seems to hold it in relatively low regard. </span><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/142844/dragon-quest-games-ranked-list"><span>It routinely ranks at the bottom of mainline </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>rankings</span></a><span>, though these same rankings often clarify that the writers don’t outright hate the game. In my opinion, it’s missing the strong hook that would have made it distinct from the other mainline games. The first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> is a less technically impressive game, but its simplicity gives it a lasting charm that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>lacks.</span></p> <p><span>One look at Japan in 1987, however, paints a very different picture. In </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512112519/http://www.1up.com/features/koichi-nakamura-interview-console-rpg"><span>an archived interview with </span><i><span>1Up</span></i></a><span>, Chunsoft founder Koichi Nakamura describes how he “was very confident that [the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>] was going to become a hit.” However, he was disappointed with how the first game initially sold, as he was “expecting it to be a bigger hit.” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>was actually the breakout success that would eventually lead to the series spawning </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-quest-spawned-an-urban-myth"><span>wild rumors about Japan declaring a holiday whenever a </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> game is released</span></a><span>. According to Nakamura, “once [</span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>] was out in stores, it created a huge panic — the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>panic — everybody wanted </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, and the stores all sold out.”</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s fitting, as </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>introduces much of the flavor that would define </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>beyond “it’s kind of like </span><i><span>Ultima </span></i><span>I guess.” The player now commands a party that must contend with swarms of foes in strategic combat. The world is vast in scope, going so far as to include the island of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>as a small slice of its map. The journey spans multiple granular arcs that balance drama with whimsy. If the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is the core of the turn-based RPG, then </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>is the core of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>as a series.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>also released in a notably unfinished state. In </span><a href="https://shmuplations.com/dragonquestii/"><span>a 1987 interview</span></a><span>, Yuji Horii describes how the development team had to scramble to balance the game, which ultimately delayed the game’s release. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>was also designed with more elaborately drawn cutscenes in mind, but those had to be cut due to memory limitations. Items were wholesale removed from the game, leaving some treasure chests empty. Even the ending was cut down to size; Horii originally entertained the idea of having the Prince of Cannock sacrifice himself during the final battle, which would lead to the Princess of Cannock murdering the protagonist out of revenge for her lost brother. I don’t think that would have been a </span><i><span>good </span></i><span>idea, but it definitely is an idea!</span></p>

 <p><span>The point is, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>comes across as a game whose narrative ambitions outstripped what was feasible at the time. It’s been remade about as many times as the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, which has afforded its makers many opportunities to fix any lingering balance issues (ask your local NES gamer about </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/183zlyr/the_final_section_of_dragon_quest_2_is_making_me/"><span>what the final act of the game was like</span></a><span>). However, </span><a href="https://www.realmofdarkness.net/dq/snes-dq2-differences/"><span>aside from altering some dungeon layouts and introducing some extra stuff to interact with</span></a><span>, none of these remakes have punched up the content of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>to better match that original vision. Keep in mind that its sequel, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span>, received a massive overhaul</span> <span>when it was remade on the Super Famicom way back in 1996, with new items, core mechanics, and content that </span><a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Dragon_Warrior_III/Versions"><span>would mostly carry forward to its subsequent remakes</span></a><span>. The precedent was there for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>to get a glow up, but it never got one, until now.</span></p> <p><span>For this reason, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span> feels much more impressive than its predecessor in this package, even though the two games were treated virtually identically by Masaaki Hayasaka’s team. It too is very different from what it previously</span> <span>was, but it also feels closer in spirit to what </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>has always aspired to be.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646283">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake</em>: Party like it’s 1999ish</b></h2> <p><span>As you might expect, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> is also now a story-driven game. While the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>mostly treated the player’s party as observers traversing through the world, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D </span></i><span>makes the protagonists active participants in the unfolding events. The characters now discuss events at length that passed in mere seconds in the original game, and we get our fair share of “you couldn’t sleep either?” conversations in which the cast can intimately discuss their feelings. It’s not quite a “modernized” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but it does more closely match the jRPGs of the SNES and PSX eras, rather than the NES one.</span></p> <p><span>By focusing more on the main characters, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> builds off of that feeling of hopelessness that pervades so much of its predecessor. Back on the NES, the Princess of Moonbrooke occasionally felt like the little sister who you had to let follow you so your mom wouldn’t get mad. She contributes to combat, but her lack of defenses and low level cap could make her a liability. In </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span>, not only is she an invaluable party member, she’s practically the beating heart of the entire cast. Hers is the only kingdom to be destroyed by the villain Hargon’s forces, so her sorrow and desire for revenge give a weight to the conflict that never existed before.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As the Prince of Cannock tells the protagonist, “The princess fights to exorcise the grief and anger that cloud her heart…We may never be able to soothe the Princess’s pain, nor replace her family, but perhaps we can offer her another.”</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> lingers on that sorrow for much of its early game, but something interesting happens as it progresses. In the original game, the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/PswoKohVx4Y?si=u8OBkuXwGhmUM656"><span>world map theme that plays at the start carries a melancholic tone</span></a><span>, riffing on the equivalent theme in the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. However, once the party of heroes is assembled, the theme changes to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPKbuxLwELs"><span>a happier, jaunty tune</span></a><span>, marking the moment as a sea change for the rest of the game. This remake’s narrative similarly shifts in tone as it progresses. That overwhelming darkness starts to feel surmountable in a way that wasn’t felt in </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>, and that theme of clinging to hope finally feels like it pays off.</span></p> <p><span>“But lately, I dream [of Moonbrooke’s destruction] no longer,” the Princess of Moonbrooke tells the protagonist later in their journey. “I dream instead of our time together. The meals we enjoy in one another’s company. The arguments. Even the battles. I once believed that the purpose of this journey was to see Hargon and his minions suffer as I have suffered. But I know now that this is not true. And I know this thanks to all of you.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646284" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646284"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646284">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The epic conclusion</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> isn’t just a <em>D</em></span><i><span>ragon Quest II </span></i><span>remake: it is the culmination of all the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest HD-2D</span></i><span> games. The villain Hargon has been built up and teased for two games now. It feels as if evil forces are a generational inevitability that can only be subdued rather than outright defeated. For someone who is freshly experiencing the first three </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games via these remakes, it might feel like this is just what </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is: Monsters endlessly returning time and again, like the villains of the week in an old </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Sentai"><span>Super Sentei</span></a><span> series.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> counterbalances this by showing how good works can become generational too. The heroes are regularly saved by relics of the past, like Princess Gwaelin’s pendant which both opens otherwise blocked paths and dispels enemy magics that confound the party. The legendary armaments crafted for the past Erdricks can also be found and used throughout this journey. The heroes of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> are younger than their heroic predecessors were when they faced generational evil, but the legacies of their ancestors give them the strength to do what couldn’t be done in the past: End this cycle once and for all.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>“It’s interesting to think that every generation between Erdrick and yourselves had its own heroes,” the party is told. “All those who came before you: your parents, your grandparents, your great-grandparents…All of them were heroes in their own right, if only because they kept Erdrick’s legend alive until you lot came along to repeat it.”</span></p> <p><span>This reframing of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> gives it a unique warmth in relation to the other HD-2D games. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span> technically has a party system, but it’s filled with generic mercenaries created by the player, so it still feels a bit lonely. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I</span></i><span>, as I described above, is a solo adventure despite this remake’s best efforts. So coming into </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span>, with its full party of developed characters, brings an end to those hours upon hours of isolation you feel by playing these games in this order.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646285"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646285">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Strength through unity</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> leans into this theme by adding the Princess of Cannock to the cast of playable characters for the first time in this game’s history. It’s a big departure from the original for sure, but given Yuji Horii’s original aspirations for the Princess to take a more prominent role, her inclusion feels appropriate. She doesn’t kill the protagonist (sorry, spoilers), but I think Horii would have agreed this direction is best even back in 1987. From a pure gameplay perspective, the Princess of Cannock is a major boon to the combat system. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>combat works best with a party of four, as this gives the player enough actions per turn to cast buffs and debuffs, and even to take a gamble on some status effects here and there.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Princess of Cannock also breathes new life into the party’s relationships with each other, offering fresh perspectives as the protagonists interact with the world. I can only describe </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> as overwhelmingly empathetic, with its heroes unifying the many peoples and species of the world with their kindness. Meanwhile, disorder notably divides the villains of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, with Hargon’s generals routinely sabotaging each other for personal gain. The Princess of Cannock mentions this outright, as it becomes a massive advantage the heroes can press over their enemies.</span></p> <p><span>“I am overjoyed! For I have seen that we can win!” the Princess of Cannock proclaims. “That victory over Hargon and his armies shall surely be ours! …There is no unity among the monsters. No harmony… Each is a law unto themselves. We, on the other hand, have made—and continue to make—allies of the people we meet.”</span></p> <p><span>These themes of hope may be new to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, but they’re not new to RPGs. Notably, however, they have gone out of vogue in recent years. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-games-are-giving-up-on-the-idea-that-we-can-save-1849727976"><span>As Michael Lee writes in his reflection on this very topic</span></a><span>, “The question video game narratives are asking has shifted from ‘How can we save the world?’ to ‘How do we live in the world we couldn’t save?’” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake</span></i><span> is modernized, but not so modernized to age itself out of this classic theme. The way it homes in on this concept makes it feel like an homage to the entire RPG genre as it evolved following the original release of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>back in 1987, and that story is exactly what we need in the present day.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646293"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646293">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The real <em>Dragon Quest</em> was inside you all along</b></h2> <p><span>Neither game in </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>is profound in ways I’ve never seen before. I can point to games with better stories, better battle systems, games that are better at whatever criteria we use to discuss a game’s quality. Yet I found myself regularly tearing up playing these games, even during banal moments that shouldn’t elicit an emotional reaction. These games aren’t facsimiles of what they were before. But as I interrogated that deep response I was routinely getting, I realized that’s the essence of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest—</span></i><span>simple, poetic adventures that give us the space to slow down and reflect on our lives, taking whichever shape will reach us in the moment.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>invites us not to look at this series as a set collection of rules and systems, but as classics that </span><i><span>should </span></i><span>speak to whichever time period they’re revisited in. After all, while the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is a great tutorial for how RPGs work, the modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>fan doesn’t necessarily need one of those. Homer’s </span><i><span>The Odyssey </span></i><span>probably wasn’t created to be forever discussed in academic settings. But whether it takes the form of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F"><span>the tale of escaped convicts in 1937 Mississippi</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic:_The_Musical"><span>a series of musical numbers that are covered and animated by internet denizens</span></a><span>, the story continues to resonate throughout society. Were </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>a fully modernized, 3D reimagining, we’d probably look at it as a new game totally detached from what it was before. But it maintains just enough of a retro sensibility to bring RPG fans back to the halcyon days of their youth, even if the core essence of these games has drastically shifted.</span></p> <p><span>As Tim Rogers says in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-xi-the-kotaku-review-1828646512"><span>his very in-depth and very good review of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest XI</span></i></a><span>, “</span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games are bedtime stories.” I don’t think I’m the only one for whom calming my ever-present anxiety enough to get eight actual hours of sleep has been a struggle for these past couple of years. There have been so many layoffs in the video game industry that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/layoffs"><span>it got its own tag on this very website</span></a><span>. The cost of living is unconscionably high. My own career as a writer has been completely and utterly slashed to unrecognizable shreds thanks to </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs/"><span>shortsighted media networks</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2025/04/14/the-60-problem---how-ai-search-is-draining-your-traffic/"><span>AI-driven algorithm changes</span></a><span>. How can someone dream of a joyful future when just surviving for the next six months is an overwhelming prospect? Where does one find the energy to take another step forward in a world that seems to detest their existence?</span></p> <p><span>In this mindset, it’s all too tempting to retreat into nostalgia, living in a fantasy of “the good old days” as our bodies age and our minds wither away. And for the RPG enjoyer, there is no more reliable comfort food in such times than </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. I find it moving to think that those most in need of the hope these games offer may come to them seeking to blot out the world by retreating into the nostalgic comfort they offer and perhaps instead find the courage to face the darkness enveloping their lives. A world in anguish is a world that can be united. Evil is not an inevitability that has to endlessly repeat. Maybe we aren’t Erdricks, but rather, we’re the people simply enduring, searching for our own small destinies as we bolster our heroes. The sun will rise again no matter how endless the night may feel, and it will be because the suffering that connects us is greater than the philosophies that divide us. Those who oppress us are too disordered and too selfish to overcome a force as powerful as that.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>is the bedtime story for the broken. It’s comfort for those who desperately need to find their strength again, a reminder that it’s okay to dream of a world where we’re surrounded by friends and we fight for a brighter future. What we get here is not </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I</span></i><span>, nor is it </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, but its connection to the original form of those games is not arbitrary. Rather, through this reinvention, I once again remember the promise expressed by the gameplay loop of the very first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>: Take your time and get stronger. Know when to fight another day if you encounter a challenge you cannot overcome. Talk to those around you. Gather hints and follow the clues. The road ahead may be fraught, and you may face defeat. But always remember the time you’ve invested is not wasted. Fight bravely and do not back down. Persevere, and you will finally win.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-hd2d-remake-review-is-it-good-2000646277]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Honkai: Star Rail</span></i><span> publisher HoYoverse’s next game seems to be less fantasy or sci-fi than psychological thriller—something more akin to Remedy Entertainment’s </span><i><span>Control</span></i><span> than Nintendo’s </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, which </span><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> was compared to when it was first released. Clearly a horror game, </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span> begins with a job application that may cause “slight discomfort.”</span></p> <p><span>HoYoverse announced the game on Thursday with a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NccLyRQQZY"><span>31-minute gameplay demo</span></a><span> showing the world of </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>, in which the player-character approaches a desk to join a mysterious organization called SEAL (Shadow Emergency Alliance) whose headquarters looks to be a government building that shifts and changes due to “disruption events” caused by mindrot. The gameplay demo has about 20 minutes in the SEAL building, followed by a lengthy driving segment before heading out into the field where the player battles shadowy monsters while dressed like Harley Quinn.</span></p>

  <p><span>“Upon entering Varsapura, the protagonist’s appearance shifts to match each viewer’s preferences,” HoYoverse wrote in the YouTube video’s description, perhaps explaining the outfit shift from sexy cop to DC villian-lookalike. “The origin of this parapsychological effect remains unknown.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span> is also HoYoverse’s first game using Unreal Engine 5; </span><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> was made in Unity. The game shares a similar vibe for its characters but the broader art direction is definitely more moody and distinct. HoYoverse’s usual cel-shaded look has been swapped for more realistic, three-dimensional textures—the characters and design look more similar to the company’s </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1833000/N0va_Desktop/"><span>Lumi character model from its desktop companion program Nova Desktop</span></a><span> than any of its previous games.</span></p> <p><span>There’s no information yet on its timeline for release. As of now, HoYoverse has three unreleased games in development: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/honkai-nexus-anima"><i><span>Honkai Nexus Anima,</span></i><span> a creature-collecting game</span></a><span>; </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/petit-planet"><i><span>Petit Planet</span></i><span>, a life simulator</span></a><span>; and the newly announced </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>. Beyond announcing the game, </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>‘s lengthy gameplay demo seems to be an ad to recruit developers: The video ends with all the different jobs HoYoverse is hiring for.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“</span><span>Hoyo literally said, ‘go get a job’ by a game,” one person joked on Instagram. </span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/uk-unveils-military-esports-games-in-alliance/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/uk-unveils-%E2%80%98military-esports-games%E2%80%99-in-alliance-with-40-countries.1361272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today, the International Defence Esports Games (IDEG) was unveiled in the United Kingdom. The initiative, which brings together ’40 allied nations’, endeavours to ‘sharpen the cyber skills that are critical for modern warfare’. This news comes mere months after the United Kingdom’s government moved to recognize esports as a ‘military sport’.</p>



<p>In a press release from the UK government, it was said that IDEG26, the inaugural tournament in the ecosystem, will take place next year and has been partially inspired by Ukrainian forces using drone simulator games to train operators in the field.</p>



<h2 id="h-from-the-battlefield-to-potentially-battlefield">From The Battlefield to (Potentially) <em><span>Battlefield</span></em></h2>



<p>It hasn’t yet been confirmed which games will serve as the foundation of the IDEG’s esports initiative, but it’s safe to assume it’ll be militaristic shooters, given the link.</p>



<p>Battlefield just got into the esports arena with a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-elite-series-announced-with-1-million-prize-pot/">$1 million REDSEC tournament</a>, so perhaps that could serve as a staging ground.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-launches-military-esports-games-to-boost-cyber-skills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> published by the UK government, the Minister for Veterans and People, Louise Sandher-Jones, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Strategic Defence Review has shown us clearly that the nature of war is changing, and we must change with it. The Government’s Plan for Change demands forces are ready for digital battlegrounds, where our personnel must be as skilled in cybersecurity and with controllers as they are in traditional combat.</p>



<p>Lessons from Ukraine have shown how gaming technology can train drone operators and develop the rapid decision-making skills essential for modern warfare. The International Defence Esports Games (IDEG) positions Britain at the forefront of this transformation, ensuring our armed forces are prepared for the conflicts of tomorrow.]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the statement, the Deputy Commander of Cyber and Specialist Operations Command said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The International Defence Esports Games represent a significant step forward in developing the cyber and digital skills essential for modern military operations. Lessons from conflicts including Ukraine have demonstrated the real-world value of gaming technology in training drone operators and enhancing cyber capabilities.</p>



<p>IDEG will strengthen our warfighting readiness whilst building crucial partnerships with allied nations who share our commitment to technological innovation in defence.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In October 2026, the first IDEG tournament will surface, taking place at the National Gaming and Esports Arena in Sunderland. As a hybrid event, it’ll also feature a cybersecurity, AI, and drone operations summit.</p>



<p>Do you think there are any concerns with this kind of vertical crossover? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hear me out: <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> isn’t a racing game, it’s an art tool with a racing game tacked on.</p><p>The game, out now for the Nintendo Switch 2, is the follow-up to the quirky Kirby-flavored kart racer released in 2003 on the GameCube. It features <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22823897/masahiro-sakurai-interview-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch"><em>Smash Bros.</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai</a>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo">round, pink, utterly charming</a> child participating in short races where the main feature isn’t so much about how fast you go, but how well you can manage the winding courses while fighting the cutest rogues’ gallery ever committed to polygons.</p><p>Unlike in other kart racers, <em>Air Riders</em> has no acceleration button. Instead you’re automatically propelled forward, requiring you to negotiate the track with the brake button that you can use to drift around corners. You can also use the brake to charge your kart (known as a “machine”) for an extra boost of speed at the expense of halting all forward momentum while you charge up.</p><p>To add another interesting wrinkle, <em>Air Riders </em>is stuffed with different kinds of machines with different properties. Those properties are not the kind of acceleration, braking, and handling stats that are common in, say, <em>Mario Kart</em>, but fundamentally change how the machine handles. The Swerve Star, for example, is super fast but can only change its direction while charging. As a result, it can’t gently glide along curves and turns, but instead ricochets across a course like a pinball. Meanwhile, the Bulk Star won’t accelerate if it’s not charged, but it makes up for the constant starting and stopping by being super fast and super tanky. In <em>Air Riders</em>, the machines have just as much personality as the racers, which brings me to my strange little declaration.</p><p>I haven’t done much racing in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> because I don’t wanna leave the damn vehicle customization screen. I was not expecting this cute little mashup of Sakurai’s pet projects — <em>Smash Bros.</em> and <em>Kirby</em> — to have such robust customization options, and it has completely dominated my time with it. More than just changing machine colors and adding the odd sticker, you can add different patterns and textures to your machine, both on the body and the boosters. There are different visual effects you can add to the trail your machine leaves in its wake. You can customize your Rider Cards that you show off while you race online with titles, backgrounds, pictures, borders, and more. Even the act of applying the cosmetics has an unexpected level of detail to it, allowing you to rotate, transform, and flip patterns and decals with fine precision to get anything you want in the right place just so.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Just an example of some of some of the things creators have done with machine customization.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></span></p></section><p>And if that weren’t enough, there’s also an online shop where players can upload their own creations that other players can buy. Better yet, it’s all done with currency earned in-game, which is refreshing when this kind of cosmetic expression is typically locked behind <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/have-live-service-games-gone-off-the-deep-end-with-insultingly-expensive-cosmetics/">microtransactions</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">gacha-game-like chance</a>. Naturally, <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-bikini-chef-kawasaki-custom-vehicle-2000646175">there have been issues,</a> but <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-custom-vehicle-designs-market-best-2000645836">the level of creativity</a> on display there speaks to just how incredible these customization features are.</p><p>I. Am. Obsessed.</p><p>After a couple of introductory races, I blew my entire stack of currency buying up stuff just to play with the customization tools. In fact, the only reason I race at all is to earn enough currency to go back, buy up more stuff, and play with them some more. I know I’m playing <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>incorrectly — but I’m having too much fun to care.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/826488/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-vehicle-customization]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Video game piracy, the common and controversial practice of copying and sharing games without paying for them, has its advocates. One of them was Anadius, a popular fixture in the <i>Sims</i> community for his “<i>Sim 4</i> Updater” tool which allowed users to pirate the game’s many expansions. I say “was,” because the fellow has gone dark, and in his wake, all that’s left is disappointment and disagreement over the state of the work he’s left behind.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All done! Have fun playing the game! 🙂</p> <p>— anadius (@anadius) <a href="https://twitter.com/anadius/status/1991539527018557494?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I decided to step down,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/comments/1p28a9o/comment/npveo2e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Anadius said</a> before pulling a Bilbo Baggins (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4-legend-behind-piracy-tool-rendering-nearly-usd1-500-of-dlc-totally-free-quits-town-and-takes-his-loot-with-em-players-pay-tribute-as-copycats-immediately-try-to-charge-for-alternatives/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). “Don’t pester my close friends, till the end I acted like an asshole I am and haven’t told them the reason why either.” His departure has sent shockwaves through the r/PiratedGames community and those who relied on his tools to play <i>The Sims 4</i>. But he didn’t take all of his toys with him; he left behind the source code for his work, enabling others to pick up the pieces and continue to sail the seven seas. Someone has already stepped in to do just that. Problem is, she’s locked these pirate tools up behind a paywall via Patreon.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Simmerella has shared the news on Patreon (free) that they'll be working on a *NEW* updater, and have been given all requireed files to make that happen.</p> <p>See their announcement below:<a href="https://t.co/Zks92KogfZ">https://t.co/Zks92KogfZ</a></p> <p>— GewoonIraj (@xLOLxLOLxIRAJx) <a href="https://twitter.com/xLOLxLOLxIRAJx/status/1991842574290583784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Popular <i>Sims 4</i> modder Simmerella took over Anadius’ work. But while some pirate communities are okay with paying a certain amount of money for access to troves of pirated material, this segment of the <i>Sims </i>community isn’t too thrilled, especially considering the fact that <a href="https://x.com/impekko/status/1991922291018698781?s=20">Anadius didn’t charge for his work</a>.</p> <p>There’s another potential wrinkle in all of this: the fact that Simmerella is using a popular funding platform to more or less sell piracy services. As <i>Sims</i> creator <a href="https://x.com/SimMattically/status/1991888537718018510?s=20">SimMattically put it</a> in an X thread documenting the community reaction to the news, “you have to put your legal name and pay taxes on your Patreon earnings lmfao bless [Simmerella] and good luck.”</p>

                <p>During an investor presentation earlier today, Ubisoft showed off Teammates, a new R&amp;D game experience that utilizes generative AI. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot also described the advent of generative AI in games as "a revolution."</p><p>"Generative AI is as big a revolution for games as the shift to 3D," said Guillemot (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results%20%20as%20the%20tech%20is%20embraced%20company%20wide" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>). "We are making great strides in applying Gen AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams... It's as big [of] a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D. And we have everything to lead on this front."</p><p>Teammates was developed by the team behind Neo NPC. The company also said that the demo is meant to prove that "generative AI-driven gameplay can shape a new generation of more interactive and engaging games."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608845-teammatessofiaandpablo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608845" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608845-teammatessofiaandpablo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608845"></a><figcaption>A screencap from Teammates.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608845-teammatessofiaandpablo.jpg"></figure><p>The game's prototype is currently being tested by a small number of players. Teammates is a first-person shooter, but its AI tools will supposedly let it adapt to voice commands from the player, allowing NPCs to dynamically respond in real-time.</p><p>"It's really about experimenting with entirely new ways of creating interactive stories," said the game's narrative director, Virginie Mosser. "Our role is to give AI meaning, to narrativize it, ensuring logic doesn’t replace soul. We designed Teammates to leave space for player creativity, finding that balance between emotion and unpredictability."</p><p>Teammates includes a companion character called Jaspar who is said to be able to help the player overcome obstacles and provide hints or strategies. In concept, that's not very different from other NPCs in numerous games. What supposedly makes Jaspar stand out is his ability to interact and respond directly to the player.</p><p>The Teammates devs note that it has a specially made Application Programming Interface (API) that can utilize guardrails that shield players from AI-powered hallucinations and "helps control its power to put it at the service of human creativity and play." The company also characterized Teammates as an experiment that "serves both as a playable prototype and a testbed for the underlying technology."</p><p>Ubisoft has stated that its new "Creative Houses" operating model will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-posts-strong-first-half-growth-and-teases-major-creative-shake-up-coming-in-2026/1100-6536414/" data-ref-id="1100-6536414">unveiled in January 2026</a>. Earlier this week, Ubisoft apologized to players for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-promises-to-replace-ai-art-found-in-anno-117-pax-romana/1100-6536293/" data-ref-id="1100-6536293">including AI artwork in Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>. The replacement image looks like the AI version, minus a few people with extra fingers or distorted faces.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>In my freshman year of college, a friend of mine convinced me to go to Saint Mark’s and impulse <a href="https://videogamesnewyork.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">buy an imported PSP</a> before it had launched in the States. This was generally bad financial advice, as it blew a gargantuan hole in what little disposable income I had at the time. But buying it felt fantastic, one of the first real things I had purchased as an adult who could vote, smoke, die in a war, but not yet legally drink. We then proceeded to go around the corner to a dingy and poorly lit Italian restaurant and played each other in the only game we had at the time, <em>Lumines: Puzzle Fusion</em>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmnMAzPx7jU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Lumines Soundtrack: SHININ'"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>SHININ'...my old friend.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t remember the meal, but I do remember the walls melting away and both of us being locked in silent combat for much of the duration of our time there. From that moment onward, the PSP became ”the machine that played <em>Lumines</em>.” <em>Lumines</em> came to represent that feeling of PlayStation  cool – the idea that video games were these things that young, fashionable adults in urban areas played, like the scene in <em>Hackers</em> where they go to the club and play a pre-vis version of <em>Wipeout</em> on a wall of CRTs. It was also a game that represented what rhythm games can and should be, a sublime melding of music and play, of performance and curation. Now, decades later, <em>Lumines Arise </em>returns when much of that feeling of gaming’s potential for being cool is largely absent. <em>Lumines Arise </em>is that feeling of 2000s cool unthawed, along with all it represented.</p><p>The original <em>Lumines </em>was the product of Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the man who introduced a generation of indoor internet kids to the concept of synesthesia with the game <em>Rez</em>. The player drops various configurations of 2x2 blocks in various configurations of two patterns, while a metronome line sweeps the stage. When the line sweeps through a solid color square, the square is eliminated. What differentiates <em>Lumines</em> from many other puzzle games is that it makes explicit the implicit rhythm and tonality of the format with different speeds and custom music. A stage in <em>Lumines </em>is bespoke, with everything synchronizing and pulses in perfect harmony.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3-TLvgz8mXA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Star Guitar by The Chemical Brothers | Lumines II"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>I kinda love that they just used the Michel Gondry video as the backdrop for this.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It has been well over a decade since we have gotten a <em>Lumines</em> game that was not some flavor of remake. In the void of new releases, Q Entertainment and subsequently Enhance (the company Mizuguchi would go on to found in 2014) went on to riff on similar puzzle-rhythm fusion concepts, the most notable recent release being <em>Tetris Effect. Tetris Effect </em>was a <em>Lumines</em>-themed mutant, with its immersive music and textural themes infecting the most storied and beloved puzzle series in history. But <em>Tetris Effect</em> always had to be a <em>Tetris</em> game first and foremost, a quality that confined what it could do as a synesthetic experience, and on some level it felt like a dry run for the inevitability of <em>Lumines Arise</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>I can confirm that this looks sick in VR.

The textures of individual tile dyads shift between stages; on one stage they take the shape of jarringly vivid fruits and vegetables, on another they are droplets of water and jellyfish. The dropping, clearing and twisting of each block sync harmoniously with the song in the background, one stage in particular being flanked by giant raving chameleons.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Burst mechanic is new and gives you breathing room to create a single, giant block. Credit: Enhance</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sets of stages in <em>Lumines</em> blend in with one another like an album or a DJ set. Like<em> Tetris Effect </em>before it, it is one of the better showcases for VR as a format, as the immersion of being fully swaddled in a space and surrounded by whirling particles gels perfectly with the game’s thesis of synesthesia and connection. You are meant to be locked in, senses blending in seamlessly with one another. But while the boutique VR experience that I dusted off my Valve Index for was nice, <em>Arise</em> is also a fantastic fit for portable gaming. It now has a permanent home on my Steam Deck in much the same way my PSP always had <em>Lumines: Puzzle Fusion.</em></p><figure><figcaption><span>Transitions between stages are shifting and intricate. Credit: Enhance</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are times where the sheer noise of the default blocks can be a bit overwhelming. This is especially noticeable if you compare <em>Arise</em> to the original PSP classic, a game whose tiles were fairly clean and legible, steeped in the exact Y2K design sensibility you’d expect from a PSP puzzle game in 2004. That said, <em>Arise</em> also has a solid accessibility menu, allowing you to dial in the experience to fit different forms of color blindness and reduce the severity of particles. There are also spider and snake filters, which is a nice inclusion because I’m sure those levels in particular would be mildly terrifying to me if I had that phobia.</p><p>The music selection is apropos in <em>Arise</em>, a lot of bumping techno and a bunch of pop tracks crossing a variety of genres. The electronic music in these games is more strongly curated, and there’s at least one hip hop track in Event 7 that I just straight up don’t like. If I was more jaded I would say a few of the vocal tracks are corny, but I am old enough to also find them charming. They also contain a wisp of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/amazingthew.bsky.social/post/3m5ju6dzho22c?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">earnestness</a> that is fundamental to the game’s premise of connection and that is inseparable from the mentality that this game is culturally downstream of.</p><figure><figcaption><span> Later stages can get hectic. Credit: Enhance </span></figcaption></figure><p>It is that commitment to earnestness that I find so refreshing. I do not need to explain to you how cynical the world is. Art these days feels self-aware and too clever by half, unable to let its guard down to say something from the heart. <em>Lumines Arise</em> feels unstuck in time, like a memory of a dinner with an old friend when you were younger and more naive, when the future stretched out infinitely, before you were crushed by the weight of just getting by. It<em> </em>is a reminder that the beauty of the world is still limitless and luminous, that even something as abstract and frivolous as a puzzle game can stir in you emotions that are wordless and perhaps divine.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-is-going-nuts-990-pro-2tb-ssd-going-for-pennies-when-you-buy-on-amazon-2000646246</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-is-going-nuts-990-pro-2tb-ssd-going-for-pennies-when-you-buy-on-amazon.1361218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Samsung 990 Pro 2TB is the <strong>best-seller among internal SSDs on Amazon this Black Friday</strong>, and that makes total sense given what you’re getting. Storage speed is the single greatest determinant of whether your computer feels snappy or sluggish, as fast SSDs eliminate boot delays, application loading, and file transfer bottlenecks. This drive delivers flagship performance at pricing that makes it the best value proposition in the SSD market right now. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/">has it down to $169 for Black Friday, down from $229</a>, which marks a record low that places professional-grade storage well within reach of anyone building or upgrading a PC.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>7,450 MB/s Read Speed Eliminates Storage Bottlenecks</h2>
<p>The s<strong>equential read speed of 7,450 MB/s</strong> represents the ceiling of what PCIe Gen 4 technology can do. You boot Windows in under 10 seconds, fire up applications in an instant, and transfer large files between drives in a matter of seconds-not minutes. In-game loading, when the game is loaded on this drive, is faster than on SATA SSDs or hard drives, with some titles eliminating loading screens altogether through DirectStorage support. It makes a big difference in day-to-day use, where everything from opening folders to extracting compressed files happens faster than you expect.</p>
<p><strong>Sequential write speeds reach 6,900 MB/s</strong> to handle large file creation and modification with ease. For video editors working with 4K or 8K footage, timeline scrubbing remains smooth, while render times significantly decrease. Content creators exporting large projects onto this drive find transfers complete in a fraction of the time that SATA drives normally would take.</p>



<p>The 2TB capacity allows for installing your OS, applications, and a substantial game library without relying on secondary storage. Modern games take up 50-150GB each, and with this capacity, you can store 15-40 titles depending on how large the files are. You keep the most played games installed and ready, instead of always having to reinstall and uninstall based on which one you want to play.</p>
<p>To achieve these speeds, the PCIe Gen 4 interface uses four lanes of bandwidth on compatible motherboards. The M.2 2280 form factor fits into the standard slots on modern motherboards without the need for adapters or special mounting hardware. This drive will work in older systems that have PCIe Gen 3 slots but will run at reduced speeds limited by that interface. Most motherboards from the past five years support PCIe Gen 4, making this drive compatible with the majority of current builds.</p>



<p>The <strong>thermal solution involves a heat spreader</strong> that radiates the heat during continuous operation. High-speed SSDs generate thermal energy during continuous intensive read and write operations, and proper cooling keeps performance within limits. The included spreader does its work quite effectively in most scenarios, but it’s even better with systems that have dedicated M.2 heatsinks or motherboard cooling solutions. The drive implements thermal throttling, which drops the speeds temporarily when temperatures exceed safe limits, ensuring hardware protection while continuing operation.</p>
<p>Drive management tools such as performance optimization, firmware updates, and health monitoring are available through<em> Samsung Magician</em> software. You manage remaining drive life, securely erase data, and optimize settings for different workloads. The software normally runs in the background, usually alerting you to firmware updates or potential issues before they can become a problem.</p>
<p>At $169, you get Samsung’s flagship SSD with PCIe Gen 4 speeds for 26% off, dropping pro performance down to the mid-range drive price class.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Full screen capabilities for playing Xbox on PC has been added to Windows 11. Furthermore, it’s available to all Windows Insiders with the latest preview.</p>







<p>These days, like the marketing says, everything is an Xbox. Many of the exclusives Microsoft has racked up, like Halo, Gears of War, and Forza make their way to PCs in many forms. Plus, with Game Pass Ultimate having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-game-pass-40-new-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Game Pass</a>, you can easily play any game with a simple tap. However, even with playing on PC, it never felt like a replacement for the seamless console experience. Well, that’s about to change with the latest update for Windows 11.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-screen-for-xbox-on-pc-available-to-windows-insiders-now-via-new-update">Full Screen for Xbox on PC Available to Windows Insiders Now via New Update</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/11/21/full-screen-experience-expands-to-more-windows-11-pc-form-factors-for-windows-insiders/?ocid=Platform_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Video_lrn_11.21.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog from Windows</a>, the team reveals that, along with Preview Build 26220.7271, <strong>Windows 11 is getting Full Screen support for Xbox</strong>. Now, you can easily switch between desktop and Xbox’s Full Screen Experience via the task bar or Win + Tab. When in full screen, your desktop will switch to the Xbox page and you can play any game without distractions. <strong>You can also have multiple open games at once and switch between them with your controller</strong>. </p>



<p>No date was given as to when everyone will get Full Screen for Xbox on Windows 11. Still, it is a pretty neat concept and one many people on the go will enjoy. If you don’t own Windows 11, there is the new ROG Xbox Ally, which brings your Xbox to a portable device. Now, with other games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved going to PS5</a>, you can pretty much play Xbox wherever and however you want.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-wanted-to-balance-pvp-tryhards/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-devs-always-wanted-balanced-pvp-to-avoid-%E2%80%98tryhards%E2%80%99.1361212/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new documentary episode uploaded to showcase the origins of ARC Raiders, Embark Studios took a deep dive into where the game came from. It walks viewers through the original PvE title that saw players team up against enormous robotic enemies, to the extraction shooter with intense PvP mechanics that we know today.</p>



<p>It was revealed in one segment that the team at Embark wanted to balance PvP so perfectly that it would placate players who didn’t <strong>want </strong>to fight other users for fear of stumbling upon ‘tryhards’ who could defeat them in every engagement.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-was-very-different">ARC Raiders Was Very Different</h2>



<p>In the documentary uploaded on YouTube today, we get a glimpse behind the curtain at the development lifecycle of ARC Raiders, which unfolded over more than seven years. It started as a PvE-exclusive game that would see players team up to take down extremely threatening ARC enemies, and it evolved into a PvPvE extraction shooter out of necessity and to become more marketable.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Evolution of ARC Raiders EP1 - Finding ARC Raiders" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tdorU3sjt_0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In one segment of the documentary, David Dixon, Embark Studios’ Animation Director, explained how PvP was addressed to ensure that <strong>all comers </strong>could have as much fun as possible, even when fighting tougher opponents:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That’s why PvP is such an important addition to the game. A lot people have a strong reaction to what that might mean, but if you think about what happens when you play against other humans, you just realize that the finite distance gets closer to infinite, because now you have all the permutations of human behaviour in the session.</p>



<p>Some players might not like playing another person because they’ll get tryhards that are very, very good, but if we do our job well, then you’ll have something that feels balanced and fun, even if you’re not the best at aiming or the best at shooting.</p>



<p>You should still be able to find something rewarding in that experience of extracting stuff back out of the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When ARC Raiders hit the market, it felt like a positive and refreshing title that had everyone collaborating to explore this new world. Within a matter of days, the PvP theme had spiked, and every engagement felt heated and ‘on sight’. There are still positive interactions to be found, but as players became more capable and better equipped, the collaborative aspect mostly went out the window.</p>



<p>But fans accept that’s part of the PvPvE loop. It’s still not as bad as games like Escape from Tarkov, in which you have almost no chance whatsoever of collaborating with other random players.</p>



<p>Do you think ARC Raiders has good PvE, or is there something you’d change? Let your thoughts be heard on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

I'm lucky I was also sent a press copy of this particular collection so I didn't have to share! For reference, we succeeded in buying one at The Pokémon  Center website, but failed everywhere else for everything else. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, that’s an entirely different conversation.

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-nuketown-2025-map-goes-live-tomorrow-see-it-in-action-now/1100-6536356/" data-ref-id="1100-6536356">new version of Nuketown arrived on November 20</a>, and one of the first things people tried on it was shooting off all the mannequin heads to unlock the long-running Nuketown Easter egg. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in Black Ops 7, at least not yet. This isn't a huge shock, though, as Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown didn't unlock the Easter egg right away, either.</p><p>A popular video from the Detonated account shows that the mannequin heads on Nuketown 2025 cannot be shot off, thereby not allowing the Easter egg to unlock once they're all blasted away. People are theorizing that the new version of Nuketown does indeed carry forward the Easter egg that's been in every version of Nuketown since 2010, but it's just not active yet.</p><p>In Black Ops 6, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-easter-egg-breathes-new-life-into-nuketown-in-the-creepiest-way-possible/1100-6527796/" data-ref-id="1100-6527796">zombified mannequins sprung forth from the ground</a> for the Easter egg. And <a href="https://screenrant.com/call-duty-black-ops-nuketown-easter-eggs-ranked/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as ScreenRant reminds us</a>, when Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown launched, it also didn't have the Easter egg unlocked, but it arrived around a week later. If the same pattern holds for Black Ops 7, fans can expect the latest version of the Easter egg to be here soon. Season 1 is expected to launch in early December, and this could be when the Easter egg gets unlocked for Black Ops 7, but that's just a guess.</p><p>The Nuketown Easter egg debuted with the first Black Ops game in 2010 and has showed up, in different forms, for every version of the map since. For the first game, shooting all the mannequin heads would trigger the game to start playing the Rolling Stones song "Sympathy for the Devil." In Black Ops 2, the Easter egg makes classic Activision games playable on an in-game sign.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Treyarch made <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Ops 7's Endgame available to everyone</a> today, November 21.

			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/">is officially out if you haven't noticed</a>, and frankly, if you didn't, no one could blame you since this has felt like one of the most muted launches from Activision in years. Muted or not, however, it's still a new Call of Duty, which means that sales should already be skyrocketing, right? Well, at least right now, that doesn't seem to be the case. According to the latest weekly GSD Sales Data report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european">The Game Business,</a> while Black Ops 7 was at the top of the charts for the week of November 10-16, it's far behind last year's Black Ops 6 launch numbers, and far behind Battlefield 6's launch numbers for EU sales.</p>



<p>According to GSD Data, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's launch week sales in the EU fell short of Battlefield 6's first week EU launch sales by 63%, and according The Game Business's estimates, it fell short of last year's Black Ops 6 first week launch sales by over 50%. </p>



<p>So even though it still made it to the top of the sales charts for premium game sales in the EU for its launch week, which means it was able to sell quite a lot of copies, potentially in the millions, by Call of Duty standards, this launch missed the mark.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the chart include Anno 117: Pax Romana, which launched just two days ahead of Black Ops 7, and, according to The Game Business, more than doubled the launch numbers for the last major Anno game, Anno 1800.</p>



<p>Football Manager 26 remains in the top-10 list for revenue earned, though it dropped from the copies sold list. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-26-knocks-battlefield-6-out-of-eu-sales-charts-top-spot-with-the-biggest-launch-in-gsd-weekly-charts-history/">it had an incredibly impressive first week</a>, it seems that the game's technical issues at launch and the poor word of mouth around that are impacting its sales.</p>



<p>And speaking of Battlefield 6, it remains in both the revenue top 10 and copies sold top 10. It's behind fellow EA title EA Sports FC 26 in both lists, but it is still in the top five. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is another title that was able to keep its spot in the top 10 for both the revenue earned and copies sold list as it continues to ride the wave of momentum from <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">the release of its third and final DLC, lined up alongside a free trial weekend and major discount to the game on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Per The Game Business, here's the list of the top 10 games in the EU by copies sold for the week of November 10-16:</p>



<ol>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Anno 117: Pax Romana</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>
</ol>
