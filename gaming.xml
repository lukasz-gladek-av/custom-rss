<p>These new physical editions of the game come complete with the 8-bit original, now with modern conveniences such as quick save. But, of course, the star turn is a "massively expanded" Jaws Enhanced Edition that embiggens the adventure to incorporate aspects from four (!) of the Jaws movies, rather than just the good one.</p>
<p>With pre-orders opening on 19th December and ending on 18th January 2026 over on the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/jaws-retro-edition-bigger-boat-edition-switch-ps5?variant=44839204585525">official Limited Run Games site</a>, the game is set to be released as part of celebrations "culminating in the 50th anniversary of the blockbuster Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg film, and this time there’s no escape." We'll see about that, chief. We'll also update you folks with a solid release date when we have one.</p>

<p>Originally published by LJN back in 1987, you commandeer a boat (don't worry, it's plenty big enough) in order to hunt down a selection of nasty sea-dwelling enemies, including, of course, that great big rubber shark that terrified audiences so badly back in the days when this writer was still rocking a shark-repellent nappy (bet Batman doesn't have one of those).</p>
<p>Here are some more details on both physical versions that will be up for pre-order, alongside some screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jaws Retro Edition Features:<br></strong>Save Anywhere<br>
Rewind<br>
Achievements/Trophies<br>
Music Player<br>
Gallery</p>
<p><strong>Jaws Enhanced Version Features:</strong><br>
Massively expanded, multi-chapter adventure filled with nods and homages to all four Jaws films<br>
New quests and objectives<br>
New abilities and weapons for your boat and diver alike<br>
More challenging enemies, and more ways to deal with them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The standard version is $34.99, while $99.99 will get you that bigger boat with a "NES-inspired box", a CD (game) soundtrack, a shark lamp, and a couple of other bits.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the original NES game, the excellent Jeremy Parish (who happens to work at Limited Run these days) covered it in his excellent NES Works series several years ago.</p>

            <p>Reader, I must apologise for the intolerably wholesome nature of RPS of late. My last couple of reviews were of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-review">a laidback farming sim</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/routine-review">showcase of nostalgic hardware</a>. Glancing down the news feed, I note with outrage that Oisin has recently been writing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/match-delightfully-silly-hand-drawn-dogs-in-dogpile-a-roguelike-deckbuilder-take-on-suika-game">Very Good Doggos</a> (being thrown into pits), while Mark has been spilling ink over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">that least offensive of politicians, Keir Starmer</a>. Time to consign Starmer, the doggos, and those fetching Macintosh-me-dos to the waste bin along with my lingering fondness for Dreamcast-era platformers. Let's cleanse our palates of sugar with a post about stinking murderous zealots. For you see, there is now a demo available for Band Of Crusaders, the new tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Polish developers Virtual Alchemy and publishers NCSoft.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
These aren't the crusaders your great-great-etc grandparents hopefully neither joined nor had to run away from back in the 12th century. They live in a very Witchery France that is being consumed from within by many-armed abominations, towering arch-demons, sigil-ridden cultists and... bandits. 
</p>
<p>
I did get a chuckle out of <a href="https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:kxu4xg5fx3gi6dwjlgfws5hw/bafkreianzgimybybt7reciurxievyfirm3ltldyada3hpnlelzobqirty4@jpeg">this image</a>'s casual equivocation of the likes of Beelzebub with ordinary human thieves. We all remember that line from Revelations, right? "And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. Also there were some guys in hoods who stole my favourite cow. The crowned beast I can live with tbh, but I'm in the cheesemaking trade and I really needed that cow."
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it plays a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a>. You stroll around a real-time overworld in tabletop figurine form, steadily consuming resources and periodically entering your campsite to re-equip your hairy devil-dingers, level them up, and send them off to the infirmary as needed. There are quests with fairly extravagant historical fantasy writing. These take you between cities with trading facilities and a range of smaller locations, such as monasteries. While sallying forth to the latter, you will likely encounter another, opposing figurine, plunging you into a separately loading smaller real-time battlefield, where men in metal hats bellow and belabour each other with clubs and greatswords. Or sickles and pitchforks if that's all you can afford.
</p>

<p>
Thing I like: the impression of a world steadily succumbing to a demon blight. Cities have cult activity bars; I imagine you'll have a hard time buying more grain and furnace parts if the major hubs are totally overrun. It reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2s-free-kingdoms-mode-is-out-now-and-its-got-its-red-hooks-in-me-already">Kingdoms mode in Darkest Dungeon 2</a>, with your party striving to prop up farflung settlements. Thing I'm indifferent on: the real-time combat seems fine, with much seemingly depending on choice of weapon: a sword won't bust up plate armour like a hammer. The weapon categories accompany a pinwheel of unlockables that skew towards roles such as tanking, DPS, etcetera. It's sturdy enough, but nothing mindblowing.
</p><p>
Things I dislike: the repetitive combat barks and the fact that all the French-accented English voice staff sound like hastily recruited exchange students. Also, I don't get the sense that this is particularly mindful of the mayhem associated with real-life Crusades; based on 30 minutes, anyway, it seems pretty free and lemon-squeezy with the "deus vult" stuff that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deus-vult">has proven popular among the latter-day alt-righteous</a>. The choice of otherworldly opponents can naturally be read as dodging the association with religious pogroms and persecution.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, because I could really go for a horror tactics game that investigates the ugliness of the crusader worldview, and/or leans into the garishness a la Red Hook's work. Perhaps that's where the full version of Band Of Crusaders will take us? It's not impossible. I'm not sure all of my Brothers in Fiend-Bashing are the saintly sort. My hooded advisor gives off a certain brimstone vibe. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526570/Band_of_Crusaders/">Steam</a>.

              <p>Jim Ward, sometimes know as James Kevin Ward, was a voice actor and radio host, best known for providing the wonderful voice of&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>‘s buffoonish antihero Captain Qwark. It was <a href="https://x.com/StephMillerShow/status/1998881395167604759">announced</a> last night (via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/jim-ward-voice-of-ratchet-and-clanks-captain-qwark-has-passed-away"><em>PushSquare</em></a>)&nbsp;that he has died at the age of 66.</p> <p>Jim Ward was perhaps more recently most recognized as a co-host on the nationally syndicated talk radio program,&nbsp;<em>The Stephanie Miller Show</em>, but to video games players it’s almost certainly Captain Qwark who would first come to mind. The hilarious character, all bravado and little talent, was so deftly performed by Ward such that he was<em>&nbsp;just</em> likable enough to be both a glorious antagonist, then later a hilariously useless ally, across most of the series of games.</p>

 <p>However, Ward was recognizable in so many other games, as well as his many TV and movie roles (especially as Doug Dimmadome and Chet Ubetcha in&nbsp;<em>Fairly Odd Parents</em>). In 1998 he was the voice of Hector LeMans in&nbsp;<em>Grim Fandango</em>, became a regular in multiple <em>Star Wars</em> games, appeared as <em>FEAR</em>‘s Rodney Betters,&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>‘s Belial, as well as roles in&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>,&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>, and&nbsp;<em>BioShock 2</em>, among many dozens of others.</p>

 <p>Ward had retired in 2021, due to a combination of precocious Alzheimer’s and an extremely serious case of covid-19 that had left him paralyzed for months. After a slow recovery from the sickness, he had entirely lost his memory. (Rather wonderfully, despite this, he apparently would still perform voices and entertain his family.) This obviously meant <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2021/05/12/ratchet-clank-jim-ward/">he was unable to reprise his role</a> for 2021’s <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, where he was replaced by <span data-testid="hero__primary-text">Scott Whyte, but his voice has continued appearing in more recent games such as&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>‘s&nbsp;<em>Gold Road</em> expansion and last year’s remaster of <em>The Thing</em>.</span></p> <p>Ward’s death was publicly announced by his former radio colleague Stephanie Miller, who quoted from an email sent to her by Ward’s wife on December 10. “One of the saddest messages I have ever received,” she began, quoting, “<span>Our wonderful ‘voice deity’ as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM. Can you let Steph know? Thanks, Janice.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the saddest messages I have ever received from the amazing Mrs Jim Ward:<br> Our wonderful “voice deity” as Steph anointed Jim Ward, passed away today at 10:45AM.

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Free Title Update 4 lands on December 16, 2025, introducing a new Elder Dragon, new equipment, features, events, and more. </p>



<p>Capcom had announced a Monster Hunter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-showcase-announced-for-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Showcase</a> earlier this week, which was not only going to take us through the details of title update 4 for MH Wilds, but also new information on MH Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. The showcase was delayed to December 11 due to a tsunami warning in Japan, and is now available as a VOD. </p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-adds-new-elder-dragon-and-support-hunters">Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4 Adds New Elder Dragon and Support Hunters</h2>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4 adds a new Elder Dragon called Gogmazios, who is available after completing the main mission “A First Cry.” It is a special quest that has four hunters bringing on support hunters (new feature) to form parties of 8 to take on this challenge, and you will be teaming up with Nadia and Fabius. Players will also find a permanent, replayable event quest version of the Gogmazios quest on the same day. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-equipment">New Equipment</h3>

There’s new Armor Transcendence as well, allowing hunters to upgrade their HR 100+ armours even further.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-arch-tempered-monster-support-hunters-and-optional-quests">New Arch-Tempered Monster, Support Hunters and Optional Quests</h3>



<p>Title Update 4 for Monster Hunter Wilds will also introduce the Arch-tempered version of Jin Dahaad. Players will find new support hunters like Nadia, who uses a light bowgun, Griffin, who is a great sword wielder, and Nightmist, who uses a light bowgun as well. New high-difficulty quests have been added with several 9-star monsters, and there will be new limited-time quests that will let players forge special equipment, farm Heavy Armor Spheres, and more. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-downloadable-content">New Downloadable Content</h3>



<p>Players will get access to four beloved poses from prior Monster Hunter games for free in the new update. They will also receive a free Character Edit and Palico Edit Vouchers. Lastly, a paid Cosmetic DLC Pack 4 is also coming.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-performance-improvements-roadmap">Monster Hunter Wilds Performance Improvements Roadmap</h2>



<p>The developers have acknowledged the “great deal of feedback regarding improving the overall quality of the game” and have provided a <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1999057737578074300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">roadmap</a> for addressing these issues. </p>

<li>Another CPU/GPU optimization patch will be released for all platforms in February 2026, introducing level-of-detail (LOD) quality levels for polygonal meshes in 3D models, reducing GPU processing load. </li>
</ul>

            <p>Annapurna has released another trailer for musical RPG People of Note, giving us a full listen to its big musical number, as well as a fresh look at its turn-based combat.</p>
<p>Yes, this is an RPG with rhythmic turn-based combat and big musical numbers, and I can't wait to play it once it's out.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's a corgi shaped like an accordion!</p>

<p>Developed by Iridium Studios, People of Note was first shown at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurnas-next-three-games-are-a-turn-based-musical-a-zelda-like-adventure-and-a-puzzle-game-exploring-a-utopian-society">Annapurna's showcase back in September</a> alongside the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>This new trailer gives a deeper look at the game. There's protagonist Cadence singing catchy pop-musical number Under The Lights (its chorus reminds me of Rewrite The Stars from The Greatest Showman), with singer <a href="https://lexxemusic.com/">Lexxe</a> providing vocals. Cadence is on a quest for stardom, apparently, and recruits an ensemble of musicians to back her.</p><p>The trailer description also promises each battle will be "a musical performance with evolving combat conditions and genre-bending mashup attacks". We see glimpses of this in the trailer itself, with rhythmic button presses triggering attacks - though without in-game music it's hard to tell exactly how this will work.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Just look at this little guy! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Annapurna</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We also see more of the game's world - a mix of fantasy and cyberpunk presented in colourful animation. It looks like there'll be exploration and puzzle solving along with combat and extensive music videos.</p>
<p>It's looking brilliant and could be the Kpop Demon Hunters of gaming if it takes off on its release next year, across both PC and consoles.</p>
<p>I just hope combat lives up to its potential. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 raised the bar this year for turn-based combat</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-greek-melodrama-fails-to-reach-lofty-expectations">2023's Stray Gods</a> attempted a melodramatic musical but didn't quite deliver on its genre-mixing promise. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Hi-Fi Rush, however, proved how intoxicating a musical animated world can be</a>, so let's see if People Of Note follows suit.</p>

<p>Are the upgrades worth it?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead Redemption</a> is out now for the Switch 2, delivering an updated version of the acclaimed Wild West romp. We've already provided our own glowing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10 review</a>, but now the lovely chaps at Digital Foundry have gone into even more depth as to what you can expect from a graphical and performance point of view.</p>
<p>Starting off with performance, Red Dead Redemption runs at a mostly stable 60fps, with minor dips present in Armadillo and Blackwater, particularly when playing the <strong>Undead Nightmare</strong> add-on. For the most part, however, you can expect lovely, smooth gameplay with very infrequent interruptions.</p>
<p>Looking more closely at the visuals, the game's textures and world design remain pretty much the same as those found on Switch 1. However, while docked, the Switch 2 version utilises DLSS to achieve a much more detailed 1440p resolution from a native 720p. There's much less flickering going on with the foliage, while objects off in the far distance have reduced anti-aliasing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 2D assets such as the in-game map are much more detailed thanks to the higher resolution, while shadows appear slightly more realistic than on the original Switch. There are still a few lingering issues, mind you. Some textures still flicker and pop in slightly, which Digital Foundry notes as "disappointing" given the age of the original game, while shadow quality in handheld mode is noticeably worse when compared to docked.</p>
<p>To be honest, the issues mentioned seem so minor, that it's unlikely to cause any issues for the average player. With a nice boost up to 60fps and much improved resolution thanks to DLSS, it seems Red Dead Redemption on the Switch 2 has proven to be a huge success.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Expression Games has shared a first look at gameplay from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose-vietnam">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</a>, the studio’s large scale multiplayer sequel set to release in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | First Gameplay Reveal Trailer | World Exclusive with @IGN" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/05/hell-let-loose-review-ps-plus-ps5-xbox-series-x/">the WW2 original</a>, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam jumps to 1973 and one of the other most significant wars fought in the 20th century. Much like the original game, two teams of 50 players will fight for supremacy, but this time will be tramping through the jungles, boating up and down rivers and flying over the trees of Vietnam. You can absolutely see the game’s visuals are looking to capture the way that this war was represented in cinema, though I’d hope to see a little more variety in the time of day so it’s not always so sunset-y.</p>
<p>Fresh gameplay additions include aerial units like helicopters that can be used to transport troops, deliver supplies, and provide air support through reconnaissance and firepower. Patrol boats will also be a key new addition as these are heavily armed, allowing players to navigate the waterways into enemy territory and strike. The use of tunnels were a key strategic tactic for the North Vietnamese, and they can be constructed to allow for underground movement for surprise attacks against enemy forces.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S next year, but you can check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/hell-let-loose-vietnam-preview-choppers-tunnels-and-a-new-era-of-war/">our early preview of the game</a> from Gamescom in August. I said, “Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the bigger dose of wish fulfilment for war gaming fans. Arguably it is the more difficult conflict to adapt as well, but the team’s plans for how to balance the massively different battle tactics, technology and destructive options might seem to have a great grasp of how to manage this.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Update Fixes Some Out-of-Bounds Map Exploits]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-patch-notes/</link>
            <guid>1379389</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has published a new update in ARC Raiders, one that addresses some of the most critical concerns players have about the game. In recent weeks, the patches pushed out by Embark Studios have been appreciated, but they’ve been firefighting some pesky issues that have made some player experiences fairly miserable.</p>



<p>The biggest concern has been around the game’s worst players glitching through walls or using ziplines to get out of the map in places, sometimes making them impervious to damage while being able to take down other players.</p>



<p>This patch addresses some of those issues.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-patch-notes-december-11">ARC Raiders Patch Notes – December 11</h2>



<p>The latest ARC Raiders patch was summarized by Embark Studios <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1999060771125248006">on social media</a>. It’s a small change, but one that might prove to be quite mighty:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Time to restart your client, there’s a new update rolling out! </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Removed zipline out-of-bounds exploit on Stella Montis</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed vaulting bug on Blue Gate</em></li>



<li><em>Corrected material issues affecting bullet/blocking &amp; ARC vision</em></li>



<li><em>Closed gap in Spaceport Launch Tower wall.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>Patch Cadence Update:</p>



<p>Going forward, updates and store rotations will move to Tuesdays, and will not be on a weekly cadence. With the holidays approaching, the team are taking a much needed break to rest and recover, returning in January with more exciting updates. </p>



<p>We’ll continue to monitor and work on critical issues during this time, but for now… </p>



<p>Get ready for the Cold Snap update next Tuesday, packed with fixes and new content!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to comment about the other outstanding issues under the post, such as the broken Trophies on PlayStation 5, which are preventing some users from hitting 100% completion of the game. In a title where a completionist attitude is front and centre, this is understandably quite irritating.</p>







<p>Have you been hit by anyone using a map exploit in ARC Raiders? Let us know if you’re happy to see this change going in on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Indeed, there were no new Fallout games announced at all.

And we know Bethesda wants to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Fast forward a year and a half, and IGN had the chance to quiz Todd Howard on all things Fallout, alongside Kevin Beatty, Head of Product for Samsung Gaming, Interactive Experiences, and Emerging Tech (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/watch-prime-videos-fallout-season-1-for-free-from-today-on-samsung-tv-plus">Bethesda and Xbox recently announced a partnership with Amazon and Samsung to stream Season 1 for free on Samsung TV Plus ahead of Season 2</a>). In the interview, Howard remained coy when asked directly about a number of unannounced projects, but did offer a tantalizing tease that should get Fallout fans excited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We started by asking Howard if the explosive success of the Fallout TV show had caused Bethesda to alter its plans for new Fallout games, either creatively or timeline-wise. Howard denied that, saying Bethesda already had a plan for the Fallout games it wanted to make.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, it hasn't,” he replied. “We had a plan for the games we were going to make. The TV show was part obviously of our Fallout plan as far as a franchise. And in a lot of ways, I view it as an entry, as a game entry. Games are one lens into the world, the TV show is another lens into the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The one thing it has led us to do is people are coming back to the games that are already available. So, you're seeing record numbers again back in Fallout 4, from the first season, again, in this season. Fallout 76 obviously is a game that we've continued to update for the last seven years. So that's probably the one where we really see engaged audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, the one thing it's made us do is lean into that. We know that we have an audience there in that game in particular. And the Burning Springs update that just came out, and having Walton Goggins in the game is The Ghoul, just there's some really, really good opportunities there.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We then asked Howard if Bethesda being owned by Microsoft had made it likely that the company might partner with, for example, Obsidian, developer of the original Fallout: New Vegas, or Wasteland developer inXile — both of which are Xbox studios — on a new Fallout: New Vegas game while fans wait for Fallout 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, Howard was coy in his response. “We've had a long-term plan for Fallout, and so I wish I could talk about all those today,” he said. “I'll just say this, it's the franchise that we're doing the most in right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That cryptic tease at the end will be of interest to The Elder Scrolls fans patiently waiting for The Elder Scrolls 6 to come out. While that game is clearly of a big focus internally at Bethesda, it’s interesting to learn that there’s a lot more going on for Fallout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally on this topic, we asked Howard if the success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which has seen over 4 million players since it shadow-dropped earlier this year, was a repeatable trick for a Fallout 3 Remastered. Howard once again kept his cards close to his chest, and reiterated a point he’s been making a lot in interviews lately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will just say that the Oblivion Remaster, we're really, really pleased with how well it did, it was a very long project too, and not just in how it was received, the ability to shadow drop it, and the response to doing that,” he said. “I like to do that with games as much as possible. I love the moment that you find out about a game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Howard continued: “And I like to think about when somebody presses play, what is in their head? What do they think? What is their expectation? What's their excitement level? What do they think about the thing they're about to play? And so, I like to back up from that moment with how we talk about it, and sometimes there are big gaps.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big gaps indeed. The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG over time (and after a rocky launch), it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/arc-raiders-patch-1-6-0-attempts-to-stop-players-going-out-of-bounds/</link>
            <guid>1379368</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Embark Studios has released a new patch for ARC Raiders, with this 1.6.0 patch being quite small in comparison to previous updates. The main issue patch 1.6.0 addresses is stopping players from going out of bounds in the Stella Montis map, and various collision issues that hindered players, causing them to fall through the environment or be shot behind walls.</p>
<p>Here are the full ARC Raiders 1.6.0 patch notes:</p>


<ul>
<li>Removed a zipline that allowed players to get out of bounds on Stella Montis.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed collision that allowed players to vault and fall through a wall in Blue Gate.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed material issues that caused multiple objects to not block bullet fire or ARC vision.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a gap in the collision on Spaceport Launch Tower that allowed players to be shot through the wall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Embark Studios has also announced changes to its patch release schedule, and how often they will be coming. Patch releases and store rotations will be changed to Tuesdays from Thursdays, with the Cold Snap update being the first to come out on a Tuesday. That will release next week. However, the team will be taking some downtime over the Christmas and New Year period, with only critical issues being looked at during that time. Then more regular updates will resume in January.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks as the hottest extraction shooter in town, we delivered our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">review of ARC Raiders</a> a few days ago. Tuffcub said, <em>“Arc Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A box art for Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-leak-spoilers-potential-box-art-and-some-info-of-tr1-remake-%E2%80%9Cretelling%E2%80%9D-has-leaked.1379143/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> a few hours ago via the ResetEra board. The leak also includes some information suggesting that it will be a remake of the first installment in the series, originally developed by Core Design and released in 1996. The box art matches Lara Croft's pose in the teaser image <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-tomb-raider-game-announcement-confirmed-for-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared ahead of the planned announcement</a> that will go live during Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025 event</a> later today.</p>



<p>As officially confirmed by Crystal Dynamics, this game is intended to somehow unify the various Tomb Raider series and the protagonist, Lara Croft, who will be more mature and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confident</a> than in the recent reboot trilogy. It is, however, unclear whether this remake is in addition a brand new title or if it's the main project Crystal Dynamics has been working on.</p>



<p>There are also a few screenshots circulating, but their resolution is so low that even the best upscaling tools cannot make them decent enough to share. Best to wait for the official ones, which will no doubt be available after the TGA announcement.</p>



<p>The new Tomb Raider game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is being developed using Epic's Unreal Engine 5</a>, marking a departure from the proprietary Foundation engine used in previous titles. Amazon Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will publish it</a>, and there are rumors that it will <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share the same universe</a> as the upcoming TV series, featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a> (and, according to a new rumor, Sigourney Weaver is also in the main cast). </p>



<p>When it comes to game details, we only have <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/">an old rumor</a> that it may be an open world game set in India where Lara Croft can explore the environments with a handy motorcycle. Again, though, we'll have to wait and see if those details were referring to Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis or something else instead.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Over 100 Performance Improvements’ Are Coming To Monster Hunter Wilds Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/</link>
            <guid>1379362</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although many of its mechanics mark a set step forward for the franchise, Monster Hunter Wilds hasn't been as well-received as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/"><strong>Monster Hunter World</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/"><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></a>, mostly due to its low challenge level at launch and significant performance issues on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>While the development team addressed the low challenge issue in the past few months, introducing more powerful monsters and Arch-tempered variants with free title updates, performance issues still prevented many from enjoying the game. However, it seems like the time has come for CAPCOM to address the matter finally.</p>



<p>The Ver. 1.0.4.00 update launching on December 16 will implement CPU and GPU optimization across all hardware, applying a variety of improvements such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Applying frame distribution, reviewing collision detection, and reducing the number of simultaneous effects to optimize processing time.</li>



<li>Reducing the overall load by eliminating unnecessary processing.</li>



<li>Implementing over 100 performance improvements for players, monsters, Seikret, Palicoes, NPCs, GUI, effects, gimmicks, and more.</li>
</ul>



<p>The elimination of unnecessary processing, in particular, promises to address the issue that most suspect was behind the most significant performance issues. Shortly after release, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">an in-depth analysis suggested that performance hiccups were related to data streaming to the GPU</strong></a>, as the game likely streamed elements in and decompressed textures aggressively when the camera was in motion, among other factors.</p>



<p>Besides introducing over 100 performance improvements, the next Monster Hunter Wilds title update will also introduce new monster Gogmazios, additional 9★ tempered monsters, a tempered 9★ Rathalos roaming the Scarlet Forest and Oilwell Basin at Hunter Rank 100, balance changes for all weapons, support for new paid cosmetics, and more. All the details on the update can be found on the game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.040.00.00.html">official website</a></strong>.</p>



<p>If the game's performance issues are finally fixed across all formats, Monster Hunter Wilds will be in a much better state than at launch later this month. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>more players will consider returning to the game, as producer Yuya Tokuda hopes.</strong></a></p>

            <p>Publishers and studios who want to show off their games during the main show at a Keighleyfest usually have to pay a not small chunk of change for the privilege. According to a fresh report from Kotaku which aims to deliver the latest figures for a couple of different trailer lengths at this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/the-game-awards">Game Awards</a>, those handing over the cash are now looking at paying seven figures for a three-minute showing of their game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243">Kotaku</a> cite two sources familiar with 2025's edition of the winter Geoffs who say that three minute trailers at this year's show go for over $1 million. Saving two minutes off that time and going for a 60-second trailer instead can reportedly still set you back up to $450,000.</p>
<p>To compare these against previous rates, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/">Esquire</a> wrote in June 2024 that trailer prices for the main show of that year's Summer Game Fest were as follows: $250,000 for a minute, $350,000 for a minute and 30 seconds, $450,000 for two minutes, and $550,000 for two and a half minutes. 2023's summer Geoffs were reported to have run the same pricing tiers.</p>
<p>So, having a presence at the front and centre of these sorts of showcases often remains costly. Though, <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">Kotaku</a> did report having heard from that certain smaller game makers may get free airtime. These are called "earned editorial placements". They're not just for the little guys - Kotaku suggest that big reveals from major publishers like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft may also qualify. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-costs-of-exhibiting-at-a-video-game-convention-1">As ever with shows like these</a>, companies may also pay to run a booth on the show floor.</p>
<p>Outside of that, Kotaku's latest piece outlines the costs a nominated developer can face simply getting devs to the show, if they wish to bring more than the two people who're reportedly offered complimentary attendance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> devs Sandfall Interactive have paid for a number of extra tickets at around $300 each this year, it's claimed. Meanwhile, a freelance narrative writer who worked on a game nominated this year, but is no longer under contract with the studio, expressed frustration at the Geoffs' organisers only selling general admission tickets after announcement of the nominations, while apparently neglecting to keep any reserved for developers who can prove they worked on nominated games.</p><p>These sorts of stories continue to fuel debate as to whether the Geoffs do a good enough job of celebrating developers and acknowledging the serious issues an industry decimated by layoffs faces, alongside all of the advertising. Just yesterday, the United Videogame Workers-CWA union hosted their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/videogameworkers.bsky.social/post/3m7olyr5u2k2w">inaugural "avarice awards"</a> on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/UVW_CWA">Twitch</a>, a protest parody of the Game Awards which dished out plaudits like "Most Corporate Speak/Tactless Layoff Announcement", "Worst Crunch Culture", and "Most Studios Closed". Tencent and Microsoft tied for first place in that last one.</p>
<p>The latest edition of the winter Geoffs kick off later today, and we'll have plenty of words to deliver to you about the things that're announced.</p>

            <p>When <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-solar-empire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a> 2 launched from early access in September 2024, its premium edition and content pass promised something no other game in the series had delivered: a singleplayer campaign.</p>
<p>The Times of War DLC would for the first time give you an authored story and set of missions for each faction. Originally announced for release in "Fall 2025", there are players of the series who have waited nearly 20 years for this, and they're still waiting because there's no sign of the DLC yet. Nor Harbinger, the expansion bringing a fourth playable race to Sins of a Solar Empire 2.</p>
<p>"They're definitely still on the road map," development lead Brian Clair tells me, "but we've shifted them around a bit."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Clair and I spoke ahead of Sins of a Solar Empire 2's 1.5 update, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2s-ai-will-now-only-hate-you-if-you-give-it-a-good-reason">overhauls the AI of NPC factions and adds a suite of diplomacy tools</a>. However, it doesn't bring Harbinger or Times of War. "They're both high up on the road map," Clair says. "We've promised this stuff to people who bought the premium edition with the content pass, so we have a duty to deliver."</p><p>The team had "originally planned to do the campaign first," Clair explains, but Stardock will instead work on Harbinger next. "The reason for that is we want to have the fourth faction in the campaign, and it would be really hard to have them in the campaign before we actually had the assets made," Clair says. "It just made logical sense to swap it." Clair says Harbinger is set for release in late 2026, with Times of War now due in 2027.</p>
<p>That's a hefty delay and one that leaves players who have paid money for a DLC potentially waiting three years for its release. Though, signs of Stardock's progress toward the campaign are trickling down into Sins 2. In the Paths to Power DLC, released in March this year, Stardock added scenarios. These mission-driven maps gave players objectives and special victory conditions, something that hadn't appeared in any previous game in the series. "That was actually the foundation for the campaign," Clair says. "We're going to need to use all those systems to make the campaign happen."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>While that may be the first step in building a campaign, there is still a long way to go. Even now, adding a new scenario is a fiddly business. "You fire up VS code, and you're hand writing out the JSON to bring this together," Clair says. "As a developer, I can do it, but it's really going to slow it down." It's much worse for modders. Next year, along with the push to complete Harbinger, Stardock plans "to build a tool to streamline [scenario creation] and not just for us, but so modders can use it too."</p><p>Then, with Times of War, Stardock wants to share the tools it makes to build its campaign, so modders can tell more complex stories than those possible in single scenarios. "What they're going to be getting when we tackle the campaign in full is the ability to bring all those together into a coherent whole and add in more to it, cinematics, custom victory conditions depending on your story path, that kind of thing," Clair says.</p>
<p>Sins has an active modding scene, twisting its real-time space operas into different shapes. Some original, some, er, <a href="https://mod.io/g/sins2/m/sta4-core#description">more Star Trek adjacent</a>. So, while such a long delay is frustrating, the prospect of modders getting their hands on the tools to create their own campaigns alongside all their current tools is an exciting one. Now if only someone were to mod in a Tribble faction, then I could allow my excitement to reach fever pitch.</p>

                <p>It seems telling that Microsoft and Activision haven't been touting sales numbers for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, a sequel that hasn't been as well-received by players as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> was a year earlier. Regardless, Microsoft has announced that the Call of Duty franchise led the charge on Xbox Game Pass in 2025 in two key categories.</p><p>On social media, the official account for Xbox Game Pass noted that Call of Duty ranked first for total players and hours in 2025. Specific figures beyond that weren't included in the announcement.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/xboxgamepass/status/1998878735626567997?s=46" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">In addition to #1 in November, <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CallofDuty</a> closed out 2025 as the #1 franchise on Xbox Game Pass for total players and hours all year 🫡<br>Here’s to <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CallofDuty</a> &amp; its worldwide community. Season 1 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> + Call of Duty: Warzone is just getting warmed up.</p>  — Xbox Game Pass (@XboxGamePass) <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass/status/1998878735626567997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The timing is interesting because Activision released a statement of its own earlier this week which acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">Black Ops 7 fell short of the mark the publisher set for itself</a>. Furthermore, Activision pledged to refrain from any future CoD year-to-year releases that are direct sequels, as Black Ops 6 and 7 were.</p><p>"[We know] that for some of you, the franchise has not met your expectations fully," reads the statement. "To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward ... We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren't sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right."</p><p>Despite the mixed message that comes from the close arrival of these statements, it's entirely plausible that Call of Duty was No. 1 on Game Pass despite under-performing in other metrics. At least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-underperforming-in-2025-analyst-says-citing-burnout-creative-decisions-and-ai-slop/1100-6536669/" data-ref-id="1100-6536669">one video game analyst chastised Microsoft</a> for "dropping the ball" and blamed Black Ops 7's disappointing performance on burnout, poor creative decisions, and its use of AI slop.</p><p>The real question now is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-hasnt-been-outsold-by-another-shooter-in-the-us-since-2006/1100-6536492/" data-ref-id="1100-6536492">whether EA's Battlefield 6 will outperform</a> Black Ops 7 in sales. As of early November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">Battlefield 6 sold 10 million copies</a> across all platforms. It remains to be seen if that will be enough to unseat Call of Duty as the top-selling franchise of the year. Call of Duty hasn't been beaten in that category by another shooter since 2006.</p>

                <p>In 2012, programmer Chris Oberth passed away after a career that spanned from the dawn of video games in the late '70s to the PlayStation 2 era. Now, one of Oberth's unfinished games, Xcavator 2025, has been completed and it's slated for a physical release on the console it was originally intended for: the NES.</p><p>The Video Game History Foundation--with the permission and support of Oberth's family--found the source code for Xcavator 2025 in Oberth's development archives. It was originally developed by Incredible Technologies Inc., the company behind the Golden Tee Golf and Big Buck Hunter arcade games. However, it was rejected by publishers in 1991, and it was never seen again until now.</p><p>To finish the game, the VGHF teamed up with Mega Cat Studios, which was guided by the remaining materials to recapture the spirit of Oberth's original vision. Towards that end, Mega Cat Studios' development team only used the tools and environments that would have been available at the time. A standalone trailer for Xcavator 2025 isn't available yet, but the first footage was screened during the Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Edition at the 1 hour 43:31 mark below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCX95t5cWY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="6210">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4nCX95t5cWY?start=6210" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The physical release of Xcavator 2025 on a working NES cartridge is being handled by iam8bit. Xcavator 2025 <a href="https://www.iam8bit.com/products/xcavator-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is available for preorder now</a>, and it's going for $100. This game will include an "authentically retro package," as well as a 14-page manual that includes background info on both Oberth and Xcavator 2025. All of the profits from this release will be donated to the Video Game History Foundation, which is an official non-profit organization dedicated to preserving gaming history.</p><p>This isn't the first time that the VGHF has resurrected one of Oberth's lost titles. In 2020, the organization released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-lost-nes-game-based-on-a-tom-cruise-classic-has-/1100-6478023/" data-ref-id="1100-6478023">a restored version of Oberth's Days of Thunder NES game</a>, which was based on the 1990 feature film starring Tom Cruise. This was an alternate version that was separate from the Days of Thunder game that was released on the NES, PC, and Amiga. The limited run of Oberth's Days of Thunder sold out quickly, and we wouldn't be shocked if Xcavator 2025 has the same kind of success.</p>

            <p>Here we go: Capcom has finally released an official trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> 4 Title Update 4, which is due to launch for the game on 16th December. But, as exciting as the new content is - featuring returning Elder Dragon, Gogmazios - most players are more interested in another tease of information Capcom has given over the past 24 hours: an optimisation roadmap for the game's performance on PC. This was all revealed during a special showcase Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-capcom-schedules-new-monster-hunter-wilds-presentation-as-its-director-begs-players-to-return-to-the-game">announced last week</a>, which was paired with comments from the game's director asking us all to please "pick up the game again".</p>

<p>The roadmap is segmented into three portions: improvements that will arrive next week as part of Title Update 4, then more planned improvements in January 2026, followed by further optimisation in February 2026. These updates were promised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-asks-pc-monster-hunter-wilds-players-to-wait-until-title-update-4-this-winter-for-cpu-and-gpu-related-optimizations">as far back as August this year</a>.</p>
<p>The first update promises to fix CPU/GPU optimisation, targeting processing improvements applicable to all platforms. This means Capcom has updated elements such as frame processing, collision detection, and how many effects are shown on-screen at once. The developer hopes to lower CPU/GPU load by "reducing unnecessary processes", and will implement over 100 improvements to make the game run a bit better. This will target consoles and PC versions of the game.</p><p>Then, in January, we're getting a bit more - and I think this is where the most notable difference from all the updates is going to land. Here, Capcom will introduce "new graphics and CPU settings, as well as new presets, providing additional options to reduce processing load". This will include improving the shader compilation process (which seems to be at the heart of the game's performance woes for many PC players) and improving VRAM usage, too. The devs are also working on a way to improve streaming for the high-resolution texture pack here: another apparent bottleneck for PC players, specifically.</p>
<p>Finally, in February, more general optimisation will be complimented with the addition of level-of-detail quality levels to the polygon mesh on 3D models. To put it simply, this will also help reduce GPU load. This is also PC-only.</p>

<p>That all sounds good, right? Yes. But of course, players aren't happy. "They're even drip feeding optimization lmao," <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjshc0/tu4_optimization_roadmap/">writes one redditor</a>. "Damn now imagine the game was optimised at launch, I might've played more than 30 hours before never touching it again," says another. "It looks like they pushed out the things that might actually make a difference until the January patch. I don't get why they're not focusing on the impactful items first. We don't even have monster LOD until February? That should have been in at launch!" claims a third.</p><p>They all have a point, to be fair. These issues have plagued the game since Monster Hunter Wilds launched in February 2025, and whilst Capcom has acknowledged them, the publisher has been slow on pushing out updates that addressed player concerns. This has led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">review bombing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">less than stellar sales</a> for the game outside its launch window, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">falls in Capcom's share price</a>.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter audience is also concerned that an upcoming expansion (similar to Monster Hunter World's Iceborne, or Rise's Sunbreak) is going to undo all this hard work and revert the optimisation to launch window levels. There's precedent with this: something similar happened with Iceborne, after all.</p>
<p>There's a decent game inside all of these performance issues, so I'm hoping these updates will sort the bulk of the problem for a PC audience that feels it's been largely left behind thanks to ongoing issues with Capcom's RE Engine. But, a whole year after the game's launch, will this be too late to tempt some people back? We'll find out in a few months.</p>

<p>But it'll cost ya</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> is already one of the greatest fighting games of all time, so Capcom really didn't need to do much more to sell it to us. Alas, an upcoming update on <strong>16th December</strong> genuinely sounds like one of the coolest yet, with the game adding a bunch of UI options from previous titles.</p>
<p>So, if you're a fan of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/street_fighter_iii_3rd_strike_fight_for_the_future">Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike</a>, you can make the in-game UI closely resemble that of the 1999 entry. Alternatively, you can go back even further and add the UI from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/super_street_fighter_2_turbo">Super Street Fighter II Turbo</a> from 1994.</p>
<p>Most of the new additions will cost, mind you, with only the Sim Sim design being offered for free for all players. We're not sure exactly how much each option will cost, but it's likely that both Drive Tickets and Fighter Coins can be applied, the latter of which you can purchase with real money.</p>
<p>Here's a look at every new UI option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Super Street Fighter II Turbo<br>
- <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_alpha_3">Street Fighter Alpha 3</a><br>
- Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike<br>
- <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/ultra_street_fighter_iv">Ultra Street Fighter IV</a><br>
- <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v_champion_edition">Street Fighter V: Champion Edition</a><br>
- Sim Sim (free)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the microtransaction nature of the whole thing, this is a really cool addition for Street Fighter 6. We're particularly keen to utilise the 3rd Strike UI, even if the new iteration isn't <em>exactly</em> the same as the OG.</p>

<p>A significant drop in Nintendo’s share price on Wednesday wiped billions from the company’s value, amid growing concern over the surging price of components and memory chips.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s share value dropped as much as 4.7 per cent on December 10, with the surging prices and shortages of key components, including memory chips, playing a major role.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Rising. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reports</a> the drop in Nintendo’s share prices is the biggest since May, citing market intelligence firm TrendForce in stating that the price Nintendo has to pay for 12 GB RAM in the Switch 2 has jumped 41 per cent.</p>



<p>In December, Nintendo’s shares have declined in seven of eight trading days, wiping around $14bn of value from the company, and the concern is that it could get worse.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 has enjoyed an extremely popular launch period, aided by the releases of the likes of Mario Kart: World, the component situation in the market is becoming extremely problematic for Nintendo and other developers.</p>



<p>Nintendo may be forced to adjust prices for the Switch 2 console, with Dell and HP among those to have already warned that price rises could be on the cards in 2026.</p>



<p>With the large storage sizes of some of the biggest games, many players have sought to purchase additional storage for their devices, but the prices of those add-ons are already increasing.</p>



<p>In a market that is extremely sensitive to price increases, as shown by the backlash earlier this year to increases to an Xbox Game Pass subscription, it creates a worrying period for Nintendo and other console-building companies.</p>

            <p>So, it turns out that Arrowhead actually has a prototype for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> rogue-lite mode kicking about, and I really want to give it a shot!</p>
<p>This news comes from the studio's CCO Johan Pilestedt, who casually shared the titbit on social media last night like it was nothing.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p><a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/with_replies">Pilestedt</a> was responding to a Helldivers 2 player, who said they had an idea that would mix things up in Arrowhead's space shooter, which came to them during Into the Gloom. The player in question said they were keen to see "some sort of roguelike/endless mode where we fight waves and waves or keep completing objectives on the same map", which does sound like fun.</p>
<p>To this, Pilestedt replied: "Hey! We have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode." Huh?!</p>
<p>And that's not all. Not only does Arrowhead have that prototype knocking around the studio, this mode apparently also "changes the game fundamentally". The studio exec didn't elaborate on this specific point further than that, but did previously state he was with some other team members to talk about the game's "next four arcs". So, could this rogue-lite mode be the focus of one of these future arcs? </p><p>In a subsequent post, Pilestedt said the team is now "in a better technical space" than it once was, so these arcs should come a little quicker than previous ones. He also would really "love a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> Super Destroyer Lego set" at some point, saying this would be a childhood dream come true".</p>
<p>To be honest, that does sound like a pretty great idea for a Lego set.</p>

<p>Away from the game itself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">a Helldivers 2 film is also in the works</a>, from Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin. Earlier this month, Arrowhead's CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-trust-justin-arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-helldivers-2-community-asking-for-film-director-to-play-the-game">Shams Jorjani told fans calling for the director to at least play the game before directing the film to pipe down</a>, saying: "I trust Justin."</p>

            <p>Just a day after more N64 classics were announced for Nintendo Switch Online, another game has been added immediately to the GameCube catalogue on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>: Wario World.</p>
<p>Developed by Treasure, the Japanese developer known for Gunstar Heroes and N64 shooter Sin &amp; Punishment, Wario World was not only the first home console Wario game (the previous games were released for handhelds), it was the first 3D Wario platformer.</p>
<p>It was released back in 2003, which was the same year as the first WarioWare game - and ever since, Wario has been mostly relegated to microgame star. So give this GameCube classic some love and maybe Nintendo will consider a new Wario platformer in future.</p>

<p>Wario World joins a whole host of previous Wario games available on the subscription service, including Wario Land 3 for Game Boy and Wario Land 4 for Game Boy Advance.</p>
<p>Still, Wario World is an intriguing choice of inclusion, not least because it wasn't the console's most successful game. The game wasn't included in the initial announcement of GameCube games coming to Switch 2. The most recent of these was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamecube-cosy-horror-luigis-mansion-comes-to-switch-2-in-time-for-halloween">Luigi's Mansion, the GameCube launch game that arrived back in October</a>.</p>
<p>The remaining games previously announced but not yet available are: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fire-emblem-path-radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, Pokémon XD Gale of Darkness, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-classic-n64-platformers-join-nintendo-switch-online-later-this-month">two Ubisoft N64 platformers would arrive on the service later this month</a>: Rayman 2 and Tonic Trouble.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elon Musk Wants One Major ARC Raiders Change to Happen]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-major-arc-raiders-change-to-happen/</link>
            <guid>1379305</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>That’s not a title you likely thought you’d read today, but it’s true. In a post on social media under a recent Embark Studios message, Elon Musk suggested a major change that could alter the core combat mechanics in ARC Raiders, the electrifying extraction adventure title released on October 30.</p>



<p>Elon Musk is a well-documented gamer who has participated in live streams on his X platform, but earlier this year, he openly admitted to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-cheated-diablo-poe-admit/">‘cheating’ in games</a> like Diablo and Path of Exile.</p>



<p>What does Elon Musk want to change in ARC Raiders?</p>







<h2 id="h-elon-wants-to-hunt-people">Elon Wants to Hunt People</h2>



<p>In his post on social media, Elon Musk, the eccentric entrepreneur and super-billionaire, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Good game. </p>



<p>A way to hunt players who have betrayed you would be 🔥🔥</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This gels with the recent arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-watchlist-set-up-unfriendly-players/">a satirical ‘Speranza Watchlist’</a> that players could use to identify griefers and other abusive players in ARC Raiders. It was powered entirely by fake data, but it was humorous enough to get fans interested for a while about the concept of naming and shaming some of ARC Raiders’ more troublesome users.</p>



<p>Elon’s comment landed under a post from Embark Studios requesting feedback from the community regarding the ARC Raiders map pool. Of the five maps released thus far, a diverse array of opportunities is presented, but the environments available aren’t without their fair share of issues.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention Raiders!<br>You’ve explored the world of ARC Raiders, and we want to know what you think of it!<br>We know that YOU, the player, are best placed to offer valuable feedback and suggestions on the game, so we’d like to kick off the conversation by asking for your thoughts… <a href="https://t.co/NssN9zV7E0">pic.twitter.com/NssN9zV7E0</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1998800164090515586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Most notably, fans of the extraction adventure are still complaining about the exploits that allow players to phase through walls on certain maps.</p>



<p>In the past, Elon Musk has spoken about Elden Ring, Mass Effect, Diablo IV, Civilization, and BioShock, amongst others. He’s a self-professed ‘living god of video games’ and has boasted about being a ‘top Quake player’ in his youth, carrying on his love for gaming as an adult and one of the richest people on Earth.</p>







<p>Are you surprised that Elon Musk is a fan of a game where an AI-driven robotic race oppresses humans everywhere? Let us know what you think about this story on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
