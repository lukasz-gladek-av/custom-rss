<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39bc17e5e3c50/resident-evil-requiem-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever since the first big blowout Direct for the Switch 2 back in April, I’ve been itching to see an announcement for <strong>Resident Evil</strong> on the new console. It’s possibly my favourite series of all time, after all, so I’m eager to play the recent entries on a Nintendo console without having to connect to the bloomin’ Cloud. Heck, aren’t we all?</p>
<p>I’ve been banging on about it so much over online chats and meetings that I’m quite sure my colleagues were just about sick of it weeks ago. So you can imagine how much my excitement ramped up when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-resident-evil-requiem-could-be-heading-to-the-switch-2">rumours began to surface</a> about not only existing RE Engine games making their way to Switch 2, but also the upcoming ninth mainline entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>Surely not, right? We’re Nintendo fans, for goodness’ sake; we’re used to getting ports of games months, if not years after their release on other platforms. That’s if they even get ported <em>at all</em>, of course. Which often isn’t the case. And that’s fine, y’know, we’ve got our own first-party games to enjoy, plus a plethora of incredible indie titles.</p>

<p>But then it happened. Towards at the end of the latest Nintendo Direct, atmospheric shots of spooky hallways emerged, followed by the ringing of a telephone. 'Is this Resident Evil?!' I asked myself. And, stone the crows, it <em>was</em>! Not just any Resident Evil either, but as rumoured, it was Resident Evil Requiem, launching day-and-date with other consoles on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This, in my opinion, represents a pretty significant shift for the Switch 2 early in its lifespan. As I said, we’re so used to getting ports of games long after their initial release on other platforms (or, in the case of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, just a few weeks later), but this is a major new entry in one of the biggest gaming franchises of all time – a franchise in which 4 of the 13 titles available on Switch were relegated to Cloud Versions. Yet there it was; a native port launching right alongside the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>There was once a time – very briefly, mind you – in which Capcom and Nintendo were besties, with the former bringing a bunch of exclusives to the GameCube, including the now-iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>. Thanks to lukewarm sales, it didn't last long, and with Nintendo subsequently going in a drastically different direction to Sony and Microsoft, flagship RE games just weren't a thing on Nintendo consoles anymore.</p>
<p>The success of the Switch did change things quite a bit, and Capcom has done an admirable job in supporting the system over the years, but from the customer's point of view, and from <em>our</em> point of view, Cloud Versions just aren't good enough, and it felt like Switch owners were still drawing the short straw. Now, we're back in the driver's seat, and it feels wonderful.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not expecting some major revolution in which every publisher suddenly rushes to launch their flagship games on the Switch 2, but the console’s remarkable success since its launch just a handful of months back has clearly made executives sit up and pay attention. This, along with the Switch 2's favourably comparable specs to the Series S has made immediate ports of new games a much more likely prospect.</p>

<p>Now, you could make the argument that Resident Evil Requiem isn’t the first ‘AAA’ game to launch day-and-date with other platforms. We had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> back in July, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a> earlier this month, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a> is launching just next week. But let’s be fair, publishers would still be releasing sports games on the PS2 if they thought they could get away with it.</p>
<p>Seeing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> gave me a great deal of hope that the Switch 2 would be a good home for modern blockbusters, even if it means waiting just that little bit longer. Then <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> happened, and that felt like a good nudge in the right direction.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem, though? Yeah, that’s on a whole new level. This is a big deal, and I sincerely hope it signifies a bit more openness from publishers to launch their games on the Switch 2 alongside other platforms.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that we're getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> in March 2026 alongside other platforms, and there's a good chance <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-entire-final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-is-making-its-way-to-switch-2">the untitled third entry in the <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-entire-final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-is-making-its-way-to-switch-2">trilogy</a></strong> will also land day-and-date. Good things are happening folks!</p>
<p>Whether it continues is likely down to how well these games actually sell, so... Yeah, buy Resident Evil Requiem, everyone.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> developer Shift Up has dropped a mysterious image onto social media, leading some fans to speculate it could be teasing a horror event or even crossover promotion with the upcoming release of Konami's horror, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>.</p>
<p>While there's no cheeky copyright notices or any obvious indication that Stellar Blade is taking us to Silent Hill, Shift Up did share an image of a very Silent Hill Otherworld-esque world onto Stellar Blade's X/Twitter page, complete with crumbling walls, a dilapidated ceiling, and a very familiar rust-red hue. Hmm.</p>

<p>The text – which reads "in one week…" alongside a stars emoji and the hashtag Stellar Blade – similarly doesn't give much away, but coincidentally enough, Silent Hill f – the first mainline Silent Hill game since 2012 – is due to launch next week on 25th September.</p>

<p>As both franchises have partnered with other games for promotional purposes, it's certainly possible, but it could, of course, just be a spooky-themed time-limited event or another horror game or movie with Halloween just a few short weeks away. Whatever it is, hopefully we'll find out soon.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shift-up-to-expand-stellar-blade-franchise-after-successful-launch-across-multiple-platforms">Shift Up announced it intends to expand the Stellar Blade franchise with "various derivative works"</a>. A new financial report explored the success of its different products, including Stellar Blade, highlighting the game's impressive performance both at launch and with its port to PC.</p>
<p>The report added (via machine translation): "Through this, [Stellar Blade] was able to effectively secure a new user base and further strengthen its position as a global AAA franchise IP. We plan to develop various derivative works to expand the [Stellar Blade] IP so that [Stellar Blade] can establish itself as a well-made IP."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned leaker Tom Henderson shared an interesting tidbit regarding Kratos and the next God of War game in the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFFHG7oPngE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming's weekly podcast</a>. </p>



<p>Henderson was discussing with the others the likelihood that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored 2.5D Metroidvania spin-off</a> would be announced at the next State of Play (rumored to take place before the end of September). The leaker then remarked that Sony Santa Monica is also working on a new mainline entry, adding that Kratos would be equipped with a brand new weapon from ancient Egypt.</p>



<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There's some weird confusion because there is the Metroidvania game in development and then there's also a new mainline God of War game in development, which is kind of similar in themes. I think that Kratos this time has an Egyptian sword, you know, like the curved Egyptian sword. I can't remember what they are called, but I think like what Prince of Persia's got or whatever.</em></p>



<p>Henderson appears to be referring to the Khopesh, a sickle-shaped sword that evolved in Egypt from battle axes. It would be a new weapon for Kratos, but more to the point, it would indirectly imply a potential Egyptian setting. After all, why would there be an Egyptian sword if that wasn't the case? The Norse duology added fitting weapons like the Leviathan Axe, a weapon historically favored by nordic warriors.</p>



<p>It's not first time that the Egyptian setting has been attached to God of War. Before the release of the 2018 installment, Game Director Cory Barlog said that, after the Norse saga, future games could feature either Egyptian or Mayan mythology. </p>



<p>It's already been three years since the release of Ragnarök. However, if the rumor about the smaller Metroidvania game is correct, chances are the next big main installment is a bit further away. Still, in the meantime, fans have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video adaptation</a> to look forward to. The first season is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start filming in March 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Would you like for Sony Santa Monica to choose Egypt as the next God of War setting?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/say-no-to-100-speakers-this-anker-alternative-is-nearly-free-on-amazon-2000627456</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium brands love charging $100, $200, even $300 for Bluetooth speakers but a lot of the time, you’re paying for the label more than the performance. If you want real bang for your buck, the <strong>Anker Soundcore 2</strong> is a fantastic choice. Now, with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4189/">Amazon dropping the price from $45 to just $29, this deal is too good to pass up</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4189/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Pocket Powerhouse That Delivers Where It Counts</h2>
<p>The Soundcore 2 isn’t your average small speaker: Inside its <strong>compact body hides a powerful 12W output</strong>, delivered through dual neodymium drivers engineered to produce rich sound even at higher volumes. One of its standout features is the BassUp technology which selectively boosts low frequencies in real time and makes bass tones punchier without causing distortion.</p>
<p>One of the big concerns when buying a portable speaker is durability and resistance to weather conditions: The <strong>Soundcore 2 handles that with an IPX7 rating of waterproofing</strong>. It’s a level of protection that can keep it underwater for full submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. It also makes it easy to clean it up—just wash off and go.</p>



<p>Anker’s famed power management combined with a 5,200mAh lithium-ion battery<strong> lets this speaker run for up to 24 hours on a single charge</strong>. That’s enough to last a full day of work or travel without constantly hunting for an outlet. Plus, <strong>fast charge technology</strong> means you’re back to full power quickly and makes it ready for your next adventure.</p>
<p>Portability is never sacrificed: Tipping the scales at <strong>about half a pound </strong>and measuring small enough to fit into backpacks, purses, or big pockets with ease, it fits easily in your pocket. The looks are clean and minimalist, and the controls are uncomplicated enough that anyone can become familiar with them quickly. And talking of Bluetooth, the new <strong>Bluetooth 5.0 standard ensures reliable and low-latency connections</strong> with your device and improved range.</p>
<p>If expensive Bluetooth speakers are out of your budget, then this Anker Soundcore 2 deal shows you don’t have to take out a second mortgage on a quality portable speaker that’s rugged, sounds great, and plays all day on one battery charge.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Avast is one of the true giants in cybersecurity today, trusted by over 435 million users worldwide. As a core part of Gen Digital (which also owns Norton, AVG and Ccleaner), the company has long been synonymous with free antivirus software. However, in the face of increasingly aggressive and sophisticated cyber threats, Avast has evolved: The days of relying on freeware antivirus are numbered; Avast is now leading the way with robust pay-for security solutions that are <strong>designed to guard all devices and every corner of a user’s online life</strong>.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity landscape in 2025 is overwhelming. Microsoft and Identity Theft Resource Center data show that more than 600 million cyberattacks took place globally per day throughout last year. Nearly two billion people had data exposed in breaches. The bad guys aren’t even just going after big business: the primary targets are regular folk, with cyber thieves going far beyond mere viruses to steal identities, bank account data, and more using sophisticated malware and fraud.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Identity</h2>
<p>With insight into the reality of rising threats, Avast has grown beyond mere status as the free antivirus pioneer to an all-out defender of PCs, Macs, Androids, and iOS devices through advanced protection that keeps up with the cybercrime tools of the modern age. Paid subscriptions include a smarter and more comprehensive solution, way beyond yesteryear malware scanning.</p>
<p>A premium choice is <strong>Avast Premium Security</strong>. At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">a massive 60% discount dropping the first year down to a mere $31 (previous price being $78)</a>, it’s an affordable option that secures one device with premium features. Members are provided with virus, ransomware and phishing protection. It scans Wi-Fi networks to detect vulnerabilities and ensures your digital life remains unscratched by bandits looking to exploit your system. Regardless if you’re a PC, Mac, Android, or Apple user, this offer gives you the essential and robust security.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Avast Premium Security</a></p>
<p>Add more, and <strong>Avast Ultimate</strong> has it all from Premium Security with extras such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/avast-vpn-vs-nordvpn">the Avast SecureLine VPN</a>, which encrypts your internet connection to shield your surfing and keep it private. For $43 after a discount of 60% compared to $109, you get Cleanup Premium as well which maintains your devices in smoother operation by clearing out garbage and streamlining their performance. AntiTrack technology silently in the background prevents trackers and conceals your online identity from snoopers’ view, an essential privacy feature in today’s data-driven world.</p>
<p>In a world where hacks and scams get increasingly formidable by the minute and the consequences of compromised data pile up,<strong> Avast’s premium security subscriptions are basic insurance</strong>. They give you so much more than traditional antivirus solutions: <strong>they safeguard your entire digital existence</strong> and provide you with the comfort of mind not just for yourself but for your family and devices as well.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/776873/henry-halfhead-review-pc-ps5-switch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/henry-halfhead-is-full-of-heart.1303311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In <em>Henry Halfhead</em>, you play through the life of a person named Henry. But there are a couple twists. Henry is only half of a head — just eyes, ears, nose, and the top of their head — meaning they move around by sliding on the floor and jumping up and down. Also, Henry can possess everyday objects. It’s a strange concept, but the developers at Lululu Entertainment use the goofy ideas to tell a poignant story and have a <em>lot</em> of fun along the way.</p><p>The game starts with Henry as a baby in their nursery, bouncing around the room to wreak havoc. As you play, you’ll progress to different rooms and age up through different stages of Henry’s life, and the ability to possess basically every object you can see lets you get into all sorts of trouble at every age. I particularly liked a sequence where I had to attempt to set candles on a birthday cake to celebrate my own third birthday. As a school-aged kid, I helped Henry make a mess in the classroom.</p><p>The objects are all placed in such a way to invite you to tinker with them and treat everything like a big virtual playroom. Despite my tendency to break plates or scatter items around haphazardly, I never ran into any way to “lose,” which really encouraged me to experiment with things and not worry about anything “bad” happening.</p><p>The bright graphics, goofy sounds (especially Henry’s “yips” when hopping from place to place), and an omniscient British narrator all added to the charming and inviting environment. If the controlled whimsy all sounds a little bit like <em>Katamari Damacy</em>, it’s a clear inspiration; at one point, I found a radio on a shelf that looks just <em>Katamari</em>’s iconic green protagonist, and one section of <em>Henry Halfhead</em> had Henry rolling around as a laundry-collecting ball.</p><p>As you might have guessed about a game chronicling somebody’s entire life, <em>Henry Halfhead</em> can get a little real. Without getting into the details, a good chunk of the game takes place during Henry’s soul-crushing adult job, and the final chapter of the game stars an elderly Henry. You can probably guess what happens before the credits roll.</p><p>But the broader message of the whole game is all about being creative, trying new things, and celebrating joy where you can. At the end of my two-hour playthrough, I was a little emotional that my journey with Henry was over, but I’m inspired to channel Henry’s silliness into my own life.</p><p><sup>Henry Halfhead<em> is available now on PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.</em></sup></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/776873/henry-halfhead-review-pc-ps5-switch#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/776873/henry-halfhead-review-pc-ps5-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-amazon-ipad-alternative-has-no-weak-points-and-sells-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-2000627453</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-amazon-ipad-alternative-has-no-weak-points-and-sells-for-pennies-on-the-dollar.1303308/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not everybody can afford $500 or $1,000 for an iPad or iPad Pro, but if seeking a decent everyday use alternative, <strong>Amazon’s Fire HD tablets</strong> are certainly well worth a look. They cover all the bases for general use and currently, Amazon is discounting the price by nearly 40% so the <strong>Fire HD 10</strong> is pretty much impossible to ignore: At a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/">price that has dropped to $89 from $140</a>, it’s a chance to enjoy a quality tablet without the usual premium.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Tablet that Gets Big Features at a Budget Price</h2>
<p>The Fire HD 10 has <strong>prioritized speed and simplicity</strong> with 25% more performance than its previous generation through an octa-core processor and 3 GB of RAM. It means streaming, reading, browsing and gaming all happen without frustrating lags or delays. Its <strong>10.1-inch full HD screen is rich with clean 1080p images</strong> and brings colors and details in sharp brightness. Whether binge-watching your favorite <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/netflix">Netflix</a> shows or flying through work, the screen makes every frame count.</p>



<p>Battery life is a smart friend in this case as it <strong>lasts up to 13 hours of normal usage</strong>. Yes, extended trips or days without a plug will not leave you stranded. Storing-wise, <strong>there’s 32 GB as base</strong> (expandable with a microSD card up to 1 TB), a whole book collection of apps, videos, and books in your hands. The aluminosilicate reinforced glass toughens the screen and withstands drops better than most of the competition, including the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8.</p>
<p>The 5 MP front-facing camera is a welcome added feature for day-to-day video chats or social media content creation without needing to use special gear. And when inspiration strikes, the Fire HD 10 supports the Made for Amazon Stylus pen which recognizes over 4,000 levels of pressure for flowing, natural writing or drawing (bit it is sold separately).</p>
<p>If spending a big amount of money on an Apple tablet is not feasible but frequent use of a tablet is, this Fire HD 10 deal is difficult to pass up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable monitors are a game changer when you need some extra screen space but can’t lug around a bulky setup. Picture this: a screen that’s just a bit wider and heavier than a regular notebook in your backpack, giving you plenty of room to work or unwind wherever you are. This <strong>Arzopa 16.1″ portable monitor fits right into that sweet spot</strong>. And the best part? Amazon is running an early Prime Day deal that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4204/">slashes the price to about $76 after a 30% coupon, down from around $110</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4204/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger Screen and Brighter Colors</h2>
<p>This Arzopa design has also bumped up the screen size from 15.6 inches (which is typical for so many portable monitors) to 16.1 inches. That extra inch of screen space makes more of a difference than you might think: i<strong>t gives you a more natural 16:9 ratio</strong> that is easier on the eyes and perfect for streaming your favorite shows.</p>
<p>Quality is not just a matter of size. The monitor uses an I<strong>PS panel with crisp 1080p full HD resolution</strong>. It also gains color accuracy with a comprehensive 100% sRGB gamut that renders images with rich, real-life colors. Thanks to a 1000:1 contrast ratio, dark areas are deep and detailed and the light areas glow, a wonderful option for anything from creative work to Netflix bingeing.</p>



<p><strong>At 1.7 pounds and 0.35 inches thin</strong>, this monitor is easily stashed away in bags. Its slivers of a bezel pack more screen into smaller space, and the <strong>fold-out kickstand</strong> so you don’t require any other hardware to prop it up.</p>
<p><strong>Both USB-C and mini HDMI connections</strong> let you plug it into laptops, phones, game systems, and more at a snap. There are a few display options like duplicate, extend, or as a second display, so you can configure your workflow or entertainment center without a single hassle. Plug and play is trouble-free as it plays right away out of the box.</p>
<p>If you’ve been craving a little more screen real estate, this early Prime Day deal is a perfect chance to grab one of the most premium portable monitor without a hefty price tag.</p>

            <p>Xbox consoles are about to become more expensive in the United States. Again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">The hike comes just months after Microsoft raised prices of its products in May</a>, when the Xbox Series S and X increased by between $80 and $130, depending on the spec. While May's cost hike was felt across the world, this time the increase is limited to the U.S., with Microsoft <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">confirming</a>: "Pricing in countries outside the U.S. remains the same".</p>
<p>The prices for controllers, headsets, and products "in all other markets" also remain as they were.</p>

<p>Here's how the price changes impact the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/xboxconsoles?icid=XboxConsoles_Header_AllConsoles_CTA">Xbox console range in the U.S.</a> when they go live on 3rd October:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox Series S 512: $399.99 (up $20 from $379.99)</li>
<li>Xbox Series S 1TB: $449.99 (up $20 from $429.99)</li>
<li>Xbox Series X Digital: $599.99 (up $50 from $549.99)</li>
<li>Xbox Series X: $649.99 (up $50 from $599.99)</li>
<li>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition: $799.99 (up $70 from $729.99)</li>
</ul>
<p>"Beginning on 3rd October, we will update the recommended retailer pricing for Series S and Series X consoles in the United States due to changes in the macroeconomic environment," Microsoft explained.</p>
<p>"We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and providing value for Xbox players."</p>
<p>Microsoft did not justify the price rise, but it's possible the current U.S. administration's import tariffs have had some bearing. That said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off"> the company reported an 18 percent boost in profits at its last earnings call</a>, and a 13 percent increase across its Xbox business.</p><p>If recent reports are true, we likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">won't be seeing Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console until 2027</a> at the earliest.

              <p>Portable power stations are<strong> basically power banks amplified</strong> designed to charge all your devices and even serve as back-up power in case of a power outage. They’re really handy, surprisingly light and convenient to take with you wherever you go. Today, on the eve of Prime Day,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/"> Amazon has slashed the price on the Jackery Explorer 1000 (v2) to an all-time low of only $448, down from its normal $799</a> which is a fantastic deal for anyone looking for trustworthy portable power on the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Power Bank That Travels Everywhere</h2>
<p>The Jackery Explorer 1000 is a portable powerhouse that can pack serious punch without weighing you down. Its 1,070Wh LiFePO4 battery life means you have enough juice to <strong>power multiple appliances like your AC unit, refrigerator, or electric stove</strong>, making it a camp lifesaver, road trip companion or emergency power outage rescuer. All that power and yet it <strong>only weighs 23.8 pounds</strong> and comes with a foldable handle so you can simply grab and leave whenever.</p>
<p>One of the things that is truly awesome is the <strong>1,500W continuous AC output and 3,000W surge power</strong> which makes it possible for it to start devices that need a pre-initial power boost and keep them running effectively. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver which allows you to charge the entire device from zero to full in as little as one hour when you’re using emergency charging through the Jackery App. Typically, <strong>the unit charges in approximately 1.7 hours</strong> to maintain battery health, trading speed for smart care with the advanced ChargeShield 2.0 technology.</p>



<p>With <strong>two USB-C, one USB-A, a DC automobile port, and three true sine wave AC outlets</strong>, the Explorer 1000 can power an array of devices simultaneously (smartphones, laptops, cameras, and even small appliances). The 100W USB-C Power Delivery port assures rapid charging of compatible devices without requiring cumbersome power adapters, further enhancing the convenience in being able to go anywhere or respond to unforeseen power failures in your home.</p>
<p>If there was ever a time to take advantage of a portable power station that will never let you down, that time is now with this record-low price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158938/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>While not entirely dormant for the last 30 years, Yuzo Koshiro’s Ancient Corp — responsible for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/streets_of_rage_2">Streets of Rage II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/beyond_oasis">Story of Thor</a>, and the Master System’s superb <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> — is finally back in the public eye with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a>. What’s significant for the small studio is a return to the console that cemented it in the annals of gaming history.</p>
<p>Those who follow Koshiro on social media will know his love for the Mega Drive and its Motorola 68000 processor, and, as such, it is with great fanfare that Earthion has arrived to reignite Sega’s 16-bit powerhouse. Sort of. Intended for a physical release in the first instance, Ancient has instead decided to lead with modern formats to ensure the manufactured cartridge (ostensibly scheduled for 2026) is the best it can possibly be. This has already resulted in improved bullet visibility based on player feedback, and other tweaks via update.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158939/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For Nintendo Switch, then, Earthion works both beautifully in handheld (assuming you use anything other than the stock Joy-Con) and as a bigger, more arresting experience on the TV. Driven by precise emulation, Earthion is actually more the brainchild of Makoto Wada - a fact often drowned out by Koshiro’s celebrity status. Wada is the designer, programmer, planner, and overall director of the game, while Koshiro produces, adding in a blazing soundtrack and crunchy effects.</p>
<p>A clear labour of love, there are a lot of personal touches in Earthion, right down to the barrelled CRT and heavy shadow masking set as the startup screen filter. While pretty, this does make it a little tough for those new to the game to see everything that's going on. It's best, then, to go into the in-game menu and take advantage of one of the most granular and configurable scanline filters around, where you can change percentages by the digit for every aspect of the display.</p>
<p>What smacks you instantly is the game’s graphical bombast. Your craft, the YK-IIA (quite possibly representing someone’s initials), deployed by a mothership and blasting off on stage one, spins dynamically from the foreground to take its firing position amidst a booming space war of lasers and debris.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158943/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Koshiro's soundtrack ploughs you in, driving the action from one set-piece to the next in a game of near-constant variety. Giant mechs tear through space stations; lasers rip up through the floor of a technological, dinosaur-patrolled lost world; towering guardians rise from seething lava pits; and maddened alien monsters give chase through tight futuristic chicanes and sinewy, pulsating hives.</p>
<p>Bosses are profound — at one point stretching three-screens-tall — and come at you with smartly engineered attack patterns that only occasionally feel a touch haphazard. Moreover, the sheer number of regular enemy types is equally impressive, introducing small, medium, and large foes at breathless pace, ever-changing the game’s spots and continually keeping you on your toes. It’s hard to say if it can run so flicker and slowdown-free on real Mega Drive hardware, although beefed-up chipsets may do the job.</p>
<p>To help you deal with the barrage, the game employs multiple weapon options and a divisive regenerating shield system. Should you get pummelled too much when your shields are low and the warning is blaring, you’ll go up in flames; but, avoid damage for a brief period and that protective blue bar will work its way back to top-spec.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158940/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Earthion is engineered more around taking fire and surviving than absolute precision dodging — especially in its latter stages — and to some this may be irksome. But, with extended play, Earthion’s mechanics reveal themselves to work very well indeed, with the survival aspect nicely implemented around the increasingly dense flak. While at first it may seem complex, and you’re likely to go up in smoke early on, once you grasp the balancing it becomes both much easier and very encouraging to clear.</p>
<p>Wada’s ideas are unique and interesting. You start out with two shield bars, two weapon power bars, and two weapon slots. You can fill the swappable weapon slots with lasers, homing missiles, and twin-firing cannon pick-ups, amongst others, and, by grabbing green icons spilled from the destruction, you can keep those weapons chugging at their most powerful state.</p>
<p>Most important to the game’s strategy is the “Adaptation Pod” released at the tail-end of each stage. Grabbing this will occupy one weapon slot and has no in-play function, restricting you to a single actual weapon of choice to battle the boss. Should you manage to hold on to the Adaptation Pod (which is at risk of being destroyed should you take too much fire), it can then be spent at the mid-stage interval to upgrade your craft via a menu. Options here include adding additional shields, increasing max weapon power and slots, or even an extra life.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158942/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>How you choose to spend the Adaptation Pod is down to the player, although in reality there are better ways to apply them. From personal experience, whereby I managed to pin down two one-credit clears, the upgrades that seem most immediately beneficial (like extra lives) aren’t always best in the long-term.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Wada’s approach to Earthion is multi-functional. In a positive way, it feels markedly different from the genre norm, and lot of this is owed to how broad and unique the various weaponry is, and their distinct usefulness in certain sections. It's also designed to be friendlier to new audiences; not just through its several difficulty levels or mid-stage ship upgrades, but its password system - one that allows you to carry over boosted shields and weaponry to subsequent playthroughs. This is a nice, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/radiant_silvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a>-style augmentation that allows anyone the chance to complete the game through multiple attempts. For those who want to have at it traditionally, though, the password option can be comfortably ignored.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158937/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's worth noting, too, that the Switch version seems to have been toned down ever so slightly in its default difficulty. No doubt whatever changes have been made here have now also been patched through to the Steam version, resulting in a game that feels cleaner and easier to navigate than its initial release. It wasn't overly difficult to begin with, only sitting mid-range in terms of shoot-'em-up challenge, but some further fine-tuning has definitely occurred, removing certain popcorn enemies and refining some of the bullet spreads and speeds. Overall, it's now at its most enjoyable state.</p>
<p>Earthion is a game that may not click immediately. It looks and sounds fantastic, but its idiosyncrasies take a few runs to adjust to. To that end, it requires time to grow on you. Once it clicks, you'll find yourself engrossed in strategising a path to victory, and the wonderful risk-reward of the Adaptation Pod. It’s full of neat elements, including safe spots and techniques, where the more unlikely, less obvious weapons can prove advantageous in certain areas. There are multiple methods of approach for bosses, and there are several extra lives dotted about to keep you in play.</p>
<figure><a title="Earthion Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158941/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What it does brilliantly is in its constant inventiveness, requiring the learning of the smallest of enemies to the largest of bosses; and its final third is thoroughly climactic. It has a big-budget, arcade feel to it, and really nice introduction and ending sequences.</p>
<p>It is, however, imperfect overall, with Wada’s creative enterprising never quite hitting that absolute shoot-'em-up adrenaline high, that pocket of euphoria that comes from pure and perfect dodges, near misses, and glorious untouched victories. The bullets can still be difficult to spot in places, and will often tag you because of it, and the soundtrack — while top-notch by Mega Drive standards — doesn't excel beyond the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gleylancer">Gleylancer</a>, <strong>Thunder Force III</strong>, or the more recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/andro_dunos_2">Andro Dunos 2</a>.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Earthion is a terrific piece of work. It's more an accomplished production, arguably, than a shoot 'em up of incredible highs, but at the same time, that’s part of its charm. It has a different feel thanks to its shield system and mid-stage upgrade rungs, and this is a refreshing and welcome change from the norm. Much of the fun is in figuring out the order of bolstering your ship and the little tricks that various weaponry affords when faced with tricky junctures. It does some things other shoot 'em ups don’t do, and is all the more standout for it.</p>
<p>At the same time, it fails to achieve some things that other shoot 'em ups do so well. Nonetheless, Earthion is a treat of a game: a bold new Mega Drive work that sits in the upper echelons of the console's broad catalogue, and shouldn't be passed up by fans of the genre or wonderful 16-bit works.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having a Xbox but not enough controllers kind of kills the fun, especially when playing with friends and family. What makes the console truly cool is those multiplayer moments, and nothing beats sharing the game with extra controllers on hand. The catch? Controllers aren’t always the easiest or cheapest to grab. That’s why timing your buy is key, and right now there’s a Black Friday-level deal on Amazon that’s too good to miss: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">latest Xbox wireless gaming controller is available for $53, down from its original $64</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Contemporary Design Coupled with Comforting Play and Intelligent Features</h2>
<p>Its modernized design features sculpted surfaces and refined geometry that fit comfortably in your hands, and keeps you gaming longer without fatigue. The textured grip on the triggers, bumpers and back case is there to make sure your fingers stay steady and controlled. And the new hybrid D-pad adds precise directional control which is a big deal whether you’re navigating tricky menus or battling opponents.</p>
<p>The <strong>Share button is perhaps the best feature of them all since it lets you snap and share your gameplay</strong>—screenshots, video, whatever—without breaking stride. It’s a simple way to share with friends or easily record your best victories.</p>



<p>The controller supports Xbox Wireless and Bluetooth which makes it simple to connect to many devices. If you’re playing on your Xbox console, alternating to playing with your Windows computer, launching games on Android or iOS, or even attaching it with Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs, or VR headsets, this controller lags behind none. With so much flexibility, you won’t need to keep multiple different controllers occupying valuable space.</p>
<p>And, to boot, players also have a lot of selection with sound: The <strong>3.5mm headset jack</strong> will work with any supported headset, so you can simply plug in and talk or be completely enveloped in the game’s sound. The <strong>USB-C port</strong> lets you plug directly into your Xbox or PC for plug-and-play installation which is perfect if you are enthusiastic about a wired connection or charging during gaming.</p>
<p>All things considered, snagging this controller at $53 is a smart move whether you’re replacing an older one or expanding your multiplayer setup.</p>

platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler 0 will be available on the majority of current platforms: Xbox Series, PlayStation 4 and 5, Switch and Switch 2, and PC.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler 0 story, setting, and characters</h2><p dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler 0 is loosely based on the mobile game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/octopath-traveler-champions-of-the-continent/">Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent.</a> It takes place on Orsterra, the same setting as CotC and the original Octopath Traveler. During the Day of Reverence ceremony in Wishvale, the city is attacked and razed to the ground, leaving your created character with the task of both rebuilding and seeking revenge on those responsible.</p><p dir="ltr">The reveal trailer introduces a few story characters: Stia, an Architect who is the player character's childhood friend; Phenn, a watchful Huntsman; and Laurana, a Cleric. Square Enix claims that there will be over 30 playable characters in total, and they will all have some unique abilities. Further character reveals include Celsus the thief, Alexia the Scholar, Ludo the Merchant, Viator the Warrior, and Macy the Apothecary. Antagonists that have been revealed so far include Herminia, the Covetous Witch; Tytos, the Hero; and Auguste, the Playwright.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Octopath Traveler 0 gameplay</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler 0 inherits much of the freeform exploration gameplay of previous titles. There's no set, linear route you'll be required to take from beginning to end, though certain areas may be easier than others depending on your party composition, skills, and equipment. You'll be able to interact with NPCs through various, character-specific Path Actions, such as Entreat (asking NPCs to give you items) and Inquire (pressing NPCs to give you more information). One of the new Path Actions we know is in the game is Invite, which allows you to attempt to bring an NPC to live in your town.</p><p dir="ltr">Enemy encounters occur randomly in certain areas, though there are some encounters that are visible on the map--including challenging elite-tier enemies that require some extra power and strategy to take down.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Octopath Traveler 0 combat</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Like the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/octopath-traveler-review-divide-and-conquer/1900-6416941/">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/octopath-traveler-2-review-go-your-own-way/1900-6418036/">its sequel</a>, Octopath Traveler 0 features turn-based combat in which you aim to strategically target enemy weaknesses to break down their "shields." When their shields hit 0, they enter a weakened stun state, allowing you a prime opportunity for a big attack. You can also choose to use a Boost during a character's turn to enhance their skills' effectiveness. What makes OT0's combat different is that up to eight characters can join in, up from four in OT and OT2. The front-row characters are active in combat, while the back-row team provides various boosts. You can switch characters between rows in battle, as well, opening up new strategies. For more details on combat, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-looks-massive-even-by-octopath-standards/1100-6534403/">read our Octopath Traveler 0 Gamescom preview. </a></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Octopath Traveler 0's new features</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Some big new mechanics have been introduced in Octopath Traveler 0. One such new element is town-building, which you'll use to reconstruct Wishdale. In this mode, you'll use materials to place and build structures. As you play, you can recruit characters who will aid in rebuilding in various ways, such as staffing facilities. You can also upgrade these facilities through quests. For more details on town-building, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-looks-massive-even-by-octopath-standards/1100-6534403/">our Octopath Traveler 0 preview from Gamescom. </a></p><p dir="ltr">The other big feature is character creation and customization, which we detail below.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How character creation works in Octopath Traveler 0</strong></h2><p>Since all of its characters are drawn in 2D pixel art, character creation in Octopath Traveler 0 is a bit different from many of the 3D titles that offer the feature. You'll be able to select a base gender, small facial details (eye appearance and color), hairstyle and hair color, skin tone, victory/action poses, voice, and name. Going from the trailer, you'll also be able to choose a starting Learned Skill (likely similar to Hikari's mechanic in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/octopath-traveler-2-review-go-your-own-way/1900-6418036/">Octopath Traveler II</a>), starting job, a favorite food (which gives specific stat boosts), and starting gear.</p>

		<p>There’s a hefty bit of DIY ahead of me this weekend, but I’ll have to try and squeeze in some gaming for some reviews of some upcoming releases. That and watching the Formula 1 from Baku means I have plenty to keep me occupied!</p>

		<p>Dying Light: The Beast has to be the week’s biggest release, with zombie hunter Kyle Crane returning to parkour his way across an all-new open world, while bashing in the heads of the undead in a variety of grisly ways. While there have been a few reports of instabilities in the launch build, Techland have got right on it, and immediately dropped patch 1.2. Here’s what it fixes!</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qsqBCs7o5go?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

</ul>
<h4>Ragdolls &amp; physics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Overhauled ragdoll behavior: more realistic rooftop falls and natural corpse physics.</li>
<li>Polished hit reaction transitions to remove janky interruptions.</li>
<li>Zombie “flavor” behaviors</li>
<li>Added new atmospheric details, such as zombies banging their heads against locked doors.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stability &amp; Bug Fixes</h4>

</ul>
<p>The team at Techland also let us know that there are going to be even more improvements made to the game over this weekend, and as soon as we have the details for that, we’ll let you know.</p>
<p>Gamoc is currently working through our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/dying-light-the-beast-review/">Dying Light: The Beast Review</a>, but his early impressions have been very good. He says, “It’s a return to the classic tone and style of Dying Light. This feels more like the truer sequel to Dying Light I was expecting, one that’s focused on the zombies and being terrifying instead of everything being about how humans are bad – we get enough of that in the real world these days. Dying Light: The Beast is tough and brutal whilst the suns up, and after sunset it’s just tension and terror. I’m not finished yet, but The Beast is mostly the game I wanted it to be.”</p>

		<p>Microsoft is raising the price of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> consoles in the US, with increases of between $20 and $70 depending on the model coming into effect from 3rd October. With a $50 price increase for the main Xbox Series X, the console is set to be a staggering $150 more expensive than it was at launch in 2020.</p>
<p>The new prices are to be as follows:</p>


<ul>
<li>Xbox Series S 512GB – $399.99, up from $379.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series S 1TB – $449.99, up from $429.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series X Digital – $599.99, up from $549.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series X – $649.99, up from $599.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition –$799.99, up from $729.99</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing for headsets and controllers are remaining unchanged at this time, but all of these prices are being adjust upward from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/01/xbox-series-xs-console-prices-are-jumping-up-around-the-world-games-to-hit-80-this-winter/">price hikes made back in May</a>.</p>
<p>In t<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">he support page</a> detailing the changes, Microsoft blamed “changes in the macroeconomic environment.”</p>
<p>They continued, “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and providing value for Xbox players.”</p>

<p>Thankfully the rest of the world is unaffected, and so it seems that the root cause of these particular price increases is the tariffs that have been implemented by the US administration. Given how wildly these have swung up and down at the whims of a capricious President – to put it mildly – and how exemptions have come in and out of effect, it’s taken around half a year for tariffs to have a directly felt effect.</p>
<p>The daft thing about all of this is that, while Microsoft relies on Chinese manufacturing and is passing the tariff prices onto its customers, it is an American company that is now at a serious price disadvantage when compared to both its main Japanese rival. Sony has had their own price increases in the last few years – also <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">raising US console prices by $50 across the board in August</a> – but the standard PS5 with disc drive stands at $550, making it $100 cheaper than the Xbox Series X. Even more ridiculous is that the PS5 Pro is $749. That is $50 <em>less</em> than the 2TB Xbox Series X, but the PS5 Pro the better, more powerful console! I know the Xbox is a “special edition”, but come on.</p>

<figure><a title="Metroid Dread" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a9fba4d700ec/metroid-dread.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well hello there. Welcome. It's the weekend, and that means you're keen to see what we're going to be playing over the next couple of days while divulging your own plans. Before you do so, however, let's just recap the last handful of days.</p>
<p>First up, Nintendo announced that it would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-gba-library-with-two-more-titles">expanding its GBA app</a> with two new titles on NSO next week, so that's pretty cool. The company also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-showcases-every-switch-and-switch-2-direct-game-in-new-infographic">reiterated its recent Direct announcements</a> with the usual handy infographic. Lots of cool stuff coming out, y'all.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/it-was-a-bit-of-a-perplexing-experience-hideki-kamiya-on-the-fan-reaction-to-bayonetta-3">voiced his thoughts</a> around the reception to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>, ensuring to apply his learnings to the development of the <strong>Okami Sequel</strong>. Plus, we were treated to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2-gets-a-seven-minute-overview-trailer">pretty extensive overview trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> on the Switch, and it's looking very tasty.</p>
<p>Finally, we provided our final thoughts on both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> DLC, so be sure to check those out if you're on the fence.</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I am going to wrap myself up in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a> on Switch 2 as much as I can. I'm on my own for the next few days, you see, so it's gonna be 24/7 rage-quitting online matches and looking up soccer rules in disbelief for me, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Oh, and I can't stop playing Silksong. But I don't imagine I'm particularly unique in that just now. Have a nice weekend, and should we cross paths on the FC 26 early access field of battle over the next 48hrs or thereabouts, well, honestly, I hope you get a proper stuffing, mate.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I could say "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> plus X and Y" as I have the past few weeks, but really it's just going to be Hollow Knight. I just found the double-jump and the downward-smash in quick succession, and I'm eager to crack on and make proper progress towards the endgame. <em>Newsflash!</em> It's good. It's not blowing my mind, but it feels great (man, I wish I had that Switch 2 Pro Controller, though!) and, more to the point, I'm still playing it after 20 hours. It's doing something right.</p>
<p>But yeah, I'm eager to finish. GOTY will be here before you know it.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm getting very excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, folks. So I've gone back to play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a> one more time before Retro's latest drops in December. It's like comfort food for me, it's just too good.</p>
<p>I'd like to say I'm playing something else, but that's pretty much it! Truth be told, I'm eager to dive into <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> next week on PS5, so I'm holding off on playing anything too substantial in the meantime.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was a very lucky boy and got both <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> for my birthday this week, two short little games that I could probably breeze through in a weekend (hahaha… <strong><em>gulp</em></strong>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, both have sat on the sideline since I pulled them from their brightly coloured wrapping paper because Silksong is eating up <em>all of my free time.</em></p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I’m in a post-Silksong slump. I’m actually fighting back the urge to do a second playthrough or a Steel Soul run right now. But no, I have to get ready for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>’s 1.0 launch, so naturally, it’s time to start afresh in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> and see how much recent muscle-memory will screw me over.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I still have a ton of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> games to check out, but I cannot put Magic Garden down. I’m so close to getting the cherry and all achievements on it, and it’s so fun and moreish. Enjoy your weekend, folks!</p>

<h2>Zion Grassl, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This is a big weekend for me! After nearly a decade of saying “This is the year I’m going to play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>” it’s finally happening. I’m currently hunting down the last few Chozo Artifacts (which have been a huge pain in the morphball to find) and thankfully <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/metroid-prime-remastered-all-artifact-locations">Ollie’s guide</a> here on Nintendo Life is keeping me sane!</p>
<p>I’ll probably wrap this up over the weekend, but there’s also the off chance that I play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> all weekend as you can now pilot the Power Rangers Megazord from now until October 3rd! I just unlocked the Green Ranger skin from the battle pass too! Young Zion is freaking out right now. I want to savour this moment for as long as I can, but honestly I wish these Fortnite events didn’t have an end date. Why can’t they run year round, as maybe a separate game mode?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Well, that's what we have planned for this most Mario of weekends, but what about you? Let us know your weekend picks in the following poll.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-film-original-story-leon-wont-be-there/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-film-will-be-an-original-story-and-leon-won%E2%80%99t-be-there-says-director.1303230/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New details about the upcoming Resident Evil film are starting to pour in. Just a few days ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-bird-star-joins-zach-creggar-resident-evil-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that actor Paul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai, Black Bird, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, The Naked Gun) would join the cast. Now, movie director Zach Cregger (Barbarian, Weapons) <a href="https://ew.com/resident-evil-movie-entirely-original-story-set-game-world-zach-cregger-exclusive-11812968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has spoken with Entertainment Weekly</a> about the adaptation, revealing that it will be an entirely original story and, despite fan speculation, Leon Kennedy from the games won't be there.</p>



<p><em>It's an entirely original story. When you watch it, you'll be like, 'This is very Zach.' It's just it takes place in the Resident Evil world. I don't think fans of the games are gonna be bummed. I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story. I think that would be presumptuous. But I respect the games enough where I'm gonna like tell a Resident Evil story in the Resident Evil canon that still leaves everything they love intact from the games, you know what I mean?</em></p>



<p><em>I think that when you see it, you'll understand how I can be obsessed with original ideas and still make a movie that is an IP-based thing. I know that doesn't make a lot of sense now, but I hope that it will later.</em></p>



<p>We only know the very basics of this original story based on the synopsis. Apparently, a 'hapless courier' is sent to deliver a package to a remote hospital and soon finds himself caught in the middle of an outbreak and must battle hordes of mutated creatures to survive. The courier is probably going to be played by Austin Abrams, who was the first actor to be confirmed for the Resident Evil movie. Abrams has been featured in This Is Us, Euphoria, Wolfs, and Weapons.</p>



<p>This will be the third film saga based on CAPCOM's survival horror IP. The first and most famous is the series of six movies directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, starring Milla Jovovich. In 2021, there was an attempted reboot with <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-welcome-to-raccoon-city-director-says-the-most-challenging-part-was-living-up-to-zombie-movies-legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</a>, which was more faithful than Anderson's movies to the games but still largely failed to captivate critics and fans. The following year, a way less faithful TV series adaptation was released on Netflix; it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-tv-series-canceled-by-netflix-after-one-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> after the first season.</p>



<p>Cregger's new Resident Evil film will debut in theaters on September 18, 2026. Meanwhile, a brand new game installment, Requiem, will be released on February 27, 2026. You can find our Gamescom 2025 hands-on preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here's what the critics had to say</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6fe86fde20c08/sonic-racing-crossworlds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is out next week on multiple platforms and the first lot of reviews have now gone live.</p>
<p>If you are curious to know how this new experience generally holds up, this round up should help. When we hear more about the Switch version, we'll let you know. The Switch 2 version is also scheduled to arrive at a later date and will be available as a paid upgrade for the existing Switch release.</p>
<p>So, here are the impressions of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds so far:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/sonic-racingcrossworlds/">VGC - 4/5</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"CrossWorlds is a brilliant karting game with satisfying handling, a fun portal mechanic and useful customisation options. Its weapons aren't as punchy as we'd like and it's unclear how it's going to keep players' attention long-term but it's a genuine, more traditional alternative to Mario Kart now that Nintendo's pointed its series in new direction."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jmiusk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review/">GamesRadar+ - 4/5</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is a slick, ambitious racer with loads of tracks, primed and ready for future, licensed crossovers. At first too slow and then suddenly extremely fast, the racing lacks finesse, but it gets better as you play. A strong offering that's compulsively playable, but a bit grindy in single-player and not quite S-tier on the track."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">IGN - 9/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds fires on all cylinders with a fantastic roster of 24 of my favorite hedgehogs, foxes, echidnas, and more. The lineup of 24 main tracks and 15 Crossworld tracks is the best designed selection we've ever gotten in any Sonic racing game, and there is a generationally great soundtrack to accompany them. The racing itself feels fast, fantastic, and intuitive, with lots of options to tweak your stats to your preferred playstyle."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review-an-arcade-kart-racer-for-gearheads/1900-6418408/">GameSpot - 7/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Altogether, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is a solid package. The single-player modes, meta-goals like collecting gear and vehicle parts, and wealth of customization options to experiment with different play styles, make it easy to recommend for players who like their kart racing with a little more mechanical complexity. Even with slightly underwhelming online offerings, it's easy to see how Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has plenty of road ahead of it."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/a-new-dimension-of-kart-racing">Game Informer - 8.5/10</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds offers some exciting twists on the tried-and-true kart-racing formula, making for a streamlined experience that wastes no time getting you into the action. Though there’s substantially less content and replayability than its primary contemporary, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is concise and effective in its mission, offering the most well-rounded kart racer of the year."</p>

<p>A free DLC is "coming soon"</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Rune Factory Story of Seasons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59cdc253d16c1/rune-factory-story-of-seasons.large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> got off to a solid start, with Marvelous revealing the RPG spin-off had already shipped more than 500,000 copies as of August.</p>
<p>Now, in another update, a special collaboration with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> has been announced. This will be a free DLC and is "coming soon", so expect "more details" soon.</p>

<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar was released on the Switch and Switch 2 in August, and we called it the farming series' best remake yet. Guardians of Azuma arrived on both of these platforms in June and we thought the experience was "near-perfect" on the new Nintendo system.</p>
