It’s refreshing after seeing <em>Overwatch 2</em> sand off all its edges in pursuit of being the main esports hero shooter on the market. However, the hope that the wonkiness would last felt like a pipe dream for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, as NetEase was eventually going to have to put out some balance changes that would tone down some of the shenanigans. However, now we have the details on the first balance patch launching alongside the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-fantastic-four-patch-notes-map-1851733602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-fantastic-four-patch-notes-map-1851733602"><em>Fantastic Four</em>-focused season</a></span> and it contains just the right amount of tweaks, offering some encouragement for the game’s future.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>NetEase released the full patch notes after teasing them earlier this week as it rolled out information about Season 1. Some of the previously announced hero changes are here, such as the nerfs for Hela and Hawkeye and the buffs for Venom and Captain America, but there’s also a handful of smaller tweaks to a large swath of the roster. I’d still argue Cap needs a bit more damage to his kit if he’s going to be a brawler and that Hela’s minimal health reduction is not enough, but it’s probably the right approach to make some light changes here and there instead of turning the dial too far in either direction.</p><p>Individual heroes got rebalanced, but several Team-Up abilities also got some buffs. Almost all of the ones affected received perks of some kind, whether that be in shorter cooldowns or increased damage output. The full notes patch read as follows:</p><h2 id="h124878"><a id=""></a><strong>VANGUARD</strong></h2><p><strong>Captain America</strong><br><em>Steve will receive some enhanced survivability, allowing more frequent entering and exiting of the combat.</em><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Reduce the delay time for shield restoration after releasing Living Legend from 3s to 2s.</em></li><li><em>Reduce Liberty Rush cooldown from 12s to 10s.</em></li><li><em>Increase base health from 650 to 675.</em></li><li><em> Reduce the energy cost for releasing Freedom Charge (ultimate ability) from 3400 to 3100; Reduce the additional health provided per second to self after releasing it from 110 to 100.</em></li></ul><p><strong>Doctor Strange</strong><br><em>We’ll be reducing the threat range and increasing the defense window of the Sorcerer Supreme.</em><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Add damage falloff to Maelstrom of Madness and Gamma Maelstrom.

But the Steam Deck wasn’t powered by Windows as most gaming PCs are these days. Instead, it was powered by SteamOS, a Linux-based, gaming-focused operating system that made it easier than ever to buy, install, and play almost any PC game on the portable device. And it’s SteamOS—and Valve’s dedication to making a gaming-focused OS—that made the Steam Deck a big hit. </p><h2 id="h48282"><a id=""></a>SteamOS is the reason the Steam Deck is popular</h2><p>Companies had tried to do handheld gaming PCs (not laptops) before Valve. One example would be the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPD_Win&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPD_Win" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPD Win</a></span>, which featured a full keyboard and built-in Xbox controls. It could play games, but it ran on Windows, and felt clunky and slow. Other Windows- or Linux-based handheld PC were similarly clunky, hard to use, and often expensive. </p><p>The Steam Deck succeeded because it’s dead simple and easy to use, thanks to SteamOS and its compatibility features. Nearly any Steam game you already own, besides VR stuff, can work on the Steam Deck. And, in most cases, you won’t have to do much of anything to get it running. You use the easy-to-navigate menus of SteamOS to select a game, install it, and hit play. That’s it. </p><p>In the years since Valve released the Steam Deck and its slick operating system, other companies like Lenovo and ROG have released Steam-Deck-like competitors. And while many of these devices are more powerful than the Steam Deck, none of them include SteamOS, instead running on Windows 11. As a result, these devices are harder to use and clunkier. And sure, the companies behind them have tried to add their own software to make things easier, but it’s never quite as simple as the Steam Deck It’s that simplicity that allowed a lot of people who didn’t consider themselves PC gamers to buy a Steam Deck and enjoy it anyway as a straightforward, console-like experience.</p><h2 id="h48283"><a id=""></a>Microsoft let Valve create and then dominate the market</h2><p>During all of this, Microsoft had a chance to potentially step in and offer a lightweight, easy-to-use version of Windows 11 that portable PC makers could slap onto their devices. But the parent company of Xbox never did. </p><p>Now, in 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve is ready to make it easier</a></span> than ever to install SteamOS on more devices. Not only that, but now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenovo has announced the first third-party device</a></span> that will ship with SteamOS.  I expect by 2026 all handheld makers will offer SteamOS versions of their existing devices; likely at a cheaper price, too. </p><figure id="" data-id="8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-recommend-id="image://8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="720" data-height="405" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-recommend-id="image://8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="720" data-height="405" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/handheld-xbox-microsoft-pc-console-1851734989&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/handheld-xbox-microsoft-pc-console-1851734989">Sure, <em>now </em>Microsoft is talking more openly about a portable</a></span>, Xbox-like device and changes to Windows 11 that will make it a more handheld-friendly experience. But it really feels like Microsoft dragged its feet for too long and is now trying to play catch up. And I just don’t think it will be able to offer a version of Windows 11 that will be better than SteamOS anytime soon.</p><p>In the meantime, Valve is soon going to let any company use its gaming OS as the backbone of future devices, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2025/01/07/valve-set-to-release-a-steamos-beta-for-multiple-devices/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2025/01/07/valve-set-to-release-a-steamos-beta-for-multiple-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let users install SteamOS</a></span> on any portable PC they own.</p><p>This is likely to lead to a situation in which SteamOS is just considered the default way to play games on a portable PC, similar to how Steam is vastly more popular than Microsoft’s built-in Microsoft/Xbox/whatever app store that comes pre-installed on all Windows devices. And if SteamOS makes its way onto TV-based console-like devices or desktops, I think it will find a lot of success there too. A lot of people want to just play games, surf the web, and maybe listen to some music on their PC, and SteamOS can accommodate all of that easily. </p><p>Microsoft had a chance to compete with Valve in the handheld gaming space. Instead, it just...didn’t. Microsoft will likely never be able to dethrone SteamOS as the most popular way to play PC games on the go, especially if Valve keeps updating it to be better, faster, and easier to use. </p><p>Sure, Microsoft won’t go bankrupt anytime soon, but Xbox had a chance to dominate a corner of the gaming market and possibly expand its reach on desktop PCs, too. But time has seemingly run out for that to happen, and Valve has won again.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It has an 8-inch 1920 x 1200 LCD display with 120Hz variable refresh rate. Other features include adjustable RGB light rings around the analog sticks, two back buttons, one trackpad, and a pair of levers on the back that modify trigger tension.</p><p>Unlike the original Legion Go, this one doesn’t offer detachable gamepads or a kickstand, opting instead for a solid, streamlined design built specifically for handheld play. Lenovo increased the battery capacity from 49.2Wh to 55Wh with the Legion Go S.</p><p>Lenovo will also launch a second Windows configuration in May for $600.

The Legion Go S will be the first third-party handheld that uses Valve's Steam Deck operating system. This model will receive the same updates as Valve’s Steam Deck. That means you won’t have to worry about Valve abandoning SteamOS on the Legion Go S, as the team is treating SteamOS as a unified platform regardless of which handheld you’re playing on.</p><p>While it retains the Ryzen Z2 Go chip and the 8-inch 1200p display, the SteamOS edition is limited to 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. You can upgrade your SSD or expand the storage capacity via microSD.</p><p>For comparison, the Steam Deck starts at $399 for the 256GB model with a 7-inch LCD display. The 512GB model with a 7.4-inch OLED display costs $549, and the 1TB OLED edition goes for $649.</p><p>If you opt for the Legion Go S, you'll get a faster processor and a larger 8-inch screen with higher resolution--1200p compared to the Steam Deck's 800p resolution. That said, the Legion Go S uses an LCD panel, whereas the 512GB and 1TB Steam Deck models have better OLED screens.</p><p>Lenovo went with a more conventional control layout with offset sticks, while the Steam Deck's two sticks, D-pad, and face buttons are essentially aligned. The layout admittedly looks odd, but the Steam Deck is a lot comfier than it looks. Valve's handheld has four remappable back triggers, while Lenovo's new handheld only has two. The Steam Deck also has two large trackpads, whereas the Legion Go S has one small pad. Adjustable trigger tension is unique to the Legion Go S.</p><p>With these differences, it'll be interesting to see how the Legion Go S stacks up against the Steam Deck.

                <p>Call of Duty's big Squid Game crossover event is in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-squid-game-event-bundles-announcement#VIPs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full swing</a>, and the newest DLC has landed in the store. Players can now buy the VIPs bundle, which allows players to don special masks inspired by the TV show.</p><p>The VIPs Tracer Pack, as it's called, includes two Operators--the Panther Mask VIP and the Lion Mask VIP. The bundle also includes the "Choicest" launcher, the "Lacquered" sniper rifle, and the "Satin Slayer" SMG. A new frag grenade skin, "Death Plated," is included in the bundle as well.</p><p>What's more, players get a new finishing move, "Pinky Up," as well as the "Gilded" emblem, "List Required" calling card, and "Very Important Player" loading screen. You can see this content in action in the video below. The bundle costs 2,400 COD Points, or about $20.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KTvPAodyBY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_KTvPAodyBY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Call of Duty's Squid Game event also includes the Pink Guards Tracer Pack and the upcoming Young-hee Tracer Pack. These are separate from the new Squid Game Event Pass, which is a paid battle pass specifically for the Squid Game event that includes its own set of unique rewards based on the show.</p><p>The Squid Game Event Pass is the first such microtransaction offering in Call of Duty. Its release has ignited a debate among players about how far Activision will go to make money from microtransactions. Initially, Activision did not reveal the price of the Event Pass, but later did, confirming it would be 1,100 COD Points, or about $10.</p><p>In addition to the new store bundles, the Call of Duty / Squid Game event brought new modes to the game, including Red Light, Green Light and Pentathlon. As for the TV show, Squid Game Season 2 debuted on Netflix at the end of December and has become a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/squid-game-season-2-viewership-rises-second-most-popular-non-english-series-1236250247/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">smash hit in terms of viewership.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>This story includes content some readers may find disturbing.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Former employees of Brandoville Studios--an Indonesian support studio that worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> before closing its doors in August--recently stated that they were subjected to mental and physical abuse while working on the game. Now, Ubisoft has responded to their claims.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are deeply disturbed by the recent reports surrounding Brandoville Studios," an Ubisoft spokesperson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-deeply-disturbed-by-damning-reports-of-abuse-at-assassins-creed-shadows-support-studio" rel="nofollow ">told Eurogamer</a> when asked to comment on the controversy. "We strongly condemn all forms of abuse, and our thoughts are with the affected employees."</p><p dir="ltr">The claims of abuse were first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR9HQ2C6h_4">reported by People Make Games</a> in a 50-minute YouTube video uploaded earlier this week. In the video, former Brandoville employee Christa Sydney alleges that she was subjected to various forms of abuse by Kwan Cherry Lai. Cherry Lai is the wife of Brandoville CEO Ken Lai and was responsible for overseeing Brandoville's daily operations while the studio was still open.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Sydney, Cherry Lai created a toxic work environment, using gossip to alienate employees and manipulating employees' schedules to an extreme degree. But the alleged misconduct didn't stop there--Sydney says Cherry Lai forced her to stay awake for days at a time, only allowing her a few minutes of sleep over the four days leading up to the 2022 External Development Summit conference. Sydney also alleges that Cherry Lai forced her to engage in Christian religious practices, made her write lines as a punishment, and even demanded Sydney send over photos of her daily work outfits for approval before coming into the office.</p><p dir="ltr">"5:30 AM we need to wake up and then like, pray to god, and then [at] like 6:00 AM we need to go do our exercise, and then 8:00 AM shower," Sydney said of Cherry Lai's desire to control employees' schedules. "9:00 AM be at the office, and then even like, what time we need to drink water--she also put it in the schedule. And then what time we eat, what time we go to bed… that sort of thing."</p><p dir="ltr">But according to Sydney, that was just the tip of the iceberg, and Cherry Lai's behavior would eventually escalate to physical abuse. Sydney says she was forced to film a video in which she slapped herself in the face 100 times as a form of punishment, and also claims she was directed to slam her head into a doorframe repeatedly before being forced to apologize for "mistakes."</p><p dir="ltr">"The earliest record that I have was a recording of me hitting myself in the mouth until it bled, and then she wanted me to take a picture of the blood in my mouth," Sydney shared in the People Make Games video, which includes chat logs, photos, and recorded footage backing up her claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Sydney previously spoke out about her experiences in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts">2021 interview with People Make Games</a>, and says Lai forced her to film an apology video retracting her claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Other former Brandoville employees have come forward with reports of abuse as well. Caesarion Balthazar, who also worked at Brandoville while the studio was still in operation, claims that Cherry Lai took large chunks of his paychecks, adding up to the equivalent of a month's salary. When he tried to leave the studio, he was told he owed Lai money for a series of training programs. There was a problem, however: He hadn't engaged in any of the training programs he was being charged for. Syifana Afiati, who worked at Brandoville from 2019 to 2024, claims she was overworked during her pregnancy, and refused time off when her child died shortly after birth.</p><p dir="ltr">After the studio was liquidated in 2024, Cherry and Ken Lai formed a new company: LaiLai Studios. Sydney was hired on there as well, but later left after another incident with Cherry pushed her over the edge.</p><p dir="ltr">"She was taunting me. She was challenging me, basically," Syndey said. "I thought to myself, 'She already doesn't have anyone else [to work for her].' I was quite literally the only person left with her, and she was still doing this to me. But this time around I was like, 'You know what? I'm so tired, it's like 2:00 AM. I should order a cab home. When she realized that I wasn't going back to her, she panicked."</p><p dir="ltr">Sydney claims Cherry threatened her, but after years of abuse Sydney was at her limit. She refused to return to her position and began sharing her story, providing videos, photos, and text messages to back up her claims, which led to her story getting picked up by various news outlets and social media sites in Indonesia.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Ubisoft has denounced Cherry Lai's alleged actions, Lai herself gave a bizarre response when contacted for comment by People Make Games.</p><p dir="ltr">"To me, my part of the story is not important as long as my team are good and safe now," Cherry Lai said of the accusations. She refused to provide further comment.</p><p>Employees interviewed by People Make Games say that although CEO Ken Lai was not directly abusive toward them, he enabled his wife's conduct. At the time of writing, Ken Lai has not made any statements regarding the alleged abuse his wife engaged in. Brandoville Studios employees also worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/age-of-empires-iv/">Age Of Empires IV</a> during the timeframe the abuse allegedly took place, but Microsoft has not yet commented on the People Make Games video, nor has it addressed the allegations of abuse by Cherry Lai.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/new-league-of-legends-season-trailer-could-hint-future-noxus-show<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot Games is ringing in the New Year with a fresh season of League of Legends — the first of three season launches that players will experience in 2025. In typical Riot fashion, there's a cinematic trailer to go along with it, but this year's video is a major step-up from its predecessors. For one thing, it's absolutely stunning — thanks, of course, to a lending hand from Fortiche, the animation studio that brought Arcane to life. But more importantly, the five-minute video is leaving fans of Netflix's Arcane hopeful that <a href="https://youtu.be/I76wvt0aEE4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Noxus-themed trailer</a> doubles as an exciting prelude to another League of Legends show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a couple of apparent nods to Arcane that make their way into the end of the new cinematic. One of the biggest moments in the trailer that merges series with game comes when Black Rose members Vladimir and LeBlanc discuss how they need to take "advantage of the opportunity that has washed up our shores," which we're assuming is a reference to Mel. LeBlanc also comments that "Piltover was a lesson," which Arcane viewers will recognize as the Runeterra region in which the original show takes place.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/08/melpowerup0-1736357828902.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A first look at Mel in the League of Legends 2025 cinematic trailer.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When the final season of Arcane wrapped, fans were eager to find out if other Runeterra regions would get some on-screen exposure. Christian Linke, creative director at Riot and the creator and showrunner of Arcane, confirmed these suspicions in <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2309678052" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with League content creator Necrit</a> shortly after the show concluded, revealing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arcane-showrunner-reveals-which-3-league-of-legends-regions-riot-games-will-explore-next">Noxus, Ionia, and Demacia will receive their own spin-off series</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, upon the cinematic's release, fans can't help but connect the dots that this Noxus-themed season of League of Legends is perhaps a subtle hint towards the Noxus-themed spin-off they've been waiting for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One Rioter on Reddit, dubbed RiotMiddler, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/loreofleague/comments/1hvwtdj/bro_got_me_excited_for_noxus_centric_tv_show_only/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has denied that the cinematic trailer is a set-up for a TV show</a>: "Regarding the intent of the cinematic, our goal was to set up some themes for Noxus for the season and a plot line that'll be continued this year in game/around game materials (not a tv show to be clear)." </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But, like, have you looked at it? It very well may be true that the intent of the cinematic is first and foremost to promote the new Noxus-based season of League of Legends — there's no actual show storyline that's teased, nor any official release date for a new show attached. We're just saying, it seems unlikely that Fortiche went through the trouble of creating new designs for characters like Elise, Katarina, Vladimir, Darius, LeBlanc, and Trundle with no intent of introducing them into a future series.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/08/dariusstruggle0-1736357917658.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A still of Darius and Trundle fighting.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Show teaser or not, we're hyped for this new season of League of Legends, which goes live tomorrow, January 9. It's a pretty historic patch that ushers in a total Noxian makeover for the Rift, a handful of visual changes to the map, and even some novel targeting animations for the all-new Noxian War Turrets. Until Riot decides to release an official announcement about its next TV series, we'll be waiting with bated breath (and probably re-watching Arcane).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Katie Reul is a freelance journalist whose entertainment reporting has been featured in IGN and Variety.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-presents-confirmed-for-next-month-via-pokmon-go-datamine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A datamine of mobile game Pokémon Go has confirmed The Pokémon Company will host a Pokémon Presents event in February 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Established dataminer <a href="https://x.com/mattyoukhana_/status/1876988464878567879" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@mattyoukhana_</a> revealed on X/Twitter that the Pokémon Go code now references an event connected with what's being called Pokémon Presents 2025. Further text reveals it will take place on Pokémon Day, as expected, meaning February 27.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this isn't really a surprise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-presents-february-2024-everything-announced">as such an event has been held on Pokémon Day for the last few years</a>, the seemingly imminent reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, from The Pokémon Company co-owner Nintendo, is a big enough occasion to shake up the regular schedule.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's currently unclear when the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal will happen but it appears to be very soon given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-mockup-spotted-at-ces-accessories-maker-alleges-release-month-and-more">accessory maker Genki is currently showing off a mockup</a> at the Consumer Electronics Show 2025. It's confirmed to be revealed before the end of March 2025 too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An announcement ahead of Pokémon Day would certainly make sense, however, as it would allow The Pokémon Company to discuss its next big game during the Pokémon Presents. The February 27 event is the biggest on Pokémon fans' calendar and in the last few years has seen the likes of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and Pokémon Legends Z-A announced.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This latter game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-pokemon-game-pokemon-presents-2024">the next big release coming sometime in 2025</a>, is therefore practically a shoe in for the upcoming event, and is increasingly likely to appear on Nintendo Switch 2 given how little The Pokémon Company has said about it so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Presents events typically last around 30 minutes and feature big announcements like these alongside myriad on the rest of the Pokémon world. This includes games such as Pokémon TCG Pocket and, as is already known, Pokémon Go, but reveals for the anime, actual card game, and other products are common too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

    <p><span>Of note in this encased Switch 2 shot from a Genki video: the top USB port, expanded shoudler buttons, mysterious C button below the Home button.</span>
                    <span>
                      <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/pages/ns2_accessories" target="_blank">Genki</a>

          </p>
  </div>

<p>Away from CES, Genki's website was updated Tuesday night with <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/pages/ns2_accessories">a new video</a> showing encased Switch 2 Joy-Cons attaching to the tablet via a horizontal snap-on motion, as opposed to the vertical slide seen on the original Switch. The video also shows a special lever on the back of the Joy-Cons engaging to detach the Joy-Cons horizontally, seemingly with the aid of a small extendable post near the top of the inner edge of the controller itself.</p>
<p>The inner edges of the Joy-Cons shown in Genki's video match very closely with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/switch-2-leaks-point-to-controllers-that-work-like-computer-mice/">other recent leaked photos of the Switch 2 Joy-Cons</a>, right down to the mysterious optical sensor. That sensor can even be seen flashing a laser-like red dot in the Genki promo video, helping to support rumors of mouse-like functionality for the controllers. The Genki video also offers a brief glimpse of the Switch 2 itself sliding into a familiar-looking dock labeled with an embossed Switch logo and a large number 2 next to it.</p>

<p>A Genki representative also told Numerama that the company expects the console to be released in April, which is just after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/nintendo-pre-announces-a-switch-2-announcement-is-coming-eventually/">Nintendo's self-imposed deadline</a> for announcing more details about the system. The company had better get a move on, as third-party accessory makers are apparently getting tired of waiting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/switch-2-to-sell-4-3m-units-in-us-if-1h-predicts-mat-piscatella/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lfakfksucs2q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new posts</a> from Video Game Industry Analyst Mat Piscatella, he predicts that Nintendo's next hardware device (which is supposed to be the Nintendo Switch 2) will sell approximately 4.3 million units in the US in 2025, assuming that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be released in the first half of the year. Many were expecting more news to be released last year, but it felt that the audience was still kept in suspense, as we are no closer to knowing the release date of the upcoming console.&nbsp; Despite that, there are tons of leaks coming out about the upcoming console constantly, with some being believable and others being incredibly outlandish.</p>
<p>At the moment, the console doesn't have a set release date, but according to an Italian website, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-launch-on-march-28-says-italian-website/">the Nintendo Switch 2 could launch on March 28</a>. However, all of these rumors come after people <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/">speculated that it would be announced before the New Year</a>, except that information never came. Whether it will be released in the first half of the year remains to be seen. However, if it does, it means that revenue will be on the rise for Nintendo.</p>
<p>Despite that, Nintendo isn't expected to rank 1st in overall hardware units sold, according to Mat Piscatella. Instead, he believes that the PlayStation 5 will continue to rank 1st in overall hardware units sold in the US during the year. This statistic could very well be possible, especially with the release of the PS5 Pro, with new games getting PS5 Pro enhancements regularly.</p>
<p>If the Switch 2 is released in the first half of the year, Piscatella says that he expects to see hardware constraints for several months after due to a significant early demand surge. This is something that has been seen for all recent console releases, with the PlayStation 5 in particular continuing to suffer from this. With there being hardware constraints have led to prices being raised and the console constantly being out of stock, especially with the consoles ending up in the hands of scalpers, where tons of consoles then resurface on online markets for an extortionate price.</p>
<p>Alongside this, Piscatella gave a sneak peek into the percentage growth in video game spending for the year, saying that he expects low to mid-single-digit percentage growth over the year, helped by Nintendo Next and Grand Theft Auto VI. Despite GTA VI reportedly being released this year, there are many who are now beginning to lose faith in that and feel that it will be delayed until later in the year or even next year.</p>

            <p>
After nine of public beta access, hugely influential colony sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>' roguelike Adventure Mode is getting its full Steam release on 23rd January.
</p>
<p>
Adventure Mode, if you're unfamiliar, offers an alternative way to explore Dwarf Fortress' ludicrously in-depth, procedurally generated worlds - trading the usual colony management for a roguelike RPG, complete with procedural quests, NPCs, and turn-based battles.
</p>
<p>
Dwarf Fortress' Adventure Mode isn't a new thing, of course. It's been available as part of the free (and nearly two decade old) ASCII version for years, but it wasn't included when the game made the jump to Steam as a notably slicker paid release - featuring the likes of sprite-based visuals, a mouse-driven UI, and Steam Workshop compatibility - in 2022.

<p>
That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dwarf-fortress-roguelike-adventure-mode-gets-beta-launch-on-steam">changed last May</a> when developer siblings Zach and Tarn Adams launched a public beta version of Adventure Mode for Dwarf Fortress on Steam. At the time, the duo noted the beta had "some missing bits" seen in the ASCII version - ranging from additional graphics and sounds to butchery, crafting, and trading - that would be implemented prior to its full release.
</p><p>
And now, following nine months of beta access, Adventure Mode's full release is officially set for 23d January. "Thank you to all the urists who participated in the beta and left their helpful feedback," the Adamses wrote in announcement on Steam. "The mode has come a long way since it first launched in beta and we couldn't have done it without your help!"
</p>
<p>
"We are excited to shift focus back to Fortress Mode very soon," the announcement continued, "but this is also not the end of Adventure Mode development. Many updates in the future will be applied to both modes and there's still more to add to Adventure Mode in the future. As with everything in Dwarf Fortress development, it will all come in due time."
</p>
<p>
Prior to Adventure Mode's full launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/">Steam</a> (and <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress">itch.io</a>, where the Premium version is also available), the Adamses have released what'll likely be one of the mode's last pre-launch beta updates, featuring a long list of improvements and additions - as detailed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/530961267633946651?l=english">latest patch notes</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> promises to be a massive game-changer, introducing significant image quality and performance improvements, as highlighted by an early test conducted at CES 2025 with CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>The tech experts at Digital Foundry had the chance to go hands-on with NVIDIA DLSS 4 and the recently announced RTX 5080 GPU, highlighting in a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-dlss-4-on-nvidias-new-geforce-rtx-5080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> how, even in its early state running on an engineering sample without the final driver, the new version of the tech is a different AI-upscaler compared to the current version, introducing significant image quality and performance improvements. The new model using a vision transformer brings greater image stability, reduced ghosting, higher detail, and enhanced anti-aliasing, improvements that address a good portion of the image quality issues seen with the previous convolutional neural network used by DLSS 3.</p>
<p>Among the improvements NVIDIA DLSS 4 will bring is the RTX 50 series-exclusive Multi Frame Generation, which generates up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working with the complete suit of DLSS technology to provide a frame rate boost of up to 8x over traditional rendering. In one of the game's most demanding areas, the black market in the Petrochem stadium, using NVIDIA DLSS 4 and current Frame Generation on an RTX 5080, Cyberpunk 2077 runs at 4K output resolution with path tracing with a 535% frame-rate boost compared to native 4K resolution. The boost gets bigger at 725% with two generated frames and a whopping 935% with three generated frames. In every scenario, this means that the framerate went well past the 120 FPS mark, which is extremely impressive, considering we are talking about the game running with demanding path tracing.</p>
<p>Frame pacing is also improved in the x4-enabled multi-frame generation compared to the regular x2 of the single-frame generation, as NVIDIA had promised in the announcement. The only downside is the additional latency. Digital Foundry measured latency at 55.50 ms average when using DLSS 4 x3 and 57.30 ms when using DLSS 4 x4, compared to 50.97 ms with single-frame generation (x2). There's an additional 6.4 milliseconds of latency when using x4 instead of x2, then, but you get a 71% frame rate boost, which is more than a fair trade.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is among the games that will get native in-game support later this month, together with Alan Wake 2, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and others. A few more titles, like Black Myth: Wukong and Marvel Rivals, will receive in-game support at a later time, while Alan Wake 2 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are also <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting two new technologies</a> (RTX Hair and RTX Mega Geometry, respectively) that are part of the newly announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX Kit</a>.</p>

I love the Switch, I think it’s a wonderful piece of tech, and I would really love to have an upgraded version of it that’s capable of running more powerful games, and perhaps even running its own store software. But at the same time I realize, if that’s what we’re getting, it also feels like a big anticlimax.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>One of the things Nintendo has been so reliable for is bizarre innovation. For generations, it’s been utterly impossible to guess what the company might create next, given the complete surprises of, say, a two-screen clamshell touch-screen portable gaming device, or a gesture-led under-TV console that shines best when the whole family is prancing around together. Even the failed Wii U that the Switch replaced was a ludicrous combination of console and a giant handheld screen as a controller. The Switch was just as imaginative, a handheld <em>and</em> dockable console, with detachable controllers, in wild defiance of the tech-first, ever-larger boxes sold by rivals.</p><p>Even when Nintendo was creating iterative updates for its most successful products, like the GBA SP follow-up to the Game Boy Advance, or the DSi XL evolution of the original Nintendo DS, it seemed to be doing something else at the same time. Between the DS and the DSi we also got the Wii! The GameCube came out the same year as the Game Boy Advance! But, given the extraordinary scrutiny being put on every patent and parts manufacturer Nintendo is attached to, it seems vanishingly unlikely that there’s some secret second project being hidden behind the noise of the as-yet unnamed second Switch.</p><p>And the Switch 2? It’s another Switch. The controllers look likely to slot in magnetically, rather than slide in on those tracks that only match up the third time you try, and the screen is very likely to be bigger, all running on far more powerful chips. But…given it’s backward compatible, given it’s an iteration of the same format with improved tech, I find it hard to think of it as anything more than the equivalent of a souped-up Switch XL.</p><p>As I say, I <em>want</em> a Switch XL. If that were announced, independent of anything else, I’d be first to pre-order. I bought the Switch OLED as soon as I could, and I was delighted to have it. A Switch 2, as it so distressingly seems likely to be called, is a thing I want. But, at the same time, it’s not what I want to want. I want to be on the timeline where Nintendo says, “Sure, here’s the Switch 2,” but then pulls back the curtain on what else it’s cooking up. The thing that’s so wild, so peculiar, that even my silliest suggestions feel feasible. It’s a wearable piece of tech that uses holograms, or a bizarre twist on AR where the flagship <em>Mario</em> game uses our house furniture for platforms.</p><p>Just making a better Switch is so safe, so ordinary, so utterly un-Nintendo. Can you imagine any other company in the universe having the phenomenal success of the Nintendo Wii, and responding to that not by making a more powerful version of the same, but a two-screen console so complicated to explain that no one understood what it was for? Sure, that was a <em>terrible</em> idea in hindsight, but it was also the sort of thing I expect from Nintendo, and it’s impossible to understate just how equally crazy the pitch for the Switch seemed at the time, following the Wii U.</p><p>I still hold out hope that the Switch 2 will have some surprises. That little lens spotted in the Joy-Cons is something Nintendo will likely use in some really innovative ways, even if other developers never notice it’s there. I often think about one of the most wonderful aspects of the Switch—the all-too underrated Labo. Those cardboard packs, in conjunction with the peculiar controllers, that had you build working pianos, fishing rods for fishing games, and even a remote-controlled bug creature. It used the Joy-Con’s haptics to move around, and the infrared sensor as a tiny camera! That was bloody incredible! That was astoundingly imaginative, and I have high hopes that Nintendo has similarly inventive plans for using the new Joy-Cons’ tech. I like to imagine they’ll have pushed it all a little harder to third-party developers this time, so we can see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/a-dsloveletter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-dsloveletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some of the wonderful madness that appeared in the first few months of the Nintendo DS</a></span>.</p><p>But, you know, I’m still a bit sad. It could have been something bonkers! It could have been something capable of running Switch games like the 3DS could run DS games. But if all the rumors and leaks are true, there’s no entire new plane of gaming existence being added here, just a Switch that can run prettier games. I’m buying one, for sure. But I will still lament a little the brand new Nintendo console innovation it doesn’t look likely to be.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/scump-on-call-of-duty-state/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Seth ‘Scump’ Abner, one of the most electrifying and popular former pro players in Call of Duty, has taken to his stream to talk about the state of Call of Duty. In a transparent statement, he echoed what so many content creators have said, suggesting that Call of Duty is in a horrible state right now – for many reasons.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 was supposed to be Call of Duty’s ‘saviour’, and it was solid for a while, but things are starting to fall apart. Check out what Scump had to say about Call of Duty below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-such-a-bad-spot-right-now">‘Such a Bad Spot Right Now’</h2>



<p>Scump is a Call of Duty world champion and arguably the most prolific pro player in the scene. He has spent a decade honing his following and his talents, and now that he’s tired from actively competing, he has become one of the game’s most-watched streamers. He’s still flying the OpTic banner after all these years, too.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://x.com/SpawnUpgg/status/1877025389077225639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent stream</a>, Scump explained how he and so many people feel about Call of Duty:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Call of Duty is just in such a bad spot right now, dude. I don’t think Call of Duty has ever been in a worse spot than it is right now. It’s kind of depressing, to be honest.</p>



<p>I was already concerned them releasing ranked so early and the CDL started up, and then we had like a month break from the CDL, so I was already a little concerned about all of that.</p>



<p>They dropped it so early and then they dropped it and it was so bad because of all the hackers.</p>



<p>… I don’t know, they just f***ed up.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He followed up by explaining that he’s dropping away from Call of Duty a little to stream other games. That’s something that Nadeshot did just a few days ago, pivoting away from Black Ops 6 to play Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 has been riddled with hackers for several weeks, and it seems like every creator and pro player is running up against them in Ranked Play. It’s making the game borderline unplayable for the more skilled players, and other elements such as poor network performance and tricky SBMM mechanics are inflicting pain upon the more average gamers.</p>



<p>Do you think Call of Duty is in a hole right now? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>For the better part of two decades, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dwarf-fortress/">Dwarf Fortress</a> has been the passion project of brothers Tarn and Zach Adams. Although the acclaimed fantasy simulation game has technically remained in development since its debut in 2006, Dwarf Fortress' Adventure Mode will launch out of beta on January 23. The announcement was sent out with the following video, and an update about the latest changes in the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg99hUv4YEY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kg99hUv4YEY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Dwarf Fortress allows players to control a clan of dwarves as they stake out their place in a procedurally generated fantasy world. Adventure Mode shakes up the formula by allowing players to step into a roguelike-style RPG and explore the worlds that were created during their time in the standard game. Adventure Mode also allows players to accept quests and look for lost treasures, among other activities.</p><p>Tarn Adams and Kitfox's Alexandra Orlando have shared Dwarf Fortress' latest updates <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/530961267633946651" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on its Steam page</a>. Most of the changes were for Adventure Mode, including enhanced options for character creation, the addition of Adventure Mode's soundtrack to Fortress Mode, and even the option for child and baby portraits.</p><p>Dwarf Fortress has been around for nearly 19 years, but it didn't launch on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dwarf-fortress-arrives-on-steam-with-fancy-graphics-december-6/1100-6508880/">Steam until December 2023</a> with a paid version of the game that had new graphics, music, and more. The game's incredible success on Steam <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dwarf-fortress-game-devs-reveal-whats-next-for-them-after-the-games-sudden-success/1100-6522418/" data-ref-id="1100-6522418">allowed the Adams brothers to purchase a new home</a>. Now that Adventure Mode is on the horizon, Tarn Adams indicated on Steam that the focus will return to Fortress Mode "very soon." He also added that both Fortress Mode and Adventure Mode will continue to be supported by future updates.</p>
