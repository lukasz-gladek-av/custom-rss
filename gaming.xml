            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>For a very long time, the possibility of the long-anticipated Half-Life 3 was nothing more than an illusion, but in the past few months, evidence piled up regarding a new project codenamed HLX, which could actually be the game that most fans of the series lost hope in.</p>



<p>Although Half-Life 3 has yet to be officially announced, we already have some information on how the game might play. For some time, dataminers have taken a close look at every update made to the Source 2 engine, which powers Valve's currently supported games, such as Counter-Strike 2, and have discovered <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-final-development/">a wealth of information related to the gameplay mechanics that will power the project codenamed HLX.</a></p>



<p>In case you haven't followed all the leaks, some dedicated users have <span><a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJnkh8Q4=/" target="_blank">created a board on Miro</a>&nbsp;that compiles</span> all the known information regarding the yet-to-be-announced Half-Life 3, providing an excellent overview of the game's core mechanics and engine features.</p>



<h2 id="h-core-gameplay-and-player-systems">Core Gameplay and Player Systems</h2>



<p>At its core, Half-Life 3 will provide an immersive experience, featuring core gameplay mechanics centered on unique environmental interactions through fire and heat conductivity mechanics, as well as a granular weapons system with a physics engine that determines how projectiles interact with the environment. Vehicles will also be return from Half-Life 2, with simulation features that focus on realistic low-level wheel and suspension physics and mechanics that will handle passengers, FOV changes depending on speed and more.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Key Elements</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Fire and Heat Conductivity</strong></td><td>Highly detailed simulation for tracking heat transfer, focusing on how different materials and the player react to fire and heat sources.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weapons</strong></td><td>Granular system covering multiple fire modes, attachments, and the specific rules defining how projectiles interact with deformable physics.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Vehicles</strong></td><td>Realistic handling and movement based on simulation of Wheel Dynamics, including tire friction, suspension, and responsive damage tracking.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-physics-fluids-and-other-environmental-interactions">Physics, Fluids and Other Environmental Interactions</h2>



<p>The Gravity Gun will play a significant role in Half-Life 3's environmental interactions, powered by a physics system that handles complex object manipulation with high precision. Another core element of the game's environmental interactions will be represented by the simulation of multiple liquid types, as well as their interactions with the environment and the player. A complex physics system will also handle character ragdoll behavior and the destruction of environmental objects. Additionally, advanced world manipulation via precise physics adjustments and the ability to alter the gravity of specific locations will provide an even more immersive experience, offering numerous gameplay possibilities.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Features</th><th>Key Elements</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Gravity Gun</strong></td><td>Dedicated, complex system for lifting, manipulating, and launching objects with high precision. Essential for core physics-based puzzles and combat.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ragdoll &amp; Destruction</strong></td><td>Advanced, physics-driven death animations and object shattering. Focuses on granular, realistic destruction of large props and entities.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Water / Liquids</strong></td><td>Simulation of diverse fluid types (acid, oil, water) and their unique physical interactions, visual effects, and environmental consequences.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Deformable Physics</strong></td><td>Implementation of objects capable of bending, denting, or deforming under stress and force, adding realism.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Track/Train Changes</strong></td><td>Specific engine modifications to handle the physics, tracking, and switching of large moving platforms, trains, and interactive machinery.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gravity Shifting</strong></td><td>Core system for modifying local or global gravity vectors, used for complex puzzle design and unique gameplay scenarios.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>BasePhys Adjustments</strong></td><td>Low-level customization layer for the base physics engine parameters, allowing precise tuning of collision, friction, and mass for every object type.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-core-engine-features">Core Engine Features</h2>



<p>The Half-Life 3 gameplay mechanics will be further compounded with some of the core engine features. Chief among them will be an enhanced audio experience with positional sound systems that provide accurate 3D audio implementation, augmenting stealth gameplay mechanics. This will enable NPCs to detect player noise and react accordingly.</p>



<p>The supposed complexity of the game's world will be compounded by the SpatialOctree data partitioning structure, which will organize every visual element to deliver highly optimized interactions between a multitude of in-game elements. A G2 Generation system will also be introduced, enabling the rapid creation of levels and areas. Further enhancing the world's immersion will be a save system that manages data persistence across maps and more.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Features</th><th>Key Elements</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Positional Sound</strong></td><td>High-end 3D audio engine ensuring accurate spatialization, including environmental effects like echo, reverberation, and sound occlusion.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SpatialOctree</strong></td><td>A high-performance spatial partitioning data structure used to organize all world entities, geometry, and light sources for efficient lookup and query operations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>G2 Generation</strong></td><td>Dedicated tools for Automated Content Generation, suggesting methods for procedurally or systematically creating assets and environments.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Map Shared Environment</strong></td><td>System for managing environment data that must remain consistent and synchronized across different map sections.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game System / Save System</strong></td><td>Framework essential for saving and restoring the entire state of the game world, including the status of all interactive physics objects.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-visual-features-and-rendering">Visual Features and Rendering</h2>



<p>Although the Half-Life 3 gameplay features promise to be the main focus of the experience, the next entry in the series is also set to feature some great visuals featuring a realistic global illumination and shadow mapping systems alongside necessary optimization tweaks that will ensure that models and effects not currently on screen are not drawn, and an LOD and AI system that will manage the level of detail of distant objects depending on the distance from the player.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Features</th><th>Key Design Elements</th></tr><tr><td><strong>PostFX Effects</strong></td><td>Cinematic visual enhancements, including advanced implementations of Lens Dirt, detailed blurs, and tunable chromatic aberration.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lighting / Shaders</strong></td><td>Physically-based rendering (PBR) foundation with specialized components like Skylight for global illumination and custom shaders for material fidelity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Observer Fields</strong></td><td>Critical performance optimization using sophisticated Occlusion Culling logic to ensure only visible elements are processed by the GPU.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AI LOD</strong></td><td>Level-of-Detail system that scales both the geometric complexity of models and AI based on viewer distance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Detail Props</strong></td><td>Efficient system designed for the mass rendering of numerous small, non-essential environment objects (debris, scattered items) with minimal performance impact.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As all of this information has been datamined, there's the chance some of these features may not make it into the final version of Half-Life 3. Still, they paint a very exciting picture for a game whose release may be a hallmark for reasons other than its now legendary status. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/">it really won't take much longer </a>to learn everything about the game directly from Valve itself.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rockstar Reportedly Used The Discussion of Slack Policy Changes in a Discord Server to Fire 34 Union Members]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rockstar-reportedly-used-internal-slack-changes-shared-in-discord-server-to-fire-34-union-members/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rockstar-reportedly-used-the-discussion-of-slack-policy-changes-in-a-discord-server-to-fire-34-union-members.1362964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TvWNFBBwuY">People Make Games</a>, the investigative journalists and documentarians who have recently been doing boots-on-the-ground coverage of Rockstar's firing of 34 union members and accusations of union busting, seems to have discovered the messages behind Rockstar's claim that the fired employees were discussing confidential information in a public forum.</p>



<p>To quickly catch you up if you've not been following this story, on November 1, Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">was accused of union-busting when it fired 34 employees between Rockstar North and its Rockstar Toronto offices</a>. Five days later, Rockstar followed up by denying it was union-busting, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">claiming that the employees were fired for "<em>gross misconduct</em>," </a>and cited that misconduct to be "<em>distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum</em>."</p>



<p>As the IWGB held its ground, continuing to claim that Rockstar was union-busting, an anonymous <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">employee took to GTAForums to fire back at their company's claims</a>. They alleged that this was nothing more than union-busting and said that Rockstar was trying to claim that a Discord server that only included Rockstar employees and IWGB members was a 'public forum' and pin the discussion of company policy changes as confidential information that was publicly shared.</p>



<p>The IWGB followed up <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">with two legal claims against Rockstar</a>, over <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">200 Rockstar employees signed a letter to management in support of the fired employees</a>, and protests have taken place outside of the Rockstar offices in Edinburgh, London, and Paris, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">calling for the reinstatement of the fired employees</a>.</p>



<p>Now, People Make Games' latest report seems to not only corroborate what the anonymous employee shared on GTAForums, but also provides a more specific account of the messages that are likely the ones Take-Two and Rockstar are using as the reason for the firings.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Messages Rockstar Saw Before Firing 34 Union Members" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8TvWNFBBwuY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to information shared with People Make Games by a Rockstar employee who is not a union member, the messages that the company is likely calling "<em>gross misconduct</em>" and the "<em></em><em>distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum</em>" are employees sharing changes to the company's internal Slack policies in the aforementioned union-focused, employee-only Discord server.</p>



<p>The Slack policy changes reportedly came in October, which included the removal of miscellaneous channels, meaning that employees now had no place within the company's internal communications to discuss any non-work-related topics. Discussing what was dubbed "<em>The Slack Purge</em>" in a Discord server that had been around since 2022, with the intention of it being a place for union members to discuss working conditions, is the exact kind of thing that, in the eyes of the IWGB, is protected under UK law.</p>



<p>These weren't employees sharing the latest information about Grand Theft Auto VI in a public Discord server that anyone can join. It was employees talking about their working conditions in a private Discord server that was set up for employees to talk about their working conditions, and is only accessible to IWGB members and Rockstar employees who had verified their identity.</p>



<p>Now, because Discord is not the company's chosen internal communication platform, and because the policies were discussed and shared in the server, it could potentially hold up in court that the employees were sharing company information in a 'public forum.' That'll be for a judge to decide, depending on how far this case goes. Still, it's clear that this wasn't a case of the company cracking down on leaks as we move closer to GTA VI's launch.</p>

            <p>Arkane Lyon level designer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thief-the-dark-project">Thief: The Dark Project</a> modder Romain Barrilliot is back with another fan creation - a Thief 2 castle heist Barrilliot calls "by far my most ambitious work in the Dark Engine to date", presumably including his previous group project The Black Parade, despite being "purely based on vibes". Called Reflections In Red, it's a sequel to Barrilliot's <a href="https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=152800">Winds Of Misfortune</a>, though it works well as a standalone release. It's also based on a real-life castle so preposterous I have no choice but to immediately steal the deeds from what I assume is a heavily fortified bank vault inside a creepy mountain somewhere.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Reflections In Red has no bank vaults, nor creepy mountains, just majestic amphibious architecture. It sees light-fingered snarkyman Garrett heading to a manor built over a lake on the outskirts of Wychwood. He's here to pinch a recipe for some posh wine, by any means necessary. "Swim, sneak, or climb, the choice is mine," explains the intro, below. "Front gate's a death trap. Guards in plate, a captain and two sergeants keeping watch. The lord hates electricity, sticks to torches and gaslight. Perfect for someone like me. A few water arrows should do the trick."

<p>Long story short, it's a mansion raid with many points of entry and superb production values, inside and outside. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skacky.bsky.social/post/3m5yxqa73ds24">Posting on Bluesky</a>, Barrilliot concedes that it followed "a very unusual development cycle" and "wasn't even supposed to be a real mission at first, just a testbed for my own textures and a doodle based on <a href="https://www.nicolasdelort.com/illustration?pgid=ki3luwp3-ad5b13cd-8b7c-48aa-a53f-7e5277bd326d">this etching by artist Nicolas Delort</a>." (For clarity, I've added the link to speed the chain of reference here. Can't have you running off to Google them like a sap.)
</p><p>Barrilliot says he "had no document for this mission whatsoever. I just built it and it eventually coalesced into the final result." The castle takes inspiration from <a href="https://www.chenonceau.com/en/">Chenonceau Castle in France</a>, "which has some of the stupidest vanity architecture you'll ever find", in Barrilliot's estimation. I feel like quite a lot of videogame level design can be filed under "vanity architecture", though it's not a comparison I've thought about before.
</p>
<p>Up for it? You will first need Thief 2 version 1.28, which may mean you have to upgrade using T2Fix 1.28, as detailed alongside the download link on <a href="https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=153139">TTLG</a>. While Reflections In Red appears to have been Barrilliot's pet project, the mod features contributions from a few other Thief fan community members, including voice actors, writers, scripters and tool developers - find a full list in the Thanks section in the TTLG post.</p>
<p>Ah, Thief. I've kind of forgotten everything about the first two games, bizarrely, though I can quote certain bits of Hammerite scripture in my sleep. The third remains vivid in my mind thanks to the efforts of Kieron Gillen, co-founder of this parish, who once dedicated a whole PCGamer feature to its Shalebridge Cradle level. I remember Eidos Montreal's fourth Thief mostly for that time I choked out a guard and he carried on humming, though I thought it was solid enough as stealth games go.</p>
<p>If you call yourself a Thief enthusiast and you've yet to play Barrilliot's previous The Black Parade, you should get that wiped off your ledger pronto. Here's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-black-parade-is-a-thief-mod-from-a-team-including-a-dev-at-arkane-and-an-original-thief-designer">interview of our own with Barrilliot about its creation</a>, in which writer Lee Seymour confesses that "the thing is so jammed with fun surprises that anything more than a sketched overview feels like a spoiler."</p>

              <p>When people recall their favorite <em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games, it’s often focused on which was their first. For me, that was <em>Tomb Raider II</em>, and as such, it remains very special. For others, it’s the wonderful opener to Crystal Dynamics’ era of the franchise, <em>Tomb Raider Legends</em>. And for many more, it’ll be one of the more recent entries, like 2018’s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. But for all the reminiscing and celebrating, there’s one entry that seems to get little love, despite being one of my absolute favorites at the time, and to replay today:&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>. It turns 25 years old today.</p> <p>There is a perennial issue for both games and movies, which I call Critic Fatigue. It doesn’t matter how good a series may be, nor how increasingly popular it might be among audiences: at a certain point, critics seem to believe it’s their role to be sick of something. “Uh, <em>another</em> <em>Avengers</em> movie? I hate it just for existing!” “More&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed</em>?! It’s time for it to be taken down a peg or two!” It’s like it’s their collective job to punish a franchise for having too many entries. That happened astoundingly harshly to&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> at the turn of the century.</p>

 <h2>Business is boobing</h2> <p>Obviously, the first three <em>Tomb Raider</em> games were a phenomenon. From 1996 to 1998, the original trilogy received international hype that today is hard to even conceive. It was a messy combination of a worthwhile celebration of three genuinely fantastic video games and the lecherous misogyny of the late-90s era. The reason an entire generation bought 3DFX cards, Lara Croft championed and emboldened the third-person action genre, <em>and</em> had rather large boobies. So yes, there <em>was</em> a lot to be frustrated by, especially in Lara’s home country of the UK, where “lad mags” ruled supreme with their soft-porn photography and lifestyle articles. This aspect was so blatantly exploited by publisher Eidos that there was always an <a href="https://www.laracroftonline.com/pictures/tomb-raider-models-images-gallery-page-one.html">“official” Lara Croft model</a>, despite these people never appearing in movies, TV shows, or any other actually extant tie-in media. Instead, the likes of Rhona Mitra, Ellen Rocche, and Nell McAndrew would show up on the covers of those lad mags with multi-page photo shoots within, and on cardboard cut-outs in every gaming store. (And on the covers of many a gaming magazine.) It’s pretty embarrassing to look back on, not least remembering how Nell McAndrew was hypocritically fired from the role after posing for <em>Playboy</em>.</p>

 <p>But for all the squirm-inducing marketing, the games remained <em>fantastic</em>. They still are. Then, in 1999, came <em>Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</em>, and the tide started to turn. Critic Fatigue was due to kick in, and you could smell the backlash coming. <em>The Last Revelation</em> was more of the same, and for some reason, more of something we previously loved stops being good enough after a while, and scores came in lower. It wasn’t helped by a crappy Dreamcast port, but there was still enough residual love for the franchise that <em>The Last Revelation</em> escaped the brunt of the kickback. That was reserved for—in my opinion—a better game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646923" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646923"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646923">© Eidos</figcaption></figure> <h2>Putting the fun in funeral</h2> <p><em>The Last Revelation’</em>s ending deserved far more criticism.&nbsp;The game, during which you watched Lara Croft die some 40 billion times, ended with a cutscene in which Lara Croft died. A pyramid falls on top of her. “Reload then!” I remember saying to the screen at this ridiculous forced ending, reloading to see if I’d made a mistake. But nope, she was dead. It was extremely silly, but it happened for a reason. Core, the developers of the games, were sick of making <em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games. It was hoped that by killing her, the developers would be free to make something else. It didn’t work, and Eidos demanded more.</p>

 <p>However, it also set up a superb conceit for the fifth game,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>. Rather than beginning with Lara in the middle of some improbable heist, then bringing us back to her manor to start a new series of international adventures, <em>Chronicles</em> began with Croft’s funeral. That’s something, right! And of course, everyone was expecting the immediate reveal, that having the Pyramid of Giza squish her flat turned out not to be so serious, and reports of her death were greatly exaggerated. Except that’s not what happened at all. Instead, post-funeral, Lara’s butler Wilson invites two of her close compatriots back to the manor for a drink. Together, the three begin to reminisce about their friend, recalling adventures that had yet to be seen in the games. And that’s what you play! Four stories, in completely unique settings, at different stages in Lara’s life—including as a teenager.</p>

 <p>The result was almost all great! Each of the four chapters was a distinct game, with enormous variety in setting, from haunted islands to modern, high-tech skyscrapers, via an abandoned submarine, delivering the intricate puzzles and acrobatic antics we’d come to expect from developers Core. That no one involved in the game apparently wanted to make it really didn’t come through, perhaps via some sort of involuntary competence, or as a result of breaking it into small chunks that felt less oppressive to create. I can imagine if someone had just played the first four games through in a row and then instantly started on this fifth, they could be thoroughly sick and tired of Lara and her formula. But giventhat&nbsp; a year went by between each entry, I really want to push back against this “fatigue” argument.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646924"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646924">© Eidos / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <h2>Backlashing out</h2> <p>No matter <em>Chronicles</em>‘ merits, they wouldn’t matter. The backlash was due, many critics were ready to put Lara in her place for having the temerity to keep returning. Scores came in hard and harsh, with even <em>IGN</em> almost hitting its lowest possible score of 6.&nbsp;<em>EDGE</em> dished out a mauling 4, while the usually supplicant&nbsp;<em>Official PlayStation Magazine</em> joined in with a 5. But as you read through those reviews (or the residual summaries remaining on the internet), they all praise the game, celebrate its great level design, recognize it as a good example of a&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> game, but then penalize it for…existing? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010220230712/http://www.zdnet.com/opm/stories/main/0,11891,2667614,00.html">That&nbsp;<em>OPM</em></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010220230712/http://www.zdnet.com/opm/stories/main/0,11891,2667614,00.html"> review</a>, that 2.5 star score, described the game as “the best sequel in the series thus far,” albeit then claiming that all the other games “downright sucked.” The same magazine gave <em>TR II </em>a 9, then the third game 7. The fourth game, that one got a 10.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/22/tomb-raider-chronicles"><em>IGN</em>‘s review</a> couldn’t make my argument any better. The 25-year-old article had the strapline, “Lara Croft’s last adventure on PlayStation is also her very best. Still, it’s just more of the same.” There it is! The whole point, perfectly encapsulated! How dare this game be the best example of a thing?</p> <p>The review goes on to say that the matter of annual releases “turned what could have been one of gaming’s most cherished franchises into one of the most reviled.” Most reviled! For the crime of carrying on being good too often. The article also praises the game for its four distinct chapters, offering “the greatest amount of diversity in play style and atmosphere,” then calls the fourth story “one of the best <em>Tomb Raider</em> levels ever.”</p>

 <p>A huge part of this reaction, as indeed is the case in most other examples, is leveling complaints at the latter entry that should have been raised from the start. So <em>Chronicles</em> was repeatedly berated across reviews for its control issues, and indeed the games’ silly combat, even though these aspects were almost always overlooked in the rush of excitement for, er, the first three games. The best example of the series so far, having the same faults as the poorer examples in the past, makes the most recent game the worst? That seems to be the rule.</p> <p>And yes, of course, I’m not naive. Having the same control issues five games in&nbsp;<em>is</em> crappy and should be dealt with. But given they were given a critical pass the first four times, and the games sold eighty million-billion-squillion copies despite them, there’s not a great deal of incentive being put before the developers to prioritize them. It is, in a large part, a failure of criticism.</p>

 <p>It’s the same reason Bethesda gets to release half-finished games with barely functioning UIs, because why would the developer bother to do otherwise? It knows it’ll get a round of 9s and 10s from every outlet despite it, and given the company releases new games every decade rather than every year, these consistent issues don’t seem to amount to “fatigue.” It took an actively&nbsp;<em>boring</em> game,&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>, for any hint of that backlash to appear.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000646925" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646925"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646925">© Eidos / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <h2>The fallen angel</h2> <p>I’m here to say that I loved&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>, despite the litany of flaws that haunted the entire franchise up until that point. I played&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> games on PC, with one hand on a game controller and the other on my keyboard, because this was the only way the crummy control issues were overcome. That worked for&nbsp;<em>Chronicles</em> as well as it worked for&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider II</em>, and if anything, I was used to it by then. It was a splendid game, despite the malaise behind its creation, because—as so many identified at the time—it featured some of the best levels in the series!</p> <p>The irony that it was&nbsp;<em>Chronicles</em> that received the backlash when the borderline unplayable <em>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</em> was just three years away isn’t lost on me either. Both games were developed simultaneously, the former a reluctant sop to the publisher, the latter a whole fresh start for Core. But after years of delays and brutal development issues, <em>Angel of Darkness</em> was atrocious. Lara was close to uncontrollable, the enemy AI was abysmal, and the game quickly became a laughing stock. And it reviewed the same as <em>Chronicles</em>, because it was new! It was fresh! So it&nbsp;<em>had</em> to be interesting. This time, reviews went, “While the game is so broken as to be functionally useless, it has new graphics!” (To be abundantly fair to <em>IGN</em>, after just picking on them, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/06/24/tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness">the site gave it a good kicking</a> with a score lower than some thought it could reach: 5.3.)</p>

 <p><em>Chronicles</em> is included in Aspyr’s recent remake, <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-angel-darkness-release-date-1851670508"><em>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</em></a>, although <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-remastered-review-pc-lara-croft-1851250080">given my experience with the gruesome mess of the first three</a>, I’m not convinced it’d be the best way to play—definitely stick to the original graphics and controls. You can also <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_the_last_revelation_chronicles">pick it up paired with&nbsp;<em>The Last Revelation</em> from GOG</a> for under $9, and then <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Tomb_Raider_Chronicles">go crazy on&nbsp;<em>PCGamingWiki</em></a>, getting it all patched up for modern machines.</p> <p>I say it’s worth it! Ignore those fatigue-ridden naysayers. It’s OK for something to be good five times in a row.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-practically-giving-smart-plug-away-50-off-makes-it-cheaper-than-regular-plugs-2000646854</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is practically giving away its smart plug at a price that barely exceeds what you’d pay for a basic outlet adapter: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/">At $12, down from $24, this connected device costs roughly the same as a dumb power strip from the hardware store</a>.</p>
<p>This Black Friday, Amazon slashed prices across all its <strong>own-brand products by approximately 50%</strong>, selling at zero margin to drive ecosystem adoption. The smart plug exemplifies this aggressive strategy and offers voice control and automation at a price that removes every excuse for not starting your smart home journey.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Voice Control That Changes Your Daily Routine</h2>
<p>The <strong>Alexa integration adds voice commands to any device</strong> that has a physical on/off switch. Tell Alexa to turn on your coffee maker from bed, and hot coffee waits when you reach the kitchen. Command the lamp in your living room to turn off from the couch. Turn on a fan in another room without walking there. These minor conveniences compound throughout your day into proper quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Setup takes literally minutes</strong> and requires no technical knowledge whatsoever. Plug the Smart Plug into any outlet, open the Alexa app on your phone, and follow the simple, on-screen prompts. The plug connects automatically to your 2.4GHz WiFi network. You then name the device based on what you’re controlling, such as “bedroom lamp” or “coffee maker.” It takes less than five minutes from box to working smart device.</p>



<p><strong>No smart home hub requirement</strong> removes the additional hardware cost that plagued earlier smart home adoptions. It directly connects your Smart Plug to your WiFi and communicates with Alexa over the cloud. You avoid buying expensive hubs like SmartThings or dedicated Zigbee coordinators. The Alexa app manages all your Smart Plugs from one interface.</p>
<p>Routine automation turns disparate smart devices into cohesive systems that react intelligently. Create a morning routine that starts the coffee maker at 7 AM, turns on bathroom lights, and starts playing the news on your Echo. A bedtime routine might turn off all the lights, smart lock the doors, and drop the thermostat. Leaving home triggers an away routine to power down everything non-essential. These are scheduled automations that happen independently of you and creates the smart home experience most people envision when they first hear about connected devices.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa+ capabilities give you much more natural interactions</strong> with your smart home. You can set routines without having to open the app, using voice commands for actions that power multiple devices at once, such as saying, “Alexa, it’s movie night,” to activate all the smart lighting in the room and turn on TV-connected devices. You can be a lot more casual about what you are asking for without needing to follow strict command structures. It all feels less robotic compared to earlier smart home controls, which required you to say things in a very specific way.</p>
<p>At $12, the smart plug provides fundamental smart home functionality at just about the price of basic electrical accessories this Black Friday. Want to start controlling devices by voice without spending hundreds on smart home infrastructure? This record-low price eliminates that barrier.</p>

<p>With Marathon’s most recent Closed Technical Test behind it, a new Community Playtest has been announced. Details are already available on how to sign up, but it brings more focus on the fact that there’s no sign of a Marathon release date.</p>



<p>October’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-marathon-closed-technical-test-dates-platforms-nda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Closed Technical Test</a> is done. Bungie has inevitably learned valuable data about the extraction shooter, and Insider Gaming has reported before that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has confirmed that Marathon will launch by March 2026</a>.</p>







<p>We’re one step closer to another test, but no closer to knowing when before March 2026 the full release will happen.</p>







<figure><figcaption>This feels like a marathon in itself. Credit to Bungie</figcaption></figure>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Marathon/Playtests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon</a> website is now advertising and recruiting for the ‘Marathon December Community Playtest’ taking place in December 2025.</p>







<p>You can try out the latest extraction shooter build for yourself. It’s playable across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam, and Bungie has said this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Marathon December Community Playtest will run from December 12th to the 15th from 2PM PT to 8PM PT each day.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like before, the playtest is under a strict NDA, so you can’t share your footage or experience. It’s only for North America, so if you’re based outside of here, you’ll have to wait for the next one!</p>



<p>It’s true that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-leaks-closed-test-reveal-positivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks from the recent Closed Test were positive</a>. However, Bungie needs to commit to a release date soon and has to make sure it can compete with the dominance of ARC Raiders and Escape From Tarkov.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> staff were fired last month due to internal company messages being discussed on a Discord server shared privately between staff and union workers, a new report has suggested.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games fired 34 staff members for "gross misconduct", though further details have not been officially revealed. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">company has since been accused of union-busting</a>, with UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">launching a legal claim alleging unfair dismissal of staff</a>.</p>
<p>Now, a new video report from People Make Games has revealed messages shared in a Discord server, sourced from a Rockstar insider who believes these may be the cause of dismissal.</p>
<p>Use of the Discord server began in 2022 and was invite-only for employees, with a "general" channel available to all and other channels accessible only for paying union members. Membership to the Discord was limited to either Rockstar employees, or representatives of the IWGB (which the Rockstar union was part of).</p>
<p>Most conversations in the Discord were around salaries, bonuses, and other HR issues - topics protected by the Equality Act of 2010 and relevant to the union members.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-acknowledges-gargantuan-grand-theft-auto-6-leak">major leaks in the past</a>, it's understandable Rockstar would be protective of its work. But it would appear this Discord server contained no confidential information about its games.</p>
<p>The catalyst towards these dismissals, however, appears to be the sharing and discussion in the server of changes to internal Slack policies.</p>
<p>Rockstar employees are unable to access their work emails outside of the office and, as at least one email concerning these internal policy changes was shared after work hours, it was instead discussed in this Discord server, with details and quotes shared.</p><p>People Make Games' source believes at least one server member brought this to Rockstar management, which reportedly led to an internal investigation into the Discord server. The Slack policy changes were initiated in the second week of October and by the end of the month, 34 employees had been fired - as such, the timing of these dismissals is in line with these messages, as the source suspects.</p>

<p>The Slack policy changes themselves include the removal of various miscellaneous chat channels concerning non-work topics, which Rockstar considered a distraction. The "Slack purge", as it became known by employees, proved unpopular and, as such, was discussed separately on the Discord server.</p>
<p>One Slack channel focused on gaming became a place for employees to share industry news on mass layoffs. Union members often reacted with the seedling emoji to show support. Elsewhere on Slack, employees would use emojis such as this (or the Palestine flag) in their status to show support for important causes. All of this was disallowed under Rockstar's new Slack policy.</p><p>"What we've seen time and time again is that Rockstar are desperately trying to prevent people from being able to communicate," IWGB president Alex Marshall told People Make Games. "And all these workers have ever been trying to do is to discuss their pay and conditions in order to try and improve them so they can deliver a game that's loved by millions."</p>
<p>Marshall also explained IWGB's presence in the Discord server is legally sound as it's completely normal for workers, when they join a union, to be supported by union staff.</p>
<p>Rockstar refused to comment on People Make Games' investigation.</p>
<p>In addition to the IWGB's legal case against Rockstar, over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">200 employees at Rockstar have signed a letter to management condemning the firing</a> of their fellow staff members.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">dismissal was also discussed in UK Parliament last week</a>.</p>

<p>With a 7CD physical release in the works</p>

<figure data-uuid="4bfd593560611"><a title="Shujinkou Soundtrack" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4bfd593560611/shujinkou-soundtrack.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Rice Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shujinkou">Shujinkou</a> surprised us all when it arrived on Switch in October, bringing its unique blend of dungeon-crawling RPG mechanics and the chance to learn Japanese through combat to the hybrid system after launching elsewhere in February. Now developer Rice Games is keeping the educational odyssey going with a release for the game's lengthy soundtrack, which recently went on sale as a digital download.</p>
<p>Popping up on <a href="https://ricegames.bandcamp.com/album/shujinkou-original-soundtrack">Bandcamp</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2098430/Shujinkou_Original_Soundtrack/">Steam</a>, and the <a href="https://ricegames.net/product/shujinkou-original-soundtrack-digital/">Rice Games store</a> for <strong>£19.99 / $25</strong>, the soundtrack comprises a whopping 158 tracks for almost seven hours of dungeon-crawling tunes. Lead composer Brian LaGuardia packs a bit of everything in there, too, with battle themes, character motifs, and minigame tunes spanning genres from classical to metal, rock to jazz.</p>
<p>All this comes from an orchestra of more than a dozen live performers, with the collection mastered by <a href="https://vgmdb.net/artist/13760">Ryuichi Tanaka</a> of Warner Music Japan — the same mastering engineer that you'll find on numerous Pokémon music collections.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, you can also stream the full collection on the likes of Spotify, Amazon, and YouTube, and there's a physical release on the horizon, too, with a seven-CD Collector's Edition planned to launch at some point in 2026. No word on price yet, but keep an eye out for that one.</p>

<p>If you missed it, Shujinkou is a dungeon-crawler that gives you the chance to learn Japanese as you play. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/shujinkou-has-been-updated-on-switch-here-are-the-patch-notes">A patch at the end of October</a> added a Visual Fidelity mode, which improved the presentation on Switch 2, as well as fixing some other issues. We've recently added expanded impressions to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shujinkou">our review</a> of the game, so if you like the sound of this unusual language-learning RPG, check it out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Serbian game development studio GFA Games announced that PIONER, their post-apocalyptic MMO first-person shooter, will launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> on Tuesday, December 16.</p>



<p>The announcement comes at the same time as the game has officially surpassed 500,000 wishlists. No details have been revealed yet on pricing, but we do know that there will be a Standard Edition and a Deluxe Edition. The latter will be more expensive, but it will grant access to the following in-game items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Unique Skin: “Renegade” - a unique, exclusive armor and gear design</li>



<li>Weapon Skin with VFX - a unique weapon skin for the entire AR platform, including AR-12, AR-16, and AR-16 Ifrit</li>



<li>Exclusive Founder Title - a status symbol for social interaction</li>



<li>Premium Currency - 500 Efritanium Crystals</li>



<li>Weapon Accessory: “Creepy Charm” - cosmetic trinket for a weapon</li>



<li>Gadget: “Katana” Watch - inspired by the iconic 80s Japanese watch design; a retro-futuristic style that fits the world of PIONER</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game, initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-is-an-impressive-survival-mmofps-inspired-by-stalker-and-metro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in 2021, was featured here on Wccftech multiple times thanks to two <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interviews with GFA Games</a>. We've often referred to it as clearly inspired by STALKER; it takes place on a vast post-apocalyptic island (spanning over 50 square kilometers filled with hidden dungeons, story quests and faction missions that influence alliances and rewards) where the remnants of the Soviet era have created an incredible alternate reality. As a social MMO, PIONER combines story-driven exploration with intense PvE and PvP gameplay. Here's an overview of what players can expect in this title:</p>



<ul>
<li>Story-driven campaign</li>



<li>Intense PvP modes</li>



<li>Unique Progression System that lets players grow their influence by completing quests, defeating monsters and exploring. The greater their influence, the more inclined merchants will be to sell you better items and the higher the quality of materials that will drop. Even non-combat abilities can be improved.</li>



<li>Diverse game activities include events, story-driven locations, and engaging mini-games such as fishing and Carnage, a unique tactical card mini-game featuring collectible decks, rewards, and ranked matches.</li>



<li>An extensive weapon customization system lets players tweak militarized weapons with a wide array of unique modules and designs.</li>



<li>Realistic survival mechanics require the maintenance of your character's strength by managing hunger, rest and resources.</li>



<li>In-depth crafting system: use artefacts, anomaly energy, and scavenged materials to craft powerful weapons and equipment at workbenches.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Earlier this year, it looked like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/629678/zombies-run-marvel-move-six-to-start-layoffs-fitness-tech">time was up for ZRX: Zombies, Run!</a>, a popular fitness app that mixed couch-to-5K plans with postapocalyptic audio storytelling. Now, cocreator and author Naomi Alderman has announced that she’s bought back the franchise from the brink.</p><p>Zombies, Run! was first founded in 2012 with about 10 million users worldwide. The app, made by Six to Start, immerses runners and walkers in an episode-based storyline where the undead “chase” users. Despite the expensive and time-intensive process, the company was successful enough to make other immersive fitness games, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23686893/marvel-move-six-to-start-running-fitness">Marvel Move</a>. Six to Start was bought by OliveX in 2021.</p><p>In March 2025, OliveX <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/629678/zombies-run-marvel-move-six-to-start-layoffs-fitness-tech">laid off all but two Six to Start staff members</a>, noting that the game would be shut down if a buyer could not be found. At the time, sources told <em>The Verge</em> that the Six to Start staff clashed with OliveX and its owner, Animoca Brands, over the games’ anticapitalist themes and the latter’s attempts to create crypto and NFT projects. Later, Six to Start alerted users that the Zombies, Run! app, archive, and message boards <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633758/zombies-run-six-to-start-layoffs-statement">would remain available</a>, but that future episodes were paused, leaving the app’s future in limbo.</p><p>“I am incredibly delighted to be taking ownership of the game. This isn’t a big corporate takeover, it’s me buying back the game I made and love so I can look after it,” Alderman wrote in <a href="https://zombiesrungame.com/">a post on the Zombies, Run! website</a>. Alderman also confirmed the news in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/naomialderman.bsky.social/post/3m6e5zqg3uc26">a Bluesky post</a>.</p><p>“We’re working on a new story for Zombies, Run!, which I’m intending to be a great ‘on-ramp’ for new players or people who want to come back to the game after a break,” Alderman tells <em>The Verge</em>. “We’ll also resume production on Season 11, which was paused halfway through — a very long cliffhanger to wait through!”</p><p>Alderman clarified that she hasn’t bought Six to Start. Rather, she’s bought the Zombies, Run! franchise, along with <a href="https://thewalkgame.com/">The Walk</a> — another immersive fitness game Alderman created with Six to Start. She also confirmed that Marvel Move had already been in the process of sunsetting, but that the app will be supported until the last annual subscription ends in July next year.</p><p>Alderman says that her main focus going forward will be preserving the app and experience, noting that she’ll be reaching out to the community soon with more news. “Zombies, Run! has been a community effort since the first Kickstarter, and we’ll keep it shambling on together.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjI1"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Victoria Song</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/827575/zombies-run-six-to-start-fitness-gaming]]></content:encoded>

Rockstar have been accused of union busting by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain over the firings, with the union having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company.</p>

<p>This new report from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisbratt.bsky.social/post/3m6eynx2ycc2f">People Make Games</a> cites an anonymous Rockstar insider as having passed on messages from the private Discord server Rockstar developers and IWGB staff were using to organise, with the insider claiming they believe these messages contributed to the firings. The alleged messages in question discuss and include snippets of text from internal Rockstar emails concerning a change in internal Slack policy, which the company reportedly announced to staff in the second week of October this year.</p>
<p>According to People Make Games, the policy changes included the removal of miscellaneous Slack channels which staff used for non-work related discussions, with Rockstar allegedly claiming these had become distracting and occasionally sources of poor conduct. The report claims that at least one of the two emails from Rockstar about the changes was sent out after 5PM UK time, with Rockstar staff reportedly only able to access their work emails while at the company office during work hours. Some members of the Discord who were still in office then allegedly shared information or quotes from the emails in the server, so staff who'd gone home could see and discuss them.</p>
<p>People Make Games claim Rockstar management then became aware of these messages when at least one non-union member of the Discord server reached out to them to express concern.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Rockstar for comment.</p>
<p>Asked about the Discord discussion of the Slack policy changes by People Make Games, IWGB union president Alex Marshall said the following:</p>
<blockquote>I think it is absolutely normal for people to be discussing their material conditions, whether that's bonuses, whether that's policies, whether that's anything like that. That's completely normal for staff to be doing that and for an employer to respond in a way that comes down so hard on that shows not only that they are governing by this lack of transparency, but they're also trying to govern by fear. They feel completely threatened by the idea of workers talking to each other and that's why they've taken this act to try and destroy the union, decimate any form of kind of solidarity being built between workers.</blockquote>
<p>Earlier this month, Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">raised the issue of the firings in UK Parliament</a>, revealing that she'd written to Rockstar asking for information about the issue and requesting a meeting with a relevant minister in the hopes of discussing what support may be offered to affected staff.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/djis-4-7-star-wireless-microphone-is-a-massive-pre-black-friday-steal-2000645986</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-goes-into-black-friday-clear-out-mode-with-the-mic-mini-bundle-and-each-mic-feels-practically-free.1362910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Look up any portable video device — smartphone, tablet, or camera — and you’ll get a full, vivid description of just how good its video quality is. That does leave out one very important and all-too-often ignored part of a truly pro-quality recording — the sound. Even the best smartphones and pocket-sized action cams can leave you with truly spectacular video paired with tinny, shallow sound filled with background noise.</p>
<p>There’s no need for a boom mic — the DJI Mic Mini wireless lavalier microphone transmitter is the tiny, ultra-lightweight (10 grams) solution that delivers exceptional sound from as far away as 400 meters. Content creators, vloggers, and travel buffs can give their content a massive upgrade for a lowest-ever price during this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/">Amazon Black Friday blowout that drops the price of the DJI Mic Mini by 45%, down to just $66.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Sound for Pro-Level Content</h2>
<p>As 4K or even higher-resolution video has moved from being the exclusive property of professional videographers to being a smartphone feature that you carry in your pocket, the world of content creation has exploded. But with ultra-hi-res videos and vlogs being created by virtually anyone and everyone, the best way to set yourself apart from the masses is with content that pairs that video with sound that’s just as good. DJI has mastered ultra-high-quality cameras, both in their tiny action cameras and their famous fleet of consumer drones. Once they turned their attention to sound, it was no surprise that the result was exceptionally small and lightweight, highly versatile, and of the best quality.</p>
<p>In barely a year’s time the Mic Mini has become the gold standard of rechargeable wireless microphones, with a stellar 4.7-star average rating at Amazon. It can be worn as a clip-on, on a lanyard, or magnetically attached to your clothes — regardless of how you decide to go, it’s unobtrusive on camera and able to deliver a highly stable, impeccable sound transmission from as far away as 400 meters, even in busy or noisy environments. Two built-in levels of noise cancellation — Basic for quiet indoor settings and Strong for noisy environments or outdoor shoots — cut out the background noise, often the biggest shortfall of video shot on a smartphone.</p>



<h2>The Total Package</h2>
<p>The sound quality of the DJI Mini Mic sets it apart from the built-in mics of any consumer-level video device — 48Hz sampling and 120 decibels of full, clear, rich sound. This Amazon deal includes everything you need to give your videos a huge sound boost – two transmitters and one receiver, a USB-C charging cable, four mini windscreens, a type-C smartphone adapter, two DJI Mic Mini Clip magnets, and a carrying pouch.</p>
<p>If you’re already shooting video with a DJI Osmo camera — the Pocket 3, Action 4, or Action 5 Pro, the Mini Mic can be used in a direct wireless connection to the camera, delivering premium audio without the need for a receiver. And a single charge gives you 48 hours of shoot time, so you never have to worry about going silent in the middle of a shoot.</p>
<p>For anyone who wants their videos to sound as good or even better than they look, this is the best $66 upgrade you can make. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/">It’s an amazing pre-Black Friday deal that’s live right now at Amazon — 45% off the price of the DJI Mic Mini.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-millennium-falcon-stays-full-price-on-official-site-but-selling-for-pennies-on-amazon-2000646840</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO’s official website lists flagship sets at full retail price year-round with very little pricing variations. Amazon manages its own inventory and slashed the prices of thousands of products aggressively on Black Friday. Indeed, while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">LEGO still sells the Star Wars Millennium Falcon (25th anniversary) set for $84 on its website, Amazon slashes it to $67</a>. This <strong>921-piece collectible build</strong> of one of the most iconic starships in cinematic history is now at its lowest price ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Star Wars Set</h2>
<p>The 921-piece construction is satisfying to build and requires several sessions of focused building time. Each bag of parts opens up a new section of the Falcon, from the detailed cockpit to the iconic sensor dish. The process of building naturally encourages mindful relaxation as you work your way through the instructions, never hurrying the pace.</p>
<p>The <strong>mid-scale size</strong> hits the sweet spot between desktop models and massive display pieces: At 9.5 inches long, 7.5 inches wide, and 5 inches high, the finished Falcon commands attention without dominating an entire shelf. The proportions of this LEGO version hold true to the ship from A New Hope and do so in a structurally safe way. You can place this next to other mid-scale starships from the LEGO Star Wars collection with no mismatched sizes. The dimensions are perfect for home office desks, bedroom shelves, or living room displays.</p>



<p>Authentic details recreate the Falcon’s most recognizable features in LEGO brick form: The cockpit sits offset on the starboard side, just as it should. The quad laser cannons rotate and articulate for different display poses. The sensor dish mounts on top in its classic pre-Return of the Jedi configuration. The hull greebling makes use of clever part combinations to suggest the weathered, lived-in aesthetic of the original prop.</p>
<p>Thoughtful presentation features on the display stand take this set from toy to décor piece. Instead of placing flat on the table, the angled mounting provides dynamic visual interest. The nameplate clearly identifies the ship for guests who might not be too familiar with Star Wars. There is <strong>also a brick that commemorates 25 years of LEGO’s partnership with Star Wars</strong>. This stand design shows LEGO understands their adult audience, wanting display-worthy builds rather than play sets.</p>



<p><strong>4.9 out of 5 stars, with almost 2,000 reviews,</strong> confirms this set lives up to expectations. More than 10,000 sold in the last month prove sustained popularity well beyond a niche following among Star Wars fans. The wide appeal crosses multiple demographics: long-time fans of the franchise, LEGO collectors, décor-conscious adults, and gift-givers seeking a well-appreciated gift. The universal recognition of the Millennium Falcon transcends typical hobby boundaries.</p>
<p>At $67, the Star Wars Millennium Falcon set offers collectible quality 20% off retail this Black Friday. LEGO’s official site is still charging full price, while Amazon moves inventory aggressively.</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios recently spoke about their next title, revealing that it shouldn’t be too far from Helldivers.</p>



<p>We have been hearing a lot about Helldivers 2 recently, with the developers also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-ceo-comments-on-switch-2-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting on a Switch 2 port</a>. However, we have yet to hear new details about the next game that Arrowhead Game Studios has been working on. The latest comments from the devs don’t provide too much information, but should be enough to make Helldivers fans happy. </p>



<h2 id="h-arrowhead-studios-next-game-will-not-be-too-far-from-helldivers">Arrowhead Studios’ Next Game Will Not Be ‘Too Far’ from Helldivers</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowheads-next-game-wont-be-something-thats-too-far-off-from-helldivers-2-creative-lead-says-were-looking-to-continue-the-legacy-of-what-weve-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Arrowhead Game Studios CCO, Johan Pilestedt, spoke a bit about their next title. Pilestedt first revealed that the game is currently in his favorite phase, the part he loves the most. The CCO revealed that he loves getting a new team together, breaking down boundaries among themselves, and getting to the heart of “who we are as people, and what games do we want to make together.”</p>



<p>Talking about what Arrowhead devs want to make, Pilestedt states that the team is “looking to continue the legacy of what we’ve created already.” The CCO added that the next title is “something that’s too far off from Helldivers”, which means that people who are massive Helldivers fans will be able to jump into their next game and “recognise the DNA” they have become familiar with over the years. The devs didn’t provide any more details about the game or explain how Helldivers will inspire it. </p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2’s Xbox port helped increase the sales and engagement for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 and PC versions</a>.

                <p>Bethesda did a shadowdrop for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered earlier this year, and it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">big success</a>. Another Bethesda-published game, Hi-Fi Rush, had a shadowdrop as well. Now, Bethesda Game Studios director Tom Mustaine is openly calling for more releases of this type in the future from other developers across the industry.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/after-oblivion-remastered-and-hi-fi-rush-bethesda-game-studios-director-wants-more-shadowdrops-because-we-all-have-short-attention-spans-now/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Mustaine said the shadowdrop approach is a favorite of Bethesda boss Todd Howard, and releasing games like this can be a way to reach players who may have short attention spans.</p><p>"We all have short attention spans now," he said. "There's Grand Theft Auto, for example. I want that today, right? So it is an interesting strategy ... I don't have any ideas of what would be next, but I hope it's not the last. Personally, I think it was great to own the internet for that day and, you know, give people exactly what they want the moment we talk about it. I'm a fan of that personally, but I'd love to see more people do it."</p><p>Oblivion Remastered was technically a shadowdrop because it was released on the same day that it was announced, but the game wasn't a total surprise to everyone. After all, the existence of the game had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leaked years earlier.</a> The same 2023 leak said a Fallout 3 remaster was planned, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-remaster-is-real-another-report-says/1100-6536093/" data-ref-id="1100-6536093">recent report said this game is still in the works.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">Speaking to GQ</a> earlier this year, Howard said he's a big fan of announcing games and releasing them shortly thereafter, and this has contributed to people believing the rumored Fallout 3 remaster could be a shadowdrop. He would also like for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> to "just appear" one day.</p><p>"I like to just announce stuff and release it. My perfect version--and I'm not saying this is going to happen--is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear," he said.</p><p>Next up for Bethesda is the Burning Springs update for Fallout 76, which releases on December 2. It adds Walton Goggins' The Ghoul from the Prime Video TV series, which itself returns for its second season on December 17.</p>

Set during ancient China's Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (about 907 to 979 AD), the game is this fantastical amalgam of MMO, action-adventure, and RPG mechanics that seamlessly blends into an open-world environment you can play either in solo or multiplayer modes. There are epic sword fights with flashy combos, Tai Chi moves to basically force-throw animals and enemies, and bosses that rival a From Software game in size and difficulty. Not to mention the wealth of content in the first two regions--Kaifeng and Qinghe--that easily contain hundreds of hours of stuff to do, secrets to find, puzzles to solve, and baddies to beat up. The best part is it's all totally free.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Where Winds Meet - Coming 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Almost everything you experience in Where Winds Meet is free to play. There are premium currencies to buy, a battle pass to purchase and upgrade, clothes and accessories to fill your (digital) wardrobe with--you know, "free-to-play" stuff. However, the action of the game--the bosses, the weapons, the main and side objectives, the minigames, etc.--doesn't cost you anything to play. That's true of future content as well. Since the game's Chinese servers get new features before the global ones do, players on those servers have shared what's coming to the game in upcoming updates, like new regions to explore and weapons to fight with.</p><p>All of this has skyrocketed Where Winds Meet to massive popularity. Following its global launch on November 14 for PC and PS5--it's been out in China since December 2024--the game reached two million players, becoming a top-three best-selling PlayStation game and a top-seven best-selling Steam game.</p><p>At the time of this writing, it's also rapidly climbing Steam's charts. According to data tracker <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3564740/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Where Winds Meet has a 24-hour peak player count of 251,008, with 201,807 people playing right now. It was so popular that, over the weekend, Where Winds Meet surpassed even Arc Raiders, sitting fourth on Steam's <a href="https://steamdb.info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most-played games</a> chart. Arc Raiders now has 207,234 players on right now, putting it above Where Winds Meet, but the two are struggling for fourth. Meanwhile, market research firm Circana states that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m6f2uc2g5s2z" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Where Winds Meet has cracked the top 15 on PC and PS5</a> for player engagement in the US and Canada.</p><p>It's not all sunshine and rainbows for the open-world martial-arts sim, though: The game reportedly uses a ton of generative AI for NPC voice acting and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wuxia-mmo-where-winds-meet-is-full-of-ai-chatbot-npcs-and-people-are-doing-all-the-standard-obscene-stuff-to-them-i-made-him-think-that-my-character-was-pregnant-with-his-child/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">chatbots</a>. One Redditor named MisterZan25 was even able to convince an NPC that they were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oxqhuz/anybody_else_mentally_break_the_zhao_dali_ai_just/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pregnant with his child</a>, leading the NPC to fall to his knees and weep uncontrollably. On top of that, the game's monetization, while completely ignorable, is a little wild. According to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/this-where-winds-meet-skin-can-cost-up-to-42000-if-youre-unlucky-3285089/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>, there's a skin that can cost you upwards of $40,000.</p><p>Still, this is a free-to-play game with a smattering of content that exposes a global audience to not just Chinese development but ancient Chinese lore as well. This doesn't excuse the wild monetization or disheartening AI usage, but it doesn't necessarily dampen an otherwise impressive Wuxia experience.</p><p>Where Winds Meet is available now on PC and PS5, with Android and iOS versions slated to launch on December 31.</p>

<p>Lurking in the shadows</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="f91587d6942cf"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f91587d6942cf/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>With just one week to go before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> arrives on Switch 2, Ubisoft has updated the game's eShop page with some noteworthy details to keep in mind before you buy. Like, for example, the dreaded file size.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Assassin-s-Creed-Shadows-2967695.html">updated listing</a>, Shadows will take up a beefy <strong>62.8 GB</strong> on your system. It's not the most surprising news considering the size of the game, but it's something to keep an eye on as we head towards release.</p>
<p>For reference, this file size puts Shadows above the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> (60.6 GB), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a> (57.1 GB), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a> (45.3 GB), but it's still a good step below <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> (69.2 GB) and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> (90-95 GB). Not the end of the world, then, but it might be time to start looking for a Micro SD Express, if you're hoping to have a couple of these in your library.</p>
<p>For those who missed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/its-official-assassins-creed-shadows-comes-to-switch-2-in-december-with-cross-progression">initial announcement</a>, Assassin's Creed Shadows will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>2nd December</strong>, complete with cross-progression saves, touchscreen support and all the title updates you could wish for — apart from the Claws of Awaji expansion, you'll have to wait until 2026 for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re on the hunt for a new monitor, be it for your main screen or as a second, or dare I say, a third display, you can get a solid piece of hardware without emptying out your entire wallet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5867/">Right now, Amazon has the ASUS ROG Strix — a 24.5-inch Full HD gaming monitor — on Black Friday sale for 43% off.</a> This hefty discount brings the price down by a whopping $130. It usually sells for $299, so that means you end up only having to pay $169 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5867/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Insane Frame Rates</h2>
<p>When it comes to monitors, if you want to stay within a reasonable budget, you’re going to need to make some decisions on what your priority is. Like, do you want your screen to be massive above all else? Do you want the sharpest detail with a crazy 4K resolution? Well, the ASUS ROG Strix is for the frame rate freaks out there. Sure, it only measures at a humble 24.5 inches. It only displays in your standard 1080p HD resolution. However, this monitor is capable of up to 310Hz. People love to argue online over what the maximum perception of the human eye is when it comes to screen refresh rates, but this thing has got to be approaching that.&nbsp;You’ll be able to game at ridiculously fast frame rates without sacrificing much size or detail. 24.5-inches and 1080p is still good.</p>



<p>The ASUS ROG Strix monitor has a 1ms response time. This will make it so all your inputs feel immediate and snappy. A high response time will make it so every move feels like you’re walking through mud. That won’t be a problem on this monitor. I’ve been playing <em>Ho</em><em>llow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>through Game Pass UItimate, meaning I have access to it on both my Xbox and my PC. I had started out on my Xbox which is connected to a fairly cheap 2017 Vizio. I struggled hard with a lot of the platforming sections, but then I switched over to playing on a new Lenovo Legion gaming laptop and man is that change night and day. I now know it’s time my TV gets and upgrade.</p>
<p>You have multiple options when it comes to how you connect to this ASUS monitor. It supports USB-C, DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI. So you can connect a laptop, your PC tower, a phone, or perhaps your new ASUS ROG Xbox Ally if you so please.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose and Sonos watched nervously as Amazon entered the soundbar market after noticing the category’s massive sales potential. Amazon’s strategy was simple: create their own hardware and undercut premium brands on price while delivering competitive quality. The <strong>Fire TV Soundbar Plus</strong> represents this approach perfectly and packs 3.1 channels, a built-in subwoofer, Dolby Atmos, and DTS:X into a package that costs a fraction of comparable models.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">$149, down from $249, this newest model has hit an all-time low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best Soundbar</h2>
<p>The <strong>integrated subwoofer</strong> addresses the most significant compromise in budget soundbars by housing appropriate bass drivers within the main unit. You get deep, room-filling low-end without buying and placing a separate subwoofer box. Action movies provide satisfying rumble during explosions and car chases. Music playback maintains warmth and body across genres from hip-hop to rock.</p>
<p>The <strong>3.1 configuration adds a dedicated center channel </strong>specifically for reproduction of dialogue. Conversations, narration, and vocal performances come through exceptionally well. You finally stop reaching for the remote when scenes switch between quiet talking and loud action. It also keeps your center channel focused on speech frequencies while left and right channels handle music and effects, which stops a muddy audio mix plaguing cheaper 2.0 soundbars.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos support introduces 3D audio</strong> that flies around and above your listening position. Height virtualization bounces the sound off your ceiling to create overhead effects in movies and shows. Helicopters fly over your head, rain falls from above, and atmospheric sounds envelope you on all sides. DTS:X offers similarly multi-dimensional audio with somewhat different processing. Both transform your living room into a theater-like experience without needing to install ceiling speakers.</p>
<p>Setup takes only minutes via a <strong>single HDMI cable attached to the eARC or ARC port on your TV</strong>. Audio automatically stays perfectly synchronized with video over the HDMI connection. You avoid the lip-sync issues that plague budget setups with optical cable connections. Power the soundbar on, and your TV instantly recognizes it. The included HDMI cable means you do not need to invest in any more accessories.</p>
<p>It has <strong>four preset audio modes that automatically adjust the sound</strong>, depending on the content. Movie mode enhances dynamic range for cinematic experiences with deep bass and clear dialogue. Music mode balances frequencies to accurately reproduce your favorite songs and albums. Sports mode amplifies crowd noise and commentary for live events. Night mode compresses dynamic range so late-night viewing won’t disturb others.</p>



<p>The Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus delivers premium features at nearly half the retail price this Black Friday, priced at $149. Amazon actually made up the soundbar category to begin with specifically to provide better value than the established brands. If cinematic audio is what you need but want to avoid the premium prices, then this record-low deal proves that you don’t need to spend over $500 on a soundbar.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The team behind FiveM has officially announced support for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition, allowing users to convert Legacy assets for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition through a new tool called Alchemist. </p>



<p>As we wait for Rockstar’s next big thing to arrive, GTA 6, players still have time to sink their teeth into all that Grand Theft Auto 5 and GTA Online have to offer. Recently, we were informed that GTA Online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-now-included-with-gta-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be included</a> with a GTA+ membership. Now, the modding community has some good news to celebrate, thanks to mods being updated for Enhanced Edition support. </p>



<h2 id="h-alchemist-will-convert-fivem-mods-for-gta-online-enhanced-edition">Alchemist Will Convert FiveM Mods for GTA Online Enhanced Edition</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-alchemist-for-fivem/5366795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> by Cfx.re (via <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/new-fivem-conversion-tool-released-by-rockstar-games-owned-team/#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Intel</a>), Alchemist is the first tool in a series of updates set to arrive for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition to support FiveM. The new tool will allow players, server owners, and creators to convert assets that were originally made for the GTA 5 Legacy edition and make them compatible with the Enhanced Edition. Alchemist also lets users refine existing Legacy assets to address potential formatting or compatibility issues introduced by earlier tools.</p>



<p>The Asset Conversion feature in Alcehmist allows users to convert a folder and all its content automatically. When choosing the folder, Alchemist can identify all GTA 5 Legacy assets inside the subfolders and “convert them to the GTAV Enhanced format inside the selected target directory.” The tool will also copy scripts, interfaces, and configuration files without altering them. </p>

Additionally, Rockstar’s recent firings have led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-after-firings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal issues</a> with IWGB.

"There is an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role in that game. Any nomination, or any credit I get, I have to give to him. I believe the performance of that character is really down to him and my voice was just a part of that process."</p><p>Cox was nominated for Best Performance alongside two other Expedition 33 actors, including Ben Starr and Jennifer English. Erika Ishii was nominated for Ghost of Yotei, Konatsu Kato for Silent Hill f, and Troy Baker for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p>Expedition 33 led all others this year with 12 total nominations, including a nod for Game of the Year. With 12 nominations, that makes it the most-nominated game in the history of The Game Awards.</p><p>The Game Awards take place on Thursday, December 11, but it's expected there will be teases ahead of that, so keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

            <p>An upcoming Pokémon game may have a darker story than you'd expect given its cheerful look and typical Nintendo vibrancy. With links to the original Pokémon game trilogy and hints at older lore, what appears to be a quirky spin on the franchise might actually have a sadder side if fan theories are spot on.</p>
<p>That game, for those not tuned into all things Pokémon, is Pokopia. This is an Animal Crossing style game in which you play a Ditto, morphed into human form, and find Pokémon spread around the island in order to restore some life to the place. Cool right?</p>
<p>Well, the extended trailer The Pokémon Company released earlier this month does offer some hints at a more dire tale hidden beneath the surface. First of all, while a Pokémon Centre is present, there are no other buildings. Ruins, sure, but no sign of human life. This is stated explicitly by your in-game guide Professor Tangrowth, who hasn't seen a human in a long time.</p>

<p>So what's happened? Well, there are some clues hidden fans believe which point to an important link to early Pokémon games. For one, the Pokédex seen at the start of the extended trailer is a generation one Pokédex, which offers a good starting point for where Pokopia takes place. Secondly, the game is set on an island, a key detail to the puzzle.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oxrrpd/cant_unsee_the_connection_after_rumors/">Pokémon fans believe the game may be set on Cinnabar island from the Kanto region</a>. This location was a key spot where the fire gym was located in the first generation Pokémon games: Blue, Red, and Yellow. However, by the time Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal takes place, the volcano on the island erupts, leaving only the Pokémon centre standing - just like the starting town we see in the Pokopia trailer.</p>
<p>Following this eruption the entire island is evacuated, explaining the lack of people present on the island despite clear evidence of buildings, roads, etc. In case you think this isn't enough evidence, there's actually more proof Pokémon Pokopia takes place on a post-eruption Cinnabar. Ditto, who you take control of in Pokopia, can only be found in one spot in the generation one Pokémon games: Pokémon Mansion. If this games <em>does</em> take place between the generation one and two Pokémon games, where else could a Ditto come from?</p>
<p>If we accept Pokémon Pokopia is set in Cinnabar Island it explains a lot of the new Pokémon we see in the trailer too. Pokémon Mansion is where a lot of experiments on Pokémon took place - it's where Mewtwo was created - so it's not out of the question to say other tinkering may have happened.</p>
<p>Failing that, the new Pokémon like Mosslax could simply be a Snorlax left in the same spot mid-sleep, uninterrupted for a super long time. Without people around, it's not out of the question. Maybe Smearguru is what happens when Smeargle is left alone to paint without interruption. Cinnabar may also explain the ghostly Pikachu we see: Peakychu. If there was a volcanic eruption then, well, maybe they got wiped out? A sad possibility.</p><p>There are alternate theories out there that are equally tantalising. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1p3sg81/pokopias_world_is_created_by_mewtwo/">Some believe this</a> could be some alternate spin on early Pokémon games where Mewtwo removed humans from the Kanto region. Not entirely off the cards, <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_multiverse">given alternate realities is something the Pokemon franchise has arguably embraced over the years</a>. In the Mystery Dungeon series there are no humans whatsoever, so anything is possible.</p>
<p>It's something fans of the franchise will surely be digging into come March 2026 when Pokémon Pokopia comes out on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Until then, theories and speculation run amok. Or perhaps, a-Muk.</p>

<p>The surprise sequel to the under-appreciated GameCube racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> has performed much better than its 2003 predecessor, boosted by fantastic visuals and performance, a plethora of characters and stages, and so many custom vehicles.</p>
<p>It's an absolute blast with friends, and our very own PJ O'Reilly agrees, scoring the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">an 8/10</a>, summing up that "This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards."</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adkymhgq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>It's a fantastic comeback, and yet another feather in Kirby's cap; seems the pink puffball can do little wrong on the Switch and Switch 2. We've <em>always</em> loved him, of course. But what about you lovely folks?</p>
<p>Yes, we want to hear what you think of Kirby Air Riders on Switch 2. Have you been blitzing through it all weekend and have some strong thoughts on it? Or have you just dabbled and want to put more time into it? You can give the game a score below and, if you change your mind later, come back and do just that!</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! If you've got even more thoughts to share about Kirby Air Riders, hop on that warp star and let us know if you're enjoying the game in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Alana has been with Nintendo Life since 2022, and while RPGs are her first love, Nintendo is a close second.

			<p>People who upgraded from a Nintendo Switch to a Nintendo Switch 2 quickly learned (if they didn't already know) that the MicroSD cards they used on the original Switch would not work with the Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, the Switch 2 requires <a href="https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/">MicroSD Express cards</a> to expand the system's 256 GB of internal storage. Finding those Express cards could, however, become more difficult and more expensive if a current shortage of non-Express MicroSD cards continues.</p>



<p>Why would a shortage of MicroSD cards impact MicroSD Express cards? The answer lies with AI companies. According to an interview with Japanese publication <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/articles/2511/22/news019.html?s=31">IT Media</a> (spotted and translated by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/microsd-cards/large-capacity-microsd-cards-are-now-regularly-out-of-stock-in-japan-as-storage-crunch-claims-another-victim-high-capacity-hdds-are-also-vanishing">Tom's Hardware</a>), while consumers seemingly moving towards using large-capacity MicroSD cards for their storage requirements is part of the issue, the bigger part is how AI companies are swallowing up huge amounts of storage products, including HDDs, SSDs, and MicroSD cards.</p>



<p>"<em>It looks like large-capacity models are getting sucked up for AI use, so we aren't getting any stock at all,</em>" one tech shop owner told IT Media. "<em>Everyone knows what's going on, so even if the price goes up, the drives sell out immediately...and the cycle repeats</em>."</p>



<p>It was already difficult to grab a MicroSD Express card <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-sell-out-amazon-best-buy-1851776846">when the Switch 2 was first revealed</a>. Now, with AI companies swallowing up storage stock, paired with a consumer move to MicroSD and MicroSD Express cards as the more common storage option, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/ongoing-microsd-shortages-could-have-a-knock-on-effect-for-switch-2-storage-availability">Nintendo Life</a> points out, a shortage and price hike of the only kind of storage cards the Nintendo Switch 2 uses feels inevitable. </p>



<p>Essentially, if you were already looking at <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-first-party-games-like-super-mario-odyssey-get-rare-discount-for-black-friday-2025/">grabbing a new game for your Switch 2</a>, or if you were looking to grab <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-nintendo-switch-2-deals-save-on-console-accessories-and-games/">a Switch 2 console as part of ongoing Black Friday sales</a>, then you would be wise to include a MicroSD Express card in your shopping cart while you can still get one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Post-apocalyptic MMO shooter&nbsp;<em>Pioner </em>now has an Early Access release date, so get ready to head into GFA Games' Soviet-inspired open world next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC via Steam Early Access on December 16th, and if you're a fan of games like GSC Game World's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-17" rel="nofollow"><em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>series</a>, Platypus'&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/misery-steam-return" rel="nofollow"><em>Misery</em></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Chernobylite&nbsp;</em>titles</a>, you might want to check this one out.</p>

<p><em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>(and yes, as far as I can tell, that's an intentional spelling rather than a typo) takes place in an "alternate reality inspired by the Soviet era" and aims to tell a story "deeply influenced by classic science fiction", so I guess you can throw&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/atomfall" rel="nofollow">Atomfall</a>&nbsp;</em>into the mix here as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pioner-release-date-warehouse.jpg?itok=do-Z5YKZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pioner-release-date-warehouse.jpg?itok=GsrRq1ao 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>looks like one for fans of&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Chernobylite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Since it's an MMO shooter,&nbsp;<em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>will feature both PvE and PvP gameplay; you can choose to take part in a "story-driven campaign" complete with "rich lore and engaging quests", but if you'd rather just dunk on your fellow players, "intense" PvP play will be available too.</p>

<p>The progression in&nbsp;<em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>is tied to influence; if you want to get better items from merchants and improve your abilities outside of combat, you'll need to increase your influence by completing quests, exploring the world, and killing monsters.</p>

<p>As well as the core gameplay,&nbsp;<em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>will also offer a host of diversions including a fishing minigame and a "unique tactical card mini-game" by the name of Carnage, which sounds like it'll suck you in if you're a fan of&nbsp;Gwent or Queen's Blood.</p>

<p>You can check out the new release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pioner</em>, which also gives a sense of what kind of world awaits you should you decide to take the plunge, right here.</p>




<p><em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on December 16th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
