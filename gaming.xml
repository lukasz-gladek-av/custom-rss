			<p>Since its release in 2023, Baldur's Gate 3 has taken the world by storm. It isn't much of a surprise, really, considering how much content and customization there is, as well as some truly lovable (and hateable) characters that you can romance or kill. The main thing is that most things in the game are completely up to you, and you can choose to play the game in a myriad of ways, with each playthrough having the potential to be different from the previous one. When it comes to single-player RPGs, they tend to die off relatively quickly, as people will have completed the story shortly after it comes out. However, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to remain healthy, with a strong and consistent player base. According to Larian's Director of Publishing, Michael Douse, Baldur's Gate 3 performed better this year than it did in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1859244899847069827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Douse revealed</a> that the daily peak player counts were up by 3% compared to last year, with average daily users up by 20% and average daily Steam Deck users up by 60%. There are many factors that could be contributing to the fact that Baldur's Gate 3 continues to be popular. A lot of it likely revolves around the fact that Larian Studios has had great community support, and has patched the game where it needs, as well as adding new content. Since it was released, the game has received multiple new endings for the main companions, as well as official mod support.</p>
<p>Even Douse has said that mods are a huge reason as to why more people are playing Baldur's Gate 3. While mods were available on PC previously, they didn't have official support from the developers and required a fair few steps to install, which could lead to your game bricking. However, the developers have now added an official mod manager, which allows people to mod their game with ease and makes the removal of them significantly more accessible.</p>
<p>One of the most monumental moves made by Larian was allowing those on console access to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-available-for-mac-and-consoles/">the mod manager</a>. It's a huge rarity that games on console can get any sort of modding. For example, games like The Sims 4 are notorious for being modded on PC, but that just isn't an option for console players. This was a huge move by Larian and has definitely helped keep the game relevant, as well as their consistent updates to the game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-27-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/honkai-star-rail-version-2-7-release-date-bids-farewell-to-penacony.1042962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-27-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.7 release date has been revealed, so get ready to bid farewell to Penacony and embark on a new adventure to lands unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Version 2.7 of the turn-based gacha RPG officially arrives on December 4th. In&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-26-release-date" rel="nofollow">Version 2.6</a>, you brought the events of a "trailblazing silkpunk saga" to their climax, but now, you'll be wrapping things up in Penacony before heading off to the mysterious land of Amphoreus.</p>

<p>As HoYoverse tells it, you'll be making new memories with your friends in Penacony while Miss Himeko gathers information about Amphoreus in preparation for moving the story to the Eternal Land.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.7-release-date-fugue.jpg?itok=OMjGirLk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.7-release-date-fugue.jpg?itok=LkBMdQK4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As ever, you'll have new characters to add to your team in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>'s latest update.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd probably expect if you're a&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll have two new characters to add to your roster in Version 2.7.</p>

<p>Your first new character is Sunday, a five-star Imaginary fighter who provides powerful buffs to his team and allows other characters to immediately take action. You'll want to add him to your team if you're looking for some solid support.</p>

<p>Joining Sunday in this update is Fugue, a foxian girl who applies a powerful debuff to enemies. When said debuff reaches zero, enemies take damage, and Fugue's abilities also allow her party members to dish out some extra pain, so she's a valuable addition to any lineup.</p>




<p>Two additional characters will feature in reruns for Version 2.7. In the first half of the update, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-gameplay-trailer-celebrates-release-of-new-character-jing-yuan" rel="nofollow">Jing Yuan</a> will make a return, while the second half will see Firefly once again up for grabs.</p>

<p>A number of other major additions and improvements are set to arrive as part of this update as well, including customizable quarters for the Trailblazer. As HoYoverse prepares for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.0, you'll also get&nbsp;the new Path of Remembrance system and updates to Relics, plus lots more.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on PC, PS5, and mobile devices. Version 2.7 arrives on December 4th.</p>

Despite playing for three weeks, we <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wishlist-cards-wonder-pick-1851704678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wishlist-cards-wonder-pick-1851704678">only just discovered the game has a wishlist option</a></span>!</p><p>Most significant of these anomalies is the Pack Point Exchange.

The game at least introduces this concept to you, but later, when you want to find it again, it’s bizarrely concealed.</p><p>To use the points, you have to do something entirely counter-intuitive: Go as if to open a pack. This is genuinely the only place in the game where you can access the feature, and it’s completely unlabeled too. Once you’ve tapped to open a new pack, next to the three pack arts you can choose from, in a tiny circle at the bottom-right of the screen, there’s a picture of...well, it’s a picture of a zippo lighter. Tap that, and then you can buy cards. It’s ridiculous!</p><p>And talking of the Pack Point Exchange...</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="50db3406ec898c9f30ead2f85dc991ef" data-recommend-id="image://50db3406ec898c9f30ead2f85dc991ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Let us spend Pack Points when browsing our collection" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Let us spend Pack Points when browsing our collection" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50db3406ec898c9f30ead2f85dc991ef" data-recommend-id="image://50db3406ec898c9f30ead2f85dc991ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Let us spend Pack Points when browsing our collection" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The most obvious place to put the Pack Point Exchange button would be when browsing your own collection, the My Cards area.

Tap on these, and you can see all the details, except for the artwork (and indeed wishlist them).</p><p>But what you <em>cannot</em> do is buy them with the Pack Points! It’s such an unbelievably obvious option, making it downright odd that it wasn’t in the game at launch.

Or a guilty face when your own pack deals you exactly the right cards on your first turn.</p><p>Clearly nothing that can be abused, and obviously nothing that lets you send messages, but just a bunch of emojis would make a big difference.

So four times out of five, you don’t get what you wanted. That sucks enough on its own, but the game’s insistence on painfully slowly returning you to the screen to watch the rest of the cards flip over, showing you the location of the card you actually wanted, is miserable.</p><p>Perhaps some people want it, want to know where it would have been, so they can cry, “That was the card I was going to choose!

You need to create a password, and then that other person needs to enter the same password, then you have the game search for others using that word to pair up. It works, and that’s all fine, but it could be <em>so</em> much simpler. There’s a friends list! You can click on profiles of people you’ve befriended, view their battle record, see their emblems, number of cards, and unlocked achievements. But you cannot just click to send a battle request. Which is bonkers.</p><p>So, you know, add that.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-recommend-id="image://8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fix the whole UI!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fix the whole UI!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-recommend-id="image://8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fix the whole UI!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>What a mess this game is. It’s like new features were added via a game of pin the tail on the donkey, the developers blindfolding themselves before slapping a button or core element into the UI.</p><p>The eight different pages of the Shop, split into three sections, with a page in two of them that’s just completely blank, are indicative of what a muddle everything is. It needs to be screwed up into a ball and thrown away, starting over entirely.</p><p>As mentioned, the option to spend Pack Points is hidden only on the page for opening packs, while buttons to access your own decks appear at random in different places on the screen, in different sections, but then disappear on the sub-pages where you want them most. There are seven different pages of missions (although that goes up and down as events come and go), but for some reason one of them (Themed Collections) is on a button separate from all the other tabs. Absolutely everything is loopy, and it’s far too hard to remember where you’re supposed to go for each disparate element.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-recommend-id="image://b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Make Premium something worth paying for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Make Premium something worth paying for." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-recommend-id="image://b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Make Premium something worth paying for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>OK, this is where it gets a bit more serious. Of all the strangest choices this deeply strange card game makes, the paid-for Premium Missions are the worst. Asking people for $10 a month, and then offering a handful of desultory tasks with insultingly poor rewards, all easily completed in a couple of days of casual play, feels like a monstrous misstep.</p><p>Rewards are <em>so</em> awful. Giving paying customers a single Pack Hourglass for completing “Open 20 booster packs,” for instance, is gobsmacking. Weeeeeee, a whole hour off before I can open a new pack! However can you afford to be so generous?!</p><p>A battle pass is supposed to be a series of grinds that give players a motivation to keep coming back all season. Sure, there are crazy people who’ll somehow reach level 200 in <em>Fortnite</em> in the first week, but for normies, it’s a long list of rewards given for continued progress, combined with new missions every day, week, and storyline. And it costs less, and lasts three times as long!</p><p>Or for a more direct comparison, look at <em>Marvel Snap</em>. For the fee, you get an enormously long list of unlocks that’ll take you weeks to finish, unlocking the coolest versions of favorite cards, and all manner of other decorative bonuses. In this light, <em>Pocket’s </em>battle pass is outrageous, its embarrassing handful of rewards gained almost immediately (five Mewtwo-themed decorations, and a single Pikachu card), the Premium section of both the Missions and the Shop then just left grayed out and a grim reminder of wasted money for the other 29 days in the month.</p><p>Yes, you get an extra pack a day for this too. That’s not nothing. But it’s also nowhere near enough.</p><p>This desperately needs to be improved, or people are going to bail on it in droves. In fact, the launch version has been so awful that some sort of redress seems in order, an apologetic pile of hourglasses and shop tickets handed to us suckers who forked out in the hope that it would update or improve at some point after the two week free trial.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Your Thief, meanwhile, can use AOE weapons, learn some of the best out-of-battle abilities in the game, and always has a chance to steal items at the end of battles. Lastly, as you can guess, your Priest will ensure your team’s health stays topped off, and they’ll eventually even learn a resurrection spell that is a borderline must-have in long, difficult dungeons.</p><figure id="" data-id="c817dc2f5a1e2bbd696d8b0f0c7abfe0" data-recommend-id="image://c817dc2f5a1e2bbd696d8b0f0c7abfe0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party fights monsters in a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The party fights monsters in a building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c817dc2f5a1e2bbd696d8b0f0c7abfe0" data-recommend-id="image://c817dc2f5a1e2bbd696d8b0f0c7abfe0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party fights monsters in a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This setup covers every base in terms of offense, defense, and support to ensure that you’re rarely in a position where your team doesn’t have an advantage.

<p>As announced by Atari, the theme park sim will arrive on 5th December, with the Switch version joining its availability on mobile and PC.</p>
<p>The re-release pairs the original RollerCoaster Tycoon with its sequel, bringing updated UI and controls.</p>

<p>These two games are generally considered the best in the series, and even if they're showing their age, their simplicity is charming compared to more recent sim games.</p>
<p>Indeed, it's great timing from Atari just after the release of Frontier's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>, a game with far more modern enhancements.</p>
<p>Atari is the sole publisher of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, after<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-has-bought-rollercoaster-tycoon-3-for-7m"> acquiring the rights to the third game from Frontier</a> earlier this year. Atari boss Wade Rosen said at the time this would bring "new opportunities for Atari" and "benefits to the fans of games across the Rollercoaster Tycoon franchise".</p>
<p>This Switch release of RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic (not the third game) is the only follow-up news so far, so it's unclear what's in store for the rest of the series.</p>
<p>For an alternative, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-theme-park-management-sim-parkitect-hits-playstation-and-xbox-this-week">Parkitect was released on PlayStation and Xbox consoles</a> earlier this year, following its previous PC release. It's a classic take on the theme park sim genre, akin to RollerCoaster Tycoon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Virtua Fighter is finally making its return to PC with the release of Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. For those who are excited about the return of this beloved franchise, the game is now available to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlisted on Steam</a>. This <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-game-is-in-development-sega-confirms/">news comes after Sega confirmed that a new Virtua Fighter</a> game was in the works just a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; This title is based on Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown and is set to provide players with an optimized gaming experience. The game will be offering support of 4K60 and is the first game in 13 years to feature balance adjustments. The upcoming title is also set to support rollback netcode, which will allow players who don't have access to a wired connection to enjoy a smoother experience on the battlefield and will allow everyone around the globe to participate in heated battles.</p>
<p>At the moment, there aren't too many details that are being revealed about Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O., as Sega is currently keeping it all under wraps. However, it's been confirmed that a 2.0 update is planned for Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown for those who are playing the game on PlayStation 4. To celebrate the announcement of Virtua Fighter coming to PC, the Opening Cinematic trailer has been released to show off some of the content that players can expect from the upcoming title. The video is just over two and a half minutes long and showcases some of the iconic fighters that will be making an appearance in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="VIRTUA FIGHTER 5 R.E.V.O. - Opening Cinematic" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/einEYdj3nAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O will feature all of the beloved classic game modes, such as Arcade and Rank Match, with the ability to create custom online tournaments and leagues with up to 16 players. For those who are trying to become the best with their Kung Fu skills, you can also watch in Spectator Mode so that you can take notes from the battles you are watching.</p>
<p>According to the Steam page of the game, there will be 19 playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style. Of course, like most modern fighting games, you'll be able to customize them with accessories and costumes that make them feel personalized to you.</p>
<p>Along with the Arcade and Rank Match game modes, there will also be the Training and Versus game modes, providing plenty of variety for those who aren't sure what game mode they want to start with.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. when it comes out?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-gets-beloved-game-boy-donkey-kong-platformer.1042911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-donkey-kong-land<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added another Game Boy game to the Nintendo Switch Online roster, and if you're looking for a platformer to keep you entertained this Thanksgiving, you could do a lot worse than this one.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1859764097480355961" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today</a>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>has found its way to the Switch Online library. It joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-july" rel="nofollow">Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Oracle&nbsp;</em>games</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch" rel="nofollow">Super Mario Land</a></em>, as well as many other Game Boy classics.</p>

<p>Rather intriguingly, the plot for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>sees Cranky Kong and King K. Rool working together in order to get Diddy and Donkey Kong to prove they can successfully embark on an adventure on the Game Boy. It's all very meta.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-land-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=VcjDjt5q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-land-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=9U3ysc_K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>takes a decidedly more meta approach to proceedings.</figcaption></figure><p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Land</em>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>is an entirely original game rather than a remake or port of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country</em>. It features 30 levels across four worlds, and it also features several of the staples of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>platformers, including collecting K-O-N-G letters, firing yourself from barrel cannons, and more.</p>

<p>The game features similar visuals to&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, with developer Rare using the same technology as in the SNES series to transfer pre-rendered graphics into a 2D space.</p>

<p>Despite that, it does also take the Game Boy's limitations into account in some ways; the system is more limited than the SNES from a technical standpoint, for instance, so only one Kong can appear on screen rather than the two of them working in tandem.</p>




<p><em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now on Nintendo Switch. All you need is a Switch Online membership; you won't need an Expansion Pack addon like you would to play <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/38-nintendo-switch-online-n64-games-are-planned-dataminer-says" rel="nofollow">N64 games</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance titles</a>.</p>

<p>Despite several&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>games being made available via Switch Online,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong 64&nbsp;</em>is yet to make its way to the service. We'll have to wait and see whether it does or not in the coming months.</p>

		<p><em>It's often shocking how little changes to a home can have a big impact. You become accustomed to how things are supposed to work because that's the way they've always worked. In reality, you've gotten used to a bad way of doing things—or, at least, there's a better way of doing them.</em></p><p><em>Can life feel lighter by the simple purchase of a wireless vacuum?</em></p><p><em>Does the sun shine a little brighter if your garage closes on its own?</em></p><p><em>One can dream, one home automation at a time.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> We got a new vacuum a couple weeks ago. Our venerable Shark bagless vacuum had lost just enough attachments and suffered enough other damage that it was time to consider replacing it, and I was strongly considering returning to the world of old-school vacuum cleaners with their tidy little bags. I’d loved the Shark but there were times I wondered, as I stood in a cloud of gross dust as I emptied its container into a trash can, whether a bagless vacuum cleaner really represented the kind of progress I wanted.</p><p>MK, however, strenuously opposed any move toward a bagged vacuum cleaner or toward just getting another, newer Shark. Her argument was pretty simple: we don’t really have to worry about vacuuming floors or carpets. The place we have trouble is in the corners of our apartment, or the crevices in our furniture. Those are the places we find mice making themselves overly comfortable, or where we see crumbs of food or scraps of dog toys accumulating. We need to be cleaning those areas every day, maybe multiple times a day. The kinds of vacuums I was considering, she argued, were going to fail and fail miserably.</p><p>I’ll spare you the argument we had. Suffice it to say, I didn’t see why we couldn’t just use the attachments that came with the other vacuum cleaners we were considering. The Shark could do all this, so why not just get another one if she was so unmoved by the other options? The answer was simple: because it had cords. And if it had cords, we were never going to use it.</p><p>Patrick, I have to tell you how embarrassingly right this has proven to be. I thought we’d made okay use of our vacuum cleaner, but I’d often find myself saying, “Well we just need to be better about cleaning” every time we realized we were dealing with another mouse incursion. That if we were more conscientious, we’d put the vacuum to work and stay on top of housekeeping the way we needed to. But MK’s insight appears to have been <em>the </em>insight. The simple steps of fishing the vacuum out of the closet, unwinding the power cord, and plugging it in were insurmountable hurdles. Not too bad if we were vacuuming the whole house or even just the whole living room but for just doing a quick spot-clean around the fridge or along the baseboards under the cabinets? It was stopping us dead in our tracks, without even being aware of it. We’d just glance at the floor and think, “That’s not bad” and spare ourselves the whole effort.</p><p>We ended up getting an LG stick vacuum that sits on a big charger stand in the corner of our living room. Truthfully, I don’t love the look of it just sitting there, but on the other hand I can just grab it, vacuum up a bit of kitchen detritus or loose dog kibble before bed, and return it to its charger in the space of about thirty seconds. I don’t even have to empty out its little chamber: the stand has a bag inside it that the vacuum discharges into when it’s replaced on its charger.</p><p>I didn’t think “plugging in a vacuum cleaner” was a hurdle between me and keeping the house clean. Since we got this thing, though, I have to admit it was the <em>entire </em>ballgame. From the standpoint of pure math it makes sense: doing anything with the old vacuum cleaner was going to take about five minutes. Two minutes taking it out and putting it away, a minute emptying the chamber, and then a minute fussing with attachments and cords. If you just need to do 30 seconds of work, four minutes of preparation and storage work is ridiculously wasteful. But I didn’t see it that way. I just felt like my tendency to sloth was causing me to use my nice vacuum cleaner less than I’d have wished.</p><p>Do you have any steps associated with an important chore or task that aren’t that difficult, but you kind of hate regardless? Have you ever gotten an upgrade or made a lateral move toward a different piece of equipment and realized things had been way, way more difficult than they needed to be?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@norevisions?ref=remapradio.com"><span>No Revisions</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Ah, this is funny. Some of my earliest movement towards “smart” devices when we bought our house eight years ago was entirely driven by me running into an issue with the house that I could not solve through regular memory, habit, and phone/watch reminders. This is a low stakes issue, but I could not, for the life of me, remember to turn off the outdoor lights that sit encased above our front door. I also could not, for the life of me, remember to turn them on at night. When I did one, I would forget the other, leading to situations where the light was either left on all day or never flipped on when the sun went down.</p><p>Frustrated, I finally investigated these so-called “Phillips Hue” light bulbs my friends online kept chattering on about. The lights required for my light fixture were candelabras—<em>smart</em> candelabras. And naturally, they were more expensive. But the idea of having the lights go on, then off, then on again, then off again without ever having to think about on/off again was tremendously appealing. Being able to alter their habits when we were out of town was appealing, too. I looked up how well such lights hold up under cold weather and was told by reddit to “not worry about it.” Eight years later, they’re doing fine, and my brain has never, ever had to think about whether those lights have been in the right position for near a decade.</p><p>It’s the small things, no?&nbsp;</p>

The Game Boy game--which originally launched in 1995--is now available on Switch Online.</p><p dir="ltr">Coming out a year after Donkey Kong Country on SNES, Donkey Kong Land saw Rare trying to bring the same sort of side-scrolling experience to the less-powerful Game Boy.

In February, five classic Rare games came to the service, such as Killer Instinct and R.C. Pro-Am. That lineup also saw Blast Corps land on Switch Online + Expansion Pack, the premium tier for the subscription service. A basic Switch Online sub costs $20 a year, while the Expansion Pack upgrade is $50 annually.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/banjo-tooie-coming-to-ie-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack/1100-6527254/" data-ref-id="1100-6527254">Banjo-Tooie hit Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a>, almost three years after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-switch-online-in-january/1100-6498881/" data-ref-id="1100-6498881">the original Nintendo 64 game landed on the service</a>.

            <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has announced the game has already sold 1m copies in just a few days since release.</p>
<p>That figure does not include those who have taken to The Zone via Game Pass, meaning the game has been played by even more players.</p>
<p>"No wonder it feels a bit crowdy in the Zone," the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl team wrote on social media platform X, announcing this sales figure.</p>

<p>"This is just the start of our unforgettable adventure," it continued. "The Heart of Chornobyl emanates stronger with each of us. Thank You, stalkers!"</p>
<p>The game got off to a strong start on Steam, where on its launch it peaked at 113,587 concurrent players. In the last 24 hours, that number has risen once again. At the time of writing, its all-time player peak on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1643320/charts/">Valve's platform</a> now sits at 117,928.</p><p>These sales figures and impressive player numbers are despite a number of bugs present in the game itself. The developer has already acknowledged there are a few issues, and earlier this week it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">assured players it will address any issues that arise in the game</a>, as and when it is able.</p>

One of these very welcomed additions is the Monster Wrangler, an extremely strong vocation that wasn’t available in the original game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,195719,196572" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-remake-review-hd-2d-changes-quality-of-l-1851700918&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-remake-review-hd-2d-changes-quality-of-l-1851700918"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> Is A Gorgeous Remake That Stays Stubbornly Faithful To An RPG Classic</a></span><br><strong>Order Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fdragon-quest-iii-hd2d-remake%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fdragon-quest-iii-hd2d-remake%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/b5tna58zaaqyu&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/b5tna58zaaqyu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy</a></span></p><p>But what exactly is the Monster Wrangler, and is it worth adding one to your lineup?</p><h2 id="h101771"><a id=""></a>How Does The Monster Wrangler Work?</h2><p>The Monster Wrangler is a vocation that allows you to tame monsters and use their abilities in battle. Unlike most vocations, this one requires you to invest time outside of battle to find monsters and earn their abilities for yourself, so it’s not recommended for anyone seeking a straightforward, no-frills party setup.</p><p>As you continue to level up, you’ll eventually earn an ability known as “Animal Instinct”, which lets you know when there are monsters nearby that you can tame. However, recruiting them won’t always be easy, as you’ll sometimes need to meet certain requirements or use special items to ease them into befriending you. It’s worth the effort, though, as filling out your abilities list is the only meaningful way to advance this class.</p><h2 id="h101772"><a id=""></a>Is The Monster Wrangler Any good?</h2><figure id="" data-id="936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-recommend-id="image://936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters choose vocations in a fantasy inn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters choose vocations in a fantasy inn." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-recommend-id="image://936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters choose vocations in a fantasy inn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Monster Wrangler is certainly one of <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>’s most unique vocations, but is it actually worth using over other options? </p><p>The short answer is, well, <strong>yes</strong>!</p><p>The Monster Wrangler begins the game feeling slightly underpowered compared to more traditional vocations because it doesn’t have many offensive options at its disposal at first. But it eventually becomes a powerhouse as players advance through the campaign adding more and more monster abilities to their arsenal. </p><p>This vocation is especially useful for late-game grinding, such as facing off against Metal Slimes, as you can use its Call of the Wild/Monster Pile-On ability to call in your animal companions for multi-hit damage against random enemies (or just an onslaught of attacks against a single foe). Additionally, it can use whips and boomerangs, which are both excellent weapons for hitting multiple enemies at one time.</p><p>Ultimately, whether the Monster Wrangler is right for you will depend entirely on what type of party you’re trying to build. But most groups are likely to benefit from this vocation’s various high-damage abilities and support potential, so don’t shy away from it just because it’s a bit slow to get going!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Blizzard is holding another PTR (Public Test Realm) for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>, testing some of the new features and content that will be arriving in Season 7 next year. Here's everything Diablo 4 players on PC will be able to preview during the 2.1 update test period, which will run December 3-10.</p><p>One of the major new features previewed in the 2.1 PTR is the Armory, a new feature that will allow players to swap between different builds easily. The Armory lets you save, load, and name your favorite character builds, with five different built slots allotted per character. Loadouts will save a character's equipped items, Paragon Board and Glyphs, skill selections, and class mechanic. Switching between them will display the relevant details at a glance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4403903-gm3881bh7qmz1732059279370.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4403903-gm3881bh7qmz1732059279370.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403903"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4403903-gm3881bh7qmz1732059279370.jpg"></figure><p>2.1 will also let players master Witchcraft, with three new schools of Hawezar sorcery to learn. These include Eldritch, which focuses on destructive energies and polymorphy; Psyche, a defensive magic based on mind and spirit; and Growth &amp; Decay, a type of magic based on the dichotomy of healing and harming.</p><p>Players will have to complete seasonal tasks to learn Witchcraft, completing new Whisper bounties and defeating the new Headrotten enemies to earn Restless Rot. This new seasonal currency can be exchanged at a Coven's Altar at the Tree of Whispers to unlock and upgrade new Witchcraft powers. The full list of available powers, at least for the PTR version of Witchcraft, can be found below.</p><p>As part of the seasonal content, players will be tasked with hunting the new Headrotten enemy, which can be found in Headhunt subzones and Roothold micro-dungeons. Headrotten also have a few unique boss variants, including the Headless Husk and Fugitive Head. The latter harbors a parasitic Stolen Head, which can be collected upon its defeat and returned to Gelena in exchange for Occult Gems.</p><p>Another new feature, Occult Gems can be placed into items with available sockets to add unique effects and upgrades that complement the new Witchcraft powers. Gelena will also craft Occult Gems in exchange for Restless Rot, Gem Fragments, and Fugitive Heads. The full list of Occult Gems and their effects can be found below.</p><p>The PTR test will also include a number of new Runes, Legendary Aspects, and Unique Items, all of which are detailed below.</p><p>In order to test out the update between December 3-10, players can download the PTR through the Battle.net app, by selecting the Public Test Realm option from the selector above the Play button. Players can copy in a character from their main account from the PTR's character select screen, and can use the PTR boost NPC in Kyovashad to make sure they're properly specced for the new content.</p><p>Check out all the new powers, upgrades, and items coming to the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24162193/the-2-1-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2.1 PTR test</a>:</p><h2>Witchcraft Powers</h2><h3>Eldritch Powers</h3><p>Firebat Servants</p><ul><li>A deadly swarm of Firebats swarm enemies every 2 seconds, inflicting X total Fire damage over 1 total attack.</li><li>At Higher Ranks: Enemies are Stunned for 3 seconds after being hit 5 times by your Firebat Servants.</li></ul><p>Abyssal Resonance</p><ul><li>Every 250 Resource spent, release an explosion dealing X Shadow damage.

To mark the occasion, Ubisoft has dropped a launch trailer that explains how Kay Vess and her friends get drawn into an adventure alongside the legendary Lando Calrissian. But it looks like they'll be on opposite sides at the start.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc7FhNxCk8c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oc7FhNxCk8c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>An outlaw's reputation means everything in the underworld, which is how the Empire is able to successfully blackmail Kay into working for them on this mission. If she refuses, the Empire will simply let it be known that Kay is one of their operatives and the various syndicates will mark her for death. To keep the Empire off of her back, Kay also has to win a high-stakes Sabacc tournament against some of the game's best players--who may also be flagrant cheaters like Lando.</p><p>Naturally, this arrangement is destined to go sideways as Lando and Kay escape on her ship. From there, we're not sure where the story is going, but it's an encouraging way to tease the DLC. Ubisoft has also dropped a massive update for the game that--among other things--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/" data-ref-id="1100-6527925">does away with forced stealth missions</a>. From now on, Kay can shoot her way out of some tight spots without failing her mission. Most of the major gameplay changes are laid out in the new video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-X1YI7WIxM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2-X1YI7WIxM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ubisoft has put a lot of post-launch work into Outlaws because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">its initial sales were very disappointing</a> and players had a lot of complaints about certain aspects of the game.

Its legions of beloved fans stick around even though its core gameplay hasn't changed much since 2004 (though it has been repeatedly overhauled and improved). Players pick a race, class, and gender, then set out into the world to complete quests, raid dungeons, and fight other players using unique spells and abilities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What once pressed against the technical limits of online play is now quaint in an age of battle royales and co-op basebuilding games. And yet, it persists. And not merely persists—millions of players still log in regularly to raid dungeons, bringing in extraordinary cash for the studio and its new parent company Microsoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This Saturday, the venerated MMORPG officially turns 20. At Gamescom 2024, we asked production director Michael Bybee and game producer George Velev about the game's long-lasting appeal—and what its current stewards are doing to make sure it never goes away.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="World of Warcraft "><span>World of Warcraft </span>players want a reason to log in every day</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team at Blizzard is fully aware it doesn't take much to drag someone away from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "We're ultimately competing for everyone's attention and we compete with everything, including things like Netflix," Bybee said. "If we're not giving you something interesting or engaging to do, [players] are gonna go somewhere else."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/avowed-director-carrie-patel-explains-how-obsidian-pushes-boundaries-in-the-fantasy-genre" target="_self">Avowed director Carrie Patel explains how Obsidian pushes boundaries in the fantasy genre</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was a problem Blizzard ran into with the expansion </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadowlands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which released to positive reviews but soon saw a drop-off in players. (It didn't help that the critically acclaimed MMORPG </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XIV</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a dark horse competitor to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was enjoying great word-of-mouth marketing).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beginning with the next expansion </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragonflight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Blizzard began releasing content at what Bybee referred to as a "faster pace." Around this time, the company began </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/blizzard-may-be-ready-to-annualize-i-world-of-warcraft-s-i-expansions">shifting its production structure</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to support two expansion teams and one "live service" team. The company had always worked several expansions ahead, but the hope now was that Blizzard could plan expansions in a way that let them tease players about future content sooner and adjust that content based on player reception.</span></p><p>Image via Blizzard Entertainment/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Enter this year's expansion, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The War Within</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In it, Blizzard introduced a new idea for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is the idea of a story arc that will play out over multiple annual releases. The first one is called "The Worldsoul Saga," and its announcement came with the names of the next two expansions: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Midnight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last Titan</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Our goal was to make sure that players always felt like there was something right around the corner," said Bybee. Creating expansions that end with a metaphorical "next time on World of Warcraft..." definitely tees up the game's future direction more than the climactic finales of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadowlands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Legion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/with-disney-tron-catalyst-bithell-games-gets-to-make-a-game-about-games" target="_self">With Disney TRON: Catalyst, Bithell Games gets to make a game about games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But altering the structure of expansions wasn't Blizzard's only pivot point. Velev explained that beginning with a revamp of the talent system in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragonflight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the studio began designing new "evergreen" features to be introduced in expansions that could be kept fresh with the help of the live service team. Another example would be the "Delves" of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The War Within</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—dungeons that can be run quickly on a daily basis solo or with up to four friends.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a shift from the strategy found in previous expansions, whose big showcase centerpieces would be large raids meant to be run repeatedly by large groups of players. These expansions catered to players who wanted to run said encounters again and again—but Blizzard started getting the message this wasn't appealing to all of its subscribers. Raids are still a high priority for Blizzard, but players will now have endgame options that don't demand they and their friends all be available at the exact same time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cairn-s-manual-climbing-system-is-like-a-vertical-death-stranding-" target="_self">Cairn's manual climbing system is like a 'vertical Death Stranding'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Delves also allow casual players to see story narrative cinematics that used only appear after completing high-difficulty dungeons—a boon for the broader </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> playerbase.

For now, it's just about focusing on "the community [they] have" and all the guilds, friend groups, high school pals, and families still playing together as the game enters its second decade.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p>"In this heartfelt novella-like story of romance, newfound friend Fuddler needs a helping hand to express his feelings, and players join Snufkin and his best friend, Moomintroll, on a camping trip deep into the wilds before winter sets in," Raw Fury explains. "What should have been a relaxing excursion for two, turns into a chaotic and romantic journey, with many new and old friends."</p><p>As yet, there's no firm date on when we can expect Snufkin: Melody of the Moominvalley to hit these consoles (it's already out on Switch and Steam), but Raw Fury said it'll let people know "soon". Don't forget that standard physical editions are also now available, with a deluxe edition launching on 20th December.</p>
<p>"You can't throw a rock in Brighton without hitting a moomin. There are boutiques and galleries devoted to them," Chris Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley-review">Eurogamer's Snufkin: Melody of the Moominvalley review</a>, in which he awarded the "lovely" game four stars out of five.</p>
<p>"They're on our teacups and our beach towels. They're on plant pots by our windows and on the rough-papered covers of fancy Tove Jansson reprints stocking our libraries. It's not surprising that they've made it to video games, but it is surprising - to a moomin outsider, at least - to discover that the sort of thing that middle-class Southern idiots like me lap up so readily has a little bite to it. Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, a musical stealthy exploration game, is the best kind of surprise."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
