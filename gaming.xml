            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Playground Games and Microsoft have announced that&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will be delisted from digital storefronts later this year, prompting a massive player surge for the game on PC.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>website, Playground says that "due to licensing and agreements with our partners",&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will be taken off digital stores on December 15th, which means you won't be able to buy it digitally anymore.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Playground have confirmed that this delisting doesn't mean you can't play the game if you've already bought it; you'll still be able to download and play&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>if you own it digitally, and you'll be able to access its online features as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-race.jpg?itok=UP3e-UGt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-race.jpg?itok=6AffHvW0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will no longer be available to buy digitally later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As of yesterday, you can no longer buy&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>DLC from the store either. You can still buy the Standard, Deluxe, or Ultimate editions of the game until December 14th, however.</p>
<p>Things get a little strange when it comes to Game Pass. Bear with me here, because there are a lot of stipulations.</p>
<p>If you have an "active, full-paid" Game Pass subscription as of June 25th, and you've played&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>through that sub and also&nbsp;bought<em>&nbsp;</em>DLC for it, you should be eligible to get a copy of the game via your Xbox messages.</p>
<p>Sadly, if you've got a discounted Game Pass subscription, you won't be eligible for a code. If you do get one, make sure you use it before June 2026, as codes will start to expire from the 25th of that month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-english-road.jpg?itok=lL8T9XdP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-english-road.jpg?itok=0vQ4Xuif 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The idyllic British roads of&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will soon be closed off.</figcaption></figure><p>This news has prompted a huge player surge for&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>on Steam, with the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1293830/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">player count</a> at 47,741 and climbing at time of writing. Given that the game was peaking at around 7,500 players per day before the announcement, that's no mean feat.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>is currently available at a massive 80% discount on Steam is likely to be a contributing factor as well. Microsoft and Playground say more sales like this are in the offing, too, so watch out for those.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/forza-horizon-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

<p id="xP2s55">What would you do if you were told, with absolute certainty, that you were going to hell, and there was nothing you could do to stop it? Moreover, what would you do if <em>everyone</em> around knew this, and a bunch of big burly smoke demons were going to beat you to death before burning your corpse? Well, that’s the situation the characters in <em>Hellbound</em> find themselves in.</p>
<p id="xKbiop">Adapted from his horror-thriller webtoon, <em>Train to Busan</em> director Yeon Sang-ho’s series takes place in a modern-day South Korea that has been plunged into hysteria following a wave of mysterious murders perpetrated by supernatural beings thought to be “angels.” Believing that their victims have been condemned to hell, society has dissolved into a religious panic, with an insidious cult organization known as the New Truth Society holding sway over all forms of government and culture. </p>
<p id="UpdVd8">The series escalates from a dark fantasy police procedural about an investigator attempting to apprehend the extremist founder of the nascent New Truth Society into a nail-biting thriller about a father and mother attempting to protect their child from the machinations of the cult. <em>Hellbound</em> is a brilliantly constructed drama about the ways humans are susceptible to fanaticism and superstition, and how deliberate cooperation and compassion can stem the tide of our darkest impulses. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="QuxLcX">Bad things are coming to 1929 Berlin. <em>We</em> know this, of course — with the vantage point of history, the Weimar Republic era was marked by economic insecurity and the beginning of the Nazi Party. But the ’20s in the world of <em>Babylon Berlin</em> exist just before that horror, when the degeneracy from all that economic downturn could give way to roaring ’20s clubs just as easily as unending darkness.</p>
<p id="GTgIBz">That tension is captured in <em>Babylon Berlin</em> by two protagonists: Gereon Rath (a soft and strong Volker Bruch), a vice inspector on a secret mission to take down an extortion ring, and Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries, all vinegar and chutzpah), the new police clerk who moonlights as a sex worker. Together they provide two very distinct vantage points on the Weimar Republic’s waning days, exposing the rot of what’s to come at the same time they find hope in what could’ve been. </p>
<p id="4lnlgZ"><em>Babylon Berlin</em>’s trick is by not getting ahead of itself. The show is perhaps one of the slower boils on this list; the thrills of the mystery, such as they are, come from meticulous pacing. Answers don’t come easy, and a whole country’s politics don’t change overnight. <em>Babylon Berlin </em>is a web of history and conspiracy, and by taking those elements equally seriously and methodically, you get a twisty, hardboiled detective story for the ages. —<em>Zosha Millman</em></p>

<p id="VAu3QC">Solving a murder is hard enough, but how do you go about apprehending a culprit whose crime literally transcends space and time?</p>
<p id="oyeN3n"><em>Bodies</em> is a terrific cerebral whodunit with an excellent ensemble cast whose stories weave into one another effortlessly as the series builds and the mystery deepens. Created by Paul Tomalin (<em>Torchwood</em>) and based on Si Spencer’s 2014 comic, this sci-fi crime thriller follows four detectives living in different time periods of London who find themselves investigating a strange murder. What’s so strange about it? Well, the victim’s body appears — and reappears — in each time period in the exact same location. What’s even stranger is that the victim was last seen alive in 2053, despite being seen dead both in that year <em>and</em> as early as 1890.</p>
<p id="saPrdS">A engrossing drama that feels like a mashup between <em>Class of ’09</em>, <em>Dark</em>, and Alex Garland’s <em>Devs</em>, <em>Bodies</em> is one of Netflix’s most compelling releases this year and wholly deserves to be added to your watchlist. —<em>TE</em></p>

<p id="y5amzx">One of Netflix’s biggest hits from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24002689/best-netflix-original-movies-tv-shows-series-2023">its 2023 slate of shows</a> added a different (but well-trodden) sort of thriller to this list — the political thriller — following in the footsteps of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/30/16575426/house-of-cards-ending">streaming platform’s first-ever hit original show</a>.</p>
<p id="YLDwjU">A throwback to the kind of plot-heavy political thriller that used to run television (and the screwball comedies of days gone by), <em>The Diplomat</em> is a delightful star vehicle for Keri Russell. She is Kate Wyler, a whip-smart career diplomat whose plans are thrown into disarray when her upcoming assignment in Afghanistan is changed to what seems to be a cushy post as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. For Kate, who loves her work and is very good at it, this is a clear downgrade, but the more power-focused people in her life (including her conniving husband Hal, played by Rufus Sewell) are delighted by the new role. What follows is a whirlwind of intrigue and mystery, with snappy dialogue, strong chemistry between the leads, and plenty of twists and turns.</p>
<p id="MrLAyQ">After courting many viewers for its first season, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23706819/diplomat-netflix-season-2-news-cast-release-date-renewal-keri-russell"><em>The Diplomat </em>will return for a second</a>. We can’t wait, especially after the first season’s cliffhanger ending. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="fE6b8f">French action cinema is having a bit of a renaissance, and one of the leading figures is director Julien Leclercq. He made the very good Olga Kurylenko thriller <em>Sentinelle</em>, the Jean-Claude Van Damme-led <em>The Bouncer</em>, and my favorite movie of his, the tense crime thriller <em>Braqueurs </em>(also known as <em>The Crew</em>).</p>
<p id="vpdsQy">Six years later, Leclercq took his talents to television with the Netflix series <em>Ganglands </em>(also known as <em>Braqueurs</em>). It shares the same name, lead (the excellent Sami Bouajila), and general vibe, but is not technically a sequel or a remake. In <em>Ganglands</em>, a crew of expert armed robbers are drawn into a gang war: They’re so dang good at crimes, everyone wants to hire them, even the people they rob.</p>
<p id="luNyjZ">Leclercq and writer Hamid Hlioua have created a muscular little thriller anchored by strong leading performances and the director’s tension-filled style of building action and conflict. The second season was recently released on Netflix, and both seasons are very much worth your time. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="297QMk">The thrill of the heist — there’s just nothing like it. Ask Assane Diop (Omar Sy). He’s been working as a con artist and thief for years, drawing his inspiration (and moniker) from an obsession with the literary gentleman thief Arsène Lupin. His thrills are hard-won, but they’re also smoothly meticulous. For Assane, the art of the heist — even with a priceless diamond necklace worn by Marie Antoinette — is a given. </p>
<p id="4O5mtC">What comes less naturally is revenge. <em>Lupin</em>’s first season follows his quest to seek vengeance on the rich family that wronged his father, and the show is full of twists and turns as his mission starts to bleed from his gentleman thief persona back into his real life. </p>
<p id="cCOyCq">The French series was a breakout hit when it premiered on Netflix, thanks in large part to Sy’s performance. He is magnetic as he makes con artistry look easy, with the sort of natural charm that makes you believe he can fake his way into any vault or safe in France (and that’s all before we get into his thieving skills and connections). With a heist, the end is, typically, self-assured. Sy’s performance ensures <em>Lupin</em> has the same confidence, and makes every step of the ride along the way its own thrill. —<em>ZM</em></p>

<p id="IG0rL5">David Fincher’s exacting vision is applied to the television format in one of the best shows Netflix has ever produced. Over two seasons, odd-couple FBI agents Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff) and Bill Tench (the terrific Holt McCallany) interview serial killers in the burgeoning field of criminal psychology. </p>
<p id="13Tf2y">In a nice twist on conventional character tropes, it is the young agent who is often cold and emotionally removed, and the older one who worries about the consequences of their actions. Their chemistry, as well as <em>Mindhunter</em>’s deep study of our culture around serial killers and the approach to stopping them, makes the show excellent, and it never veers into the exploitation of its peers in the genre.</p>
<p id="kSo1mJ">How exacting is Fincher’s vision? Take a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di4Byf1EzRE">mind-blowing VFX reel</a> from the show, which literally changed how I watch modern cinema. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="tbEPzX">If you’re a fan of the 1960s crime drama series <em>The Fugitive</em>, you’ll likely love the 2004 anime adaptation of Naoki Urasawa’s psychological thriller manga. After all, the series was inspired by it! Set in Germany before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall, <em>Monster</em> centers on the story of Kenzo Tenma, a Japanese brain surgeon living in Düsseldorf. After being implicated in the murders of his superiors, Kenzo must go on the run to clear his name by tracking down the real culprit: a young man he once treated. </p>
<p id="y4D2Ys">Spanning 74 episodes, <em>Monster</em> is a labyrinthine drama filled with a rich cast of characters and enough harrowing twists and revelations to fill a Matryoshka doll.<em> —TE</em></p>

<p id="voPyds">Sometimes, you want a “light brain” thriller — something not too deep that might be perfect for a bucket of popcorn or for background viewing while you fold some laundry. <em>The Night Agent </em>is Netflix’s quintessential plot-heavy popcorn thriller, elevated to solid fare thanks to the surprising chemistry between its two leads.</p>
<p id="VWXo0y">Adapted by <em>The Shield </em>creator Shawn Ryan from the novel, <em>The Night Agent </em>stars Gabriel Basso as an FBI agent who has been relegated to watching a phone that never rings in the basement in the White House. When that phone does ring one night, he and the person on the other end (Luciane Buchanan) are brought into a vast conspiracy that threatens to unravel everything he knows. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="MK8PxH">No one is doing it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/22760188/netflixs-you-season-3-narrator">like Joe Goldberg</a> (Penn Badgley). The man is in a league of his own when it comes to stalking women and obsessing over them. This is the double-edged sword of watching <em>You</em> and following Joe in his unethical exploits: He is outright the villain of his own story. </p>
<p id="juyg80">Luckily, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23591818/you-season-4-part-1-netflix-review"><em>You</em> is very aware</a> of this, taking the initial premise of the first season — boy meets girl, boy stalks girl, boy manipulates her whole life to a dangerous degree — and continues flipping it over, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23601157/netflix-you-season-4-part-1-2-penn-badgley">putting Joe through his paces</a>, letting him scramble to cover his ass as he gets in deeper and deeper. Each <em>You</em> season is a flavor unto itself, switching locales and ladies and letting Joe make the worst kind of case for himself. </p>
<p id="you1MP"><em>You</em> is not a show for the faint of heart, but it’s also not a thriller that rests easily on its underlying darkness. Joe may be an absolute piece of shit (<a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/12/27/you-season-2-finale-penn-badgley/#:~:text=He%E2%80%99s%20a%20murderer!%20He%E2%80%99s%20a%20sociopath.%20He%E2%80%99s%20abusive.%20He%E2%80%99s%20delusional.%20And%20he%E2%80%99s%20self%2Dobsessed.">even Badgley thinks so</a>, and would <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3bvqx/penn-badgley-says-the-psychopath-he-plays-in-you-potentially-exists-in-all-of-us">really like it if you did too</a>), but the show knows how to keep him engaging as it turns the screws on him. Each of the four seasons challenges him in new ways, and it makes for a snaky and startlingly good time. With <em>You</em> there’s only one thing you can always expect: for Joe to go to extreme and violent lengths to prove he’s not the bad guy. Also a plexiglass vault. —<em>ZM </em></p>

So ensuring you have the right mods could make all the difference between earning a victory royale and getting sent back to the lobby. This guide will detail everything you need to know about equipping the best mods on your car to help you win your next game.</p><h2 id="h108914"><a id=""></a>What <em>Fortnite</em> cars can I mod?</h2><p>Currently, there are only two different cars you can modify. The first is the Sports Car, which only seats two people, so if you’re playing with a third or fourth, this may not be the ideal car for you. The other car you can mod is the SUV. Unlike the Sports Car, it can seat up to four people and has more health. But it isn’t as fast as the Sports Car, and can be a bit more unwieldy to handle.<br></p><h2 id="h108915"><a id=""></a>Best car mods to use in <em>Fortnite </em>Chapter 5, Season 3</h2><p>The first thing you’ll want to be on the lookout for is Bulletproof Tires. These are vital to have because with all the gunshots flying around, a handful of them are bound to hit your tires, and this is the only way to ensure they don’t pop mid-fight and make it nearly impossible to control your vehicle.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-recommend-id="image://dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2290" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A car in Fortnite sporting bulletproof tires." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A car in Fortnite sporting bulletproof tires." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-recommend-id="image://dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2290" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A car in Fortnite sporting bulletproof tires." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now that you have the Bulletproof Tires on, you’ll then want to be on the lookout for the Spiked Bumper. This is especially important because if you run over a player or crash into their car with this, it’ll inflict even more damage than it usually would.<br></p><p>Last, you’ll want to equip the Machine Gun Turret. This immediately damages cars or players the second it hits its target, unlike the Grenade Launcher Turret, which takes a few seconds to explode after shooting. What also makes the Machine Gun Turret great is that you shoot directly at other drivers or passengers in enemy cars, which could potentially down them mid-fight, rather than having to arc your shot to factor in the grenades’ trajectory.</p><h2 id="h108916"><a id=""></a><em>Fortnite </em>car tips</h2><p>It’s important to ensure your car is properly equipped during any game. But it’s also important to carry at least one repair torch in your inventory whenever you get behind the wheel. A fully charged-up Repair Torch can repair your car at least twice before it’s drained.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="152b10cbfbd959daa90bc5f2438ada5b" data-recommend-id="image://152b10cbfbd959daa90bc5f2438ada5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2298" data-height="1284" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Fortnite car sporting a spiked bumper.

This will ensure it won’t explode when you find yourself in the endgame.<br></p><p>If you’re playing with more than two people, a great strategy is to have whoever’s not on the turret be on repair duties. That way you won’t have to worry about having your car explode mid-fight, and the two players up front can focus on downing enemies.</p><hr><p>That’s really all you need to know about <em>Fortnite</em>’s cars and how to make the most of them!

                <p>The last couple of years have seen several remakes of Resident Evil games, but for anyone looking to experience the franchise in its original low-polygon glory, the classic games are making a comeback as part of a joint effort between Capcom and GOG. Now accessible through GOG, the first Resident Evil is available to purchase and will be followed by Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis soon.</p><p>Like other GOG releases, these are all DRM-free versions of the survival-horror games, and they've been upgraded with quality-of-life improvements and enhanced compatibility for modern PCs. GOG says this version of Resident Evil is the uncut edition and contains even more blood, graphic violence, and gory scenes than the PlayStation original.</p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fresident_evil&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fclassic-resident-evil-games-are-back-from-the-dead-on-pc%2F1100-6524515%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil</a> -- $10</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fresident_evil_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fclassic-resident-evil-games-are-back-from-the-dead-on-pc%2F1100-6524515%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 2</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fresident_evil_3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fclassic-resident-evil-games-are-back-from-the-dead-on-pc%2F1100-6524515%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></li></ul><p>Speaking to <a href="https://youtu.be/o38wFuD3Wag" rel="nofollow ">Suzi "SphereHunter" Hunterr</a>, GOG detailed some of the challenges in resurrecting the classic Resident Evil games. Technical issues and bugs had to be addressed so that Capcom's high standards could be met, and by the time the QA process had been completed, GOG had submitted dozens of builds for approval. Some of the enhancements for the games include improved DirectX rendering, new rendering options, and full support for modern controllers.</p><p>Other changes are focused on improved timing in cutscenes, better save-game managers, and the option to switch between different localizations of the games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-resident-evil-pc-re-release-spotted-could-be-out-very-soon/1100-6524343/" data-ref-id="1100-6524343">Reports of a Resident Evil re-release</a> picked up steam last week when an age rating for the game was spotted online, making this GOG version the first time Resident Evil has been available on PC digitally.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-are-the-next-remakes-for-the-franchise-report/1100-6523753/" data-ref-id="1100-6523753">Resident Evil Zero is reportedly one of two more remakes</a> in development, and rumors about the still-unannounced Resident Evil 9 claim that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-could-be-an-open-world-game-report/1100-6522123/" data-ref-id="1100-6522123">could be an open-world game</a>.</p>

                <p>Joe Tung, a video game industry veteran who formerly worked on the Halo and Destiny franchises, has commented on the state of video games and specifically the live-service approach. Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/former-halo-and-destiny-producer-says-live-service-model-is-much-better-for-developers-and-players-than-the-dollar60-boxed-product-model/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Tung said he believes live-service is "so much better" for both players and developers than the more-traditional-boxed product model.</p><p>Tung, who also worked at Riot Games on League of Legends and is now CEO of Supervive studio Theorycraft Games, said, "I always felt like in the $60 boxed product model that I was having to make decisions that were not in the best interest of players."</p>

<p>Instead, he said he felt that model was meant primarily to help sell as many copies as possible in the first two days. For live-service games, Tung said a strength of this model is that developers that think long-term. "You can think long-term in terms of what is best for the player, and how does that overlap with what is best for the company? I think it allows you to make much, much, much better decisions overall."</p><p>Asked about decisions made that are not necessarily in the best interests of players, Tung said back in the E3 days, some of the demos shown during press conferences may not have been representative of a final product. "It's like, let's jam as much bullshit vaporware into the build as we can in the next three months because we have to have a huge showing at E3 because it's our one opportunity to talk to our audience before we launch the game," he said.</p><p>Supervive aims to be a title that players can enjoy for 10,000 hours over the course of multiple years, Tung said. The game, which was formerly known as Project Loki, blends elements of the hero shooter, action game, and battle royale genres. Alpha testing on PC is happening now, with an open beta to follow this fall.</p>

If its first trailer,&nbsp; which was revealed by <em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cattle-country-aims-to-mix-stardew-valley-with-a-dash-of-red-dead-redemption">IGN</a> </em>today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2818150/Cattle_Country/?curator_clanid=40214109">Steam listing</a> simply says the release date is "to be announced."&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."</p>

<p><strong>Here are some Cattle Country screenshots:&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steamworld-heist-ii-preview-time-to-plunder.911748/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/steamworld-heist-ii-preview-time-to-plunder<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>SteamWorld</em> is host to a myriad of titles spanning across multiple genres. You have the base-building sim <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/steamworld-build"><em>SteamWorld Build</em></a>, or even the turn-based RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/steamworld-quest"><em>SteamWorld Quest</em></a>. As a tactics fan, my personal favorite of the ever-expanding series is <em>SteamWorld</em> <em>Heist</em>, and to see that it's getting an upcoming sequel? I'm all in.</p>
<p>We got a chance to check out <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>during Summer Game Fest, as well as some extra hands-on time after the show. The early portion of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> should serve as a great sequel for fans of the first game, but also a fantastic starting point for anyone that likes tactics or pirates.</p>

<h2>A Pirates Life for <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em></h2>
<p><em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> trades the science fiction, space pirate theme from the first game in for a high seas adventure. Rather than boarding space vessels and seizing loot, you have your very own submarine, the method by which you'll attack ships, plunder booty, and infiltrate strongholds and pirate dens.</p>
<p>The setting is a somewhat jarring departure from the first game, though the core gameplay loop should still be familiar for fans of the first game. <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> is a tactical strategy game at its core, and maneuvering units and planning ahead is all part of the fun.</p>
<p>Missions usually task players with achieving a certain objective, like seizing all the loot at an outpost. To do so, you'll add members of your crew to missions and go forth. In <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, units have their own class, weapon types, and more. Those can later be mixed and matched to make optimal builds, so there's already some depth to the mechanics outside of combat.</p>

<p>One of the ways in which this particular series has set itself apart is with the aiming system -- you're primarily using weapons to dispatch naval robots. The bullet ricochet system is back again, so you can defy physics by having bullets bounce in wild ways to hit enemies that <em>might</em> appear out of reach, but in fact are vulnerable to your guns.</p>
<p>It's been nearly 8 years since I played the original, but combat feels relatively unchanged. That's a good thing, since the core gameplay was very addicting and simple to get the hang of. Of course, pulling off insane shots with the ricochets never grew dull, and you'll find that's the case in <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>as well.</p>

<h2>Pilot Your Own Ship</h2>
<p>Outside of combat, the most immediate difference between this and the original is the submarine. Players commandeer their own ship and use it to explore a rather vast open world. The world, comprising mostly water and islands scattered throughout, are infested with outposts and enemy vessels you can loot.</p>
<p>It's a simple vehicle to control, but very addicting to use. The submarine is equipped with various weapons like turrets and torpedoes. These weapons fire automatically in fixed directions, but you need to position your ship often when an armament needs to be reloaded.</p>

<p>You're able to collect any loot from these ships and use it to buy upgrades for a wide variety of things. There's also a system in place where players accrue bounty points based on what they achieve in a day. Those bounties can be exchanged for rewards at the end of the day, so you're constantly getting rewarded.</p>
<p>The whole overworld is seamless, and as I mentioned, the combat retains its old charm. <em>SteamWorld</em>'s been a hallmark for quality indie games for over a decade now, and it's encouraging to see that <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>is upholding that legacy thus far.</p>
<hr><p><strong>Steam<em>World Heist II </em></strong><em>was previewed after about 30 minutes of gameplay at Summer Game Fest, and 4 hours with a key provided by the publisher - all screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

Scadutree Blessings (which affect attack and defense stars) are found at Miquella’s crosses, while Revered Spirit Ash Blessings (which bolster your Spirit summons) are placed on Miquella statues. Both are required to level up these stats at Sites of Grace, and much of the DLC is scaled to Blessings. As such, FromSoftware is bumping up the stat increases for the first half of the maximum amount in order to give players an edge in the opening hours. They will then level out as you go, so if you’re already deep into the DLC, it’s unlikely you’ll notice any tan3gible difference.</p><p>The patch notes also mention a bug on the PC version that automatically enabled raytracing if you load saved data from previous versions of the game from old patches, with instructions on how to fix it in-game.

            <title><![CDATA[AAA Games Are Bombing in iOS Port Sales, Estimates Claim]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ios-games-sales-bombing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aaa-games-are-bombing-in-ios-port-sales-estimates-claim.911742/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ios-games-sales-bombing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When the iPhone 15 (and the higher-tier models) was revealed last year, it was promised that a slew of AAA games would wind up on the super-capable device and the topmost iPad models. To that end, Death Stranding, Resident Evil Village, and – most recently – Assassin’s Creed Mirage all landed on the iOS App Store, but recent estimations have suggested that they’re simply not selling and might not be worth the developers’ investment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-too-niche">Too Niche</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that these AAA games can only be played on the most expensive, high-spec iPhones and iPads on the market, but even so, the estimated sales figures are woeful. In a report published by Appfigures (and <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/those-assassins-creed-resident-evil-and-death-stranding-ports-have-bombed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared by MobileGamer</a>), it was suggested that fewer than 3,000 people have paid to unlock the full version of Assassin’s Creed Mirage since it was released a few weeks ago. </p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage offers users a brief free trial to test out the game on their iPhone or iPad device, but after that, there’s a $49.99 paywall blocking off the rest of the game. That’s where most users are getting to before ultimately giving up, because it has been downloaded approximately 123,000 times, according to Appfigures. That has led Ubisoft to net just $138,000 in revenue, which hardly makes the venture worthwhile.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, it was estimated that while Resident Evil 4 has been downloaded around 350,000 times, only 7,000 consumers have converted to the fully-priced, premium product. The data also shows rapid drop-offs in interest post-launch. </p>



<p>Many have theorised that the leading cause of this lack of interest can be attributed to none of the games being made-for-mobile – and then there’s the fact that they boast premium price tags. In a world dominated by free-to-play games, who wants to pay $49.99 to play a game on a mobile device?</p>

In it, you'll engage in close-quarters combat, explore realistic medieval locations, learn alchemy, and more. Check out the fantastic announcement trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><p>Alkahest is set in the kingdom of Kadanor, where you're the youngest son of a petty lord. The region's balance of power is tenous at best as three houses vie for control. You'll explore castles, villages, forests, and other settings befitting of the medieval fantasy setting.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Alkahest - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Perhaps even more interestingly, Alkahest promises "dynamic combat with a focus on interactive environment." Meaning, you'll build combos with both your attacks and the environment. One example Play On gives: "Drop a tree on [an enemy's] head, kick them off a cliff, set them on fire." That fire part comes from Alkahest's alchemy system, which augments the up-close melee combat in lieu of a magic system. You'll follow recipes or concoct your own throwables, drinkables, weapon oils, and enemy traps. Stealth and brute-force melee combat are both supported and encouraged.</p><p>Alkahest is in development for PC and we'll have more on it as development progresses.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Anyway, once he gets there, a big twist in the event is that he competes in the then-unreleased Super Mario Bros. 3. And boy oh boy did that product placement work to perfection – I <em>had </em>to have Super Mario Bros. 3 the moment it came out after that, and God bless my mom, she bought it for me. Her taking it out of that white plastic K-Mart grocery bag and just handing it to me – it wasn’t even my birthday or anything! – is a core memory for me.</p><p>That is what I think of when I think about the Nintendo World Championships, but for others, the real-life competition was far more about just that: a real-life competition. Now, Nintendo is putting a creative twist on the nostalgia for its own history in a way that only they seem to be really good at: by turning into a local and online multiplayer game for the Nintendo Switch that’s played in increments ranging from under two seconds (this is not a joke) to about a minute at most. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition - June 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition includes 13 games: Super Mario Bros. 1-3, Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels, Zelda 1 and 2, Metroid, Kid Icarus, Donkey Kong, Ballon Fight, Excitebike, Ice Climber, and Kirby’s Adventure. I ended up dabbling in each of them during a 90-minute hands-on session across both solo modes and the local Party Mode. I certainly knew what I was walking into – a collection of classic NES games from my childhood turned into competitive challenges – but I didn’t expect the format to be so much <em>fun</em>.</p><p>Of these games, Kirby’s Adventure was the only one I’d flat-out never played as a kid, and sure enough it was the Kirby challenges that tripped me up the most. But outside of that, I had an absolute blast trying to earn S rankings on the myriad challenges on offer for each game. They get progressively more difficult as you go, naturally, and you have to unlock the tougher ones with coins you earn by getting good rankings on the challenges you do have access to. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As an example, the first challenge from The Legend of Zelda is so simple it probably sounds stupid: you start from the beginning of the game and have to walk into the cave that’s on the very first screen and acquire the sword. And yet, I found myself replaying it multiple times to try and shave tenths of a second off of my time and get that pride-inflating S ranking. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The first challenge from The Legend of Zelda is so simple it probably sounds stupid. And yet, I found myself replaying it multiple times to try and shave tenths of a second off of my time and get that pride-inflating S ranking.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Party Mode is where it really got fun, though. IGN’s Rebekah Valentine and I competed in a series of challenges in Party Mode against Nintendo reps. We sped through World 1-1 of Super Mario Bros. 3. We got the first energy ball in Metroid. We climbed to the top of the first stage in Donkey Kong, we took a lap around the track in Excitebike, and more. Is it the perfect re-creation of an in-person competition with hundreds if not thousands of people cheering you on? Certainly not. But it is a delightfully simple party game that truly anyone can pick up and play. Will it help if you already have a nostalgic connection to these games? No doubt. But is that experience required? Absolutely not; in 2024, any of these 1980’s classics can be picked up and played by anyone pretty easily, as there are only two buttons to worry about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Although speaking of buttons, my one genuine complaint about Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition involves them. See, when four of you are competing, all four of you have to press the A button to ready up before an event starts. The problem is, <em>so many </em>of the games use the B button as a turbo or run button that you naturally want to be holding it as soon as the countdown timer hits zero. But if any one of the four of you hasn’t readied up yet and anyone else starts laying on the B button in anticipation of the start of the event, it backs everyone out to the previous menu. This happened over and over during my 90-minute hands-on session, and I wasn’t the only one accidentally doing this. It seems like a UI design flaw that there must be a solution for.</p><p>I have one other nitpick, though this one is far less serious: the slowdown in Kirby’s Adventure (and perhaps in parts of other games that I didn’t see enough of to rule out). The versions of the 13 games included here are the original iterations, but during a couple of the Kirby challenges, the slowdown kicked in and felt disruptive to the action – as framerate hitches do in any game, modern or classic. I can see the argument for preserving each of the games as-is, but for the sake of the competition that’s at the heart of the gameplay in Nintendo World Championships, I’d prefer that it have been smoothed out. You may disagree, and that’s OK!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, I didn’t play the Online World Championships mode since, of course, the game isn’t out yet and there’s no one online to play with. But expect weekly rankings there, with the ability to watch the replays of the top players – a handy tool for improving your own skills and strategies. </p><p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition feels priced right to be at $30 for the digital version, and again I was surprised at how engaged I was with the seemingly simple challenges it puts forth (at least in the early rounds). I hope this does well, because the name of this implies that we might get a SNES Edition, Nintendo 64 Edition, and dare I say even a GameCube Edition if this one is a hit. </p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

<p>The studio estimates that the new update, catchily named 1.2.0.25, is around 30% bigger than its 1.1 patch, and it brings big balance updates, improvements to locations and the UI, and much, much more.</p>
<p>There's arguably no one big centerpiece for this update; rather, it revolves around a litany of smaller tweaks and improvements that should all add up to create a patchwork that significantly boosts your&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>play experience.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a bevy of quality-of-life changes like quests appearing on star systems, improved tooltips, and a better level-up screen, as well as an improved combat log.</p>
<p>The update adds "various improvements for locations across the game", too, including improved NPC variety and better pathing, and several companions have had new dialogue introduced so you can get to know them better.</p>
<p>Rumor zones are now highlighted on&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader</em>'s map, and co-operative play has been improved too, so if you're investigating those rumors alongside a friend, your experience should be a lot smoother.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>is a turn-based CRPG set in the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe. Developed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-reveals-new-rpg-in-rogue-trader">by&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&nbsp;</em>studio Owlcat</a>, the game casts you as one of the titular rogue traders as you explore the barely-charted Koronus Expanse in search of new opportunities.</p>
<p>Like other CRPGs,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>features a number of companions you can get to know, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-introduces-its-companions-their-romantic-preferences-with">some of whom you can even romance</a>, but if love in the&nbsp;<em>40k&nbsp;</em>universe gives you the ick, don't worry; there's plenty of turn-based combat and exploration to go around as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-new-patent-reveals-a-controller-concept-with-conductive-ink/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>PlayStation has filed for a new patent for a new controller concept. The standout feature of this controller is its use of electric ink, allowing players to craft a custom layout that suits their unique play style. This patent could revolutionize the way we interact with games. Dive into the details of PlayStation’s patent for a “user customized flat computer simulation controller field below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://exputer.com/news/playstation/sony-controller-customize-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Exputer</a>, PlayStation’s latest patent talks about a controller that gives players a new level of freedom towards customization. This concept will work on a flat surface, and the user will have to personally draw the layout for the computer simulation buttons that fit their needs perfectly. Players would need a regular first, however, to link the hand-drawn controls to the actual buttons on the standard controller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, there will be an “anti-fatigue” key, a feature designed to enhance button functionality. In some instances, players will press buttons a single time, repeatedly, or keep them pressed. This anti-fatigue key will ensure that players can enjoy a higher level of customization for their button presses, providing a smoother and more enjoyable gaming experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PlayStation’s newest controller patent can be seen as a highly advanced version of the accessibility controller. This new concept provides players with an even higher range of options, particularly in terms of customization. The patent aims to create a personalized layout that best suits their needs by allowing players to draw custom buttons. </p>



<p>However, it’s important to note that this technology is currently just a patent, and its future is uncertain. Nevertheless, the research and development of this technology could potentially open up more options for future accessibility controllers, further enhancing the gaming experience for all players.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The highly anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for FromSoftware’s critically acclaimed open-world action RPG has finally arrived. As players embark on their new journey into the Realm of Shadows, they’ve encountered some challenges. </p>



<p>The battles, in particular, have proven to be more demanding than expected, leading to some player frustration. However, the developers have just released a Shadow of the Erdtree balancing patch in response to player feedback, a move that should reassure players that their concerns are being heard and addressed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Elden Ring <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Calibration Updat</a>e 1.12.2 is now live, bringing balancing changes and adjustments to PC graphics settings. Regarding balancing, the devs have revised the attack and damage negation curve scaling of the Scadutree Blessing. Now, the attack and damage negation will be “increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements”, and the second half has been made more gradual. Moreover, there is also a slight increase towards “attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements“.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers noticed a bug in the graphics settings. The ray tracing settings were automatically enabled due to previously loaded save data, which caused unexpected changes in the game’s visual quality and performance. </p>



<p>Players can now check the Ray Tracing Quality settings through the Settings and Graphics Settings options in the title or in-game menu. From this menu, players can set Automatic Ray Tracing Off or On. Lastly, FromSoftware will introduce more balancing updates and bug fixes through upcoming patches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It looks like the release date of The Casting of Frank Stone has possibly been leaked online. According to a post on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksDBD/comments/1doae9w/the_casting_of_frank_stone_release_date_ingame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaksDBD</a> subreddit, the game is currently scheduled to release on Tuesday, September 3.  </p>



<p>In addition to the game’s release date, there will also be an in-game promotion within Dead by Daylight to hype up it’s release. The leaked release date also featured a QR code that takes you to a “Buy Now” page for the game that currently is offline.</p>



<p>“Step out of The Fog and experience a never-before-seen side of Dead by Daylight with The Casting of Frank Stone, available September 3,” the promotional message reads in the leak. “Decide the fate of four friends in the summer of 1980, and guide their shoot of Murder Mill, a soon-to-be cult classic with an insidious influence.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Behaviour Interactive and Supermassive Games regarding the validity of the leaked release date. Should a response be received, this article will be updated accordingly.</p>

                <p>Payday 3 has had a rough launch, with its online-only gameplay coming under fire when the game's servers went offline multiple times in its first week of release. Developer Starbreeze said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-dev-apologizes-profusely-for-poor-launch-discusses-potential-offline-mode/1100-6517973/" data-ref-id="1100-6517973">might add an offline mode</a> further down the track, and this week the first iteration of that mode is coming to the game--though it will still require an internet connection for now.</p><p>The new Solo Mode (<a href="https://www.vg247.com/payday-3-offline-solo-mode-beta-boys-in-blue-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VG247</a>) is launching in beta in Payday 3's next major patch, which arrives on June 27. While players will be able to play most of it offline, they will still need an internet connection to load into Solo Mode, and to upload their progress at the end of a session. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r26hIijRoRo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dev update video</a>, Starbreeze head of community Almir Listo also warned that players will see a drop in performance "since the parts normally front loaded by our servers will now have to be run on your own hardware."</p><p>The developers are aware that it's far from a perfect solution, and have said that this version of Solo Mode is just the first iteration, with a more polished, fully offline option coming later down the track. "This is a stepping stone for a feature to come, not something we're releasing and calling done," Listo added.</p><p>Because the mode is releasing in beta, Starbreeze are also asking players to report any issues they experience while playing. The studio also has plans to improve the mode in future, hoping to add popular features like hosted co-op in future updates.</p><p>Payday 3 has struggled since it came out, facing server issues and low player numbers, and has even seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-ceo-is-gone-after-games-bad-start-and-low-player-numbers/1100-6521797/" data-ref-id="1100-6521797">Starbreeze's CEO replaced</a> after the messy launch.

The ongoing updates plan to add new features, fix up existing ones, and add more content to the game.</p>

                <p>Elden Ring is a huge hit with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-passes-25-million-players-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree-expansion-launch/1100-6524201/" data-ref-id="1100-6524201">25 million copies sold</a> and fantastic reviews for the base game and its recently released Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Naturally, many are wondering if Bandai Namco might expand the franchise beyond games to other forms of entertainment, like a potential film. From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-pushing-buttons-newsletter-our-free-video-games-email" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a> (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/from-software-says-theres-interest-in-an-elden-ring-adaptation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>) that the studio isn't ruling anything out.</p><p>"I don't see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring, a movie for example," he said. "But I don't think myself, or From Software, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium. So that's where a very strong partner would come into play."</p>

<p>Miyazaki went on to say that From Software would need to "build a lot of trust and agreement" with a potential partner for an Elden Ring movie. "But there's interest, for sure," he said, though he didn't clarify if the interest is from within From Software or if the company has already been approached for a movie deal, or both.</p><p>Back in 2021, Bandai Namco said Elden Ring was already being developed for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-not-just-a-game-bandai-namco-says/1100-6492709/" data-ref-id="1100-6492709">"variety of other areas,"</a> and many took this to mean some kind of film or TV adaptation. Nothing has materialized as of yet, however.</p><p>There are more than 30 video game film projects in various stages of development right now, and you can see a rundown of them in the gallery below.</p><p>Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is out now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-is-a-retro-speedrunning-paradise/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>While online gaming really thrown esports and competitive gaming into the spotlight over the past 15 years, the battle to be the very best gamer in the room goes back much, much further. Ardent gamers have been at it since the “Intergalactic Spacewar Olympics” were held by Stanford University students in 1972, but there’s been the rise and fall of countless gaming competitions in the decades since. While far from being a part of the yearly gaming landscape like Evo or QuakeCon, there’s still a special place in gaming lore for the Nintendo World Championships. And now you can bring that competitive spirit home with Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition – Survival Mode &amp; Legend Challenge – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBhA0XdNb94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s actually a little surprising that there’s only been three Nintendo World Championships, with a 25 year wait from the 1990 inaugural event to the anniversary to its anniversary revival in 2015, and then another entry two years later just as the Nintendo Switch was coming to the fore. It’s similarly surprising that it’s taken Nintendo seven years to decide to release a branded tie-in game, but it’s better late than never, right?</p>


<p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, much like Nintendo World Championships Remix on the Wii U and the original Nintendo World Championships 1990 Game Pak that went before it, is all about taking classic NES games and breaking them down into mini stages and tasks for you to try and speed run your way through. That factor alone adds a huge compulsive urge to play, replay, better yourself and best the other names on leaderboard, or rivals who are closer to home.</p>
<p>It starts with 1-1, and a challenge that’s barely 5 or 6 seconds long (if you’re doing things right), to go left to right, hop over a Goomba, hit the second question block, and grab the mushroom that emerges. Seriously, I could play this time and time and time again trying to master it, and getting an S rank is going to require pixel precise jumping. There’s similarly miniscule, but addictive challenges to get you started in The Legend of Zelda, Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, Metroid, Kirby’s Adventure, Excitebike and all of the 13 games featured here, before building up into longer slices of levels and more varied challenges to test yourself against.</p>


<p>The UI wrapped around this is pretty neat in the Speedrun mode. You always get to see a preview of the task you have before you, to get your eye in, and then you have your current attempt on the left side of the screen and your previous best on the right, and showing your button inputs on screen. Arguably it’s not that important for a six second level, but when you get to a longer challenge, this will let you see how you’re stacking up as you chase down a better time and ranking.</p>
<p>It all builds up to the Legend Challenges, which will really put your skills to the test through minutes, not seconds. These could be clearing the first three Donkey Kong levels, racing through the whole of Super Mario Bros. (using Warp Pipes), or doing the most ridiculous thing imaginable: speedrunning a Kirby level. Legend Challenges come with ‘Classified Information’ pages, styled after classic game guides as they give you a rundown of all the specific tips and tricks that you’ll need to beat the challenge.</p>

<p>Putting a different spin on things are things like Survival Mode, where you face off against ghost data plucked from the internet. It’s a small three round knockout format that drops you in against seven other players and then ditches the bottom half after each level. The three levels are known in advance, with a Silver and Gold ranked competition to enter, but they can appear in a varying order that potentially gives you a better chance of coming out on top. While you have just a single shot for success on each attempt, you can play these over and over, just like pretty much everything else in the game.</p>
<p>And then there’s the Party Mode for local multiplayer with up to eight players, in which you can take on individual levels or curated sequences set to different difficulty levels, with each round awarding points for your finishing position. It’s another fun competitive twist to play side-by-side, especially with some of the game crutches like an automatic rewind meaning that less skilled players can still compete despite the odd mistake. Another nice tweak is that, in addition to the video preview before a challenge, you can also dive into a full practice session to get everyone up to speed.</p>

<p>It’s a bit of a mystery why Nintendo hasn’t made the Nintendo World Championships a more regular event, but it’s neat to see them bringing it back to the living room with Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, filled with around 150 challenges and a bunch of different ways to play them.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naraka-bladepoint-is-getting-witcher-and-tomb-raider-crossovers.911661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-witcher-tomb-raider-crossovers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>24 Entertainment and publisher NetEase have announced that&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>is getting three new high-profile collaborations to celebrate its third anniversary, as well as a new map, a new weapon type, and more.</p>
<p>In an anniversary livestream, it was revealed that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>The Witcher&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>will be joining&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>soon, and the game is also getting a crossover with Chinese novel series&nbsp;<em>Daomu Biji</em>, also known as&nbsp;<em>Time Raider&nbsp;</em>in its movie form.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>collab is coming this summer and will add a new outfit inspired by heroine Lara Croft. First&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover">Dead by Daylight</a>&nbsp;</em>and now this? She really is a true globetrotter. This summer will also see&nbsp;<em>Daomu Biji&nbsp;</em>hero Kylin Zhang joining the cast of&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>as a playable hero.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-naraka-bladepoint.jpg?itok=jspPQ2t1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-naraka-bladepoint.jpg?itok=l8voMeRd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lara Croft will soon join the world of&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The second collaboration is with&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>, whose hero, Geralt, will be appearing in&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>later this year. It's not exactly clear what form the collaboration will take; it could see Geralt join as a hero, or it could simply involve new outfits to collect. We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>That's not all&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>is getting for its birthday, though. A new map, Perdoria, will be introduced "after the July 2nd update", and it will take you into a subterranean city with platform areas designed for combat.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to the Fistblades, a new hand-to-hand combat weapon. It's not quite the "hands" the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2024-gaming-roundup">promised on April Fools' Day</a>, but it's as close as you're going to get.</p>
<p>Tantalizingly, 24 Entertainment also promises an Easter egg to discover in the new Perdoria map, and it's designed to "provide players with a more immersive adventure experience". Exciting! I wonder what it could be?</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>, it's a melee combat-focused battle royale game in which up to 60 players duke it out while playing as a variety of colorful heroes.</p>
<p>Since the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-release-date-announced">launch in 2021</a>, it's been updated with a variety of new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-new-hero-skill-changes">heroes</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-heng-sword-season-11">weapons</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-anniversary-celebrations-adds-new-campaign-mode">game modes</a>, and it's also enjoyed crossovers with the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-wo-long-naraka-crossover">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-nier-crossover"><em>NieR&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>.</p>
<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203220/NARAKA_BLADEPOINT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004405/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/naraka-bladepoint/9p8sqqj5t94b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>PC-playing survival horror fans, I have good news for you. The original version of Resident Evil is now available to purchase via GOG, with "even more blood, graphic violence and gory scenes than the worldwide monster hit version on PlayStation".</p>
<p>This PC release is fully compatible with Windows 10 and Windows 11, and promises new rendering options as well as other Quality of Life improvements, such as improved cutscene timing, an improved game video player and "issue-free" game exit.</p>
<p>At present, Steam only has the HD remake of Resident Evil, rather than this original release.</p>

<p>In addition, GOG's Resident Evil port supports modern controllers.</p>
<p>"Your Special Tactics and Rescue Squad has been choppered to a remote mansion to investigate a biotechnical experiment gone hideously wrong. Before you can say 'mass murder', you're plunged straight into a deathtrap writhing with man-eating freaks, swarming crows and rabid dogs," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>"Arm yourself with knives and flame-throwers scavenged from dead teammates. Solve puzzles, disarm traps and unearth mysteries. But beware: every move you make draws you deeper into the deadly embrace of Resident Evil."</p> <div>

			<p>A good free-to-play action shooter is always on my radar, even if I'm reviewing a dozen other titles at a given time. However, when you're as much of a looker as The First Descendant, then you really have my attention. Showcasing the power of Unreal Engine 5, Nexon Games' upcoming third-person looter shooter has a lot to show for itself in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-qa-on-the-game-ue5-implementation-and-future-dlss-3-support/">The First Descendant</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/First-Descendant-Assault-Rifle-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Rather than starting from scratch and having to sit through tutorial after tutorial, Nexon Games' opened our session with a brief pitch deck on the general systems and overall vibe of The First Descendant before letting us run free in the open environments. With a wide list of characters unlocked to play through, I opted for the Ultimate variant of one of the fourteen available characters: Ultimate Bunny. With a thigh gap that even the Evergreen could pass through and more skin than Metal Gear Solid V's Quiet, I went with the most photogenic character on the roster. The fact that she came with chain lightning abilities and multiple sniper weapons was just the icing on the peach cake.</p>
<p>In talking with one of my colleagues that also demo'd The First Descendant, they didn't quite understand where to go after being set free in the demo. Truth be told, in the span of 30 minutes, I didn't really have the freedom to explore the hub city and get my bearings straight. Instead, I popped out to the minimap, got a good look at the nine available regions, and then jumped straight into some Void Intercept Battles. Here, instead of learning about the game through tutorial after tutorial, I took my level 40 Ultimate Bunny and challenged a level 34 Executioner Colossus. If I had the foresight, I probably would have picked an enemy that didn't have electric attribute resistance, but it was still a good place to grasp the combat.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-FIrst-Descendant-Ultimate-Bunny-Hop.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The First Descendant is a very mobile type of third-person shooter. Staying grounded in one spot and even strafing from side to side won't prevent players from catching a stray bullet to the face. Instead, adding in jumps and a sleek grappling hook helps the player bounce around the battlefield and circle to the backside of an oversized boss and escape attacks coming their way. Having the grappling hook set to the middle mouse button took some getting used to, but with a very short cooldown and a generous range, I could unload a full clip into the boss' weak point, grapple onto a nearby pillar, and hide behind it as cover while I reload. The first Void Intercept battle lasted barely more than a minute even as a first-time player but it certainly helped that I had a sniper rifle that could hit for over 250k damage and killed the boss before I even needed to reload the five-round magazine. All character abilities are cooldown-driven, so there are no extra resources to juggle beyond just having enough bullets on hand. Fodder enemies will occasionally show up in combat, acting as loot pinatas that burst open with recovery items and spare ammo.</p>

<p>Gunplay is quick and snappy in The First Descendant and would be the main draw as a casual non-IAP, or truly free-to-play, player. Nexon granted us level 100 gear that would far exceed what the common player would have access to for hours in the game and the power difference was quite noticeable as the second Void Intercept, a level 54 Devourer, took a bit longer (almost three minutes) to down but without having to break a sweat or even retreat to recover health and shields. That fight took longer simply for the shield mechanics on the boss where I had to seek down these green bubble-covered nodes and destroy them to remove the boss' shielding. I do enjoy when bosses implement new mechanics beyond simply being a bullet sponge and at least this was a challenge to break away from the DPS phase and do something different in the fight. My third Void Intercept was against a level 118 Swamp Walker which kept summoning a bunch of adds and despite my best attempts, couldn't even break its shielding before the 10-minute quest timer elapsed.</p>
<p>For the second portion of my gameplay session, I picked one of the playable regions at random and delved into the arctic region, thinking it to be a good change of pace from the boss arenas although my bunny girl was quite underdressed for the occasion. I had just enough time to eke out a zone recon mission and jump into a few shootouts for loot and glory before my session came to an end. One thing that I'll have to give Nexon praise for is continuing the trend of implementing Korean vocal tracks into your open world exploration. It's a thing I thoroughly enjoyed in Stellar Blade, and I earnestly want the trend to continue.</p>
<p>The First Descendant has had its share of beta test phases and hands-on opportunities but this was one of the last events that Nexon will be showing off the title ahead of its launch next month. Officially launching on July 2nd, 2024, The First Descendant will be available across PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074920/The_First_Descendant/">PC (Steam)</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-descendant-preview-nexons-answer-to-destiny.911649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/first-descendant-preview-nexons-answer-to-destiny<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm always on the search for the next "podcast game," as I like to call them. You know the type of game you can just have going on one screen, with videos, music, or podcasts rolling in the background? It might be terrible for the attention span, but <em>The First Descendant</em> fits that criteria to a tee.</p>
<p>Developed in-house by <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nexon">Nexon</a> is the soon-to-launch <em>The First Descendant</em>, which we saw a fancy new trailer for at Summer Game Fest. I also had the chance to test it out in LA a few short weeks ago, and further access to a pre-launch build was also granted to me. Needless to say, I've already put several hours into <em>The First Descendant</em>, and I might just be hooked.</p>

<h2>Becoming a Descendant</h2>
<p><em>The First Descendant</em> is a massive game, and Nexon is going all gas, no breaks to make it their next hit. Using Unreal Engine 5 to power this beast, <em>The First Descendant</em> boasts top-of-the-line visuals and the polish. It's a looter shooter that has to contend with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/destiny-2-final-shape-end-to-light-and-darkness"><em>Destiny</em> <em>2</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tom-clancys-division-2"><em>The Division 2</em></a>, so those are big shoes to fill.</p>
<p>During my play session at Summer Game Fest, I had unrestricted access to pretty much every item, character, and upgrade in the game; likewise, I was able to test this out more in depth using a preview build. There's also a mode that started me fresh, so I got a taste of both the beginning of the game, and end-game.</p>

<p>The beginning of <em>The First Descendant</em> tasks me with choosing a hero, dubbed Descendant, to control -- these are pre-made characters that have a unique set of abilities. I went with Ajax, a tank/bruiser-type hero that specializes in shielding and disrupting foes.</p>
<p>I'm taken through a linear beginner mission to get acquainted with the gameplay of <em>The First Descendant</em>. Here, I learn about my abilities as Ajax and I get familiar with the gunplay and traversal system. Every Descendant is equipped with a grappling hook (because every game needs one, duh), but I can't complain because it's really fun to use.</p>

<h2>Lootin' and Shootin' in <em>The First Descendant</em></h2>
<p>Like any live service game, you're hit with a deluge of information explaining the various systems at play. Don't get too stressed by <em>The First Descendant</em> -- it might not necessarily <em>ease</em> you into things, but you're able to intuit most of the mechanics even if some aren't explained all that well.</p>
<p>You have open-world missions you can partake in these hub areas, as well as more linear dungeon experiences. These can be tackled with friends or others online, so there's a communal element to <em>The First Descendant</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, what I gravitate towards the most is loot and progression, of which there is a <em>lot</em> in this game. First, you level up your descendants and gain more power as you do so, all the while gaining new abilities and looting new weapons and modules to upgrade them with.</p>

<p>Loot is actually my biggest gripe with <em>The First Descendant</em>. There's a decent amount of weapon types, approximately a dozen or so. Weapons within each type feel almost if not exactly the same as the last. The only difference is, you'll have modifiers that make a gun more powerful, but it's not like <em>Borderlands</em> where guns can vary wildly.</p>
<p>Even the modules, which you use to upgrade the stats of your guns, are bland. You get percent increases like increased damage or fire rate, but it's hard to notice a difference. Even modules like "Electric Enhancement," which makes your guns shoot electric-based attacks, doesn't seem to look or feel individualized.</p>
<p>When I tried out a late-game, fully equipped character with the very best weapons and upgrades, I felt more powerful, sure, but weapons behaved the same as they did at lower levels. Looter shooters are so fun because of this unknown element of what the next gun might be, but I'm not really feeling it here.</p>
<p>That said, the guns do feel punchy and enemies go down relatively easy, so you feel powerful. Combine the gunplay with some Descendant abilities, and combat is just enticing enough to keep me engaged. Moving forward, though, I hope for more weapon types and variation in gunplay.</p>

<h2>Will <em>The First Descendant </em>Keep You Hooked?</h2>
<p><em>The First Descendant</em> plays it very by the books, which means it's a safe bet for a fun time, but I do fear for its longevity. Is it unique enough to distinguish itself from others on the market? How long will it take for me to get bored of it?</p>
<p>Because my progress was fast-tracked in the demo, I'm not sure how progression will be, but I hope that core gameplay loop of going out on missions, grabbing materials, and upgrading my descendant is enough to justify playing a game that demands a lot of time.</p>
<p>For now, I'm pretty impressed by the overall package. It's polished, runs decently well (and the implementation of DLSS is appreciated), and I like how individualized the Descendants are with their abilities. We won't have to wait very long to see the final product, which will be available on July 4, 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24185656/riven-review-remake-remaster-pc-steam-vr<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="sdPJyZ">Back in the early 1990s, the creators of <em>Myst</em> had a problem with their testers. Players would wander around the initial island, poking at the rocket ship, flipping the levers on the podiums up and down, and watching as none of it did anything. The quantity of puzzles was overwhelming, the solutions inaccessible. They’d get bored, and then get frustrated, and then too many of them would give up. </p>

<p id="gKFQRF">The solution was to add a hologram, near the starting point of the game, which contained a recorded message from <em>Myst</em>’s guiding figure, Atrus. And if players missed that room, there was a piece of paper — a piece of paper, <em>loose on the ground — </em>with a note on it that told players — with, like, <em>words</em>! — to go check that room.</p>
<p id="bSsnXa">Today, this would be fixed by making the message room more obvious. Or by starting with the player <em>facing</em> the door, or by putting the room in a privileged position. In the genre of puzzle games in which you explore a series of freaky li’l rooms, environmental storytelling is king. Except the phrase “<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/environmental-storytelling-creating-immersive-3d-worlds-using-lessons-learned-from-the-theme-park-industry">environmental storytelling</a>” wouldn’t be coined until years after the release of <em>Myst</em> and its expectation-shattering sequel, <em>Riven</em>. </p>
<p id="888JHj">To unpack the legacy of those two games would take another article on its own, but suffice it to say, the genre that developer Cyan Worlds put on the map has done some significant evolving in the 30 years since <em>Myst</em> and <em>Riven</em> were first released. Which is exactly why it’s so fascinating to play this week’s 3D remake of <em>Riven</em>, in which Rand Miller and the rest of the folks at Cyan return to a masterpiece with three decades of environmental puzzle games at their backs. </p>

<p id="BWCTgr"><em>Riven </em>(2024) is a compelling work of preservation. The game’s earliest life began as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23432662/riven-remake-myst-sequel-cyan-worlds-release-date">the Starry Expanse Project</a>, a fan-run effort to faithfully convert the three hours of video and nearly 5000 images that make up the original <em>Riven</em> into a traversable 3D environment. The final result, after Cyan officially absorbed the Project’s assets and even hired some of its contributors, is — in a word — gorgeous. </p>
<p id="HbVXwe"><em>Riven</em>, after all, is a game of stone, metal, and wood, textures that the Unreal Engine can simulate with its eyes closed, and there are vistas in the remake that, so long as you don’t move your view, you could <em>almost</em> convince yourself are photographs. The other good news for the pleasure centers of fans’ brains is that the original game’s sound design is intact. The meaty thunk-griiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind-LATCH of Temple Island’s rotating room, the keening screech of metal as a maglev car turns around, the bone-vibrating slam of a fire marble turning over — all are just as you remember them. </p>
<p id="nTNXjF">Also familiar: The loading screens take forever. But for a game that originally prompted you to insert one of five different CD-ROMs every time you moved from one island to another — a core, frequent, and intended part of the gameplay — sitting through a gently disguised loading screen, however long, is a palpable advancement. </p>
<p id="CTh1ZQ">Other parts will <em>not</em> be familiar.</p>
<p id="kbgWAA">Some solutions that remained the same from playthrough to playthrough in the original are now randomized for each save, so cheeky players can’t just look up the answers. The full-motion video actors have been replaced with animated figures, synced to both original and re-recorded dialogue, from necessity. Those 30-year-old recordings simply don’t scale up to modern screens. </p>

<p id="ZdTX49">The transition from static images with no need for consistency of euclidean space to a full 3D environment has had a myriad of effects. Some rooms aren’t where they used to be; some modes of travel simply turned out not to work in 3D space. But some tweaks seem fully considered on the part of the developers — and well-chosen. </p>
<p id="rmVuI2">The <em>Riven</em> remake gently gates areas of the game that were originally fully accessible to a new player, yet unsolvable until much later in their playthrough, so as to prevent exactly the kind of overwhelmed frustration that early <em>Myst</em> playtesters experienced. Two of the game’s most involved puzzles have also been completely reworked in ways that were simply not technologically possible in 1997.</p>
<p id="7axwuY">These are not small changes, and I expect some of them may tweak at the nostalgia of longtime fans. But on the other hand, <em>Riven</em>’s most finicky, tedious, time-consuming stumper is here converted into something visually jaw-dropping and engaging to manipulate. </p>
<p id="3zOXlU">If you’re a <em>Riven</em> fan, you simply must play this version. If you’ve never played <em>Riven</em>, there’s no better opportunity. Escaping into another world is not just the external promise of the Myst games, but the actual premise, and <em>Riven</em>’s update brings those two things closer than ever before. </p>

"It's like, let's jam as much bulls**t vaporware into the build as we can in the next three months because we have to have a huge showing at E3, because it's our one opportunity to talk to our audience before we launch the game."</p><p>"I would have to wager that some hugely significant percentage of those E3 efforts ended up on the cutting room floor because they were half-baked and caused people to crunch and really make huge sacrifices to get it in," Tung added.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/between-realism-and-abstraction-the-boundaries-of-playability<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the world of computer games, developers constantly balance between striving for realism and maintaining playability. Realism in computer games is a powerful tool that can enhance immersion and player engagement. However, an excessive focus on detail and faithful representation of reality can lead to complications that not only affect gameplay fluidity and overall enjoyment but also pose legal and socio-cultural challenges.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this article, I would like to examine how, during my nearly seven years of employment at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://jujubee.pl/">Jujubee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we faced these challenges, what compromises we had to make, and how they influenced the final reception of our games by the gaming community. I will also explore the lessons that can be learned from these experiences and how they might impact the future of developing computer games that aspire to be realistic.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Jujubee’s approach to Realism"><span>Jujubee’s approach to Realism</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jujubee is a Polish studio that has been active in the computer game market for over a decade. Several years ago, the studio decided to create socially responsible games that address real-world issues. Wanting to develop games with a message, Jujubee consolidated these efforts under the brand Games Beyond, which focuses on games that not only provide entertainment but also have strong reflections of reality.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="KURSK">KURSK</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first production by Jujubee under the Games Beyond brand was the documentary game "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/860620/KURSK/">KURSK</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">." This game focused on recreating real events from the recent past—the Russian naval maneuvers and the catastrophic sinking of the eponymous submarine Kursk during those exercises. The developers, aside from the historical backdrop, decided to realistically depict the interior of the submarine and other locations. To achieve this, they relied on the few available photographs taken on sister submarines. The situation was complicated by the fact that most of the materials were available exclusively in Russian, making access to sources significantly more difficult. At this stage, one can identify the first problem of creating realistic games—the insufficiency of materials, sources, and information.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The true causes of the disaster and its sequence of events are also unknown, so this gap had to be filled with an abstract scenario. In a situation where a significant portion of individuals who experienced the event, either directly or indirectly, are still alive, crafting an interpretation of reality poses several challenges. The first is the possibility of new information emerging that may reveal inconsistencies or illogical aspects between the presented scenario and the actual events. The second challenge is the risk of offending individuals emotionally involved in the event, which was very apparent during the production of "KURSK."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The third observed problem is the right to use specific materials. Access to military documents of the submarine's crew was possible—in a realistic approach, the ideal solution would have been to create characters with the same names and appropriately modeled appearances. However, licensing issues, the right to likeness, and the feelings of the families of those who perished on the submarine stand in the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fourth, more obvious aspect is finding a balance between depicting the truth and what will be interesting for the player. Game design has its own rules; players have become accustomed to certain patterns and solutions and have specific expectations regarding the tasks presented to them. Reality usually appears much simpler and duller—there is no point in engaging the player in several days of observing maneuvers from the submarine's perspective before the disaster occurs. In a realistic approach, they would spend most of the game standing next to the captain, listening to orders being given and received communications, only to later experience a brief episode with the disaster.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fifth encountered problem is, of course, the budget. Faithfully recreating realism is associated with significantly higher costs—primarily, there is no possibility of using ready-made assets, or this possibility is very limited. More time needs to be devoted to gathering source material, verifying facts, and adjusting mechanics and storyline to them. Often, it will be necessary to purchase additional licenses, such as music from a given period or the rights to use trademarks or specific models.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Truck Simulation 19">Truck Simulation 19</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Continuing the discussion on licensing rights, it is worth looking at another game from the studio—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.astragon.trucksimtwo&amp;hl=en_US">Truck Simulation 19</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The idea behind this production was to create a mobile truck simulator. To maximize realism, it was necessary to obtain licenses to use real truck models in the game. Besides the obvious financial considerations, it is important to remember that such licenses can come with additional requirements. For example, all trucks must have the same parameters to avoid presenting players with better and worse options. Only customization offered by the manufacturers is allowed—meaning all additional stickers, paint jobs, or super-tuning are excluded. Trucks cannot be shown in a negative light, which means forgoing damage systems or vehicle dirt. Moreover, using the vehicles for illegal purposes, such as street racing or transporting prohibited cargo, may also be disallowed. Licensing issues can thus force the abandonment of certain gameplay ideas but can also block some realistic aspects in games.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Take Off Flight Simulator">Take Off Flight Simulator</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second simulator released for mobile devices is the flight simulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/take-off-the-flight-simulator-switch/">Take Off</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In this game, the player takes on the role of a pilot building their airline company in the Hawaiian Islands. In this case, budget considerations led to the decision to forgo accurate representation of real aircraft, and instead, planes were created solely inspired by real models.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Originally, the game's idea was to enable the most faithful feeling of controlling an aircraft, with accurate physics and the behavior of the machine during winds, weather changes, and altitude differences, considering the size and type of the aircraft and its parameters. The problem encountered here was the computational power of mobile devices. Developing a game for mobile devices involves significantly less computational power than for PCs, so it was necessary to greatly simplify the physics and abandon realism in favor of accessibility on a larger number of devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another realistic element that had to be abandoned was the realistic number of parameters that the pilot must control and the handling of individual mechanisms in the aircraft. Creating a true-to-life simulator that faithfully reproduces a pilot's work would significantly reduce the player base—few possess the skills that would allow them to enjoy such a game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Deep Diving Adventures">Deep Diving Adventures</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990030/Deep_Diving_Simulator/">Deep Diving Simulator</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, also known as Deep Diving Adventures, is a deep-sea diving simulator. A significant emphasis in this game was placed on realistically portraying the ocean floor with its flora and fauna, realistic aspects, problems and dangers of diving, and environmental conservation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first reason for deviating from realism here was age-related requirements and associated restrictions. In many markets, there are varied requirements for games aimed at children, making it impossible to include real weapons in the game—which were intended for fighting predators or removing obstacles. It was necessary to create a sound gun that only scared away aggressive fish with ultrasound and disintegrated obstacles with a laser without any shots.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lack of weapons also ties into social issues and expectations for this type of game—we have all heard about the problems Assassin’s Creed faced related to hunting endangered fish species. Society is more accepting of killing monsters and humans in games, but when it comes to animals, especially rare ones, there is an outcry. Social expectations for environmental care are very high, and in the case of realistic games, there are expectations to align with this narrative.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The third aspect that had to be considered when deciding on the level of realism in this game was player knowledge. People entirely unfamiliar with diving will not understand why rapid changes in depth cause a decrease in health points, why the player automatically receives cold damage at lower levels, or that some marine creatures, though seemingly harmless, can be dangerous. It was necessary to decide what the player would be able to grasp or how to explain it effectively and quickly.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Covid the Outbreak">Covid the Outbreak</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1287000/COVID_The_Outbreak/?l=polish">Covid the Outbreak</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or Virus the Outbreak, is a strategy game that was created as an artistic and social manifesto by the developers confined to their homes. The very short production period allowed for the release of a game created during the pandemic, about the pandemic, and for the pandemic. In this game, the player assumes the role of the director of the Global Health Organization, who can persuade all countries around the world to take specific actions in the fight against the virus. The game's goal was to show why governments make certain decisions and what impacts they will have—how to balance social, economic, tourism, and cultural issues in the face of combating the disease.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This type of game faced significant resistance due to its subject matter—once again highlighting the prevailing belief in society that games should not touch on important topics and are considered a lesser, less responsible medium.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another problem encountered during this production was emotions—the aversion to the pandemic and the negative feelings associated with it carried over to the game's reception. The game caused a great stir—for example, the thread dedicated to it on the GOG store became one of the most popular topics, surpassing the biggest releases in terms of the number of comments.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The third problem related to this production was differing opinions. The developers tried to take a neutral approach—explaining the arguments of both sides, such as stating, “Lockdown is necessary to limit the spread of the virus, but the longer it lasts, the greater the socio-economic problems it may cause.” Extremist supporters did not appreciate this centrist approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fourth problem was the prohibition and banning of certain words and topics. To release the game on some consoles, it was necessary to change the title to “VIRUS” and remove all references to COVID (even though the game depicted a completely different disease variant set in the future). For some sales platforms, even this change was insufficient, and they refused to publish a production concerning even an abstract pandemic—resulting in the game not being released on all devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fifth problem was marketing issues and large corporations reducing the reach of certain keywords. As a result, not only did official materials and sponsored content have significantly lower reach, but gameplay videos from independent influencers were also demonetized, causing reluctance to record the game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Realpolitiks Series">Realpolitiks Series</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1248060/Realpolitiks_II/">The Realpolitiks</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> games represent the cornerstone series for the company. As a grand strategy game set in real-time and contemporary times, it fills a niche left by Paradox, which is reluctant to undertake such realistic titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first problem with realism in this series lies primarily in geopolitical conflicts—not just the delineation of borders, but also the names of countries, regions, and seas. For example, Japan does not recognize the name "East China Sea." Using this term not only resulted in threats against the developers but also led to the game being massively reported to Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Contemporary issues such as terrorism, wars, refugees, and political opinions evoke strong emotions, controversies, and aversion. Many publishers are hesitant to tackle such topics. A company that tries to include them in its productions, even while maintaining full neutrality, must be prepared for negative reactions from the media, influencers, and some gamer communities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another obstacle to realism in games is banned symbols. Contrary to appearances, this list is quite extensive and, in addition to swastikas, also includes the international red cross symbol and various local symbols. An example is the first installment of the series, where it was necessary to remove the flag of the Islamic State from the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The next aspect is the expectation to combat harmful attitudes, especially when it concerns contemporary times. For example, in Stellaris, a player can create a fascist state enslaving all other nations in the galaxy without negative reception. However, in a strategy set in our times, calling the Belarusian government authoritarian rather than totalitarian caused many expressions of dissatisfaction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is also worth noting that with realistic games, many people engage in personal crusades against a particular topic. Again, referring to the first part of the series, the inclusion of the Silesian nationality resulted in several negative reviews from opponents of this solution.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A problem with realistic games is also the changing narrative in mainstream media. What was acceptable at the beginning of production can become forbidden and unwanted after several years of developing the game. For instance, during the production of Realpolitiks 3, the perception of Palestine and Israel, as well as migration issues to Europe, changed significantly.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Punk Wars">Punk Wars</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A less problematic approach to realism can be observed in the fantastical game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1541790/Punk_Wars/">Punk Wars</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. According to the studio's philosophy, every game must reference contemporary issues, so here they decided to show the dangers that excessive faith in technology, corporatism, and continuous industrialization can bring—leading to an apocalypse and the takeover of power by fanatical corporations trying to rebuild humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, even such a large dose of speculative fiction must meet the expectations of realism among players—mainly in the form of certain patterns and beliefs already ingrained in the audience. If a faction wants to use steampunk technology, it must be consistent with the entire vision of that setting—meaning lots of clocks, gears, and specific colors. The same applies to dieselpunk, atompunk, and steelpunk. Players react negatively to breaking certain conventions derived from realism—real technological limitations or cultural sources different from those presented in the game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Dark Moon">Dark Moon</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1105330/Dark_Moon/">Dark Moon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" is an upcoming survival strategy game set in the near future, during the early stages of moon colonization. The player takes on the role of an employee of a large corporation, who is caught by a solar flare during a lunar mission, leading to the destruction of all electronics exposed to sunlight. The player must expand their mobile base and stay on the dark side of the moon, racing against time and the encroaching sunlight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To give the catastrophe a realistic touch, the studio consulted with a satellite constructor to learn about satellite safeguards and procedures for such disasters. However, finding experts with such specialized knowledge who were willing to share it proved challenging. Several times, they faced refusals from NASA employees and academic lecturers. Thus, the problem here is the availability of experts or consultants.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The Slavs">The Slavs</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The last production mentioned in this article is "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://jujubee.pl/?page_id=12">The Slavs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," an unreleased turn-based strategy game focusing on the culture and beliefs of the Slavs compared to other ethnic groups in early medieval Europe. This game is fundamentally a cultural project, heavily based on realism, true sources, and history. Such productions enjoy great popularity in Poland and are strongly supported by the state. In this case, Jujubee received a grant to create a prototype of a strategic game about Slavic culture and history, funded by the Minister of Culture and National Heritage as part of the Creative Industry Development Center's "video game support program" under the task "creating prototypes of cultural video games" amounting to 261,678 PLN.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the production, they encountered problems related to the scarcity of sources and studies. The topic of the Slavs is not very popular or overexploited in pop culture but has a dedicated fan base. Thus, there was a problem with satisfying two extremely different audiences—those with extensive knowledge and those with none at all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another problem with creating games based on such sources, which are often tales and legends rather than real chronicles written by historians, is balancing realism and gameplay with mythology. Mythological and legendary events often contradict basic historical knowledge, creating another problem in choosing the game's content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, cognitive biases in players present a problem. Pop culture has taught us certain patterns, but in the case of realistic references, these are often incorrect patterns (e.g., Vikings wearing horned helmets). For the Slavs, the biggest culprit is the local "The Witcher" series—widely perceived as a model of Slavic culture, but in reality, it draws more from Germanic mythology. The challenge is to confront players' expectations and understanding of Slavic culture with a realistic portrayal of its elements.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Summary">Summary</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating realistic games can take various forms. Realism does not always mean faithful representation in game mechanics but can also manifest as historical games, those based on cultural texts, or those reflecting current, real-world events. Realism can bring numerous benefits to a game, but it also entails additional challenges for developers—from the design phase, through production, to release, marketing, and product support. Often, it is only after years that it becomes clear whether the chosen approach was correct or not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Examining 11 games
