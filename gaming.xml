<p>Okay, is the vampire in *this* coffin?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> is the gift that keeps on giving. We've had a countless amount of free updates, expansive paid DLCs, and so much content that it's so easy to lose hundreds of hours to. So, how's about a completely new game?</p>
<p>Yep, Poncle is spreading its wings and today announced a spin-off to Vampire Survivors, called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_crawlers_the_turbo_wildcard_from_vampire_survivors">Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors</a> (we'll stick to Vampire Crawlers...) coming to Switch in 2026. The tongue-in-cheek trailer above tells you it isn't a roguelite deckbuilder, but it is in fact a roguelite deckbuilding dungeon crawler. <em>Fancy that</em>.</p>
<p>But, in true Vampire Survivors fashion, it's absolutely nuts. Essentially, as Poncle founder Luca Galante puts it on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox Wire</a>, Vampire Crawlers is "about mowing down hordes of enemies using cards, while you explore dungeons, playing as slowly or as fast as you prefer."</p>
<p>Galante also compares the game to a "blobber", a type of first-person RPG popular in the '80s that often used giant on-screen buttons; instead of the buttons, Crawlers uses cards.</p>
<p>Here's a brief little rundown from the game's Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is Vampire Crawlers about</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Snowballing, turn‑based carnage</strong>: Play cards in ascending mana order to land combos; each step multiplies the next card’s effect. Use Wilds to extend the stack and keep going to 10, 20, 30… Can you reach infinite?</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Pick your pace</strong>: Either take your time and be tactical, or play turns as fast as you humanly can: the outcome is always accurate!</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Deck-Building</strong>: Accumulate experience and level up to gain new cards, headbutt chests for customization gems and power‑ups; chase weapon evolutions and summon survivors to trigger cascade of effects and break the game.</p>
<p><strong>- Dungeon Crawling</strong>: Explore dungeons packed with something seldom seen in Vampire Survivors: functioning walls. And then all sorts of unique treasures and interactions. Find the shovel to dig into the next floor, that will most likely take place in the clouds!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't worry, this isn't a direct sequel, and Vampire Survivors will still be a thing going forward. But Galante does mention something interesting: "With regards to a sequel to <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, we’re working on <em>something</em>, but we’re not talking about that just yet."</p>
<p>Stay tuned, then...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ho, ho, ho! Happy holidays! Everyone is getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>‘s first DLC for free because the game needed so much post-launch fixing that Gearbox couldn’t finish the DLC in time, and will make it up to fans who paid for the pack with extra DLC next year.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-tips-borderlands-4-guide-help-better-loot-gold-keys-side-quests-tricks-2000626554"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched in September, it received praise for its open world, improved gunplay, and better-than-ever co-op gameplay. I really liked it! <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">But performance issues and bugs</a> on PC and console derailed some of the excitement, leading to Gearbox having to spend a lot of time fixing, improving, and updating the co-op-focused online looter shooter. In fact, according to Gearbox and 2K, the team spent so much time fixing stuff in <em>Borderlands 4</em> that it screwed up the original roadmap.</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/GearboxOfficial/status/1991545250532208879">On November 20, Gearbox announced</a> that <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s first post-launch DLC, Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/borderlandsr-4-bounty-pack-1-how-rush-saved-mercenary-day-releases-today-for-borderlandsr-4-players-for-free">will no longer be locked behind a paywall</a>. Previously, the plan was for <em>Borderlands 4</em> to get four smaller DLC drops, known as Bounty Packs, and you’d only have access to this new content if you had purchased the Deluxe Edition or Super Deluxe Edition, or had separately bought the Bounty Pack Bundle.&nbsp; However, things have changed as Gearbox was unable to include as much content as planned in the first DLC due to having to update <em>Borderlands 4</em> so much, as explained in a press release.</p>

 <p>“However, with the continued efforts to improve the <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience, the team ran out of time to stuff as much mayhem-fueled content into the Bounty Pack 1 stocking as originally planned,” explained 2K and Gearbox. “So in the spirit of the season, and as a thank you to the community for their passion and support, 2K and Gearbox are excited to provide Bounty Pack 1…to all <em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players for free!”</p>

 <h2>What’s included in <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s first DLC?</h2>  <p>In the new DLC, How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, <em>Borderlands 4</em> rebel leader Rush faces off against a new enemy, the miserly Minister Screw. This doofus is in charge of making sure people don’t celebrate the holidays and have fun. So across a series of new missions that make up a new questline, players will celebrate the holidays in defiance and take on Screw.</p>

 <p>Bounty Pack 1 includes a new Vault Card with fresh rewards, 24 new cosmetic items, and new weapons, too. It looks like parts of the map will become Christmas-themed, too, complete with gifts and snow. To start the new DLC, just update your game and head to any major hub in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> There you’ll find a large gift-wrapped present marked on your map, which can be interacted with to start the holiday fun.</p>

 <p>Keep in mind that Bounty Packs are smaller bits of paid content, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708"><em>Borderlands 4</em> will also get two proper, much larger expansions as well as new playable characters next year, too</a>.</p> <p>Also arriving on Thursday <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">is a big new gameplay update for <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that makes a lot of changes to the looter shooter. Perhaps the most exciting is that Wildcard Missions, which make up the bulk of the FPS’s endgame content, will no longer force you to play through the entirety of missions. Previously Wildcard Missions, which are just normal missions you replay with variables, forced you to sit through all the content, even if it was all tutorial crap. Gearbox is now promising new start points to drop players into the action sooner. And that sounds like a real holiday treat that will make grinding for loot in <em>Borderlands 4</em> a lot more enjoyable and less annoying.</p>

In his latest album, “The Death of Slim Shady,” the rapper attempted to put his other self away, but now Eminem recruits the legendary assassin Agent 47 to put his past away permanently. In a surreal new mission crafted by Eminem in collaboration with IO Interactive and creative director / producer Paul Rosenberg, the level is packed with dreamlike twists that mirror Slim Shady’s unhinged reality. Operatives find themselves in a medical facility in Hokkaido that has been twisted into the Popsomp Hills Asylum. Agent 47 will have to track Slim Shady across multiple areas, such as his broadcasting studio, to take him out without being detected. There are abundant Eminem references in the mission from throughout the rapper’s discography, such as a poisoned plate of the iconic Mom’s Spaghetti and a performance of “Houdini.”</p><p><strong>The Season of Eminem vs. Slim Shady: Live Updates, Free for <em>HITMAN World of Assassination</em>&nbsp;Players</strong></p><p>A new roadmap will start with the Season of Eminem vs. Slim Shady set to bring new content to players, in addition to the new Elusive Target. Players will be able to face two new challenges, two new Featured Contracts batches, as well as three returning Elusive Targets, including The Splitter featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme, and two returning events: Holiday Hoarders and Hokkaido Snow Festival. Two new Twitch Drops will be available to redeem, with the Bomb-Ass Dynamite, and the Solstice Suit, which can be earned by watching thirty minutes of <em>HITMAN World of Assassination</em> on Twitch during specific time periods.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

<p>Update: Here's a new trailer</p>
</section></header><section>
<p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-11-20T20:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Thu 20th Nov 2025, 8:30pm</time>]:</strong> Things have been a little quiet on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> DLC front. Well, during today's Xbox Showcase, we got a fresh new look at the upcoming content update, along with a new early 2026 release window.</p>
<p>Announced during The Game Awards last year and originally due to launch in 2025, <strong>In The Jungle</strong> takes Dave away from the Blue Hole and onto dry land.</p>
<p>The jungle gives Dave a bunch of new creatures to catch and ingredients to work with in his sushi restaurant. You get a brief look at what to expect from the DLC at the <a href="https://youtu.be/PFbcVdZRKwE?si=J59eXQrcmR4B6Pe9&amp;t=34">34 second mark</a> in the trailer up top, but we've also got a few new screenshots, too.</p>
<p>For more details, check out our original story from last year below. And hey, don't forget about that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dave-the-diver-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, which will be getting a physical version in early 2026 courtesy of Silver Lining Direct.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>Fri 13th Dec, 2024 11:45 GMT</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> has quickly become one of the most bankable titles for an appearance at <em>each and every game showcase</em> since it arrived on PC and console last year, and The Game Awards was no exception.</p>
<p>Developer MINTROCKET popped up at this year's Geoff-fest to reveal the upcoming '<strong>In the Jungle</strong>' DLC, an expansion that will see Dave and co. leave the Blue Hole and set out into greener pastures (literally) to search for their next catch.</p>
<p>We don't have all that much information on what the DLC entails for the time being, though the swanky cinematic trailer did give us a release window of "<strong>Late 2025</strong>", so that's something to look forward to next year — dare we say on 'Switch 2'?</p>
<p>This comes after a stellar year of Dave the Diver content drops, including a whole host of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/dave-the-divers-latest-crossover-update-arrives-today-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">crossovers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/dave-the-diver-catches-new-minigame-in-latest-update-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">new minigames</a> and... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/05/free-godzilla-dlc-storms-into-dave-the-diver-next-week-on-switch">Godzilla</a>? Damn, what a game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/godfall">Godfall</a> developer Counterplay Games <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/godfall-developer-counterplay-has-reportedly-shut-down" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reportedly shut down earlier this year</u></a>, so seeing it suddenly reappear with Armatus, a full-blown roguelite shooter coming to PC and consoles in 2026, might be somewhat of a shock.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A trailer, including everything from far-along cinematics and tense gameplay, materialized during today’s November 2025 Xbox Partner Preview. It’s undeniably got that Godfall flair to it, as its main character can be seen smashing and blasting their way through a post-post-apocalyptic Paris.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not often a game developer seemingly closes down only to reemerge months later with a brand-new video game for PC, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. We sat down with Counterplay studio head and creative director Ming Zhang to learn more about Armatus, its roguelike gameplay, and what it’s been like for the team to continue its work when those rumors were kicked up. You can see the full interview below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: To set the stage, tell me about Armatus and this trailer we're going to see. What are players looking at in this first trailer?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ming Zhang: </strong>What you see in this trailer is snippets of gameplay, largely with a little bit of cinematic footage from our game. You know, it's been a number of years in the making, and this is Counterplay's next entry in our love of visceral combat. You see some of the abilities, some of the enemies, and some of the cool moves that you're going to be you're going to be able to do, in this case.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me, in a little more detail, about its gameplay, its story, and, especially, the world it takes place in?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>It's a third-person roguelite shooter, and in order to build the world, what we did, is we took the concept of urban fantasy, which is the grim supernatural underneath the real world, and we took it to the nines. What happens in the post-post-apocalypse of an urban fantasy world? Well, you know, the real world kind of starts to break apart, and underneath, all the supernatural stuff starts to spill forth, right? When you think about, 'What is a city that evokes classic but also modern, and has all the right tone and tambre, even un-supernatural?' It would be Paris. Starting from there, we then said, 'Well, what is the kind of character that we would have bring here? We wanted to create the supernatural character, who was powerful and had access to these celestial abilities that you would be able to use, but we also wanted to take the sound and fury of modern firearms and put that in the hands of this supernatural being. So, you've got the magic and the firepower, and put it together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I saw The Vanishing is what triggered this Paris to look like this. What can you tell me about that event and how it resulted in something like that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>There's something about the word spoiler that is coming up (laughs), so you'll have to, you'll have to play and find out, but it is the pivotal event. That kicks off the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>That's totally fair. You talked about it a little bit there, but what else is it about Paris that makes it the location you go to for this instead of somewhere else around the world?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>Paris just has incredible visuals, as a city. Again, when you think urban fantasy, it's impossible to avoid a lot of the gothic undertones. The architecture of the city already evokes the emotions that we wanted from those from the supernatural side of the world, so combining that real world with the supernatural was a big part of the setting as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm curious if you can tell us more about the different tools players will have at their disposal. Are there different guns, weapon modifiers, or abilities? What can we generally look forward to?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>This is a run-based game, and the primary, I say, means of combat that the player has is, of course, your gun. So, you have your gun, you will be able to shoot it, but you also have a melee weapon at your disposal, and you have several locomotion kits and several abilities that you will be able to pick. One of the things that was really important to us was that players do this thing that we internally call 'creative expression through combat,' where not only is it that, you have all these amazing tools that you can use in your in your player kit, it's that you get to customize the player kit that you're taking on the run as you play each run. Just as it's important to have visceral fidelity in the gameplay, it was important for us to have the build craft to go along with it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Armatus Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Armatus is described as a third-person, roguelite shooter. Are there any specific games that inspired Counterplay when crafting its gameplay?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>We have a lot of references, as all game designers do. I think you'll have to play and discover all the references, but I think fans of the genre will be very pleased with what we have to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I don't know if maybe you'd have the same answer, then, for some of the different movies, books, and games or shows that inspired the story and universe this takes place in?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>Well, one of the things that we always look for at Counterplay, and we've done this since the beginning, was interesting genre blends. Without getting you know too nerdy (laughs), we always look for combinations. We always look for the chocolate and peanut butter or whatnot, and so I think a lot of the fun in doing that is for our players to figure it out on on their own, but I think you'll see the inspirations worn pretty heavily on our sleeves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Roguelite, I think, is a term that a lot of people hear, and they feel like if they've played one, they've played them all. What does Armatus do to stand apart from other rogue lights and shooters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>I tend to think of roguelite as a design framework. It'd be like saying, 'If you played one RPG, you played them all.' The design framework is the thing that you scaffold the game on top of, but it's not the only thing in the game. As we emphasized, our game really sings when you get into the combat. Creative expression through combat is a core pillar of what we wanted to do. If you came into this game and you just wanted to slaughter demons using abilities and guns and melee, this is the game for you, and if you wanted to be the kind of person who strategically picks every single upgrade in order to hit the perfect combination and eradicate rooms that way, this is also the game for you. So that's kind of how we think about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How long is your average run going to be? Is this the kind of thing where you can play quick run before bed, or do you really need to sit down and lock in for hours and hours?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>We're still working on the game, so I prefer not to give a number at this at this point, but what I will say is, like many games that have come before and after, both in the third-person action genre, as well as the roguelite genre, the choices that you make have a big impact on how much you can do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I think at the end of the trailer, you tease a boss fight. I'm not looking for specifics here, but are bosses something players can look forward to in Armatus, and what can you tell me about them?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>Yeah, bosses are definitely a part of the game. Thank you for that. Bosses are definitely a part of the game, and we call them Greater Demons. What they represent is, if you think of the demonic incursion that's happening in Paris, in the post-apocalypse that we talked about, the Greater Demons are the ones that anchor. They're more solid than the other ones. They're bigger, they're scarier, they are figures of nightmare, and I think players will have a great time being killed and killing them as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So would you call Armatus a particularly difficult game, then, or is that in the hands of the player through different options?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>I think that's going to be up to the player, but I guess you'll have to wait and see on that one, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What are some of the lessons the team learned from, specifically, Godfall, because it's really easy to compare these two, that the team brought into the development of Armatus?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>I think the biggest one is this: Coming out of Godfall, one of the things we consistently received feedback on, and it was almost all positive, but basically the big discussion point was the starting point in the game felt almost primordial. Then, as you unlocked moves in the skill tree, suddenly you were doing this and you were doing that. The combat in that game felt like a conversation with the developers. Again, I'm paraphrasing, you know, one or two reviews here, but that was a major source of feedback we got across the board. Fans really resonated with the dynamic combat that we had in Godfall, and they really liked this conversation with the developer-style of play that they had. So as we moved into our next project, we said, 'Hey, we did it for melee. Can we pull it off for shooters as well?' So we took that, and that's where this emphasis on build craft comes from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I saw a lot of rumors earlier this year that Counterplay had shut down, and sitting here now, that's obviously not the case. So, I'm curious if you have any comment on that situation you'd like to share, and more specifically, what it's been like for the studio to see those rumors swirl while knowing full well that Counterplay's next game is very much still in development, despite that.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>I think most of the studio was too busy working on the game (laughs) to really pay attention to rumours that don't really apply to their day-to-day. I think the only comment I really have on it is, the announcement and future release of Armatus is a celebration of Counterplay Games, of our camaraderie, and this team that has gone through thick and thin together. It means the world to us that players are going to be able to see this game. They're going to play it, and we think that people are going to have a lot of fun. So, my comment is, go play Armatus, and then you can tell us how you feel about, right? (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Moving back to the game itself, I couldn't tell based on the trailer alone. Is this an entirely single-player experience, or are there any multiplayer elements, even scoreboards, or anything like that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>It's a single-player game, and as for features, again, we're, we're still in development, so wait and find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I get it. It’s hard to talk about these things when the pieces are always moving, I'm sure.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>I think it's harder not to talk about these things, right? That's kind of the challenge here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>PC, PlayStation, and Xbox versions are on the way, but I also saw that a Nintendo Switch 2 version is in development. Were there any challenges in bringing Armatus to that console, and is the Switch 2 version expected to launch at the same time as other platforms?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>Yes, they are all expected to launch together. The challenge with these things is always optimization, but if you've seen Godfall, a PlayStation 5 launch title, you know that, if there's one thing that we do well, it's optimizing game systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there anything about Armatus that you want to talk about or that you want players to know now that they're finally seeing what this looks like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This game is a love letter to action combat in all its forms. It's a love letter to the urban fantasy, gothic horror inspirations that we see in so many games and fiction all over, and the thing that is most important to us here at Counterplay is for players to see this letter that we've written. So, I can come up here and yammer about systems and features all day long, and all I would be doing is making promises to the audience, but the promise I will make is that if you play our game, you're going to have a really great experience of butchering all these demons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Indie developer Cococucumber is, for the first time ever, trying its hand at a sequel with Echo Generation 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where the first turn-based romp channeled ‘80s and ‘90s vibes to create a nostalgic adventure that looked like Stranger Things was tossed into a blender with voxel graphics and classic RPG gameplay, the sequel is going a totally new direction. The sideways prequel skips the cozy small-town feel to drop players straight into a B-movie, cosmic horror story where they play as the missing father from the first game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its first trailer, which debuted as part of today’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-everything-announced-updating-live">November 2025 Xbox Partner Preview</a>, teases a much more horrific experience for Cococucumber. We sat down with game director Martin Gavreau and studio producer and director Vanessa Chia to learn more about Echo Generation 2’s inspirations, how fan feedback helped guide development, and why the team decided to revisit one of its existing universes from a new perspective. You can see everything they had to say in the interview below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Tell me about what people are going to see on Thursday. Tell me about this trailer and what exactly Echo Generation 2 is.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Martin Gavreau: </strong>It's very different than the first game. We were not sure how far we could go with it, because when you do a sequel, you have many options. You could say, 'Let's just do more of the same,' or you do something entirely different, or anywhere in between. There was a bit of an existential crisis of 'What do we do with this?' We felt that we wanted to see how far we could expand on this world-building. The first game, except for a very short moment, everything is within maybe a 5-10-mile radius of a small town, you know? The sequel, it's much more than that (laughs). It's much more. It's across the galaxy. We visit a different planet, we visit a different dimension, a different time era, and also, what's at stake is much bigger than, 'OK, I want to figure out what happened to my dad.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You think about the first game, you start just playing with your sister in the street with a raccoon, and then at one point, you fight a mech with the cannon and lasers. You're supposed to be just a kid infiltrating a military base. There's a ramp going up to there, and we wanted to have this ramp up on another scale. Sometimes, in some classic RPGs, you start in your town and you end up fighting gods. So it's like, 'Let's go all the way there.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, the trailer, what we're going to see is part of the story. We're not revealing everything. There's big story moments that are not in the trailer that we want to keep. I don't think we're going to reveal them even later, before launch, we want to keep a lot of surprise. We're not playing as a kid anymore. We're playing as the father who disappeared, and it's before the first game. I mean, when you you play with time travel, is it a prequel? So it's a part of a prequel/sequel in some ways. There's some connection with the first game that, I think, people who played the first game, will definitely see a lot of connection, but in an expanded universe that happened across a different time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're going to jump back and forth between the future and the past. Really, really bigger scope and more complex plot to...I don't want to spoil it, but there's a much bigger issue happening across the galaxy. We, of course, want to go back home because we're getting trapped. To go back will become eventually, of course, still a goal, but what's the point of going back if you're going back to ruins? You don't want to come back to your Hobbit town and the Shire, and then it's all burned and destroyed. So you want to make sure that you go on a journey of adventure, but also you're going to come back to a world that is still, you know, intact and exists.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Echo Generation 2 obviously has some connections to the first game, but it also seems so different. I am wondering, why a sequel? Why a sequel to Echo Generation instead of something like Ravenlok or Riverbond?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>I mean, I would love to do a sequel for Riverbond and Ravenlok. Revisiting those games and expanding on them would be a fantastic opportunity. But why do Echo Generation? There's always a bit of a business decision, because there's always a risk associated with making any game, but we're small in the studio, so it's what we feel like doing. We sit down and we talk all the team, share a bit there, you know, their ideas and what we like to work on, because there's always a possibility also to create a new game, no? And it's the same thing with making a sequel, and everybody loved making the first one. I think it's just the desire to go back to this world and expand on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We started the production right when the pandemic started, five years ago, already. So it just coincided, where we entered production for it, and at first there was a lot more unknown about, 'Is the whole world gonna collapse? Is everybody gonna die?' We used the game as a small safe haven structure. When I'm at work, we don't talk about politics, we don't talk about the vaccine or the virus. We just...we are living Echo Generation, and we live in that world, to our little bubble of imagination with these cute characters and talking raccoon, you know? It kind of helped us keep our sanity throughout the events of the pandemic, I think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe there's a special kind of association with it emotionally, and we felt like the story was not finished, that we had so many ideas that we couldn't put in the first game, that were left on the cutting room, so to speak, that we were really excited to go and work more on it. I think that was probably the reason after Ravenlok to go back to Echo Generation. Now, I don't think it's going to be an Echo Generation 3 after that. We have other plans, and there's been a different thing that we've been working on. Between all the games you can do, you have to commit to one, and everybody felt inspired. It's such a long amount of time not to make a game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not going to spend a week or a month, it could be years, and it's what you live with every day. You ask yourself, 'Do I want to live with that world every day? Do I want to explore?' It's a long-term relationship, in a way, because even after you launch, you need to patch it. It's many, many years. I want to make sure that not only me is on board, and I love to do it, but everybody who has to work on it will find something interesting. It was not easy not to make a sequel. We realized it was harder than we thought, but we really wanted to make that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Echo Generation really wears its inspirations on its sleeves. Because Echo Generation 2 is so different from the get-go, what are some of the other inspirations for this game specifically? The movies, games, books, and shows that helped influence its development?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>That's great that this could be seen, that you could observe those things in playing the first game. We're not hiding it, and we wanted to use different ones for the sequel and go places we didn't go before, like cosmic horror, for example. So if you think about, you know, the Call of Cthulhu and things that are more kind of like, 'What's out there in space? Is there forces beyond what are really there, and we're just not connected with them, and what if they discover humanity? So there's part of it is cosmic horror, but part of it also is Star Wars (laughs). We wanted to keep the same feeling of the first game. We wanted to use a lot of different inspiration that doesn't seem like they're going to work together at first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have also part of Cyberpunk. We have Blade Runner. We went for more of the sci-fi inspiration. We have 2001: A Space Odyssey in there. There's also X Files, because it's so fun to have. There's this kind of giant biomass that we teleport experiment again, like The Fly from Cronenberg. So, we went to inspiration that is more in the horror and sci-fi side, even if there's a bit of fun in there. I got fascinated, too, with this idea of the Backrooms. So maybe we have a little bit of that in there. That there's this other reality next to us, where there's this kind of mind maze, where you can get lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's going to be a much more violent and scary game than the first one. Maybe not for kids entirely so much anymore. I think our rating is going to be probably 16 or 18 plus. We don't really think about it, but just when we fill out the questionnaire, whatever happened happened. But there is more blood, more gore, and it is pixel and voxel (laughs). So it's not as scary, maybe, but it's kind of fun in a way, like when you see the scientist getting smashed up with the blood. There's this playfulness with it, like B-movie playfulness that you have in movies like Tremors, and we wanted to capture that cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Why is launching day one on Xbox Game Pass the right move, specifically, for Echo Generation 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>Well, the first one was on Game Pass. A lot of fans and people who discovered the game are on Xbox already, so it just feels like a logical way to do something similar with the sequel. Other than that, for us, I think it's our fourth game that's going to launch on Game Pass. We've we had this amazing relationship with Xbox that we had a chance to have their support. When you are on Game Pass, it comes with a lot of marketing support, like being part of a show or social media. Independent video games don't always have a publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't have a publisher, so this kind of support really helped the game to get discovered. There's so many people on Game Pass that if you see a title that you're not familiar with, give it a chance, try it out, and see if you like it. It really helped open a lot of opportunities for the game to be played, and the end of the day, as a game developer, that's what you want. You want to be able to share your creation with as much people as possible. I think with Game Pass, definitely, it's been incredible to have all this interaction and this communication with the community on Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Were there any major points of fan feedback after the first game that you specifically want to address with Echo Generation 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>Oh, yeah, definitely. Some of them, we address in the Midnight Edition. When we started the sequel after Ravenlok, we were thinking, 'Why don't we address some of those issues that some people had playing the game and make a special edition of the first game?' That was going to help us get back in that universe and see if it's possible to improve it in some ways, for quality of life. We really listened to player feedback. Also, something narratively, the first game, it was fun for being episodic, and also at the same time, there's a cost, and the cost is maybe the overarching main story suffered a bit from it. We still keep this episodic format in some ways, but there's a much stronger connection around the main story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the things we tried to improve. Hopefully, we'll see if that works. Another one is to make the combat faster. The combat is so much faster now, the way we designed it. It was one of the design guidelines from the start. We need to be able to fight and resolve things much faster. If you want to stop and think you can, but if you want to go fast, it is possible to go very fast through the animation or the options given to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going into a deck-building mechanic, now, also keeps the combat interesting throughout. What we saw is, sometimes, people, they find a companion, they love one move, and they just keep playing with that companion and that one move. Well, hey, there are a lot of different interesting moves that we designed, so if we add the deck-building mechanic, now you can adjust depending on the enemies you encounter. Maybe your deck will work against a certain environment, certain types of enemies, but you need to adjust it in other situations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You need to keep adjusting your combat style, depending on enemies and depending on the type of cards. You have to have more variety on that side. Those were some of the feedback we tried to improve and implement on that side, for the combat and the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I don't think I saw a release date. I'm assuming, obviously, that's not something you can give me, but is this a game we see in 2026, or is there any kind of window you are targeting?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>I was just talking this morning with a team member and what they were working on next, and they're like, 'I'm done.' (laughs) How can you be done? How can you be done with the game? Let's have a look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But we're pretty advanced. I think we want to make sure we have enough time to polish everything. We want to make sure that we have time to balance all the combat and the journey, but the game is pretty advanced. How early depends on how fast we can go through the last phase of making sure the game is properly balanced, and everything runs smoothly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>(Editor’s Note: Cococucumber clarified after the interview that Echo Generation 2 is targeting a 2026 release window.)</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there anything else you'd like to add about Echo Generation 2, the process of getting here, leading up to this reveal, and what it's like to finally pull back the curtain?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>It feels strange, because we started working on it so long ago. We started working on it right after the first one was launched, and then it's been in and out. We were exploring different types of gameplay and prototyping. It might be, maybe, four years? I don't know, three or four years that this game has been, in some ways, in development? It feels a bit strange that, finally, we're going to be able to talk about it. We're very excited to see if people are going to remember it or be excited for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think it's four years since (Echo Generation) launched. So you need to come with something new. You need to take some risk. This is what we decided to do with the game. Maybe some people wanted to have something very similar. But this is not exactly the decision we took. We decided to take more creative risk for the story and the game mechanic. Hopefully it still feels like an Echo Generation game, and the fan will embark on this journey and find it interesting, but it's, in many ways, going to be very different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were talking about the references, but the tone and the journey, the adventure, the combat, the speed of it, and the violence of it, and the excitement to to travel across the galaxy into to end up finding all those super powerful entities, I think, for us, it's super exciting to be able to finally share some of it, and soon, when it's ready, the game. I would like to talk more about certain things - I cannot at the moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

But most importantly, you must conduct your research.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roadside Research joins the recent trend that’s seen an increase in friend-focused party games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Xbox Partner Presents concluded with a seriously epic cinematic trailer for a new game that caught me totally off guard. It's called Raji: Kaliyuga, and it's a sequel to Raji: An Ancient Epic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not familiar with the first Raji, it's a 2020 action-adventure game made by India-based Nodding Heads Games. It follows Raji, an orphan on a quest to retrieve her brother, who's been kidnapped by a demon army. As she goes, she's watched and at times supported by the goddess Durga and Lord Vishnu. The story delves deep into Indian and Hindu mythologies, and ends on one heck of a cliffhanger, implying that a sequel was always on the mind. The game received mixed reviews, but was nominated for best debut game at The Game Awards that year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Raji: Kaliyuga seems to be a direct follow-up, with the trailer apparently depicting Raji and her younger brother fighting together against the encroaching demon army. It looks like the pair will be dual protagonists that you'll control during different parts of the story. But what's really astonishing here is that while the first Raji game was in an isometric view, this sequel is a full-blown third-person action-adventure game. Though we've only seen a cinematic so far and no gameplay, this looks pretty promising.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/raji-kaliyuga-xbox-partner-preview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire post</a> following the announcement, we learned that Kaliyuga will be set six years after An Ancient Epic, and will portray Raji and her brother Darsh traveling to the Eternal Summit through a number of different mystical realms. As dual protagonists, you can swap between Raji, a warrior, and Darsh, a dreamwalker, who each have unique abilities. The two are separate for much of the game after the events of An Ancient Epic, and the story is about their separation and eventual reunion. "Kaliyuga explores the coexistence of faith and illusion, where the narrative tone, art, music, and gameplay systems must mirror this duality, shifting to reflect the perspective and truth of the character currently being played."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Raji: Kaliyuga is currently planned for release on Xbox, PC, and PS5, and will be day-one on Game Pass. It doesn't have a release window yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at today's Partner Showcase <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-everything-announced-updating-live">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>EA also announced an Open Series for anyone who wants to enter, beginning December 12. Successful squads in the Open Series will earn a chance to compete in the Elite Series alongside professional players. Registration is available through Repeat.gg. More details for both competitions are available on <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/redsec/news/introducing-competitive-battlefield-redsec" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's official site.</a></p><p>Battle royale esports continue to push forward across major titles like Fortnite, Apex Legends, and PUBG, though the ecosystem has shifted over the years as publishers adjust formats, rules, and prize pools. EA is most certainly announcing this series to bring more excitement to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-conquest-update-makes-a-key-change-to-scoring/1100-6536376/" data-ref-id="1100-6536376">Battlefield 6</a> after it brought in millions of players following its October release.</p>

                <p>Gearbox's new content update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> is getting into the holiday spirit by releasing Bounty Pack 1 for free. The first Bounty Pack, How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, is now available on consoles and PC. As the title implies, this is Borderlands' version of a Christmas story as filtered through the lens of the game.</p><p>The DLC allows players to team up with the leader of the Outbounders, Rush, for some holiday cheer by giving "the miserly Minister Screw" a proverbial kick in the butt. The DLC comes alongside new gear and cosmetics, as well as some fresh missions. Gearbox also explained why this update was released for free.</p><p>"As a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, it was important that players receive it by the end of the year," wrote a Gearbox rep. "However, with the continued efforts to improve the Borderlands 4 experience, the team ran out of time to stuff as much mayhem-fueled content into the Bounty Pack 1 stocking as originally planned."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608036-borderlands4howrushsavedmercenaryday.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608036" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608036-borderlands4howrushsavedmercenaryday.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608036"></a><figcaption>Promo art for How Rush Saved Mercenary Day.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608036-borderlands4howrushsavedmercenaryday.jpg"></figure><p>The remaining Bounty Packs are still bundled together as paid DLC, although they are also included in the game's Deluxe Edition, Super Deluxe Edition, and Bounty Pack Bundle owners. Gearbox is also adding a fifth Bounty Pack to the bundle, but details about what's coming with the future Bounty Packs haven't been released. Everyone who purchased the Bounty Pack Bundle or the previously listed editions of the game will receive the fifth Bounty Pack at no additional cost.</p><p>In the middle of December, Gearbox will add another free update that drops Bloomreaper the Invincible into an arena for a face-off against players in the first of series of "invincible boss" fights that are meant to challenge the players. Each boss chosen for the invincible boss fight will get a boost in health, lethal attack damage, and a new set of modifiers that make them even deadlier than before. Players who emerge victorious can earn new Legendaries.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will receive a new story pack in Q1 2026 called Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, which will introduce a new Vault Hunter named C4SH. Gearbox will also debut a free update that adds Takedown mode to the game in 2026.</p><p>During a recent investment call hosted by Gearbox's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, it was disclosed that Borderlands 4 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-came-in-below-take-twos-sales-expectations/1100-6536020/" data-ref-id="1100-6536020">didn't live up to sales expectations</a> even though it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/" data-ref-id="1100-6535624">the biggest launch in franchise history</a> and a debut as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">one of 2025's best-selling games</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tavern Keeper: It's Good]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/tavern-keeper-review-impressions-pc-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tavern-keeper-its-good.1360069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Tavern Keeper</em> is not the first fantasy barkeeping video game, nor will it be the last, but as of this month it's comfortably my favourite.</p><p>It's a management sim that puts you in charge of a series of taverns in a fantasy universe, with a very breezy tone. The goal is to design a floorplan, build some stuff, hire some staff and keep everything running smoothly enough that you can unlock some more, cooler stuff.</p><p>Which is all very management game, but two things about <em>Tavern Keeper</em> stood out for me in particular.</p><p>First, this thing isn't just a management sim, it's a <em>toybox</em>. In addition to a stock roster of objects and decorations you can fill your pubs with, <em>Tavern Keeper</em> also has a surprisingly weighty creation suite that lets you build your own bookshelves, apply your own lighting effects to candles and even create your own paintings to hang on the walls. You can then share anything you build online, as well as download other people's creations, a circle of creating and sharing that could have been a game in its own right.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The biggest challenge when it comes to hiring staff isn't having to pay them. It's having to screen applications from guys like Bilbo, whose only skill is cooking, and whose only perk says he HATES COOKING</span></figcaption></figure><p>These tools take centre stage because <em>Tavern Keeper</em>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/town-to-city-pc-builder-cozy-impressions-review/"> <u>like <em>Town To City</em></u></a>, knows the real pleasure of building something isn't being stressed over everything that could go wrong, it's the joy of building itself, and of being able to enjoy surveying and playing with the thing you've made. The extent to which you can make each pub in this game yours, down to which suit of playing cards is left lying on a dimly-lit table in the back corner (which you lit dimly!) is remarkable. I haven't gone this hard dressing the finer details of a video game sandbox since the last time I played <em>The Sims</em>, and that was a <em>long </em>time ago.</p><p>Despite what the cartoonish visuals and warm fireplaces might suggest, there can be real challenges here, from the expected (keeping floors clean and customers happy) to the Gordon Ramsey-esque, where kitchen staff will break down as they're overwhelmed by food orders for items on the menu you've run out of because you didn't order enough stock and the floors are too dirty oh and also something is on fire, but the key to <em>Tavern Keeper </em>is that you can scale all this stuff to suit your tastes as much as you want. The game has a bunch of sliders you can adjust before starting that can give you everything from the management nightmare described above to a laidback pub creation focus that kneecaps the game's difficulty and pumps your coffers with enough cash to not ever have to worry about money.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tavern Keeper's Design Mode is waaaaaaaaaay more powerful than I was expecting.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The second thing that stood out for me was <em>Tavern Keeper</em>’s humour. This is a deeply funny video game. Not immediately, and not obnoxiously, but get a few minutes into the first tutorial and its quirks start becoming obvious. The writing is funny, sure, in the way that<a href="https://aftermath.site/galacticare-review-impressions-pc-bullfrog-theme-hospital/"> <u>so many management games these days are funny</u></a>, but somehow this entire game is funny, from its menus to its tutorial design. Its jokes have broken containment, and could be anywhere.</p><p>My first few hours with <em>Tavern Keeper</em> felt like playing through an episode of <em>The Eric Andre Show</em>, or a kid's variety program from the 90s that dumped slime on unsuspecting guests, in that anything I clicked on or looked at could have been hiding a gag. The skeleton barkeep who just walked in, he's funny, but you might also laugh at a chest unlock sequence, a character's stats or even an introduction to tooltips. It keeps you on your toes!</p><p><em>Tavern Keeper</em> is still in Early Access, but I'd have given this two thumbs up--the closest I'll ever come to a review score--if I'd been told this was a 1.0 release. It's always fun running a pub, pubs are inherently great, but running a pub that's truly <em>yours</em>, right down to the designs on the cushions and the placement of the silverware, is even better.</p>

<p>After what felt like an age of early access waiting, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> finally arrived as a console exclusive on Switch and Switch 2 back in September. Two months on, and that Switch 2 release has scored a physical edition — what's more, it's a beauty.</p>
<p>We were lucky enough to get our hands on the new box today, and feast our eyes on all of the goodies within (a download code to a digital soundtrack, a 'Character Compendium' booklet, and the full game complete on cart). The nicest surprise of all, however, was the reversible cover art, giving us an option between the standard red banner of a Switch 2 physical, and something more... artsy.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JmOlmniuSog" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJmOlmniuSog" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed624b7cwxjion&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Flipping the cover insert over, you're treated to alternate artwork featuring the game's protagonist, Melinoë, on the front of the box, while a dark and brooding image of Hecate adorns the back.</p>
<p>It's a neat touch, and one that we're sure you'd like to check out for yourselves, so we've assembled the following gallery detailing everything you get in the Hades II Switch 2 physical edition, and a closer look at the all-important art. <em>Enjoy!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Xbox 360, the most successful video game console from Microsoft, turns 20 years old on November 22. Over its lifespan, the console saw over 2,000 games released including some of the industries greatest games of all time. While the original Xbox was Microsoft’s first attempt at a mainstream video game console, the Xbox 360 was the one that put the industry on notice. It sold nearly three-and-a-half times more systems than the first Xbox (~85.73 million(M)), and, according to the latest known numbers, has even outsold the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S combined.</p>



<p>But what games from the 2nd-generation Xbox went on to become major hits? These are the best-selling Xbox 360 games of all time.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-selling-xbox-360-games-ever">Best-Selling Xbox 360 Games Ever</h2>



<p>The global data you’ll find below comes from custom data firm <a href="https://data40.com/articles/best-selling-xbox-360-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Data40</a>, where the provide numbers for the best-selling Xbox 360 games since the system’s launch in 2005. The company says that it’s “<strong>high-load parsers scrape the web and marketing analysts process the data to provide up-to-date information for business.”</strong> That said, some of the information might not be 100% accurate. Should any discrepancies be found or more accurate information arise, this article will be updated and noted.</p>



<p><strong>10. Grand Theft Auto 4</strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Grand Theft Auto IV Trailer 1 &quot;Things Will Be Different&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M80K51DosFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>GTA 4 took players back to Liberty City during one of the most memorable eras in the series. Instead of focusing on wild chaos like earlier games, this one leaned into a more grounded story about Niko Bellic trying to start fresh while getting pulled into one bad situation after another. It felt gritty, personal, and completely different from anything the franchise had done before, which is why so many fans still talk about it today.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales</strong>:</strong> 11.1M</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>9. Halo 3</strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo 3 - First Announcement Trailer  [HD] - E3 2006" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T9Ezd2FqxAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Halo 3 was the Xbox Live game everyone seemed to be playing. The campaign delivered huge set pieces and emotional moments, while multiplayer kept people up late night after night. Forge mode and Theater mode were ahead of their time and gave players tools no other shooter offered. For a lot of fans, Halo 3 represents the peak of the franchise.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 12.13M</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>8. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Call Of Duty- Modern Warfare 2 Official Trailer (Eminem ft Nate Dogg)" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZcsEQPFs_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 arrived with incredible hype and somehow still lived up to it. The campaign had several moments that stuck with players for years, but it was the multiplayer that kept people coming back. Quick scoping battles, chaotic lobbies, and broken loadouts became part of gaming culture. Everyone who played during that era has at least one Modern Warfare 2 story. And most of them, unsurprisingly, involve the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7vBol8wud0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">most controversial and infamous mission</a> in franchise history.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 13.49M</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>7. The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Skyrim was one of those games you picked up for a quick session and suddenly realized hours had gone by. With dragons flying overhead and a world full of caves, towns, and secrets, every playthrough felt different. Even on Xbox 360, players found creative ways to explore, break, or completely reinvent the game. Almost everyone who touched Skyrim has a unique tale about their time in it.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 13.7M</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>6. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Official Reveal Trailer | Call of Duty: Black Ops 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3tedlWs1XY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 changed things up by jumping into a near future setting and giving players choices that affected the campaign. It also delivered some of the most memorable multiplayer the series has ever had. The maps were tight, the pacing was fast, and the competitive scene was extremely active. Zombies mode continued to grow here and became a nightly ritual for many groups of friends.</p>



<p><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong> 13.7M</p>

<p><strong>5. Call of Duty: Black Ops</strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OPTOVQFRggI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The original Call of Duty: Black Ops put players into a Cold War spy thriller with a style that set it apart from other entries in the series. The campaign introduced characters that fans still quote and reference today. Multiplayer became a massive hit thanks to iconic maps and a progression system that kept players hooked. Zombies mode became a lasting obsession for entire friend groups.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 14.55M</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>4. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Reveal Trailer | Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/coiTJbr9m04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 wrapped up the original Modern Warfare storyline with nonstop action and a campaign that kept the pressure high from beginning to end. Multiplayer continued to dominate Xbox Live with fast matches and an enormous amount of customization. Whether players preferred MW2 or MW3, almost everyone spent time in this one when it launched.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 14.72M</p>

<p><strong>3. Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Minecraft on Xbox 360 brought the world of crafting and block building to console players in the best way possible. It quickly became a favorite for families and groups of friends thanks to its simple controls and endless possibilities. To add to it, it allowed friends to play online together in an easier way than the original PC version. Many players who grew up during the 360 era still think of this version as their first real introduction to Minecraft. Fast-forward years later, and Minecraft is the most successful video game of all time with over 350 million copies sold across all platforms.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 21M</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>2. Grand Theft Auto 5</strong></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>GTA 5 launched on the Xbox 360 in September 2013 and immediately became one a top-selling game. The three-character structure felt fresh, and the world of Los Santos was filled with detail and personality. Even after finishing the story, players kept coming back to explore, find secrets, and try new things. The early days of GTA Online also started here, giving the game a long life on the console. As of October 2025, global sales of the game have hit 220M, putting it behind only Minecraft.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 22.95M</p>

<p><strong>1. Kinect Adventures</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Kinect Adventures was bundled with the Kinect, which meant almost every Kinect owner tried it at some point. It offered simple but energetic minigames that got people moving and laughing, and it was one of the few games that actually showed what the Kinect could do. It worked well for families and parties and became a surprisingly memorable part of the Xbox 360 era.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 24M</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-aim-assist-strength-will-be-increased-soon.1360036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new video uploaded on social media, Treyarch revealed that Black Ops 7’s aim assist strength will be ‘increased over range’ very soon. This follows a period of monitoring based on community feedback that stressed that the aim assist felt too loose compared to previous games.</p>



<p>This is in addition to a bunch of other tweaks coming in, such as a reduction in the efficacy of the Drone Pod field upgrade, damage tuning for Hardcore modes, and an increase in the visible range of the minimap in multiplayer.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-s-spongy-aim-assist-is-being-adjusted">Black Ops 7’s Spongy Aim Assist is Being Adjusted</h2>



<p>In the clip uploaded earlier today on social media, Treyarch confirmed that aim assist is being adjusted soon:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Aim assist is a big conversation out there; we have been closely monitoring that conversation, and of course, looking at our internal data. We’re fairly happy with where we’re at, but we will be making some very nuanced changes and slightly increasing aim assist strength over range ahead of season one.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team will also perform some fine-tuning of spawns, adjusting spawn logic ‘across the board’ and attacking points of contention on particular maps that have less-than-desirable spawns in certain game modes, including Hardpoint.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Our first post-launch Dev Talk is here with a lot to cover:</p><p>✅ Unlocking Endgame<br>✅ Weapon balancing<br>✅ Aim Assist update<br>✅ Spawn tuning<br>✅ Equipment buffs<br>✅ Drone Pod nerfs<br>✅ Mini-Map range increase<br>✅ Zombies boss fight nerfs<br>✅ Relic updates<br>✅ Cursed in Survival?<br>+ more <a href="https://t.co/Qoc6UOoR1U">pic.twitter.com/Qoc6UOoR1U</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1991582585005437374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Black Ops 7’s aim assist came under fire at launch, even from some of the most capable Call of Duty League pro players. It was dubbed ‘insane and not in a good way’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-no-aim-assist-cod-world-champ/">by Shotzzy</a>, potentially the winningest Call of Duty player in the world right now.</p>



<p>All this is lumped into some major changes, such as Activision’s teams unlocking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-available-campaign-2025/">the ‘Endgame’ mode</a>, which exists at the end of Black Ops 7’s campaign, and making it available universally. This means you no longer need to complete the campaign to access it.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 hasn’t had a terrible launch, but it’s certainly struggling against some tough competition in Battlefield 6, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-breaks-franchise-sales-record/">best-selling shooter in years</a>, and ARC Raiders, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/">most successful extraction shooter</a> ever.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Treyarch has released its first post-launch <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991582585005437374" rel="nofollow ">Dev Talk video</a> to reveal some major changes the studio is preparing for the launch of Season 1 next month. This discusses the community feedback regarding Black Ops 7's aim-assist, weapon balancing, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7's assault rifles feel really powerful in multiplayer, while most of the guns in the submachine class have struggled to feel viable. Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce confirms that a buff is coming across the entire submachine gun class. Scronce says no plans are made for adjustments to the marksman rifles or snipers, but the team is monitoring the data.</p><p dir="ltr">"The overall goal with those weapons in Black Ops 7 is that they are a bit more present without being too dominant," Scronce says.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8JKDfXT1pg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f8JKDfXT1pg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The developer is also aware of the community debate around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-aim-assist-changes-are-inspiring-lots-of-debate-and-discussion/1100-6536208/">Black Ops 7's aim assist</a>, which features reduced rotational aim-assist compared to recent Call of Duty games. "We have been closely monitoring that conversation and looking at our internal data," Scronce says. The developer also reveals the studio is "fairly happy" with where the game's aim-assist is at, but there will be a slight increase to aim-assist strength at range. This change will arrive sometime ahead of the Season 1 update.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Treyarch's planned update includes spawn adjustments for Hardpoint, Free-For-All, and Team Deathmatch modes. A nerf is also coming for the game's overpowered Drone Pod field upgrade.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer announced that Endgame mode, which players can unlock after completing the campaign, will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-endgame-will-soon-be-playable-for-everyone-right-away/1100-6536359/">available to everyone</a> starting on November 21. Players who unlocked Endgame naturally by beating the campaign will receive a variety of rewards, including XP tokens, GobbleGums, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">For Zombies changes, Treyarch design director Kevin Drew discusses the difficulty level of the boss fight for Ashes of the Damned. The developer says it was designed to be challenging, but it is more difficult than intended. Adjustments will be made to the barnacle spawns needed to help Ol' Tessie, so players can spend less time repairing the Wonder Vehicle and more time driving. The developer says it's slowing down the speed boss's missile barrage attack.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-nuketown-2025-map-goes-live-tomorrow-see-it-in-action-now/1100-6536356/">Nuketown arrived to Black Ops 7 today</a>, and this is a new 2025 variant of Treyarch's classic map. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-season-1-content-new-maps-and-holiday-events-confirmed/1100-6535666/">Season 1 of Black Ops 7</a> begins in December, which will add the game's first battle pass, Warzone integration, additional maps, and more.</p>

                <p>You'll need to take a trip to the Spaceport map to complete the A Lay of the Land quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. This quest tasks you with finding multiple items in a single trip to the map, so you'll want to come prepared to make a long trek and survive for quite some time. Let's take a look at everything you'll need to do to get this quest wrapped up.</p><p>Knowing that you'll have a lot of traveling and surviving to do on Spaceport for the A Lay of the Land quest, we'd recommend you bring guns you're comfortable with, as well as plenty of healing items. Additionally, it's a great idea to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket, as you'll need to extract with a specific item to complete the quest back in Speranza.</p><p>When you're ready to head out and begin A Lay of the Land, follow the guide below.</p><h2>Where to find the shipping notes in the foreman's office</h2><p>The first objective requires you to collect some shipping notes in the foreman's office at the Jiangsu Warehouse. This POI is located on the northwestern side of the Spaceport map. It's not usually a very busy spot, but keep your eyes open for nearby raiders nonetheless.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606895" data-ratio="0.56039807824296" data-width="2914" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606895"></a><figcaption>Jiangsu Warehouse location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg"></figure><p>Once inside, you'll notice there's really not much to this warehouse.

			<p>Today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox Partner Preview event</a> showcased 16 games and announcements, one of them being a new trailer for IO Interactive's upcoming James Bond game, 007 First Light. Though it wasn't a huge new showcase of gameplay, a deep dive into the game's mechanics, or even a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, it did highlight a key element of any James Bond video game: the car that Bond drives.</p>



<p>The short, fifty-second trailer shows off Bond's Aston Martin Valhalla, a stunning car even without all of the special agent gadgetry that Q details in his narration of the trailer.</p>



<p>"<em>Inspired by the groundbreaking Aston Martin Valkyrie and infused with advanced Formula 1 technologies, the Valhalla showcases aerodynamic mastery, race-derived engineering, and exquisite craftsmanship</em>," writes IO Interactive senior global communications manager, Yann Roskell,<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/007-first-light-xbox-partner-preview/"> in an Xbox Wire post</a>. "<em>Limited to just 999 units worldwide, this supercar sets the standard for automotive innovation, showcasing unparalleled speed and precision.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Okay, perhaps it would have been better to get a deeper look at gameplay or some more insight into how the game was made, <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">similar to what we saw in September</a> during a State of Play presentation. But a James Bond game will live and die by how well it truly captures the allure of the character that has captivated fans for decades.</p>



<p>Bond's taste for gadgets, clothes, and of course, cars, are all mixed in with that allure, so it makes sense that IO Interactive would put something like this together to further display how it is trying to capture the essence of James Bond.</p>



<p>That said, hopefully we don't have to go too long before getting a more detailed dive into what we can expect from the game ahead of its release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 27, 2026.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-brings-simplified-ttrpg-combat-to-forgotten</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm a big fan of <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>,</em> and when I can't find the time to get a group of friends together, I'm always down to try different experiences that seek to recreate the experience. The latest of these is <em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</em>. A tabletop experience where abilities are replaced by cards as you go dungeon crawling through the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9cb3f917-f831-4c81-8cb8-54e040b09040" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-heroes-of-faerun-and-adventures-in-faerun-review" rel="nofollow">Forgotten Realms</a>, but where does it successfully recreate the experience, and where does it falter?</p>

<p><em>Battlemarked </em>is, as the name would suggest, a new title in the <em>Demeo </em>series of turn-based RPGs that leans into recreating the feeling of moving miniatures around a board and taking on waves of enemies as you dive deeper into interesting dungeons. This time around, the game has received a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> coat of paint with character classes reflecting those from the TTRPG, cards of popular abilities and spells, and the campaigns are now set in the Forgotten Realms.</p>

<p>At launch, the game will release with two Campaigns, <em>Embers of Chaos</em> and <em>Crown of Frost</em>. In my time previewing the game, I dove into Embers of Chaos. Here, the surrounding areas of Neverwinter are in turmoil, and stress is rising between groups of humans and elves as strange attacks are on the rise.</p>

While there's certainly a number of name drops and references, it's still very clear this is a combat and tactics forward game, and not as much into building any kind of vast story.</p>

<p>There's no worry with not creating that experience, it's just good to make sure you don't go in expecting that.</p>

<h2><em>Battlemarked </em>Gameplay Works Like A Board Game</h2>

<p><em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked </em>leans heavily into the turn-based combat and simplified action economy of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Starting a new area, your party will appear on the edge of the map, and you'll move them one by one, each character being able to take two actions per turn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-character.jpg?itok=4oVOoAe2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-character.jpg?itok=ywP2egoe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You can move, make a simple attack, or use any of the different items or ability cards at your disposal. With <em>Battlemarked</em>, all of the cards have a <em>D&amp;D</em> theme with simple tweaks like Fire Arrows, as well as Lay on Hands and Blinkstrike. Your hand is limited to 10 cards, but as you take out enemies, you'll slowly earn more cards. It's pretty unlikely you'll ever run out.</p>

<p>This action economy did take me a bit to work out, because moving took an action, but using an attack ability could also move you and let you do an attack. Trying to keep the party together, but also dealing damage efficiently was a bit of a puzzle in itself (and one that I definitely lost a few times.)</p>

<p>When you are ready to attack an opponent, you'll be presented with a die to roll. While it is a D20, the dice you roll is made up of a skull for a miss, a single sword for hit, and two swords for a Critical hit. I'm someone who likes seeing high numbers on dice, so it wasn't as appealing to see the attack dice symbol-based, but it definitely speeds up the game. What was incredibly satisfying in the diorama world of the game is that rolling the dice is physics-based, letting you grab and throw the dice, and watching it bounce all over the terrain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-virtual-reality.jpg?itok=ia-Ep-V4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-virtual-reality.jpg?itok=8f2yNEWL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Playing on my PC was fun, but Battlemarked is way more engaging in the VR mode</figcaption></figure><p>There are skill checks where you use a D20, these pop up during conversation or when you stumble across random events in a map, that do rely on your character stats. For the most part, you'll be rolling the Attack Dice though.</p>

<p><em>Battlemarked </em>really has the visuals of <em>Dungons &amp; Dragons</em> down, as someone who plays (way too much) D&amp;D, though it felt like a lot of these systems were a bit too simplified for me. You have a good chance to hit, but you won't always, and your characters' attack stats are all static. It would have been awesome to see some varying damage stats to create more scenarios where you'd go for a risky attack to hope for a high damage roll to finish off an enemy.</p>

<h2>Randomization &amp; Replayability</h2>

<p>When combat is a bit too tough and you fall in battle, you'll get to restart from the beginning of the floor, but the enemies present and their locations will be randomized. This is a fun addition, meaning that no matter how much the environment you move through might be the same, the progression of combat will always be different.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-combat.jpg?itok=7wc3YswB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-combat.jpg?itok=FIHBmyfy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There's further replayability to be had in the game in playing with different people, what class you choose, and how you choose to upgrade your character. Do you prefer that your Paladin takes less damage on low health, or that there is less chance for Poison damage?</p>

<h2><em>Battlemarked </em>Offers A <em>D&amp;D</em>-lite Combat Experience</h2>

<p>From my time with <em>Battlemarked </em>so far, I've enjoyed the story as it has been laid out, and the visual experience perfectly demonstrates a high-quality game with terrain and miniatures.</p>

<p>I do wish that the combat wasn't so dialed back, but there is a lot of replayability in the layout of enemies in a dungeon and how you best use the cards available to you. With how every part of the game is static numbers and grid-based movement, even when not in active combat, the experience honestly felt closer to my recent experiences with HeroQuest.</p>

<p>If you're interested in getting online with friends and throwing some dice in a strategic setting,&nbsp;<em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</em> is a fun experience, even more so with the different references that you'll run into. If the simplified combat or very light storytelling isn't for you, then you might need to seek your adventure elsewhere.</p>
