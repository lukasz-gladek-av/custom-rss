<p>According to a recent report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Tom Warren’s sources have claimed that Bethesda “has been targeting an April 2025 release for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5”. However, this release window might change depending on how the development goes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reports</a> about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle coming to PS5 have surfaced for some time. It surprised many when the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced</a> a PS5 port for the title at Gamescom’s opening night live yesterday. As per the official announcement, the upcoming first-person adventure will be released on the PlayStation 5 in the Spring of 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, MachineGames provided some new information about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at Gamescom last night. There will be a bunch of puzzles for players to overcome, from “mysteriously locked chambers, complex ancient mechanisms, and ritualistic sequences of challenges to understand and solve.” Skill trees aren’t traditional; players must find ‘Skill Books’ worldwide to learn new skills.</p>

<p>Details about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s exploration were revealed, explaining how the game has a linear storyline and narrative-driven sequences. Still, players will also find much more open areas for exploration. Additional tools for Indy were revealed, too, along with The Whip. These include the Camera, Journal, Lighter and the Rest. The Rest refers to tools that players can find across the world.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lego-super-mario-mario-kart-sets-announced-for-january-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/aboutus/news/2024/august/lego-super-mario-kart-sets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, LEGO officially announced that multiple new LEGO Super Mario: Mario Kart sets will release on January 1, 2025.</p>



<p>The upcoming sets include Yoshi Bike, Standard Kart, Donkey Kong &amp; DK Jumbo, Baby Mario vs. Baby Luigi, Toad’s Garage, and the Baby Peach &amp; Grand Prix Set.</p>



<p>Today’s blog adds that fans can use separate LEGO Mario, Luigi, or Peach figures to the new sets for more interactive features. These include “audio and visual effects for race-starting, horn-honking, kart-drifting and gliding sounds from the game.”</p>



<p>It also reveals that “players can also use these characters to scan Item Boxes, allowing them to collect extra coins and help boost their score as they finish the race.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Baby Peach &amp; Grand Prix will be the largest set with 823 pieces and a price tag of $79.99. The smallest set will be Yoshi Bike, featuring just 133 pieces and costing $14.99. So, there’s a decent range of options among the six sets.</p>



<p>LEGO Design Director Simon Kent teased sets that “provide an immersive building experience and capture the heart-pounding action of the beloved video game series.”</p>



<p>The upcoming Mario Kart-themed sets also arrive shortly after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-super-mario-world-shadow-the-hedgehog-sets-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Super Mario World set</a>, which will launch in October 2024. </p>



<p>In addition to LEGO Mario Kart sets, the new blog also teased three new LEGO Animal Crossing sets. Those include Stargazing with Celeste, Leif’s Caravan &amp; Garden Shop, and Able Sisters Clothing Shop.</p>

                <p>At Gamescom this week, Fable creator Peter Molyneux revealed his next game--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-debuts-new-god-game-masters-of-albion/1100-6525994/" data-ref-id="1100-6525994">Masters of Albion</a>--and he now says it could be his last. In an interview, Molyneux said he expects to be in his late '60s when Masters of Albion is done, and if he were to make another game, he would be in his mid-70s.</p><p>Molyneux told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/masters-of-albion-is-peter-molyneuxs-final-shot-at-redemption-probably" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> he's not guaranteed to live that long. "My life expectancy is measured in days rather than years because of my lifestyle. I smoke and drink and don't sleep enough," he said. "So if this is going to be my last game, what should it be? And the first thing that occurred to me is that I wanted to go home. I wanted to come back to PC and console, and make a game for gamers."</p><p>Molyneux runs the independent studio 22cans, which created mobile games like The Trail and Godus. He said he "got disillusioned with mobile," in part because of how mobile game development requires developers to stick to a specific formula to make money, according to Molyneux.</p><p>"I started to ask… what should I focus on? I was 60 at the time and this realization came to me that this next game could be my last. I am not announcing I'm retiring. I'll be found dead one morning with my head pressed against the keyboard," he said.</p><p>In a separate interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-a-new-spin-on-fables-world-from-its-original-creator-gamescom-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Molyneux talked about how he's able to use Albion in his game, saying it's in reference to a historical term for Great Britain. It is not, as Molyneux sees it, owned by Microsoft via the Fable series.</p><p>"[It's] like saying if you set a game in America, you can't set any other game in America," he said. "So Albion can't be copyrighted. It's the name for England and Wales and that's how we get away with it."</p><p>Molyneux went on to say he honestly doesn't know if Albion can be trademarked. "I mean you would think that the responsible person I should be, I would've spent the last six months in lawyers' offices," he said.</p><p>Microsoft owns the Fable series, and the company previously granted the rights to Flaming Fowl Studios for its CCG Fable Fortune years ago (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-fortune-the-card-collecting-spin-off-of-the-/1100-6473416/" data-ref-id="1100-6473416">the game has since shut down</a>).</p><p>If there are legal consequences, that will come in time. For now, Molyneux said he's excited about Masters of Albion because it "extends and expands" the worlds he made in the Fable series.</p><p>"But it's not actually Fable 5 or anything like that," he said. "If you've played Fable, then definitely Masters of Albion will be familiar to you. One of the things that we have got and we absolutely wanted a nail was the humour. I think in the Fable games, it's not so much about telling jokes, it's more about giving you, the player, the ability to do ridiculous and funny things. And we've got that in Masters of Albion in absolute spades. I think we’re really nailing that."</p><p>In a different interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/masters-of-albion/peter-molyneux-new-strategy-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, Molyneux addressed his history of overpromising and underdelivering. He said he is "so, so, so sorry" about how he has "sold games by overpromising" and discussing features that didn't exist as if they did. "I apologize to anyone that got excited and got disappointed," he said.</p><p>"I'm really sincerely sorry to those people. I wasn't doing it because I had a plan. I was doing it out of ignorance really, and now I'm really obsessive about only talking about things I can show," he said.</p><p>Molyneux and 22cans also generated controversy over the game Curiosity: What's inside the Cube? The winner was promised a "life-changing" reward but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-god-who-peter-molyneux-forgot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ended up receiving nothing.</a></p>

            <p>The Tomb Raider animated series will be making its debut on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> later this year. The show is set to follow on from the events of the rebooted Survivor trilogy, which those who have played the games will know saw Lara Croft lose more than one friend (in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rhianna-pratchetts-stories-from-the-tomb-raider-reboot">Rhianna Pratchett admitted to me the first game in the series became a "cavalcade of death"</a>).</p>
<p>Now, speaking with <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-showrunner-tasha-huo-interview/">Nerdist</a>, the Tomb Raider series' showrunner Tasha Huo said Lara will deal with the resulting grief in the first season of The Legend of Lara Croft, so she can finally "start working on other shit".</p>

<p>"This series... really acts as a bridge between the origin story to the Lara that we fell in love with in the '90s, when we first started picking up the games," Huo told the publication. "That Lara was very quippy, very confident."</p>
<p>The showrunner therefore wanted to explore how Lara became that more self-assured version of the series' leading lady, and a TV show was a great medium to do just that. "I think what we got in the Survivor game series was so much humanity from her that was very moving to me as a player, and surprising given the colder Lara that we met in the original series," Huo said. "So for me, it was really cool to be able to explore the more vulnerable aspects of her while still maintaining the strong superhero figure that she is."</p>
<p>Huo furthered: "Lara has been burdened with grief since the '90s, but I feel like she's never fully gotten over it. And I wanted to move past it, to be honest, so that she could start working on other things, but it felt like we still had to address it."</p>
<p>"So in this first season, she is dealing with grief and we watch her power through to figure out how to become her best self after that so Lara can start working on other shit."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-warps-bethesdas-final-frontier-into-full-on-horror<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Space can be a lot of things: beautiful, awe-inspiring, full of hope for mankind's future. But it can also be the setting for some truly spine-chilling horror - and that's what <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s upcoming Shattered Space DLC will focus on. It places the base game's creepy House Va'ruun faction - a cult who worship a deity called the Great Serpent - centre stage. (Taking a wild guess, this is probably not going to be one for people who don't like big snakes.)</p>
<p>Shattered Space will see you travelling to the House Va'ruun's homeworld, which has been designed specially to tell the DLC's story. This means, if you decide to venture back out into the stars, you'll be able to return to the DLC whenever you like and pick up the storyline where you left off.</p>
<p>But where does the name Shattered Space come in? Well, as we found out during a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom 2024</a> showfloor presentation this morning, if Starfield's main campaign is about the pursuit of knowledge, then Shattered Space is about the knowledge you should really shut away in a box and never touch.

<p>
  Upon arriving at Dazra, House Va'ruun's capital city, you'll discover that much of it has been lost to a vortex. Space has literally shattered, leaving the citizens searching for survivors and the minor houses who make up their society fighting for control. There's even worries that the Va'ruun Zealots are trying to use the chaos to re-establish their own house...</p>
<p>You'll quickly find yourself caught up in the politics of House Va'ruun. Yet, if you decide to journey across the planet, you'll discover that the vortex's effects aren't just confined to the city's borders. Creatures are emerging from the other side of the vortex and they're certainly not happy to be on an unfamiliar planet. Not to forget about the planet's terrain itself which includes gravity anomalies.</p>
<p>The vibes here are pure space horror - to an extent the base Starfield never really touched upon. And it's interesting, especially off the back of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-gets-release-date">last night's look at the game's sporty new space buggy</a>, to see Bethesda trying different things. There, it was a pitch for the game to be a sort of space-set Forza-inspired off-road romp, with the REV-8 - Starfield's first land vehicle - now available for free. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-review">Starfield didn't land perfectly</a> - but perhaps it can become, as Skyrim has through its modding scene, a staging ground for all manner of other things. Including giant space snake horror. Shattered Space will be released on 30th September for PC and Xbox Series X/S.

            <p>Lego has revealed six - six! - new Mario Kart sets are on the way. This marks the very first time Mario's racer will be immortalised in brick form.</p>
<p>Launching on New Year's Day 2025, Lego says "each set has been designed to ensure that anyone can enjoy the joy of the Super Mario universe" and includes interactive elements such as audio and visual effects.</p>

<p>The new sets - which were announced at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> - feature some of Mario Kart's best-known characters: Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Toad, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, and Baby Peach.</p>
<p>Lego Mario, Luigi, and Peach figures are not included and must be purchased separately.</p>
<p>The six sets feature a Yoshi Bike, a Standard Kart, Donkey Kong and DK Jumbo, Baby Mario vs. Baby Luigi, and Toad's Garage, respectively. They range from 133 pieces to 390.</p>
<p>Baby Peach and the Grand Prix set is the biggest set, featuring 823 pieces so you can build your very own starting gate. It also includes Lemmy in the Landship kart and Toad on the standard bike.</p>
<p>Also announced at Gamescom were three new Lego Animal Crossing sets: Stargazing with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a>, Leif's Caravan and Garden Shop, and Able Sisters Clothing Shop. These sets will also go on sale from 1st January, 2025.</p>
<p>These are not the only Mario-flavoured Lego sets on the way, of course. Last month, Lego revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-super-mario-yoshi-pixel-art-set-revealed">2D-style Super Mario World set featuring Mario and Yoshi</a>. The set will reportedly launch on 1st October and feature 1215 pieces.</p>
<p>The set is the latest entry into Lego's adult-orientated Super Mario range, following earlier impressive sets such as the fold-out ? Block and Bowser statue.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has closed its investigation into Apple's in-app payment system "on the grounds of administrative priority".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66c5991067dbaeb97a13e513/Case_closure_statement.pdf">statement</a> posted to the gov.uk website, the CMA said it no longer considered the investigation a priority but stressed that the case's closure "does not constitute a decision by the CMA".</p>

<p>"The CMA will continue to monitor Apple's conduct in the market. Its decision to close the case on grounds of administrative priority does not prevent, pre-judge or fetter the CMA's ability, if appropriate, to open an investigation [...] in [the] future, or to take action in respect of the conduct considered as part of the investigation".</p>
<p>The statement comes over three years after the CMA commenced an investigation into the distribution of apps on iOS in the UK and a market study into "mobile ecosystems".</p>
<p>The final report, which was released in June 2022, "identified a number of potential harms from Apple's requirements on certain developers to use their proprietary payment system to process in-app purchases for digital content, which could be avoided if app developers were able to choose their own payments service providers and transact directly with users".</p>
<p>After assessing a continuation of the investigation, the CMA said as it generally prioritises cases by the strategic significance of its work, it was conscious that this is "a fast-moving area" and any enforcement under the UK's Competition Act would "potentially take a significant period of time". It also noted that it will soon also have the option to consider firms' conduct in digital markets under the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act (DMCC) 2024, which would allow it to address issues "in a more timely, holistic, and flexible manner".</p>
<p>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">said he has "no regrets"</a> over his company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">decision to break Apple and Google's terms of service back in August 2020</a> - something that saw the hugely popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> booted off both iPhone and Android storefronts.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-refers-apple-to-the-european-commission-after-dispute-over-button-design">Epic referred Apple to the European Commission</a> for rejecting its notarisation submission, alleging Apple's refusal is "arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA)".</p>
<p>The following day, Epic Games updated its statement to confirm that Apple has now accepted its submission, but did not reveal if it had rescinded its call for the European Commission to investigate its "concerns" at that time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225133/samsung-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-glasses-free-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Samsung has announced a new Odyssey gaming monitor lineup at gamescom that uses eye-tracking technology to convert 2D visuals into glasses-free 3D. The Odyssey 3D is set for a global release “within this year” <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-unveils-groundbreaking-glasses-free-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-at-gamescom-2024">according to Samsung</a>, and will allow users to “seamlessly switch between 2D and 3D modes” based on preference — which may tempt folks who are curious about 3D gaming, but apprehensive to commit.</p><p>The Odyssey 3D is Samsung’s first 3D gaming monitor, having first <a href="https://www.ces.tech/innovation-awards/honorees/2024/best-of/s/samsung-light-field-display.aspx">teased a concept display at CES</a> earlier this year. It’ll be available in 27- or 37-inch sizes and features a 4K QLED panel with a 165Hz refresh rate, alongside a 1-millisecond response time and support for AMD FreeSync. Both monitors also include a single DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.1 ports for connectivity, and a tilting, height-adjustable stand to ensure you can best position it to experience 3D content.</p><p>The glasses-free 3D is achieved by combining a lenticular lens — specialized hardware that can direct different images to each eye — with a built-in eye tracking camera, and view mapping to continuously adjust for depth perception. Acer uses a similar system in its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22451850/acer-spatiallabs-3d-content-rendering-conceptd-7-pro">SpatialLabs laptops and monitors</a>. The resulting Stereoscopic 3D can only be viewed by one person at a time, but that’s hardly an issue for gamers, and my own experiences with the technology have left a good impression: it’s really fun to see things jumping out at you without having to wear special glasses.</p><p>One thing that’s missing is the price. We’ve reached out to Samsung to see if pricing information is available, but if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723345/acer-conceptd-7-spatiallabs-edition-laptop-features-specs-display-design">Acer’s products</a> (and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23757776/samsung-qd-oled-odyssey-g9-curved-gaming-monitor-price-release-date">historical pricing on Samsung’s Odyssey lineup</a>) are any indication, the Odyssey 3D offerings won’t come cheap.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for.959364/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The first thing that jumped out to me as I began Monster Hunter Wilds’ introductory mission was how quickly I got invested in its story now that both my character and my Palico companion had voice acting of their own. The second thing, sadly, was how poorly this early preview build ran once I took control. Wilds is exceptionally exciting to me, recapturing what I love about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/25/monster-hunter-world-review">Monster Hunter World</a> while learning from the joy that came from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-rise-review">Monster Hunter Rise</a>’s enhanced mobility, finding a balance of both that felt great across the handful of missions I tried. It’s unfortunate that its rough, in-development performance put a little bit of a damper on my demo time, but if Capcom can sort those issues out by launch next year, Wilds could be exactly what I was dreaming of from the next Monster Hunter.</p><p>What’s immediately clear is that Wilds has continued to put a priority on smoothing out some of the traditionally rougher edges of this series. For instance, rideable monster mounts make a return after first being introduced as an automated option in World’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/04/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review">Iceborne</a> expansion and then expanded into full control in Rise. This iteration leans more toward the latter, defaulting to follow a target but allowing you to take the reins directly anytime. Your dino-bird, called a Seikret, can scamper across special paths, glide, and give you time to use or collect items, which makes travel engaging in a way that feels less artificial than Rise’s Spiribird busywork.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But it’s not just a matter of convenience, as your mount also stores a second weapon option that you can swap to while riding. As a lifelong Insect Glaive main, this didn’t really appeal to me at first… until I realized that you can also use ranged weapons like Bowguns <em>while </em>mounted. That fully recontextualized this system, letting me pepper a retreating monster with bullets while my Seikret automatically chased it down, then swap back to my Glaive when it was time to hop off. I guess we’re all learning ranged weapons now, and I am very okay with that added flexibility.</p><p>I can only really speak to my experience with the Insect Glaive when it comes to how weapons have changed, but I was surprised by the adjustments I saw there – most of which seem to be in service of the new Focus Mode option that lets you more precisely aim your attacks at specific monster parts and special weak points. I found myself with a lot more options to sidestep or make micro-adjustments while attacking, with seemingly fewer combos that would end with a move that killed my momentum and more opportunities to really control how I was laying down the hurt. Again, I didn’t play enough to have the clearest sense of that shift just yet, but it feels like that Rise philosophy of speeding up some of the clunkier parts of combat is alive and well, even if you aren’t flying around on a Wirebug this time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wilds has continued to put a priority on smoothing out rough edges.</p></div><p>And if you’ll indulge some Glaive-specific gushing, there are two <em>massive</em> changes that radically changed the combat pattern I was used to. First, landing your aerial attack no longer bounces you back into the air for a chain of helicopter-blade slicing, which was admittedly a huge drag to discover. But the loss of that goofy fun is at least partly made up for by more convenience tweaks, as hitting a weak point with a special Focus Strike move will not only deal tons of damage, it also immediately collects all three Kinsect essences at once, massively speeding up that process in the mid-to-late part of a hunt. (Your aiming reticle now also has a helpful indicator that tells you which essence the monster part you are aiming will provide, and managing that system feels like less of a hassle all around.) </p><p>Even in my short playtime, I saw so many little examples of things like this – stuff that doesn’t undermine the challenge and deliberate pace that makes Monster Hunter what it is but <em>does </em>make the experience that much smoother. There’s a quick option to use whatever recovery items you have that will minimize waste, your hook can grab most items from afar (even while mounted), collecting at gathering points moves just a bit quicker, you can finally pick up bomb barrels after placing them, and firing an SOS flare will even fill your team with AI hunters if you’re offline or until real people online are able to join. It’s a laundry list of tweaks that aren’t necessarily revolutionary, but all make so much sense you wonder why it wasn’t like this before.</p><p>Of course, the big, buggy Gammoth in the room is how it all ran. I am willing to give Capcom the benefit of the doubt to a pretty substantial degree here given Wilds doesn’t even have a release date beyond “2025” yet – there is presumably a lot of time left to polish things up – but it’s still worth mentioning that this demo ran badly. Like, <em>really distractingly badly. </em>During busy moments, the framerate dropped to a degree that almost made it hard to play, and the group I was playing with saw multiple hard crashes. Again, this in-development build is by no means the final version of Wilds, but it is the version Capcom chose to show us, and I can’t help but be just a <em>touch </em>concerned that maybe that’s an indication that, at best, Wilds might drop later in 2025 than I was expecting, or at worst, that Capcom bit off a little more than it will ultimately be able to chew.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds gamescom ONL Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>That’s partly because the ambitious scope here is truly impressive, seemingly hoping to keep hunters out in the field longer. Rather than kicking you back to town after a successful hunt, the second mission I did was structured more like Iceborne’s Guiding Lands, where you could stick around after to explore or immediately take on a new one, with world events and other dynamic things coming and going around you. Rather than starting from a single tent, there was even a surprisingly large outpost on the map I saw, complete with NPCs to talk to. I didn’t really get to see much of this side of Wilds in my demo, but it could add up to a very different feel between fights. </p><p>From what I did see, Wilds is shaping up to be pretty much what I hoped for: a Monster Hunter that embraces the parts of Rise that made it so much more inviting, but also doesn’t shy away from the larger scale and spectacle that helped make World the more enduring entry for me. It’s hard to tell exactly which way that needle will point after just a few missions (or if these structural changes will swing it somewhere else entirely), but I certainly can’t wait to play more so I can find out. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TomRMarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

However, Towerborne is now a ‘limited time exclusive on Steam,’ according to a new trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>What that means is Towerborne begins Steam Early Access on September 10. In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/20/towerborne-why-early-access-and-a-focus-on-fun-means-a-better-game-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft said an Xbox Game Preview release will follow, with a full, now free-to-play launch planned for 2025. Towerborne will also include cross-progression, so your progress will carry over to whichever platform you prefer to play on.</p><p>Explaining the decision to go with an early access launch, game director Daniel McLaren pointed to the successful Kickstarter that got The Banner Saga off the ground.</p><p>“Stoic’s history has always been about interacting with our players, and Kickstarter is the promise of something,” McLaren said. “For Stoic, that worked out very well, and now we’re able to say hey, you don’t have to wait for us this time, we can give you a game right now.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Xbox, PC, and Xbox Game Pass players will immediately feel the benefit of the refinement Towerborne will undergo during the early access period and beyond.</p></div><p>Microsoft said that as a result of the Steam early access launch, “Xbox, PC, and Xbox Game Pass players will immediately feel the benefit of the refinement Towerborne will undergo during the early access period and beyond.”</p><p>It’s fair to say the announcement of Towerborne Steam first launch and full launch in 2025 has sparked a vociferous discussion among Xbox fans. While some are saying they’re fine with the release strategy, others are pointing to the fact Microsoft has for years marketed Towerborne as a Microsoft-published Xbox game and now it’s set to launch on Steam first, disappointing yet again what’s left of the company’s core console audience.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/towerborne-1724236339356.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Towerborne.

While Microsoft executives continue to stress the importance of consoles to Xbox, and indeed have promised next-generation consoles and heavily teased an Xbox handheld for the future, the overall strategy is clear to see. All this at a time when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">Microsoft cut an eye-watering 1,900 staff from its gaming business this year</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">shuttered a number of studios</a> amid plummeting sales of Xbox Series X and S.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>'s director Hiroshi Takai has said it's "possible" and "probably even likely" that future series entries will launch day one on PC, rather than further down the road from their console counterparts.</p>
<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-16-confirms-september-pc-release-date-director-says-its-possible-probably-even-likely-future-final-fantasy-games-launch-day-1-on-pc/">GamesRadar+</a>, Takai spoke about Final Fantasy 16's upcoming PC debut, and the time between its arrival and the PS5 release. Final Fantasy 16 first released as a PlayStation console exclusive last year, with the PC version promised when it was ready.</p>
<p>"Naturally, we wanted to get the PC version into players' hands as quickly as we possibly could," Takai told the publication. "We don't get anything out of delaying its release either."</p>

<p>"I don't think there's much more we could have done to speed up the porting process," Takai continued, adding the time taken to get the PC version up to snuff was "time well spent".</p>
<p>When asked if future Final Fantasy games could perhaps see a day one PC release, Takai said: "I think it's possible - probably even likely." He did caveat this point though, saying "the team in charge of each project gets to decide its own policy", so this was "just [his] personal opinion".</p>
<p>The director went on to address some of the recent bumps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s PC ports have faced on release. You may recall, on its own PC debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-pc-barebones-port">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade was criticised for its performance</a>. Digital Foundry contributor Oliver Mackenzie called it a "flawed, barebones release" that was "nowhere near good enough".</p>
<p>However, Takai said Square Enix "always listens to player feedback and bears it in mind".</p>
<p>"Since we want as many players as possible to enjoy our game, we made sure to address any points that could be perceived negatively," he said. "Of course, it's not just feedback from FF16 players that we listen to, but from other games, too."</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 16 is set to arrive on PC next month, on 17th September. The game will arrive as a complete edition, including all DLC: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-first-dlc-opens-that-one-mysterious-door-and-its-characters-minds">Echoes of the Fallen</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-is-finally-complete-though-its-dlc-wont-appease-critics">The Rising Tide</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-teaser-trailer-contains-several-secrets-randy-pitchford-says-and-fans-are-on-the-hunt<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>gamescom 2024 got off to a big start with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-with-teaser-trailer-at-opening-night-live-gamescom-2024">the reveal of Borderlands 4</a>, the next game in Gearbox’s looter shooter series, during Opening Night Live. The announcement came via a teaser trailer, below, that on face value offers little insight into what to expect when the game launches in 2025. But eagle-eyed fans have spotted a number of secrets buried within the trailer itself, and Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford has said there are even more yet to be discovered.</p><p>“There are several secrets in the teaser for Borderlands 4,” Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826058021614793024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> following ONL. “Some I have not seen commented on yet. What have you found!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potential spoilers for Borderlands 4 follow.</em></p><p>Let’s start with what has been found. The most obvious secret is a snapshot of what very much looks like Borderlands villain Handsome Jack with the vault symbol covering his face. This heavily suggests Handsome Jack, the president of the Hyperion Corporation, returns for Borderlands 4.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/jack-1724230300344.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Is this the return of Handsome Jack?</figcaption></figure></output><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like Handsome Jack is returning for Borderlands 4. The vault symbol perfectly aligns. (Credit to @UndeadMD for the find) <a href="https://t.co/j2plLNACuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/j2plLNACuk</a></p>— JoltzDude139 (@Joltzdude139) <a href="https://twitter.com/Joltzdude139/status/1826003824018075880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But what else? There is eridian writing in the trailer. The Eridians are the ancient, presumably extinct alien race that serves as something of a mysterious force throughout the Borderlands series. Could the Eridians play a role on Borderlands 4?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/writing-1724230502972.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>HE IS WATCHING.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/more-writing-1724230591197.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>BREAK FREE.</figcaption></figure></output><p>But what does the eridian writing say? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ex4p1i/comment/lj3ettm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor pskought</a> believes this is a substitution cipher, and the translation works out as “HE IS WATCHING” and “BREAK FREE.”</p><p>This is all very cool, but what does it mean? Fans have a number of theories, including that “HE IS WATCHING” alludes to the Watcher, an alien of Eridian origin that appears in 2014's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-the-pre-sequel">Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</a>. Some fans are currently speculating that The Watcher will end up as the antagonist of Borderlands 4, or at least a shadowy figure who is revealed to have been pulling the strings all along.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/jack-again-1724230409142.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Is this also Handsome Jack, or someone else?</figcaption></figure></output><p>Meanwhile, a mysterious orange face pops up at the end of the trailer which may be another look at Handsome Jack or someone else. Fans aren’t sure who this is, or who the robotic hand shown grabbing the face mask belongs to, but all these clues combined with Gearbox’s confirmation that Borderlands 4 is set on a brand new planet, suggest Borderlands 4 is certainly heading in something of a new direction. Perhaps a more serious tone this time around?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/hand-1724230753969.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Who's this?</figcaption></figure></output><p>As Pitchford says, there are more hidden secrets players have yet to discover. Some may be little more than Easter eggs. X/Twitter user Primidian spotted what they think is an easy to miss look at Lilith crashing into Elpis, Pandora's moon and the main setting of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. We see Elpis in the trailer on a collision course with the new planet.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lilith crashing into Elpis <a href="https://t.co/DTF5p1XKB4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DTF5p1XKB4</a></p>— Primidian (@Primidian) <a href="https://twitter.com/Primidian/status/1826058172861428028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>What else do we know about Borderlands 4 at this point? It’s described as “the definitive looter shooter,” and we know it’s out at some point after March 2025 but before the end of 2025 on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. Borderlands 3 and spin-off Tiny Tina's Wonderlands were both timed Epic Games Store exclusives. Clearly, Borderlands 4 is not.</p><p>“See if you have what it takes to go down in history as a legendary Vault Hunter as you search for secret alien treasure, blasting everything in sight,” reads the official blurb.</p><p>We also know Borderlands 4, like previous games in the series but unlike the recently released Borderlands movie, contains “intense violence or gore, suggestive themes, strong language, and general mature content.”</p><p>There’s also word of cross-platform multiplayer, which would be an unsurprising first for the Borderlands series.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Borderlands 4 Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Here's more from publisher 2K:</p><blockquote>Borderlands 4 was announced at gamescom’s Opening Night Live with a teaser trailer providing players with their first tantalizing glimpse of an all-new planet. Borderlands 4 is the fourth mainline title and seventh overall entry in the franchise. Players will once again assume the role of a legendary Vault Hunter as they search for secret alien treasure while blasting everything in sight.</blockquote><blockquote>“The team and I at Gearbox have a lot we’ve wanted to do with Borderlands since we first introduced the looter shooter genre to the world with our original game,” said Randy Pitchford, founder and President of the Gearbox Entertainment Company. “All of us at Gearbox have massive ambitions for Borderlands 4 and are putting everything we have into making everything we love about Borderlands better than ever before while taking the game to new levels in exciting new directions.”</blockquote><blockquote>The Borderlands franchise has sold-in more than 87 million copies to-date, receiving critical acclaim from reviewers and fans alike. With unforgettable characters, deep world building, and more unique guns than can be counted, the franchise has cemented itself as a must-play series.</blockquote><blockquote>“We’re thrilled to be able to share with our fans that 2025 will mark a massive year for 2K and Gearbox Entertainment,” said 2K Core Games Senior Vice President and General Manager Catharina Lavers Mallet. “The Borderlands series is one of 2K’s most successful franchises ever and is beloved by millions globally. We’re excited that our already close partnership and collaboration with the Gearbox team has grown even deeper, and we look forward to delivering best-in-class experiences for both longtime fans and new players alike.”</blockquote><p>The reveal of Borderlands 4 is a long time coming, with Pitchford teasing it on a number of occasions in recent years. He told IGN in February that Gearbox was working on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-teased-by-gearbox-founder-randy-pitchford"><u>the "greatest thing" it has ever done</u></a>. Take-Two later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-buys-gearbox-from-embracer-confirms-development-on-new-borderlands-game"><u>acquired Gearbox from Embracer Group for $460 million</u></a> and confirmed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-borderlands-4-waiting-in-the-wings-new-gearbox-owner-take-two-plans-to-pursue-growth-opportunities"><u>a new Borderlands game was in development</u></a>.</p><p>The announcement of Borderlands 4 comes hot on the heels of the high-profile flop that was the <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/borderlands-the-movie"><u>Borderlands movie</u></a>, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-kevin-hart-jack-black"><u>IGN awarded 3/10 in our review</u></a>.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at Opening Night Live</u></a> for more.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, Netease' free-to-play Overwatch wannabe comprised of superheroes from the Marvelverse, is set to launch on December 6th. And in a "hah, take this Overwatch!" way, they've also announced that all of its heroes will be unlocked for everyone straight off the bat (man). Oh no wait, he's DC isn't he. To be fair, I've only watched one Avengers film, two Captain Americas, and Thor: Ragnarok (without seeing the other Thors). All of which I have zero recollection of. Anyway, yes, Marvel Rivals.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game's big middle finger to Overwatch isn't only that every hero is free-to-play immediately, but any heroes released later down the line will be too. On the one hand I think this is good because there's no barrier to trying out the new hotness. But on the other, I do think there was some merit to locking new heroes behind at least a bit of progression. Not like, spending real life money or anything, but just a sense that you've worked to unlock the new hotness. I don't know, I just found it quite exciting whenever I unlocked a new character with my hard earned Overwatch Bucks. And weirdly, it gave me a sense that I'd passed some basic tests: in mastering the simple free characters, I'd graduated to the more complex new release.</p>

<p>Captain America and the Winter Soldier are also joining the roster, which confuses me slightly as I thought they were one and the same. Then again, I am about as in tune with the Marvelverse as I am some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX38z_Ar9yI">The Voice's coaches performing Beautiful Day 12 years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise yeah, my thoughts on Marvel Rivals are thus: I think this game is swinging around far too late. I wouldn't say hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS games</a> are dead, but I do believe Marvel Rivals' specific brand of shooter just isn't in demand anymore - even if it does look alright.</p>
<p>It might be DC or whatever, but I hope Square Enix one day gives us another Guardians Of The Galaxy adventure again. Now that game? That game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review">was good</a>.</p>

Atsuko Tanaka, the Japanese voice of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, has passed away after an unnamed illness she had lived with for more than a year. She was 61 years of age.
</p>
<p>
The news of her passing was shared by her son Hikaru Tanaka on social media earlier this week. He said she "fought... with grace, humour and strength" during her illness. 
</p>
<p>
"I believe it was a life that was truly characteristic of Atsuko Tanaka," her son wrote (translated by <a href="https://animecorner.me/voice-actress-atsuko-tanaka-passed-away/">Anime Corner</a>). "I feel truly blessed to have had such a proud mother."

            <p>If you have experience of the London rental market, there is but one way you can react to a game – a French game, no less, the cultural product of a country where two-bed apartments apparently grow on trees – that promises to maroon you in a sprawling labyrinth of flats. “Haha, alright for some!” you chortle despairingly, after freeing yourself from the laundry basket and retrieving your trousers from the fridge. “I bet labyrinths have more than one window,” you sob, as you yet again tackle the problem of opening the front door without becoming part of the wall. </p>
<p>If you have have experience of the London rental market, you are probably reading this and thinking: “He’s got a front door? Such extravagance. I live in a folded umbrella.” Touché, my friend. I guess it’s just as well we have spaciously proportioned first-person puzzle adventures to console us in our time of compound elbow bruises, rising damp and preposterous financial debt.

<p>Created by Swing Swing Submarine and published by ARTE, it’s a first-person Myst ‘em up, Witness-a-lot and/or Fez-alike (these are the developers' own stated influences, along with 90s fantasy films) in which you wake up one day to a phone call from your mate Fael, who has gotten lost in his own apartment. Sallying forth in search of him, you discover that your own flat and its surroundings have gotten all mazey. It’s just as well you remembered your handheld-console-which-is-legally-distinct-from-the-Game-Boy-Advance-SP.</p>
<p>“To open all the doors and corridors, and access certain rooms, players will have to work their brains out and solve numerous mysteries, using the GameLeaf, an intriguing retro portable console to help them complete the levels,” explains the announcement release. “Each game is a piece of the puzzle that brings players closer to the truth about Fael's disappearance.</p>
<p>“Experimentation is at the heart of the experience, and players will need to be very attentive and interact with the setting, as every detail is important, from photo frames to seemingly uninteresting furniture, everything can be a clue to solve a puzzle,” the release continues. “The world of the flat is full of surprises, and players will have to think outside the box to progress. As they solve Fael's mysterious disappearance, players will also have to question the very nature of reality.”</p>
<p>Thinking outside the box? I only wish I had a box to think in. You’d have to pay £2500 a month for the privilege round these parts, and you’d need to bring your own lid. Anyway, you can read more of Fael’s doings on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2521170/Looking_For_Fael/%E2%80%9D">Steam</a>. It’s out in 2025. The obvious comparison here is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blue-prince-is-already-the-very-best-shapeshifting-videogame-house">Blue Prince</a>, which takes things in more of a boardgamey direction with no retro handhelds to speak of.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-%E2%80%93-exclusive-details-on-world-story-and-mechanics.959322/</guid>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast was revealed by Techland during the Opening Night Live showcase. Shortly after, it was confirmed by the team that it started life as a story expansion for Dying Light 2 (2022) before blossoming into a standalone release. Now, Techland has revealed more details exclusively to the press at Gamescom, along with uncovering a 20-minute gameplay walkthrough.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has those details – read on.,</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-the-world-looks-phenomenal">The End of the World Looks Phenomenal</h2>



<p>At first blush, Dying Light: The Beast is unequivocally Dying Light 2 – it looks and feels the same as the 2022 release. Under the surface, there’s so much more to uncover, least of all being the return of Kyle Crane after almost a decade. He’s being voiced once again by the legendary Roger Craig Smith, which will be a huge win with fans worldwide.</p>



<p>In The Beast, players will traverse an 18-hour story set in a new and unique location made up of several ‘biomes’. There is a forest region alongside an ‘Old Town’ area, and an industrial complex set beside a railyard, for example. It’s comparable in size to a single region of Villedor from Dying Light 2, which means it’s not the largest map, but Techland assured me that they’ve crammed a lot into the smaller environment.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast will take players through a linear story, which means the ‘choice and consequence’ mechanics of Dying Light 2 have been eradicated. This is because the team wants players to feel like they <strong>are </strong>Kyle Crane and are following <strong>his </strong>story.</p>



<p>For The Beast, Techland has overhauled several in-game mechanics, including stealth, weather, and environmental opportunities when it comes to innovation in combat. It’s the same intense, parkour-fuelled experience players are used to, but modernised slightly and upgraded with some nice graphical improvements, new zombie archetypes, and fresh weapons and skills.</p>



<p>The gameplay walkthrough I saw genuinely filled me with excitement. I’m a ten-year veteran of the series and a huge fan of Dying Light, and I for one can’t wait for The Beast to be released.</p>

            <p>Lo, a ripple in the release date sands. Stand still a moment while we study this phenomenon. Yes, yes, it is the unmistakable rumble of a large survival MMO pondering its release date. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> is having a think and has decided "early 2025" is a good non-specific time period to come out in early access. That could mean January or February. Or March, I guess. April? Now don't be silly, that's spring. Not April, surely. This beast seems hungry. It will eat before then. I have foreseen it. Mostly by watching the trailer that dropped at Gamescom.</p>

<p>The trailer aired during Gamescom's advertising bonanza, Opening Night Live. It takes us swiftly through a new player's idealised opening experience, during which they're dumped in the desert but find another player to team up with. "Working with others will always increase your chances of staying alive," say developers Funcom (they've never <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">played Chained Together with Edwin and Nic</a>). There's a fair bit of ornithopter flying, which looks like quite a buzz.</p>
<p>As expected, much else of what we see is in keeping with Dune's lore. There are body shields and sand worms and those wibbly hoverpacks I don't know the name of. You even suck up all the blood from your enemies and put it in a machine to extract drinking water. (Mostly, I like that you can sell the blueprints of your finished buildings to other players for cash, but this feels like the least Dune-y thing in the whole trailer). You'll also get to meet known characters from the fiction such as famous protagonist <del>Duniel Baggins</del> Paul Atreides. </p>
<p>We've previously heard from developers Funcom that it plays fast and loose with the source material in some important ways, though. Paul's father is alive and well, for example, counter to the canon. Even the environment will see some changes. "The Dune in the movie shows no natural vegetation whatsoever," said Tech Art Director Richard Cawte in <a href="https://duneawakening.com/en/developer-update-1-art-of-arrakis">a blog update</a>, "which is not the case for our Dune." Plants!? On Arrakis!? My outrage better be coming across as fake!! Because it is!!! I like plants!!!!</p>
<p>Edwin got an early look at the crafty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> and came away <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sandworms-are-the-spice-in-dune-awakenings-otherwise-quite-familiar-survival-simming">"surprisingly enthused"</a>. Funcom have previously made similar multiplayer survive-o-crafts with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a> and have been in the sci-fi MMO business since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-anarchy-online">Anarchy Online</a>, so it makes sense that they were chosen to grip the reins of this particularly large franchiseworm. </p>
<p>There's an ongoing beta that you can still sign up for on <a href="https://www.duneawakening.com/#">the game's website</a> if you're so inclined. For everyone else, time to squat in the sand and look at the horizon thoughtfully for 5-6 months. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>&nbsp;is all set to immerse players in the medieval machinations of warring kings and lords all over again, when it comes out on 11th February 2025.</p>
<p>We’ve played a few hours of the game, experiencing its opening narrative twists, as well as leaping ahead to the big city of Kuttenberg and the broader historical RPG action – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">you can read all about that here</a> – but we also got to sit down with Warhorse figurehead and PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling to talk about a game that’s been a whole console generation in the making.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwywU6b_JKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><b>TSA: </b>It’s going to have been 7 years almost exactly between games, which is basically a full console generation which is a lot of time in terms of tech, gaming and people’s attitudes. As a developer, has your approach for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 changed compared to the original, beyond the studio simply getting so much bigger?</p>
<p><b>Tobias Stolz-Zwilling: </b>Yes and no. No, it’s still very much the same kind of game, so we’re trying to stay true to Warhorse, stay true to KCD, and deliver what we believe is a true, authentic medieval experience, but then again, now with more people and the cushion of a successful KCD1, we can make things bigger –&nbsp;everyone always says it’s going to be bigger and better, but in our case we do have more people, we have the financial funding that can support the development, but we also have the technology and the skills now to bring stuff into the game that we couldn’t afford before.</p>

<p>For example, we and [Director] Daniel Vávra always wanted to have a city in the game, and in KCD1 they’re teasing and talking about how in Kuttenberg something is happening, but we simply couldn’t [go there], because we weren’t able to have more than a few people on screen, the task of building a huge medieval city was too big, and so in KCD1 we basically have a bunch of villages and one overblown village, which is Rattay. Compare Ratai to KCD2 and it’s like one street in Kuttenberg. Now we are confident to tackle bigger things and that is what I think has changed most.</p>

<p><b>TSA: </b>You’ve almost already answered my next question, which is what ways KCD2 has changed from the original? The scope, of course, but are you sticking with the alchemy system, the style of combat and things like that?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Yes, the scope is the easy answer, but pretty much every element from KCD1 is being tweaked, fine tuned and upgraded. Even the dice minigame will be deeper and there will be some badges you can earn.</p>
<p>I think the most prominent example is with the combat […] We said of KCD1 that combat was easy to learn but hard to master, and I think the hard to master we nailed, but the easy to learn, not so much. Many people liked it, but some struggled, so the idea now is to have different animators come to the studio so that they all feel different, but they ca also offer different playstyle. So if you want to play the intricate combat system, then you can take a sword and do all the combos and moves, but if you’re a character that doesn’t want to combat at all or want a more straightforward style, then there’s weapons like the mace where you pretty much just whack the opponent on the head!</p>
<p>Then in the UI there are less attacking zones, it’s a bit more straightforward, the combos are not so difficult, and so on. It’s also stayed true to each weapon historically and what it was used for –&nbsp;of course the crossbow was easier than a bow, that’s why they invented them, and of course a pole weapon is easier that fencing, that’s why they used them. The intent is for a more entertaining game that offers you this choice.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>You mentioned hitting enemies on the head, and video game developers have got a rich tradition of exploding watermelons. Usually it’s for first person shooters, I think, but did you get through many watermelons during development?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>[laughs] I don’t want to spoil too much, but many watermelons were harmed!</p>

<p><b>TSA: </b>It also feels like you’re taking a step forward in the storytelling and the cinematic stylings. Perhaps a lot of that is from experiencing the opening hours and getting people into the setting, but does that continue as the open world is exposed to you?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b> Daniel Vávra is a huge cinematics fan, and one day wants to shoot a film himself, so of course you can see this in his games –&nbsp;you can also see this in Mafia and Mafia 2, his earlier products. He has this hand for dramatic scenes and sequences, and KCD 2 especially is not different.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the game, it’s a little bit more hands on and we bring you up to speed with the video sequences to introduce you to the game and the surroundings. This will be less through the rest of the game, however, I think we have 4, 5 or 6 hours of cinematics in the game, and they’re extremely powerful and important for us to deliver the story. We have a 100 hour game, after all, and it’s a story driven game first, and an action RPG and the fighting and so on, so therefore the cinematics are very important.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>I like that you can really put Henry and Sir Hans together as two characters that have a lot of growing up to do in this game.</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>And that’s what makes them so lovely! Hans Capon in the first game, if you check on Reddit and so on, most people are saying the same: “I hated this dude in the beginning, but then he became my most loved character!”</p>
<p>He had this interest arc in KCD where he became a friend to Henry, but still there’s the difference where he is a noble and Henry is a Squire, a bastard. This is still present, but KCD2 will focus strongly on the bromance between those two, as they face terrible situations through the game where they’re on the edge of surviving (maybe even further), and that’s a dramatic part that we have a big focus on.</p>
<p>Henry, in KCD1, pretty much solved everything by himself, but in KCD2 that will not be the case. He will find out very quickly that he needs friends and he needs other misfits to get things done.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>I get the feeling that Hans would like Henry to still sort everything out for them! [laughs]
</p><p>How important is that you kept Mutt in the game? Was that a day one addition to the plan?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Yes, and you can finally pet him! That was a big thing and even our own guys said we have to have a pettable dog, and to go one further, we have a petable horse as well, which is great.</p>
<p>Some of the perks and stats we are taking over to KCD 2, like the dog for instance or Henry being able to read –&nbsp;it doesn’t make sense to make him learn to read all over again –&nbsp;however, things like combat and other intricate things, he has to rediscover.</p>
<p>I like to say it’s like he’s the champion of a Sunday league, but now he’s going to the Premier League, so he will suck at most things in comparison. However, he now knows how to play soccer, but now needs to step up the game to deal with armies, knights, lords, nobility and so on. It’s not like he forgot everything, it’s more like he needs to refine his skills.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>He didn’t just take a mace to the head and forget stuff.</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Exactly.</p>

<p><b>TSA: </b>There’s obviously still areas that you might still be able to improve and add in future, so you talked about not having jousting in the game, which I’m sure a lot of people would be nagging you to do. Is that the main thing that is still on the wish list?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Honestly, I think everything that’s in the game and everything that’s not in the game is exactly as intended by Warhorse – this is how we do it, this is what we wanted to deliver, and we are looking forward to getting this out.</p>
<p>Jousting and these things are coming from fans that are very often used to Hollywood scenes, like A Knight’s Tale. Yes, jousting was a thing in the Middle Ages, but it definitely wasn’t as present as people might think…</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>Also, it was probably just for the rich folks.</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>For the <em>very</em> rich folks. For the nobility mainly, and even then, when they were participating, it was a problem because you were actually hurting a nobleman!</p>
<p>But there will be tournaments: swordfighting tournaments, archery tournaments, horse tournaments and so on and so on. There will be cool stuff in there, but jousting would be a bit like a Quidditch game for Harry Potter. Of course everyone wanted Quidditch in there, but…</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>I mean, jousting you can understand, but Quidditch is impossible to figure out how to make into a workable game!</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Just catch the golden ball! [laughs]
</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>Lastly, I was wondering about big picture for Kingdom Come. Obviously you will tell a story of its own in KCD2, but is there still another chapter in a grander saga? I’m not sure you’re allowed to say right now…</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>I’m allowed to say anything! KCD1 ended with a cliffhanger, and KCD2 will end a story, but I don’t tell you which story. What the future brings, we don’t know yet.</p>
<p>In our history at Warhorse, we had two sink or swim situations. One was the Kickstarter, and the other was the release of KCD, because even then we weren’t sure if it would be a success or not. it’s not a sink or swim situation anymore, knocking on wood, but we have to wait and see how KCD2 performs. I am positive, I think the game is great and in very good shape already.</p>
<p>I can tell you already that Warhorse tries to aim to get bigger. We want more people, have bigger studios and again tackle bigger challenges.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Our hands on time and chat with Tobi with Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 came thanks to a press trip to Kutná Hora, the modern day Kuttenberg, with travel and accommodation provided by Warhorse and Plaion.</em></p>

		<p>Supermassive Games have revealed the next game in The Dark Pictures Anthology and, as we found out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/01/next-dark-pictures-anthology-game/">quite a while ago,</a> it’s called Directive 8020. This time we are off into space for some body horror, checkout the trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Directive 8020 | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etXhOhzbXso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>I don’t think Supermassive would mind us saying that The Dark Pictures Anthology format had got a little stale after four games so it’s nice to see they are switching things up for this new release. “In a dramatic step forward for the series, the game features persistent real-time threats, all-new stealth gameplay mechanics, and enhanced interactive cinematics powered by Unreal Engine 5,” they say.</p>
<p>The game will feature Hollywood actor Lashana Lynch who you may have caught in Bob Marley: One Love or the superb The Woman King. Here’s more from Supermassive:</p>
<p>“Earth is <span>dying</span>&nbsp;and humanity is running out of time. 12&nbsp;<span>light</span> years from home, Tau Ceti f offers a small sliver of hope. When the colony ship Cassiopeia crash lands on the planet, its crew soon realize they are far from being alone.”</p>

<p>“Hunted by an alien organism capable of mimicking its prey, the crew of the Cassiopeia must outwit their pursuers to make it home alive. As they battle to survive, they are confronted with the hardest choice of all: to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth. In space, death takes many forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next-Gen Cinematic Survival Horror&nbsp;</strong>– Experience immersive cinematic storytelling and edge-of-your-seat horror on a deep space mission to save humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Alien Threats&nbsp;</strong>– Evade a deadly alien threat that roams the dark corridors of the ship, intent on eradicating human life. Overcome your enemies using improvised weapons, lightning reflexes, and stealth.</li>
<li><strong>Trust No One</strong> – Encounter an alien lifeform that perfectly imitates its prey. Years of training and trust are lost among the crew when their enemy hides in plain sight. Who is human and who is not? Your choices are now more important than ever!”</li>
</ul>

<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite’s development team just addressed a whole host of topics about the game at Gamescom, talking exclusively to media about upcoming changes and additional features. The team spoke at length about the full release of the game, which is expected to arrive later this year, and touched on some recent controversies, such as the game’s ‘pay-to-win’ model.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-to-breakout">Prepare to Breakout</h2>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite is now in early access, and some players were quick to find issues with the game’s operating model. For instance, accusations have been lobbied at MoreFun for promoting a pay-to-win model by stuffing certain items behind paywalls, but this was one of the key areas addressed by the team at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Speaking on the topic, Enzo Zhang, the Head of MoreFun Studios, said that all microtransactions are cosmetic-focused and that a battle pass structure is coming soon. He mentioned that users <strong>can </strong>access everything in-game, and as the title isn’t inherently ‘grindy’, it’s relatively easy to do.</p>



<p>Users can of course buy in-game currency, but the team is stressing that the game isn’t pay-to-win.</p>



<p>Touching on other popular topics, MoreFun explained that there is a console release planned for the game, and while it’ll be the same experience, it won’t be crossplay-compatible. That means that PC players won’t be able to interact with console players.</p>



<p>There are also no plans to introduce a PvE or ‘offline’ mode, despite the team working on innovative AI systems that would perfectly facilitate such a platform. </p>



<p>Elsewhere, MoreFun is working on better engagement with the community. It’s kicking off a ‘support-a-streamer’ program, introducing streamer items, streamer <strong>codes</strong>, and a creator program to support those who want to broadcast their gameplay on the likes of Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>By the end of the year, Arena Breakout: Infinite will have a new map (TV Station), more weapons, game modes, and the first female operator. The team is also hard at work on intense anti-cheat mechanics, working on automated solutions, manual mechanics, and better encryption.</p>



<p>Ultimately, there’s one hell of a roadmap lined up for Arena Breakout: Infinite, which is poised to fully disrupt the extraction shooter genre with reckless abandon. As the team said, it’s designed as an ‘extraction shooter for everyone’, and it’ll allow users to dip in and out as they please without feeling like they’re being penalised for taking time away from the game.</p>

<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite just entered early access but is expected to launch as a full game later this year. It’s breaking heavily into the extraction shooter market, which is admittedly becoming quite a densely populated landscape, but it’s coming with quite a bit of innovation.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the team at MoreFun Studios is working on an innovative AI solution known as ‘FACUL’, which stands for First Ever AI Companion Who Understands Human Language.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-level-intelligence">Next-Level Intelligence</h2>



<p>MoreFun Studios is working to constantly pump Arena Breakout: Infinite, a new free-to-play extraction shooter, with content. On the roadmap is the integration of a next-generation artificial intelligence engine called FACUL, which will allow players to make use of AI-powered companions that they can order around the battlefield.</p>



<p>But it’s far from the command model that existed 20 years ago in the likes of SOCOM.</p>



<p>FACUL allows AI characters to recognise up to 17,000 in-game items, such as buildings, weapons, landmarks, and as the team said, ‘even blades of grass’. Players can use an adaptive, dynamic model to issue commands to these AI companions, ordering them as though they were talking to teammates. They can even have casual conversations and crack jokes with the AI.</p>



<p>MoreFun admitted that it hasn’t found a real use case for the AI in the game, particularly as it’s trying to avoid implementing something that could become quite overpowered, but it’s an innovative and interesting feature that’s being penned as a first-ever for the FPS genre.</p>

            <p>Hyper Light Breaker - Heart Machine's fully 3D rogue-lite spin on its acclaimed 2016 action-adventure Hyper Light Drifter - has had its early access launch bumped back a bit, and is now targeting an early 2025 release.</p>
<p>In a post shared on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840/view/5989310788331688818">Steam</a>, Heart Machine founder Alx Preston said the team needs a bit more time to ensure the gameplay experience is up to the "polished" standard the studio is aiming for.</p>
<p>"We don't want to ship a project, even in Early Access, that we're not satisfied with on a number of fronts. Especially in the current state of the industry, we need to put as good a foot forward as we can," Preston wrote.</p>

<p>The developer said the studio also wanted to ensure the wellbeing of its staff, with their mental and physical health a priority. This delay, Preston said, will "enable the team to offer better, more responsive support to community feedback during the Early Access period itself", rather than seeing them burnt out having pushed for that earlier launch.</p>
<p>"Trust that we REALLY want to put Breaker out there, and see people engage with a game that we've all worked so hard on," Preston assured the community. "However, we also REALLY need to make sure that the core foundational units of the game are as strong as they can be, so that we can build on them during the Early Access period."</p>

<p>Hyper Light Breaker was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-drifter-is-getting-a-fully-3d-rogue-lite-follow-up-with-online-co-op">announced back in March 2022</a>, with an expected launch into early access the following spring. Its release then shifted to autumn 2023 before it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-drifters-3d-rogue-lite-follow-up-gets-first-gameplay-trailer">pushed back to 2024</a>. As with this latest delay, Heart Machine said it wanted to make sure it could "bring the game to its full potential" ahead of its debut.</p>
<p>In the meantime while waiting for Hyper Light Breaker, you can give Hyper Light Drifter a whirl if you are yet to do so.

		<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a new stand alone game that brings back Kyle Crane from the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light/">Dying Light</a> game and it’s DLC. Kyle was absent from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-2/">Dying Light 2,</a> probably because at the end of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-following/">The Following</a> players could experience two different endings and neither of them were particularly… healthy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azIBRaiB05I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is set thirteen years since Kyle was last seen and finds him exploring the post-apocalyptic Castor Woods, a once-popular tourist destination. The area is populated with human factions as well as monsters including “the mysterious creature that’s turned the woods into its personal hunting grounds.”</p>
<p>As you might have gathered Kylie is no longer fully human. “Years of brutal experimentation took its toll, but the zombie DNA and yours are now intertwined so that you are able to unleash a beast-like power,” say Techland. “It flows through your veins. No one can take it from you. Use it. And you’ll discover it’s not just a curse.”</p>
<p>Voice actor Roger Craig Smith will be returning to the role of Kyle Crane. “Stepping back into Kyle Crane’s shoes feels like a reunion with an old friend,” Smith said. “And even though he’s gone through a terrible time, there’s still plenty of legendary hero left in him.”</p>

<p>The extra nice news is that if you own &nbsp;Dying Light 2: Stay Human Ultimate Edition you will get The Beast for free!</p>
<p>“Development of Dying Light: The Beast originally started as a story DLC for Dying Light 2 Stay Human. But after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience,” say Techland. “To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC.”</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beas coming to to PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Xbox and PlayStation – and that includes last gen&nbsp; – but no release date has been given.</p>
