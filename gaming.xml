            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Analogue 3D, a machine that aims to replicate N64 hardware without the need for emulation, has been delayed to 2025, but creator Analogue has also released the first images of the machine.</p>
<p>Analogue first revealed the Analogue 3D <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-announced-and-its-4k-nintendo-64">back in October last year</a>; in fact, news of its delay comes exactly one year after its original reveal, which is somewhat poetic.</p>
<p>When the machine was announced, it was set to launch sometime this year, but according to a press release (<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/preorders-for-analogue-3d-a-4k-nintendo-64-start-monday/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via CNet</a>), the 3D will now be launching sometime in the first quarter of next year instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-n64-machine-delayed-goldeneye.jpg?itok=R-41nDGR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-n64-machine-delayed-goldeneye.jpg?itok=qP4_BaUd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Analogue 3D will come in both black and white.</figcaption></figure><p>Preorders for the Analogue 3D will open on October 21st at 8am Pacific (that's around 11am Eastern), so if you're looking to pick one up, make sure you're ready with your details when that time comes around.</p>
<p>Analogue has also revealed an 8BitDo controller intended for use with the 3D, and it's been designed to "retain the original size, sub-layouts, and feel" of the N64 controller. Don't worry, though; it won't replicate the awkward form factor of Nintendo's original hardware.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, said controller won't ship with the Analogue 3D, so if you're looking to play your N64 games with a controller that won't cause your hand to go non-Euclidean, you'll have to fork out an extra $40.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the Analogue 3D, it's a machine that's intended as a reimagined version of the Nintendo 64. Analogue proudly states that the machine doesn't use emulation; instead, it uses an FPGA chip "for absolute accuracy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-n64-machine-delayed-multiplayer.jpg?itok=CHeGU2i3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-n64-machine-delayed-multiplayer.jpg?itok=CVf1vK11 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Analogue is referring to the original N64 here, not its own 3D.</figcaption></figure><p>The 3D comes from the same company that made devices like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-pocket-portable-gaming-handheld-announced">the Pocket</a>, and it's aiming to provide flawless compatibility with original N64 cartridges while still offering 4K upscaling.</p>
<p>Since the machine uses FPGA rather than emulation, you won't experience glitches like input lag, graphical inaccuracies, or frame rate issues; Analogue is promising "the N64 exactly as it was meant to be, without compromise".</p>
<p>If you want to read more about the Analogue 3D, you can head over to the device's <a href="https://www.analogue.co/3d" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website right here</a>. The 3D will be available for preorder via Analogue's <a href="https://store.analogue.co/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">store</a> on October 21st.</p>

Unburdened by all the traditions and expectations attached to a name like <em>Persona</em>, <em>Metaphor </em>innovates and experiments in exciting ways. One particularly successful example of this is <em>Metaphor</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134">lack of a romance mechanic</a></span>, a hallmark of the <em>Persona </em>series. Yet even in the absence of gameplay systems devoted to romance, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> doesn’t lack such connections entirely. By removing the player’s role in finding love, the game is able to create a much more compelling representation of romance in its world, and that is best shown in party member Eupha’s storyline.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196599" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="196599,196790,196411" data-current="196599"><div><p>Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22154.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Much of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>’s gameplay revolves around forming bonds with NPCs in the world. These function in a similar fashion to social links from the <em>Persona </em>series. You’ll engage in special story moments with characters and build up a bond with them that helps deepen your understanding of the world as well as unlocking new upgrades for combat. One of the biggest criticisms of the <em>Persona </em>series is that female relationships would always end in a romance if seen to completion (something later fixed by the inclusion of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-romance-social-yukari-mitsuru-fuuka-1851206843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-romance-social-yukari-mitsuru-fuuka-1851206843">platonic routes</a></span> for all characters). This was often accomplished through messy writing that contorted compelling characters into nothing more than an object of desire for the protagonist, who themselves is a thinly veiled player stand-in.<em> Metaphor</em>’s removal of romance entirely results in every character feeling much more fleshed out as a person in their own right, with their own goals and desires that stand alongside the protagonist’s without the need for a shoe-horned love plot.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="9815eee5499456a5c489cff6d916e55e" data-recommend-id="image://9815eee5499456a5c489cff6d916e55e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1298" data-height="730" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eupha stands with her brother and the protagonist and says: &quot;I'm learning about the outside from him.

If I remain naive about it, I will only be a burden.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Enter Eupha, a young summoner from an island society that has little to no contact with the larger mainland that serves as the setting for most of <em>Metaphor</em>’s action. Yet Eupha is somewhat different from the rest of <em>Metaphor</em>’s cast in that she is explicitly romantically interested in the protagonist. It’s implied that their connection will involve sparks early on when the two have a misunderstanding over a handshake. In Eupha’s culture, a handshake can mean a sign of trust but also has a romantic meaning, something that makes her flustered.<br></p><p>As your bond with Eupha develops, romance isn’t directly at the forefront. Instead, her story focuses on the religious aspects of <em>Metaphor</em>’s world, with you helping her understand the customs of people outside of her island while also rooting out bad actors within the game’s Sanctist church. Throughout all this, Eupha grows into a more knowledgeable, compassionate, and worldly person who seeks to create a deeper connection between her world and the world of the protagonist. By the conclusion of her bond storyline the two have grown quite close, and Eupha asks that the protagonist consent to another handshake, but this time confesses that she means it as a confession of her feelings to him. </p><p>None of this storyline occurs in the way that a romantic plot line in <em>Persona </em>would. In that series, you choose to enter a romantic relationship with a character. <em>Metaphor </em>presents a fascinating inversion of this by having the NPC initiate romance. Eupha is explicitly the one attempting to build a better bond with the protagonist in the hope that love will bloom. This works incredibly well thanks to the sharp writing of her character as well as the removal of your ability to shape an NPC into a romantic prospect through gameplay decisions. It is also more thematically in line with a core pillar of <em>Metaphor</em>’s world: you are not the protagonist.</p><figure id="" data-id="6f062a0b946d387feace3c20b5b4c1ef" data-recommend-id="image://6f062a0b946d387feace3c20b5b4c1ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1293" data-height="727" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eupha shakes the protagonist's hand and says: &quot;It led me to a realization.

I only want to live in a world where you exist...&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first thing <em>Metaphor </em>asks you to do is enter a name. The game specifies that this is your name, not your character’s. You name the protagonist later on. <em>Metaphor </em>wants to drill into you that you and the protagonist are not the same entity. He has a voice, he has his own goals and wishes and ways of communicating with the world around him. He is not just a vessel for player gratification, something that feels like a departure from the often blank-slate protagonists of <em>Persona</em>. That’s also why romance as a mechanic is removed, because it isn’t your place as the player to control the feelings the protagonist has toward people. It gives more agency to not only the protagonist, but also to the NPCs in the game, especially Eupha. She expresses her love for him, and while you are given a handful of dialogue options to respond to her with, they all read as confirmations of reciprocated feelings. Hell, the final interaction you can have with Eupha before going into the game’s final dungeon has her bringing you home again, where her brother gives you a stern talking-to about taking care of her.<br></p><p>This might rub some players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-romance-junah-eupha-strohl-1851670675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-romance-junah-eupha-strohl-1851670675">the wrong way</a></span>, as it can feel like the game is trapping you inside of a romantic path without warning. But this isn’t about the player, it’s about Eupha and the protagonist, and their relationship being a romantic one is thematically in-line with the rest of <em>Metaphor </em>and with who Eupha is as a person. She is a woman who seeks to create bonds with the people and cultures outside of her island that will allow for a better world to arise. A world of peace, understanding, and love. Her relationship with the protagonist is at the heart of that. The romance that blossoms between the two is proof that their shared mission of bringing a better, more compassionate world into existence is possible. It’s a remarkable story that works due to <em>Metaphor</em>’s decision to focus on romance on a character level, rather than a mechanical one.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>It's been exactly one year since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/analogues-hardware-emulated-nintendo-64-fpga-console-will-arrive-in-2024/">the initial announcement of the Analogue 3D</a>, an HD-upscaled, FPGA-powered Nintendo 64 in the tradition of Analogue's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/analogue-nt-a-museum-grade-nes-for-a-museum-grade-price/">long-running line</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/analogue-pocket-review-the-greatest-game-boy-ever-made/">high-end retro machines</a>. Today, Analogue is revealing more details about the hardware, which will sell for $250 and plans to ship in the first quarter of 2025 (a slight delay from the previously announced 2024 release plan).</p>
<p>Like previous Analogue devices, the Analogue 3D uses a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to simulate the actual logic gates found in original N64 hardware. That helps ensure 100 percent compatibility with the entire N64 cartridge library across all regions, Analogue promises, and should avoid the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/rp8nbp/why_is_it_often_said_that_n64_is_harder_to/">long-standing accuracy and lag issues</a> inherent to most software-based emulation of the N64.</p>

<p>To get that level of fidelity, the Analogue team spent four years programming an Altera Cyclone FPGA with a full 220,000 logic elements. That's a big step up from previous Analogue devices—the Analogue Pocket's main FPGA board featured just 49,000 logic elements three years ago. But the Analogue Pocket also included a second, 15,000-logic-element FPGA, which allowed it to run <a href="https://openfpga-cores-inventory.github.io/analogue-pocket/">an expanding list</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/analogue-pocket-gets-future-minded-fpga-cores-update-with-mister-in-its-sights/">openFPGA cores</a> to support games from other classic consoles.</p>
<p>Analogue has abandoned that additional FPGA for the Analogue 3D, meaning those openFPGA cores will not be usable on the new hardware. "If we wanted to offer Analogue 3D with openFPGA (which is not the purpose or focus of the product), it would require not only a second FPGA but an even more powerful base FPGA, therefore increasing the price to a price that doesn't suit our goals," Analogue founder Christopher Taber told Ars last year.</p>

            <p>A new trailer for forthcoming sci-fi RPG Exodus has been released, starring Hollywood's Matthew McConaughey as the narrator.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-to-make-his-video-game-debut-in-sci-fi-rpg-exodus">first announced at The Game Awards at the end of last year</a>, revealing McConaughey would be making his video game debut. Now we get to hear him in-game for the first time.</p>
<p>So who is he playing? That's still unclear, though it's all part of the game's mysterious storyline.</p>

<p>The trailer, above, introduces The Mara Yama, presumably the game's villains. They are "horrifying Celestials, twisted into monstrous forms" and "unlike anything humanity has ever faced in the battle for survival", according to a <a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US/news/new-cinematic-mara-yama-reveal-trailer">new blog post</a>. These creatures "have no known territory or homeworld, living in massive space citadels secreted in desolate regions of space".</p>
<p>It's all very evocative, though we're yet to get a proper look at Exodus gameplay.</p>
<p>The game is being developed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-bioware-vets-working-on-story-driven-sci-fi-game-at-new-wizards-of-the-coast-studio">Archetype Entertainment</a>, a division of Hasbro's Wizards of the Coast. The studio is led by two ex-Bioware staff: James Ohlen and Chad Robertson. Ohlen worked on a number of BioWare games as creative director and lead designer, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>, while Robertson was head of live services on Anthem.</p>
<p>Exodus is a brand new AAA game. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCBYF4MUC58">Founders Q&amp;A video last month</a>, Ohlen and Robertson discussed developing the game, their inspirations, and the game's multiple playstyles. They also noted a look at gameplay will be coming soon.</p>
<p>There's still no news of a release date yet, but with strong talent and a star narrator, we're keen to see Exodus in action.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>After a year of Epic Store exclusivity, the Witchfire Early Access has been released on Steam with a further 9-12 months expected before a full launch. While some may scoff at such a lengthy spell before full release, there is plenty of content to get your teeth into in the current build. Given the high difficulty level of the game it is also going to take most players a considerable amount of time to even scratch the surface of what there is to offer. Whether this difficulty appeals or not depends on what you want from a game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Witchfire - Official Early Access Showcase 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ts1ZZkx2d1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If there’s one thing that immediately stands out, it’s that Witchfire already looks fantastic, the various environments benefiting from a dark and Gothic aesthetic that perfectly suits the medieval vibes of the game. Guns have a good feel to them with weighty sound effects and an atmospheric ambient soundtrack filled with chants provides the backdrop. While each area can feel a little constrained, the overall enemy variety is good, with most of them being forms of demonic knights or skeletons, but presenting a challenging mixture of ranged opponents and those that like to get close up and dirty.&nbsp;Mobility is the key to success and it is not unusual to get wiped out in short order if you get stuck.</p>


<p>To traverse the environment and engage in combat you have a double jump, a dash and a slide. Taking full advantage of all of these is necessary to survive and it may be worth rebinding some controls to suit. I changed dash to double tap movement buttons which felt far more intuitive to me than the default setting. Double jump can be particularly useful for finding a good camping spot to pick off enemies, but even this approach isn’t foolproof as teleporting melee enemies can easily reach you if you stay still for too long.</p>


<p>There are a range of classes that are suited to different approaches, from close up shotgun carriers to those more focused on magic and sniping from afar. Regardless of the class you choose you can change up your loadout as you unlock more weapons and I tended to switch between a bolt action rifle and a shotgun to cover most eventualities. As you use a weapon you can also unlock upgrades that give it unique abilities. Such upgrades do take a considerable amount of grinding, however, so it is tempting to stick to the same loadouts throughout.</p>
<p>As you progress through the game you can also unlock a powerful demonic weapon that has more scarce ammo and various equipment that can provide further bonuses, though a lot of these are gated behind levelling up your character.</p>
<p>Your central character level can be increased through the witchfire that you collect from foes and crystals. This works identically to the classic souls mechanic from FromSoftware titles with it being lost on death unless you return and collect it. Unlike the Souls games, though, Witchfire has a central hub and portals to different levels that you gain access to as you complete each one. There are extra areas to return to as you gain greater knowledge and earlier levels can be used to grind for levels and resources.</p>
<p>Alongside your character level you can also increase the Gnosis stat, but this is a double-edged sword. It opens up further areas and equipment but increases the difficulty of every level and it is easy to find yourself overpowered if you rush this process.</p>

<p>The overriding impression of Witchfire is that it is a very difficult game. Ammo is relatively scarce, enemies are plentiful and hard hitting and it is easy to find yourself dying in short order. The roguelike aspect does enable you to slowly improve and develop your character but until it clicks you will find yourself repeating the same starting areas over and over. Once you get past these and unlock more weapons and locations it becomes a much more engrossing title though so persistence does pay off.</p>
<p>If you’re up for the challenge then Witchfire is an Early Access game worth getting onboard with, but if not then you might want to wait for the full release to see if the developers fine tune the balance a little more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-xbox-series-s-impossible/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>STALKER 2 developer GSC Game World initially thought an Xbox Series S version of the game would be impossible, but now it thinks that any modern game can run on the system with the proper optimization.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/stalker-2-interview-xbox-game-pass-xbox-series-x-s-dlc-expansions">Windows Centra</a>l, GSC Game World discussed the least powerful current generation system, saying that, at first, they thought an Xbox Series S version of the game would be impossible due to the game's many mechanics and the system's lower specs compared to the other current generation systems. But as the studio started optimizing and adding new features for streaming information, they squeezed every megabyte from every piece of system content they could, ultimately making this version of the game possible.</p>
<p>Following this experience, the STALKER 2 developer believes that every modern game can run on the Xbox Series S with proper optimization. The experience also boosted the studio's optimization expertise, benefiting the PC version of the game as well, making it a lot more performant and lowering the minimum system requirements, which are rather low for a modern game.</p>
<p>Speaking further about the STALKER 2 console release, the studio confirmed the game runs at 60 FPS on Xbox Series X, with some small dips into the upper 50 FPS range during gameplay and bigger drops during narrative scenarios that have no impact on the experience, but they also hope to optimize the game further either before or after launch. On Xbox Series S, the team decided to go with 30 FPS gameplay despite being able to hit 60 FPS, albeit inconsistently. However, the studio considers a 60 FPS Performance Mode possible, though it wasn't specified if it would be available at launch or after the game releases next month.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 launches on November 20th on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/">Gamescom interview</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-rpg-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-narrated-by-matthew-mcconaughey/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Archetype Entertainment has published a new cinematic trailer for its upcoming debut game, the sci-fi RPG EXODUS. The trailer is narrated by famous actor Matthew McConaughey, who appeared on the stage of The Game Awards 2023 when the game was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-is-an-epic-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-features-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>.</p>
<p>McConaughey introduces one of the most ominous enemies players will find in the game, the Celestials humans call Mara-Yama:</p>
<p><em>Do you know what fear is? The Mara-Yama do. They thrive on it. These monstrous Celestials haunt the darkest corners of the cluster, hunting for isolated targets. Unfortunately for their victims, the Mara-Yama are interested in more than just stealing cargo. They want minds, memories, emotions. The more twisted and tortured, the better. Captured prey will be subjected to intense psychological torment before being neurologically drained. Those rare few who the Mara-Yama allow to survive and escape often never return to space, for they know too well the terror that lurks out there, in the dark, between the stars.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>We also learn the name of McConaughey's character in EXODUS: C.C. Orlev. According to the press release, he's a rather infamous citizen of Centauri, an outsider who knows many secrets and may be willing to share them, although his true motivations remain unclear.</p>
<p>EXODUS takes place in a sci-fi setting where humanity left a dying Earth in the 23rd century, looking to resettle in the Centauri cluster, where hundreds of habitable worlds had been found through probes and long-range scans. While some of the ark ships did reach the cluster and set up a beacon signal, many others were lost in space for a long time. By the time they finally found their way to Centauri, tens of thousands of years had passed for the original settlers, who had, by that point, evolved into a wholly different species (with the help of genetic engineering) called Celestials. The Celestials have come to see humans as primitives, and some of them, like the Mara-Yama, hunt humanity outright.</p>
<p>The only ones to effectively fight back are the Travelers. These brave explorers journey across the stars, unearthing ancient technologies on extinct Celestial civilizations in the hope of using them in the war. However, Travelers are subject to the so-called Time Dilation during their interstellar journeys. Since their spaceships run at the edge of lightspeed, mere hours or days for them can equate to years or even decades for those left behind.</p>
<p>With each journey in EXODUS, players will be confronted not only by the dangers across the inhospitable Centauri cluster but also by the emotional toll of your absence on those you love. Each choice made during those travels will be magnified by the inescapable reality of Time Dilation, and the cost and consequences may be paid by your entire civilization and the friends and family you left behind.</p>
<p>It's an intriguing concept that sits at the foundation of the extensive lore <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bioware-writer-joins-archetype-entertainment-says-bioware-has-become-corporate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created by accomplished writer Drew Karpyshyn</a> (known mostly for the original Mass Effect trilogy).&nbsp;Archetype Entertainment, owned by Wizards of the Coast, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/archetype-entertainment-is-a-new-wizards-of-the-coast-studio-working-on-a-sci-fi-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in early 2020 by fellow Karpyshyn colleague James Ohlen, a 20-year BioWare veteran who worked on Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Jade Empire, Dragon Age, and Mass Effect.</p>
<p>EXODUS has no release date yet, but you can start&nbsp;<span>exploring its sci-fi IP with the newly released book&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3Nsi6Jb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus: The Archimedes Engine</a>, written by </span>Peter F. Hamilton.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-publishing-ex-rockstar-thriller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>developer IO Interactive has announced that it's moving into third-party publishing, and its inaugural project on this front is a game created by ex-Rockstar legend Leslie Benzies.</p>
<p>The studio will be publishing&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, a "cinematic AAA story-driven action-adventure thriller" from Benzies' outfit Build a Rocket Boy. You might know that studio's name better from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-gta-lead-everywhere-beta"><em>Everywhere</em></a>, its flagship sandbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everywhere-gameplay-footage">game creation toolkit</a>.</p>
<p>This will serve as IO's first third-party publishing endeavor; up until now, the studio has mainly been known for its development efforts on the&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>franchise, as well as on other games like&nbsp;<em>Mini Ninjas</em>,&nbsp;<em>Kane &amp; Lynch</em>, and an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/developers-of-hitman-franchise-are-making-james-bond-game">upcoming <i>James Bond&nbsp;</i>game</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like IO will be publishing&nbsp;<em>Everywhere</em>; for now,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>is the only collaboration between IO and Build a Rocket Boy, and it's also the only game IO is currently publishing that it isn't also developing.</p>
<p>Benzies describes&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>as his studio's "first AAA premium game and ever-evolving universe", praising IO's "strong understanding of community culture, premium action-adventure games, and...best-in-class publishing team".</p>
<p>On IO's part, CEO Hakan Abrak says his studio and Build a Rocket Boy are "like-minded" in that they both "aim to create a bond and a long-term relationship" with their communities, calling the publishing agreement "a significant milestone for IO Interactive".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/io-interactive-hitman-3.jpg?itok=0jkavEQG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/io-interactive-hitman-3.jpg?itok=v8YS8u-6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>IO Interactive is best-known for its work on the&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what exactly&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>is, according to a press release, it's a "story-driven action-adventure thriller" that will feature "best-in-class cinematics, high-octane driving, and explosive combat".</p>
<p>You are Jacob Diaz, and you must unlock the secrets of your past across a "series of dangerous covert missions". In essence, it sort of sounds like what would happen if you took the open-world between-mission parts out of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, which feels somewhat appropriate for Benzies' Rockstar past.</p>
<p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>still doesn't have a release date, so we'll have to wait and see what kind of fruit this collaboration with IO Interactive bears.</p>

The Analogue 3D will launch early next year (the company says Q1 2025) and will cost $249.99. It comes in either black or white, and <a href="https://store.analogue.co/">preorders</a> kick off on October 21st at 11AM ET.</p><p>In addition to the timing and price, Analogue also released the first images of the console:</p><p>First <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">announced at the beginning of the year</a>, the Analogue 3D is a modern take on the N64, similar to previous Analogue consoles covering the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/31/14451542/analogue-nt-mini-nes-review">NES</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review">SNES</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967790/analogue-mega-sg-sega-genesis-mega-drive-price-release-date">Sega Genesis</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Game Boy</a>. The new console can render classic games in 4K and includes multiple display modes to mimic the look and feel of a CRT display. Analogue says it’s “designed with a bespoke, purpose-built 4K upscaler.”</p><p>The company says the Analogue 3D is 100 percent compatible with the N64’s cartridge library (it’s also region-free) by utilizing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc">FPGA technology</a>, which allows it to function like the original console. This is good news for the N64 in particular, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad">which has proven notoriously hard to emulate</a>.</p><p>The Analogue 3D supports Bluetooth, has four original controller ports, two USB ports, an SD card slot, and a new operating system dubbed 3D OS, which you can get a glimpse of below:</p><p>It doesn’t come with a controller, but 8bitdo has created an updated version of the N64 gamepad — minus the third prong — that is being sold separately for $39.99. You can see it in the photo at the top of this article. It has a Hall effect stick and is also compatible with the Switch, Android, and PC. You can also just use any original N64 controllers you have lying around.</p><div><p>The reveal comes during a particularly interesting time for new video game hardware. Sony is about to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253649/ps5-pro-preview">the PS5 Pro</a>, while Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">a new console on the horizon</a> along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">a $99 alarm clock</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was armor for horses and it cost $2.50. Players were outraged, but Bethesda made bank. “That was kind of a head shaker for us: you’re all making fun of it and yet you buy it,” the game’s quest designer, Bruce Nesmith, said in a recent interview. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

The company known for its sprawling open-world RPGs was testing Microsoft’s new downloadable content delivery system for the Xbox 360 and wanted to try selling a small piece of game content a la carte. The infamous horse armor was born. </p><p>Nesmith said he no longer remembers the exact sales figures for the add-on, but remembers it being a lot. “It must have been  in the millions, it had to be millions,” he said. As companies have proven with microtransactions time and again in the decades since, a vocal backlash means little if players still open their wallets. Microtransactions, or “recurring revenue” as some companies prefer to call it, now dwarfs boxed game sales at many of the biggest game publishers.</p><p>“Both Bethesda and Microsoft were caught flat-footed at the response to it, [we] did not anticipate that at all,” Nesmith told <em>VideoGamer</em>. “Only in hindsight could it be seen that that’s not what people wanted and that we basically thumbed our nose at them without realizing it. So, part of the Horse Armor story is you’re going to make mistakes when you’re the first one in the water on something like that.”<br></p><p>Bethesda ended up shipping tons of other microtransactions for <em>Oblivion</em> but most were more substantive, including a Wizard’s Tower where players could live and grow plants. “We found that the price isn’t really the issue,” Bethesda VP Pete Hines <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070328173716/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=23597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070328173716/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=23597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at the time</a></span>. “People just want to feel like they’re getting a good deal. I’ll pay $3 for downloadable content, but it better be cool - and horse armor just isn’t cool. So if we had to do it over again, I’d say either we should wait until later for the horse armor or do it for less.”</p><p>Even if some players thought the horse armor was a bad deal, it turns out many more didn’t care.

This is the segment that lets the player determine <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397">which of the original <em>Life Is Strange </em>endings is “canon” to them</a></span>, as well as solidify the nature of Max and Chloe’s relationship. Were they best friends or high school sweethearts? That’s up to you to decide, but it looks like there’s no version of events where Max and Chloe are still together, and Chloe either died at the end of the first game, or the two girls split up.<br></p><p>In a vacuum, this development could make sense. People grow apart, especially friends and significant others from high school. But given what Max and Chloe went through together in the first <em>Life Is Strange</em>, it does not sit well with fans that their relationship would be discarded off-screen.</p><p>Chloe’s reasoning for leaving Max is apparently due to the time-traveling photographer’s inability to move on from the events of the first game. This is part of Max’s arc in <em>Double Exposure</em>, as she has sworn off using her time-rewinding abilities after they had catastrophic consequences. It seems like Max is dealing with a lot of trauma from her past, even many years later, and if Chloe is alive, her inability to move forward is what broke down the relationship, according to a letter the player can find. Not that the explanation is satisfactory to everyone.</p><p>Ultimately, we still don’t know if Chloe’s role in <em>Double Exposure</em> is just a dialogue option and a postcard because the full game isn’t out yet. But given how big of a reveal this is for longtime fans, I have to wonder if releasing the sequel in pieces was the wisest option. If Chloe does show up and things are different by the end of the game, I imagine some fans would be more willing to sit with and examine this development. Or maybe this reveal makes more sense in the context of the full game. I’ll hold judgment until I see the game through to the end, but I’m not surprised that fans aren’t thrilled to find these characters in such a different place from where they left them. We’ll know more when the rest of the game is out on October 29.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Capcom has announced that the Resident Evil 4 remake has hit yet another sales milestone. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1846479698232324198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Wednesday, it was revealed that Resident Evil 4 has sold 8 million copies since its March 2023 release.</p>



<p>“To you, the 8 million-plus agents, thank you from the bottom of our hearts,” Capcom said.</p>



<p>Prior to this update, the studio announced that the game reached 7 million within its first year on the market. The game also sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-remake-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 million copies within its first two days</a>.</p>



<p>For comparisons sake, the original Resident Evil 4 sold 13.3 million copies per <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/game/227460/resident-evil-4/?region=All" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>. So, while the remake is behind the total sales of the original, it’s only been on the market for 19 months as of writing. The latest data on the original’s sales is from 2020, 15 years after its release.</p>



<p>In total, the Resident Evil 2 remake remains the best-selling of the Resident Evil games, per <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a>, at 14.2 million copies. While Resident Evil 5 technically sold more at 14.8 million, Capcom treats them as separate releases due to being seven years apart and on separate console generations at the time.</p>



<p>Are you one of the 8 million who have purchased the Resident Evil 4 remake? Let us know down below, and take the discussion to the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EXODUS - Mara-Yama Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In the spirit of spooky season, the new trailer focuses on a terrifying type of Celestial known as the Mara-Yama: an enemy encountered in the dark void of space that combine both body and psychological horror in one. The sadistic Mara-Yama prey on isolated travelers in the desolate regions of space, inflicting psychological torment as they harvest minds, memories, and emotions.</p><p>Exodus is a sci-fi RPG that explores the concept of time dilation as the protagonist travels through space, with days of travel passing as decades back on their home planet. As The Traveller, players are tasked with stealing alien technology and weapons from the Celestials, including the Mara-Yama introduced above.</p><p>Archetype Entertainment is a new AAA studio formed by Wizards of the Coast to develop new IP outside of Wizards' popular D&amp;D and Magic: The Gathering franchises. The studio employed many ex-BioWare developers, including studio head James Ohlen.</p><p>Exodus is still without a release date, but will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

                <p>Analogue has lifted the veil on its modernized Nintendo 64 console. Originally teased last year--exactly one year ago today, in fact--the Analogue 3D plays N64 game cartridges in 4K resolution. Like other Analogue devices, the 3D was built using FPGA to provide an authentic N64 experience while also allowing users to enjoy the benefits of playing on modern displays. It even supports all of the original accessories. But if you want to cut the cord and ditch the three-prong N64 controller, Analogue collaborated with 8BitDo on a new-style controller that looks quite lovely.</p><p>The Analogue 3D is designed to offer the "the essence of CRT" on a 4K TV. You can cycle through various display modes made to reproduce the effect of an old-school television set. There'll be two models available--one in white and the other in black--and the Analogue 3D is priced at $250. Preorders will begin on <strong>October 21 at 8 AM PT</strong>, and if the initial preorder window is anything like other Analogue releases, the console will likely sell out <em>very </em>fast. The Analogue 3D will begin shipping in Q1 2025.</p><p>Check out the Analogue 3D's design in the image slideshow below. The clean white and black color options appear to match the original white and black editions of the Analogue Pocket, the company's <a

certain display modes enabled, players can revisit their N64 game library in ultra high definition with faithfully reproduced scanlines, shadow masks, and other effects unique to CRT TVs. Analogue says the 3D offers 10X the N64's native 320x240 resolution without lag. The console is region-free and supports the entire N64 library.</p><p>The custom-built Analogue 3D OS takes cues from the Pocket with its Library and Memories hubs. Library is a catalog that displays a list of your games; a new entry is added to the list each time you load a cartridge for the first time. Memories is where your save states and screenshots are stored. You can save your progress at any time and jump back in at the same spot through the menu system.</p><p>In addition to the four controller ports on the front of the console, the console has an HDMI port, two USB ports, and an SD card slot on the back that supports SDHC cards up to 16GB. The Analogue 3D comes with an HDMI cable, USB cord, and a USB-C power supply. It has built-in Dualband Wi-Fi for firmware updates and supports both standard Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE.</p><p>Analogue says it spent four years developing a perfect way to experience N64 in FPGA for absolute accuracy. Ideally, this should be a massive step up when compared to N64 emulators.</p><p>Here's a closer look at all of the tech behind the Analogue 3D:</p><h3>Compatibility</h3><ul><li>Original N64 game cartridges</li><li>100% compatibility</li><li>Region free</li><li>Compatible with original accessories</li><li>Original style N64 cartridge slot</li><li>Built-in Expansion Pak capabilities</li></ul><h3>Video</h3><ul><li>4K HDMI output</li><li>NTSC &amp; PAL Support</li><li>Lag-free, zero signal degradation</li><li>Original Display Modes (CRT &amp; PVM</li><li>models)</li><li>Variable refresh rate</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><ul><li>48KHz 16 bit PCM audio</li></ul><h3>Hardware</h3><ul><li>Two USB ports / charging / wired support</li><li>SD card slot including a 16GB SD card</li><li>Dualband WiFi with OTA wireless</li><li>3DO S updating</li><li>Bluetooth Classic and LE</li><li>Four original-style controller ports</li><li>Up to four players supported (wireless &amp; wired)</li><li>8BitDo 64 Controller updating via Analogue3 D System (wired)</li><li>3DO S (4K)</li><li>220k LE Intel Cyclone 10GX</li></ul><h2>8BitDo N64 Controller</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4385542-8bitdocontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385542" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4385542-8bitdocontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385542"></a><figcaption>8BitDo N64 controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4385542-8bitdocontroller.jpg"></figure><p>8BitDo's N64 controller will be sold separately for $40 and is also compatible with Nintendo Switch, Windows, and Android. It has D-input and S-input modes. The controller features all of the N64's inputs--joystick, C-buttons, an authentic D-pad, A/B buttons, R/L/Z triggers--in a similar layout but with a modernized form factor.</p><p>It also has a Hall Effect joystick with an original style gate, a marked improvement when compared to the infamous N64 controller joystick that was prone to stick drift and becoming "loose" over time. Like other 8BitDo controllers, there'll be a high level of customization that you can access through 8BiDo's Ultimate Software, allowing you to tinker with fine details. </p><p>Preorders for the 8BitDo 64 Controller go live at the same time as the console.</p><p>If you'd rather play with original controllers, you can pick up <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fretro%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-64-controller-styles-may-vary%2F111903.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fanalogue-fully-unveils-its-modernized-n64-preorders-go-live-october-21%2F1100-6527188%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preowned N64 controllers at GameStop</a> for $18 each.

The console supports four players total with wireless and wired controllers (or a combination of the two), so you could opt for multiple 8BitDo controllers and ditch the original controller altogether.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warcraft-iii-reforged-could-be-getting-a-major-update-soon-new-findings-suggest.1011102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warcraft-iii-reforged-major-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A big Warcraft III: Reforged update could be coming in the future, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/something-might-be-happening-with-warcraft-3-reforged.1010307/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, <a href="https://blizztrack.com/view/w3d?type=versions">Blizztrack</a>, a website that tracks updates for all Blizzard games, shows that the game's internal Public Test Realm was updated yesterday to version 2.0.0 following a series of minor updates, suggesting that something big may be brewing, as every major version of any Blizzard game usually indicates a significant update. With the series' 30th anniversary being this year, it wouldn't be surprising to see a major overhaul of a game that was among the most controversial releases of the past few years.</p>
<p>Despite its issues, Chris still found Warcraft III: Reforged to be a valuable reconstruction of one of the most important RTS games ever released. You can learn more about the game by reading his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warcraft-iii-reforged-review/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Warcraft III: Reforged isn't the game that was promised, but is still a valuable reconstruction of one of the most influential titles in the history of video games. This release is, sadly, riddled with bugs as well as marred by the terrible decisions of Blizzard, particularly that of the false advertising that persists now even after launch. However, despite this, there's little doubting that Warcraft III: Reforged has a compelling story that, even eighteen years on, remains one of the most engaging in the genre. The gameplay holds strong to this day and with the tweaks and upgrades, this is an undeniable diamond in the rough.</em></p>
<div>
<p>Warcraft III: Reforged is now available on PC via Battle.net.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update-released-to-address-feedback.1011099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Miju Games has released a brand new update for&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>DLC, and the update is intended to address "most of the things" suggested by players as improvements.</p>
<p><em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-release-date">released earlier this month</a>, and in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1284190/view/4506506224312960119" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>, Miju says it's "humbled" by the volume of feedback received from players, and that it "succeeded" in some areas when it comes to player expectations of the DLC but "didn't" in others.</p>
<p>According to the post, Miju will "continue to refine" both of the planets available as part of&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>and its DLC, and following that, more free updates will be released. There's a possibility of more DLC, but for now, Miju is choosing to focus on the base game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update-ice-planet.jpg?itok=QKNVa-sJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-update-ice-planet.jpg?itok=tFd3qlkO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>has made some&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>players happy, but there are plenty of suggestions for improvement.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what's actually changed as part of this update? First up, Miju has added 23 new "Starform Crates", which operate similarly to Golden Crates; they contain "high quality flower seeds" and "a newly-added Starform effigy".</p>
<p>You'll also find a new crashed ship to explore somewhere on Humble, as well as a new hidden bunker to discover, so if you're an exploration fiend, this is the update for you.</p>
<p>Damage has been removed in "big fog areas", and lots of texture and collision problems have also been fixed, so you should have a smoother experience with&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>after this update is applied.</p>
<p>Several more resource nodes have been added, and a few more minor issues have been addressed as well. Hopefully, if you weren't entirely happy with&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble</em>, this update should go a long way towards remedying that.</p>

<p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game in which you must terraform a planet in order to make it a livable environment for humanity.</p>
<p>To that end, you'll need to gather resources, construct the base itself, and then fill it with "oxygen, warmth, and pressure" in order to create a viable atmosphere. Despite the high stakes, Miju describes&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>as "a chill experience", so it shouldn't be too stressful for you (and your friends, if you play in co-op).</p>
<p><em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as is its&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3142540/The_Planet_Crafter__Planet_Humble/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DLC</a>.</p>

Though we’ve already seen the <em>Stellar Blad</em>e bot and the <em>Helldivers</em> bot, Team Asobi is keeping the rest under wraps in order to preserve the little bolt of joy you get when you recognize one.</p><p>Interestingly, instead of releasing all the levels at the same time, Team Asobi’s going for yet another novel approach, launching individual levels on a weekly basis until all five are out on November 14th. Though it’s frustrating to have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">the best game on the PS5</a> parceled out like this, it feels like Team Asobi has made the right choice. Just like my friend’s golden retriever at dinner time, I have to be slow fed new <em>Astro Bot </em>otherwise I’d gobble everything up in one bite then complain that there’s no more fun to be had... or develop a concerning case of bloat.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24268079/apple-ipad-mini-2024-specs-price"><h2>Apple just announced a new, faster iPad Mini</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/13/24269131/tesla-optimus-robots-human-controlled-cybercab-we-robot-event"><h2>The Optimus robots at Tesla’s Cybercab event were humans in disguise</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271603/kindle-2024-colorsoft-scribe-paperwhite-specs-price-date"><h2>Amazon’s new Kindle family includes the first color Kindle</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270677/sonos-arc-ultra-soundbar-sub-4-announced"><h2>Sonos announces ‘breakthrough’ Arc Ultra soundbar and Sub 4</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24268043/google-android-15-pixel"><h2>Android 15 is now available for Pixels</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-battle-royale-cancelled-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A former developer at Certain Affinity has said that Halo’s now-canceled Battle Royale mode could have been a “game change for the franchise.”</p>



<p>The news came via the LinkedIn profile (as spotted by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/10/16/halo-battle-royale-would-have-been-a-game-changer-for-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>) of Mike Clopper, the Studio Design Director at Raven Software, who was previously a Game Director at Certain Affinity.</p>



<p>“MP Halo Infinite – I led a large team of designers working on a canceled Battle Royale mode for Halo. I believe this product could have been a game changer for the franchise. We loved playing it and working on it was a fantastic experience in spite of its cancelation,” his LinkedIn Profile reads.</p>



<p>It’s anyone’s guess why the Battle Royale mode for Halo Infinite was cancelled, but rumours surrounding the project have been going on for the past couple of years. The Battle Royale’s codename was Project Tatanka,&nbsp;and unfortunately, it’s likely never to see the light of day.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Halo announced a massive rebrand, including changing the name of 343 Industries to Halo Studios and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-moves-to-unreal-engine-5-with-multiple-games-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moving the Halo franchise to Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries,” studio head Pierre Hintze said. “Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of&nbsp;how&nbsp;we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mpl-esports-series-one-billion-hours/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a monumental milestone, the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League has become the first esports series in history to reach a whopping <strong>one billion hours watched</strong>. This data comes from Esports Charts, which highlighted that records counting these figures stretch back to 2016.</p>



<p>This means that the MPL has beaten the League of Legends World Championship, the LCK, the Valorant Champions Tour, and The International to this sweet record – but they’re not too far behind. It’s expected that League Worlds will hit the one billion mark before the current tournament is up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-immense-numbers">Immense Numbers</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://escharts.com/news/top-esports-events-series-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published by Esports Charts</a>, we get a look at some solid comparisons that highlight just how immense this achievement is for the MPL.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To contextualise ML:BB’s achievement in the mobile gaming industry,<strong>&nbsp;the MPL has received about quadruple the viewership of the PUBG Mobile Pro League</strong>, which has a similar total Airtime to the MPL. It also recorded more than triple the watch time of Twitch Rivals, which not only has over 600 tournaments but appeals to the large, loyal audiences of famous internet personalities.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The success of ML:BB is a testament to the power of mobile gaming. We recently published a report outlining the growth of mobile esports viewership in the last few months – and it’s a figure that continues to grow.</p>



<p>Despite the game’s success, it’s hampered slightly by the lack of a profile outside of the Asian markets. It’s extremely popular in Indonesia and the Philippines, plus it’s building a following in LATAM and MENA, but it hasn’t hit with the EU and NA audiences or pro players yet.</p>



<p>Moonton Games continues to work on that, though. The MPL has been around since 2017, and it continues to expand today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/full-nvidia-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-release-date-rumors-continue-to-circulate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rumors are continuing to circulate surrounding the release date of the upcoming Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards.</p>



<p>Nvidia appears set to announce a complete lineup of new RTX 50 Series GPUs in Q1 2025. According to the latest rumors, not only will the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 launch in January, but four more cards will debut in early 2025 as well. </p>



<p>According to the Chinese forum Board Channels (h/t <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/rumors-suggest-nvidia-could-launch-rtx-5070-in-february-rtx-5060-series-already-in-march" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>), Nvidia will also launch the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti in February 2025. Those will be followed up by the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti in March.</p>



<p>It’s also mentioned that there is no current plan for a Super models in the near future.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The latest news reveals that the release dates for the NVIDIA RTX50 series are mostly confirmed. This time, the various models of the RTX50 series may be launched rather quickly, with a near-monthly release schedule. Based on the information available, the estimated release timeline is as follows:</p>



<p>The tentative release dates for the RTX50 series have been set. At CES in January 2025, NVIDIA will launch the RTX5090D and 5080 series. In February, the RTX5070TI and 5070 series will be released, followed by the RTX5060TI and 5060 series in March. This means the entire lineup will be released within Q1 of 2025. As of now, there are no plans for any SUPER models.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rumors have been running about the pending launch of Nvidia’s next generation of graphics cards. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-to-launch-three-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-at-ces-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their core counts and memory</a> details to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-50-series-leaks-reveal-memory-and-power-totals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how much power</a> they’ll consume, everything has been trickling out in recent months. However, this is the first time any mention of Ti variants has happened.</p>



<p>Please keep in mind that none of these rumors have been confirmed so take the information with a grain of salt for now. Nvidia “does not comment on rumor and speculation”.</p>



<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will give his keynote presentation at CES 2025 on January 6. The new graphics cards are expected to be revealed during the event where an official release date for the Nvidia RTX 50 Series should be announced.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-final-preview.1011069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Two hours isn't enough time to see all the branching stories, admire all the beautiful graphics, and discover all the secrets within the world of STALKER 2. But it is enough to be left impressed. When I wasn't taking stock of my paltry ammunition levels and hunger gauge, I was looking out at beautiful fields of red poppy flowers. When I wasn’t getting distracted by an interesting side quest I was doing my best to lure the mutants into an anomaly trap. And while it was over just when it felt like it was getting extra good, it had still left its impression. The impression that the team at GSC Game World has created something special with STALKER 2.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</h3></div></output><p>I will preface all this by admitting that I am not a STALKER exper meaning I have not played the 2009 hits. But I probably should be, because I am a huge fan of games that offer us various options for dealing with a story scenario – especially those where one seemingly small decision can have effects that ripple through the rest of your playthrough. That’s what this series (which began with 2007’s Shadow of Chernobyl and was built on in Call of Pripyat in 2009) is best known for, and it’s what stuck with me the most from my handful of hours with STALKER 2. I kept thinking about the decisions I had made and wondering if I had made a mistake by choosing a violent, guns-blazing approach and wondering if I should have tried a stealthy or even fully peaceful one, but STALKER 2 takes it several steps further. There are times you’ll have NPCs abruptly end a quest without rewarding you because you’ve looted the body of their dead friend, for example. Have that happen a couple of times and it’ll give you pause even when you’re doing the kind of routine task that you normally wouldn’t even think about. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’ll have NPCs abruptly end a quest without rewarding you because you’ve looted the body of their dead friend.</p></div><p>Our demo began with an Enter the Zone trailer cinematic before we were unleashed into a small field area covered by the darkness of night where we were hunting for anomalies. These are dangerous areas that have been disturbed in the irradiated area and can reveal powerful artifacts with special attributes on them. And on the graphics front, for both PC and Xbox, these areas look stunning on both platforms. </p><p>This introductory sequence has us meet Skif. We still don’t know much about Skif, but we did learn that he seems to be well-versed with the new technology of STALKER 2, such as the Gilka-1 detector that you can flip open and use to search for artifacts as it beeps louder and louder when approaching the correct area. STALKER 2 artifacts are basically small objects that give you benefits like a faster stamina recharge. While attempting to plant and charge a separate larger Topaz Scanner at three such anomaly locations, I’ll yadda-yadda-yadda over some spoilers here but after a dramatic moment, we wind up in the open-world section of STALKER 2 where our journey really begins – with a main quest that we quickly find which sent us on a search for an individual named Squint.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But before discovering the Squint questline I was surprised by just how much could happen in the open world. One example was an encounter with some unsavory folks trying to attack a character bunkered down in their home. Once I took them out by sneaking around behind them and making quick work of them with a sidearm shot to the noggin I was introduced to a new NPC character. No matter who you meet in STALKER 2, the character models express emotion, and the somber mood is on full display as you sit around campfires on a brief break. This particular new character sent me on a quest to check on his friend, and a chain of other small quests unlocked because I opted to help this one individual who I could have simply walked past had I been mainlining the story missions. I found it interesting because it was an early example of how one small side-quest could begin branching out into a larger, and more involved story beat that I could have easily missed.</p><p>Not only are there human enemies to worry about which will usually have your standard arsenal, but there are also the larger more unpredictable Flesh Mutants, and Bloodsuckers who are extra deadly and can make short work of you if you’re not careful. As well as fields of poppy flowers to navigate (the latter of which sounds quite nice but will put you to sleep forever if you wander too far off the main pathways). Not only does this keep combat and the wastelands of the exclusion zone interesting, but it also offers moments of awe as you look out at the beautiful red sea of poppy flowers knowing you'll need to go in there and carefully navigate it to complete your objective.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>When I finally did find Squint, I was given two options: Confront him with violence and head back to base, or help him survive and be sent on a completely different story branch with him. At first, I took the violent approach, but when I realized it felt a bit anticlimactic to end the journey with a gunfight, so I loaded up a save just before the encounter and went the other way. I couldn’t help but remember the hundreds of hours I played Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas – some of my favorite games ever – and experienced that same lingering doubt as to whether or not I made the right decision in a given situation. It may not be special, and a lot of games have used this before, but I hadn’t realized how much I missed this level of nuance. While games like Cyberpunk offered interesting beats to explore, a lot of the stories wound up at the same place. I’m left hopeful that the branching paths can result in some wildly different results in STALKER 2’s case.</p><p>This brief session with STALKER 2, which seemed to start us at the very beginning of the game reminded me just how great a branching style of storytelling can be from a gameplay perspective. Specifically when it’s interwoven as it has been here with STALKER 2. I can’t wait to see what else is in store for the full experience and am able to discover just how far things can unravel.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I couldn’t help but remember the hundreds of hours I played Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas – some of my favorite games ever – and experienced that same lingering doubt as to whether or not I made the right decision in a given situation.</p></div><p>Beyond the branches of storytelling you can explore, and the pretty graphics, I also found it really refreshing to be challenged with managing resources like ammunition and food to ensure survival. If you don’t eat enough you’ll fatigue easier and that means worse aim or less stamina with which to run away from a conflict. If you run out of bullets your knife probably won’t cut it in many situations, but you can try to instead use the environment to your advantage by luring opponents into an anomaly or simply convincing them to let you “help” them from a better vantage point. This kind of resource management lends nicely to the overall feeling this oppressive world is trying to convey and it reminds you that every fight should be considered a calculated risk. Do I unload with my AK ammo, or do I try to use a bit of stealth here? Can I get away with using a pistol or do I need to get extra aggressive with an assault rifle for the bigger enemies? Do I tackle this during the night when I can use darkness to my advantage, or would I rather use the sunlight to my advantage for clearer sight? The fact that the designers at GSC Gameworld have struck a balance with how much they give you, at least early on, with the scenarios you’re put in feels like it’s in a great spot right now. Hopefully, that sticks for the rest of STALKER 2 and you don’t become overpowered by the end of the campaign, because this feeling of desperation is what it’s all about.</p><p>I’m left with an eagerness to get back into the world and see what other trouble Skif gets into. Even though November 20 is now less than two months away, STALKER 2 can’t come soon enough.

But obviously James Bond is a different IP. It's a huge IP. It's not our IP. It's actually the first IP that is not our original IP from ground up," Abrak says. </p><p>"But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story. So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future</p></div><p>IO Interactive has become famous for stealth games thanks to its work with the Hitman series, which is notable for its open-ended design and wry sense of humor (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/17/sean-bean-will-die-once-more-in-hitman-2">you get to assassinate Sean Bean!</a>). The owners of the James Bond IP were apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-owner-didnt-want-another-video-game-until-hitman-developer-pitched-project-007">leery of another game based on 007</a> given the franchise's mixed track record outside of Goldeneye, but IO Interactive was able to convince them otherwise. At the moment, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-franchise-on-hiatus-as-io-interactive-focuses-on-james-bond-game">Hitman franchise is on hiatus</a> while the studio focuses on other projects, but IO Interactive did release a compilation of the Hitman trilogy called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">World of Assassination</a> in 2023.</p><h2>The James Bond franchise remains "extremely powerful"</h2><p>Since IO Interactive announced that it was working on a Bond game back in 2020, MGM has released No Time to Die, which was a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-time-to-die-review">generally well-received sendoff to Daniel Craig</a>. Craig's departure means that the Bond franchise is currently between Bonds, but Abrak says that the license is still very powerful.</p><p>"When we look at the movies, it's one of the top three IPs out there, it's extremely powerful also because it's been, what, almost 15 years since the last game. So it's been a long time. It definitely is something that is not overexposed in gaming. We actually see that as a strength that we can do something very special and hopefully... There's a lot of people out there who think about GoldenEye as the classic. And I love that game as well myself," Abrak says. </p><p>"I don't want to speak too big about it, but I just hope we'll do a thing that will define James Bond in gaming for years to come. And that is not only one game, but that we create a universe for gamers to own for many years to come that we can grow with that next to the Bond on the movies."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Abrak praised the producers of the films for being able to "reinvent Bond throughout the years and keep that IP relevant" and said that IO Interactive have "big, big shoes to fill." Like the legendary secret agent himself, a Project 007 reveal remains frustratingly elusive, but Abrak says that IO Interactive will share more in "due time."</p><p>"I don't have an update today, but believe me, it's itching here as well to be talking about it soon. So we are following our plans. The production's going amazingly well and we will soon be talking more about it. I know it was a little teaser, not a lot of information, but there's a lot of cool stuff coming up," Abrak says. "We are also very excited and when we are ready with that, we'll be opening up."</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

Sony has already revealed Eve from Stellar Blade and the Helldivers. “However, as for who is next, well that’s for you to find out,” teased Doucet. “So, get busy rescuing.”</p><p>Doucet then teased more post-launch support for Astro Bot, saying: “That’s all we have for today, however watch this space as there may be even more surprises coming soon.”</p><p>Sony's critically acclaimed PS5-exclusive 3D platformer features 173 bot cameos from PlayStation games past and present (check out IGN’s feature, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-every-playstation-character-easter-eggs"><u>Astro Bot: Every PlayStation Character - Easter Eggs</u></a>, for more). Iconic Final Fantasy characters are conspicuous by their absence, however — an omission fans were quick to pick up on in the context of Final Fantasy's long-standing association with PlayStation. That means no Cloud from Final Fantasy 7, or any other character from the famous role-playing franchise.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/astro-bot-playstation-icons-shadow-of-the-colossus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game File</u></a> asked Doucet about Cloud’s absence from Astro Bot. According to Doucet, Team Asobi had hoped to get Cloud in the game but failed for some reason. “It's difficult to comment on that,” Doucet said, before adding: “We really respect the choice of each publisher.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
