          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>This week has already been one of Fortnite's most eventful ever after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-battle-pass-and-paradigm-skin-mistakes-are-the-latest-of-many-shop-problems/1100-6525585/" data-ref-id="1100-6525585">the Paradigm goof in the item shop</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ends-exclusivity-for-future-battle-passes/1100-6525606/" data-ref-id="1100-6525606">changes to battle pass exclusivity</a>. And there's still more excitement to come. We have a big timer on the battle royale map counting down to something on Saturday, which will be followed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-a-d23-presentation-about-fortnite-x-disney-get-a-free-wolverine-themed-back-bling/1100-6525630/" data-ref-id="1100-6525630">a major presentation about the future of Disney's collaborations with Fortnite</a> from D23 later in the evening, With everything going on, it can be easy to forget that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fall-guys-invades-fortnites-battle-royale-modes/1100-6525545/" data-ref-id="1100-6525545">Fall Guys finally entered the Fortnite ecosystem</a> this week.</p><p>And to be fair, this is only the early stages of Fall Guys' integration into Fortnite--it would be more accurate to say that you can play Fall Guys-style mini-games in Fortnite, at least for now. The most noticeable aspect of this being the limited-timeFall Guys obstacle course in the sky above Classy Courts in the battle royale map. You drop near the Courts, interact with the bean statue, and play a Fall Guys course for loot.</p><p>But you're racing the clock, not the other players--the faster you get through it, the better your loot will be when you return to the island. When other players are around, you do get some classic Fall Guys shenanigans, but it's not the same as a direct competition against other people, like the real Fall Guys offers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348269-fortnitexfallguyskeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348269" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348269-fortnitexfallguyskeyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348269"></a><figcaption>The first phase of Fortnite x Fall Guys is underway.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348269-fortnitexfallguyskeyart.jpg"></figure><p>Likewise, the creative maps that have been put together by Fall Guys developers at Mediatonic are approximations of Fall Guys games that have been re-imagined in a Fortnite way. Tumbly Towers, for example, is just another creative map where you have to climb a big towe--only now with traditional bean physics. The Fortnite version of Hex-a-Gone is a re-engineered version of the mini-game in which the platforms respawn after a few seconds (you're scored according to how many platforms you cause to disappear by walking on them) so as to make the rounds longer and allow them to be joinable mid-match.</p><p>All this stuff is <em>like</em> Fall Guys, but it's hardly a replacement for the real thing without the game-show structure. While I suspect Fall Guys will eventually be integrated all the way into Fortnite, Epic and Mediatonic will have to work out a couple of obstacles. And these obstacles are, frankly, so significant that it might take a while for all of this to come together.</p><p>The first issue is that these creative islands aren't going to cut it. It doesn't seem as though the current UEFN tools are able to support the multi-round structure of the game. Fall Guys needs to be a full additional mode on the same level as Fortnite Festival, Lego Fortnite and Rocket Racing, and that takes time. Since Epic usually holds its cards close to the vest, there's not enough information to speculate about a timeline on that, but we can hope it's saving it for the Chapter 6 launch, presumably coming in December.</p><p>That this first part of the Fall Guys rollout in Fortnite was delayed multiple times before it actually happened--this was supposed to be introduced much earlier in the summer--may not be the best sign that a full integration will happen in the next few months, though.</p><p>The other issue is what to do with Fall Guys cosmetics. Right now, nothing ports over between Fall Guys and Fortnite, and when you're playing in a Fall Guys map within Fortnite, it simply converts the skin you're wearing into a bean person. But Fall Guys has a massive number of its own cosmetics, and bringing those over isn't a simple prospect because Falls Guys cosmetics don't work like Fortnite ones do.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348270-jonesybeanfallguysfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348270" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348270-jonesybeanfallguysfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348270"></a><figcaption>Fortnite's Jonesy and his bean version</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4348270-jonesybeanfallguysfortnite.jpg"></figure><p>In Fall Guys, you choose your pants, shirt, hat, and more separately, whereas Fortnite uses head-to-toe skins that determine your entire appearance. Fall Guys in Fortnite would need its own section in the locker for customizing your bean. Some collaboration cosmetics, like Godzilla, are probably going to have to be left behind during this process, but as Epic has done with its drip feed of Rocket League's cross-game cosmetics, they wouldn't need to port everything all at once.</p><p>Despite the obstacles, it seems inevitable now that Fall Guys will end up as another Fortnite game-within-a-game someday. There are so many different sorts of passes in the game now that tossing the Fall Guys season pass in the mix probably wouldn't be that big a deal, and Epic and Mediatonic have absolutely nailed the gameplay feel of Fall Guys. The base is there, and ready to rock. Now, we just need the rest of it. Fingers crossed that it won't take too long.</p>

			<p>Anthem was a huge flop for BioWare and Electronic Arts, there's no doubt about it. It had an enormous amount of hype pre-launch but was so underwhelming that</p>
<p>However, in a way, it turned out to be a key lesson for the development of the upcoming single player action RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Speaking to EDGE magazine (issue #401), Creative Director John Epler explained:</p>
<p><em>We’re a studio that has always been built around digging deep on storytelling and roleplaying. I'm proud of a lot of things on Anthem – I was on that project for a year and a half. But at the end of the day, we were building a game focused on something we were not necessarily as proficient at. For me and the team, the biggest lesson was to know what you're good at and then double down on it. Don’t spread yourselves too thin. Don't try to do a bunch of different things you don’t have the expertise to do. A lot of the people on this team came here to build a story-focused, singleplayer RPG.</em></p>
<p><em>We tried a bunch of different <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideas</a> early on. But the form Dragon Age: The Veilguard has taken is, in a lot of ways, the form that we were always pushing towards. We were just trying different ways to get there. There was that moment where we really settled on, ‘This is a singleplayer, story-focused RPG – and that’s all it needs to be’.</em></p>
<p>In the interview with EDGE, BioWare also discussed why Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-wont-let-you-control-party-members-directly-according-to-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> the ability to control the rest of the party. Game Director Corinne Busche said:</p>
<p><em>This is a much higher actions-per-minute game. It is more technically demanding on the player. So when we tried allowing you full control of your companions as well, what we've found is it wasn’t actually adding to the experience. In fact, in some ways it was detrimental, given the demanding nature of just controlling your own character.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to launch this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. BioWare <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-to-reveal-its-release-date-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to reveal the actual date later this month, possibly at Gamescom Opening Night Live. Meanwhile, review all the known information in our roundup <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>.</p>

<section><p>More layoffs at Bungie look to be the result of a combination of factors, not the least of which is mismanagement. But for the game to continue, it needs to grow its audience.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Bungie CEO Pete Parsons's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> explaining the reasoning behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/">laying off 220 employees</a>, some 17% of Bungie's staff, is illuminating. In it, Parsons describes a company that overextended, expanding into too many projects as it tried to incubate multiple games while making Destiny 2, the studio's successful live-service game, and Marathon, a revival of a storied Bungie franchise. "We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red," Parsons wrote. The result of this mismanagement is that 220 Destiny 2 developers from all teams lost their jobs, which is in addition to a previous massive round of layoffs in late 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">But critically, this second group of Destiny 2 developers lost their jobs at Bungie right after shipping arguably the best expansion the game has ever seen. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover" rel="nofollow ">Developers reportedly knew The Final Shape was make-or-break for the studio</a>, and Bungie's staff responded to that call by turning out a phenomenal addition to the game. Less than two months later, they learned that their herculean efforts to make money for the company were not enough to save their jobs.</p><p dir="ltr">The Final Shape should have saved Bungie. It was a phenomenal expansion that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">received acclaim from critics and players</a>, and despite the major stumble that was the Lightfall expansion in the year before it, The Final Shape still had the momentum of 10 years of Destiny 2 investment behind it. And yet, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the" rel="nofollow ">according to Stephen Totilo's reporting at Game File</a>, The Final Shape has sold less well than Lightfall. That makes some degree of sense--Lightfall saw huge sales thanks to the hype that resulted from The Witch Queen, the expansion immediately before it, which was also excellent. Lightfall was a major disappointment, and players burned by it were less likely to turn out for The Final Shape.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348232-20240604193510_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348232" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348232-20240604193510_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348232"></a><figcaption>The Final Shape was a compelling conclusion to the 10-year story Destiny has been telling, but two months later, Bungie was hit with massive layoffs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348232-20240604193510_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Bungie leadership messed up with "our quality miss with Destiny 2: Lightfall," as Parsons puts it, shipping an expansion with a weak story and burning a ton of player goodwill and momentum in the process. But that's only part of the issue with Destiny 2 that led Bungie to this place. It wasn't just that Bungie over-invested in other projects while failing to anticipate things like how the end of the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic would affect sales. Bungie leadership also failed to invest in a key element of Destiny 2--for years.</p><p dir="ltr">Back in 2020 with the Beyond Light expansion, Bungie started to "vault" certain old Destiny 2 content, removing it from the game. Among those elements it cut was the Destiny 2 vanilla story campaign. This one decision, I think, has been quietly disastrous, with its wide-reaching effects only just now coming into focus.</p><p dir="ltr">Lots of complaints have been made about the Destiny Content Vault taking away content players have paid for. There's a debate to be had about how much removing content from the game damaged Bungie's credibility, and how the technical limitations of Destiny 2 made it impossible to keep adding to the game indefinitely, but there was a more insidious effect to the DCV: It removed Destiny 2's on-ramp for new players.</p><p dir="ltr">The Destiny 2 vanilla campaign, like the original Destiny's story campaign, worked as a guided tour through the game. It took players to each planet, introduced them to the major characters, and bounced them through content like Strikes and Lost Sectors. It certainly wasn't a perfect introduction to the game, especially since Destiny 2 has added many other major components, such as Gambit, since then, but it did at least give a decent sense of how you were <em>supposed</em> to play Destiny 2. By following the story from the start of the game and through its expansion campaigns, you could slowly acclimate to each piece of the Destiny 2 puzzle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348233-destiny2redwar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348233" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348233-destiny2redwar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348233"></a><figcaption>The Destiny 2 story campaign wasn't a perfect introduction to the game, but it was at least a functional approach to onboarding new players.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348233-destiny2redwar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ever since the loss of the vanilla campaign, Destiny 2's new-player onboarding has been a frustrating mess. In 2019, Bungie added the New Light feature to Destiny 2, a new take on the opening moments of Destiny 1 that was meant to bring players up to speed on how to play the game, which it expanded into something of a campaign with Beyond Light. But at least anecdotally, New Light still doesn't really do the job. It takes players through the basics, but does so in a speedy, artificial way that's not particularly immersive--and when it's done, the game drops them into whatever's currently happening with almost no guidance.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio tried another approach to guiding players through Destiny 2 with Guardian Ranks, a new system it introduced with Lightfall. Guardian Ranks are meant to give players an ascending ladder of stuff to do in order to "rank up," which serves to walk them through Destiny 2's content, from its easier repeatable activities to its more advanced gameplay mechanics and endgame dungeons or raids.</p><p dir="ltr">But Guardian Ranks also don't do an especially good job of actually leading players. The system is easily ignored and its importance often isn't well conveyed; it's not particularly clear that it's showing you <em>how to play the game</em>; and it lacks a lot of information and context about what the activities it wants you to do actually <em>are</em>, how they work, or where to find them. It's nice that Destiny 2 has something that says, "Okay, now you're ready for a dungeon," but you still need to know what a dungeon is in order to act on that information.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348234-20240809124922_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348234" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348234-20240809124922_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348234"></a><figcaption>The Guardian Ranks system is a compelling way to help players progress, but it still has its issues.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348234-20240809124922_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The issue is compounded by the live-game nature of Destiny 2. Boot up the game in a new season (or in the current case, during a new Episode), and you're usually met with a cutscene about whatever is happening in the game's current storyline. If you've been away from the game for a while or you're new to Destiny 2, you're immediately blasted with a firehose of stuff you don't understand. Even worse, the cutscene often leads you into a new limited-time activity as the game kicks you into the current story automatically, so you're not only confused about what's going on, but now you're playing something you didn't ask for and have no context about. It's an approach that <em>only</em> works for regular players and is totally off-putting for everyone else.</p><p dir="ltr">And that's to say nothing of the fact that even with New Light, the Destiny 2 vanilla campaign, or Guardian Ranks working as intended, Destiny 2 is just a dense and confusing game, even though Bungie has been working to lessen that issue and make it clearer literally throughout the franchise's 10-year life.</p><p dir="ltr">A great example is your character's Power level, the measure of how strong you are and, therefore, what content you're capable of playing. Power is determined not by any intrinsic measurement of your character "level" like in other RPGs, but by the numbers attached to all your gear. So in order to increase your strength, you need to find better guns and armor. You can get that just by playing the game for a while, as when you're low enough on the Power scale, every new item you find will be a little higher than what you have.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348235-20240809130051_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348235" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348235-20240809130051_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348235"></a><figcaption>Bungie has consistently improved on the more confusing elements of Destiny 2, but many of its systems are still very complex, especially for new players.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348235-20240809130051_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That's fine until you hit a certain number known as the "soft Power cap." From here, only certain activities drop gear that can increase your Power level, and only under certain circumstances. These activities are denoted as dropping "Powerful" gear, and while other gear is stalled at the soft cap, Powerful gear will drop higher than your current level. There are a lot of these activities, so ascending is still pretty easy--until you hit the "Powerful cap." At that point, Powerful gear stops being effective, and the only way to keep moving up is with "Pinnacle" gear. Pinnacle drops also come from specific activities, but there are fewer of them and they're higher-end, like raids. They also advance your character much, much more slowly.</p><p dir="ltr">And then you hit the "hard Power cap," the peak of what you can attain from gear. At the hard cap, the only way to keep advancing your character is by gaining leveling up the Artifact, an object related to Destiny 2's current content Episode. You level it by gaining experience points just by playing, so it's not something you have to think about, but if you want to hit that <em>really </em>tough endgame content, like Master-level raids, you need to boost up quite a few levels on top of the hard cap, which means more grinding.</p><p dir="ltr">I've just explained how Destiny 2 leveling works in a pretty truncated way. It took me 319 words. I didn't mention that Powerful gear has multiple tiers, or that you can "infuse" higher-level gear into lower-level gear, or what drops are offered by repeatable activities, or the old bounty system that was part of the game for years up until two months ago. I didn't mention anything about gear stats, the loadout system, or Exotics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348239-20240809130505_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348239" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348239-20240809130505_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348239"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2 has improved in providing clear goals and methods for leveling over the years, but it still maintains its confusing elements.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348239-20240809130505_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Imagine trying to follow that system <em>in the game</em> and you have a pretty good idea what new players are up against. I've been playing Destiny for 10 years and sometimes have to look up the Power system caps and differences after taking breaks from the game.</p><p dir="ltr">What I've heard from people who've tried to get into Destiny 2 is that it's extremely difficult, and a lot of them bounce off. After a certain point, they're not sure what they should be doing or what they should be chasing, or what their effort leads to. They often need friends to explain the game to them, and if they don't have any, they tend to filter out. They certainly never get to the best content in Destiny 2, the stuff that <em>really</em> makes the game worth playing and investing in, like the raids and dungeons, or great missions like the two-player-only Dual Destiny.</p><p dir="ltr">Destiny has had this onboarding problem, where players get lost in a quagmire of systems that have been building on each other and mutating over time, <em>for years</em>. Even as the game has gotten better, with better long-term storylines and more affecting narratives, more interesting gameplay systems and better weapons, improved subclasses and more endgame content, it still has dropped new players into the deep end and left them to sink or swim.</p><p dir="ltr">Imagine how many people wanted to get into Destiny 2 and couldn't--especially after The Witch Queen, a well-reviewed expansion that had the community buzzing. Again, anecdotally, I knew <em>many</em> people whose interest in Destiny was suddenly piqued after hearing about that expansion. Most or all of them played the game. None of them have stuck around.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348236-lightfall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348236" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348236-lightfall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348236"></a><figcaption>The Lightfall expansion was the penultimate chapter in the Destiny 2 story, but it stalled progress with a weak, confusing narrative and a lackluster new location that lacked a feeling of context to everything that had happened before.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348236-lightfall.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That brings us to Lightfall. The expansion was a flop among critics and veteran players, largely because of a story campaign that felt like it made no sense and did little to set the stage for the ultimate throwdown that would be The Final Shape. Good additions, like the Strand subclass, were overshadowed by weak new activities and a new destination that didn't do much to inspire players. What excitement for the future The Witch Queen built up, Lightfall leveled at the absolute worst possible moment.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's important to recognize that the damage that Lightfall did was amplified by the fact that Destiny 2 is so hostile to bringing in new players. The success of The Witch Queen attracted people to the game, but the rough onboarding meant many of them didn't stick around, so Lightfall pushed people out of the existing player community with little way for the game to replace them. With no real way for the Destiny community to get <em>bigger</em>, a stumble like Lightfall meant it could only get <em>smaller</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">For years, Bungie put its efforts into making the game for the existing community while largely ignoring the new player experience, and for a while, that was enough for the game to see success. But clearly, that situation was tenuous, and Bungie leadership's failure to prioritize making sure Destiny 2 could attract and keep new players was a major mistake.</p><p dir="ltr">To be clear, this isn't an effort to place blame on Bungie <em>developers</em>, who have vastly and consistently improved the game. Instead, the clear focus is on Bungie's leadership, who decided where to put investment and what elements to prioritize, and pumped money into other projects rather than dealing with the shortcomings of Destiny 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348266-finalshapecayde.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348266" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348266-finalshapecayde.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4348266"></a><figcaption>Bungie staff did everything right with The Final Shape, but still lost their jobs. Maintaining the game and its community is going to be much more difficult for Bungie in the future.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4348266-finalshapecayde.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, Bungie's leadership needs to deal with those mistakes, and quickly. Both rounds of layoffs have had a massive impact on the Destiny 2 community, undercutting excitement for and confidence in the game. Reports say Bungie plans to move away from big expansions like The Final Shape to smaller content drops like Into the Light, which doesn't sound great, either. Maybe that approach will keep Destiny 2 at a quality level high enough to keep the community invested, but cutting the people who've helped make the best of Destiny 2 certainly isn't raising Bungie's chances.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of the path forward, Bungie needs to make the game more inviting to new players if it's ever going to thrive as it once did--and that means investing in plugging holes, rather than cutting the people keeping the ship afloat. If there's any way to recover from the disaster of two devastating rounds of layoffs, it means creating a Destiny 2 that can grow beyond what it currently is. Otherwise, it feels like it's only a matter of time before another cataclysmic event--whether it's restructuring from Sony or just a few bouts of poorly received content--puts Destiny 2 down for good.</p>

Following yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-1-2-enhanced-bundle-surfaces-on-steam-with-new-episode-from-machinegames">"enhanced" Doom 1 &amp; 2 release</a>, developer id Software has <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-EU/article/doom-eternal-pc-mod-preview">unveiled</a> another treat for Doom fans as this weekend's QuakeCon celebrations continue: official mod support for Doom Eternal on PC, which arrives in the form of a new mod browser and the release of its idStudio mod creation tools on Steam.
</p>
<p>
By installing Doom Eternal's new Update 6.66 Rev 3 beta, players can browse, download, and play mods via the new PC Mod Preview. Currently, mod support is only available on Steam (it's coming to the Microsoft Store on PC "soon"), and it first requires players to opt-in.
</p>
<p>
To do so, right-click on Doom Eternal within your Steam library and select "Properties". From there, navigate to the "Betas" tab, select "pc-mod-preview" from the drop-down menu, confirm your choice, then wait for the new update to install.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="DOOM Eternal  Gameplay - Opening 10 minutes" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onh4PKmcbKc?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</p>
<figcaption>Doom Eternal's opening 10 minutes.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onh4PKmcbKc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Accessing the PC Mod Preview via the Microsoft Store is a little more complicated. You'll first need to install the Xbox Insider Hub from the Microsoft Store, then navigate to Previews &gt; DOOM Eternal - PC Mod Preview. From there, select Join, wait for registration to complete, then return to the store and install Doom Eternal (BATTLEMODE - PC). If you already have it installed, you'll first need to restart your PC after registration is complete. Once all that's done, mods can be browsed and downloaded via the Mods page on the Doom Eternal launcher.
</p>
<p>
The PC Mod Preview is only one half of id's official mod support, however. The other half is specifically for mod creators, and arrives in the form of id Software's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545650/DOOM_Eternal_idStudio/">Doom Eternal: idStudio</a> tools. "Only available on Steam," explains the developer, the "idStudio Beta allows community members to create and publish original mods for all Steam and Microsoft Store players who opt-in to the Doom Eternal: PC Mod Preview." idStudio is a heavy duty toolkit for Doom Eternal mod creation, and a <a href="https://idstudio.idsoftware.com/doom-eternal-launcher">comprehensive manual</a> is now available online.
</p>
<p>
Doom Eternal's official mod support arrives as idSoftware's annual QuakeCon continues, with this year's event set to conclude this Sunday, 8th August. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/quakecon2024">QuakeCon sale</a> is currently live on Steam, offering discounts on Bethesda and id Software titles until 21st August.

You don’t know anything about who you are or the world you’re in, but you’re told you must enter a remote cabin and descend to its basement. Once there, you’ll find a princess trapped there in isolation. According to the narrator, if she is able to escape this prison, she will bring about the end of the world. How you choose to proceed, whether that’s by using a knife to end her life, talking to her, freeing her, or doing nothing at all, will bring you into one of several diverging paths. But no matter where those paths lead, they all circle back around to you walking toward the cabin again and making a decision about what you’ll do next. <em>Slay the Princess</em> is all about the horror of being known. Through multiple loops, you and the princess will come to understand one another, and it leads to some shocking, fascinating places as each loop shows you new variations of the horrors you’ll enact upon one another.</p><figure id="" data-id="5703060f08638142f6befdcdfce7ed66" data-recommend-id="image://5703060f08638142f6befdcdfce7ed66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Itsumi drives her car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Itsumi drives her car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Team OFK</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5703060f08638142f6befdcdfce7ed66" data-recommend-id="image://5703060f08638142f6befdcdfce7ed66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Itsumi drives her car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/we-are-ofk-kotaku-review-adventure-visual-novel-music-1849425358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/we-are-ofk-kotaku-review-adventure-visual-novel-music-1849425358"><em>We Are OFK</em></a></span><em> </em>is all about the horror of not knowing fuck all about shit. The adventure game by the conglomerate of writers, designers, musicians, and more called Team OFK, often feels less like a video game than it does an interactive musical television show. The experimental, episodic series is an introspective look at four friends trying to figure out who they are artistically while also trying to survive in corporate America. If you feel like capitalism is sucking the joy out of art and making it hard to maintain your personal relationships, <em>We Are OFK </em>is the video game for you.

<p>On Thursday, EA Sports released the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-gets-first-major-title-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first major title update</a> for College Football 25. The update included hundreds of fixes and changes to the game, but it also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-update-causes-new-bugs-in-dynasty-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought with it a few substantial</a> bugs within College Football 25’s Dynasty mode.</p>



<p>On Friday, however, EA Sports took the game’s servers down for a short period in order to fix the issues with College Football 25’s Dynasty mode. And, according to posts on social media, some of them have been fixed, specifically for online dynasties.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We are back with some updates!</p><p>Server maintenance was completed earlier today to address the issues mentioned above for ONLINE Dynasties.</p><p>For OFFLINE Dynasties, a Title Update will be required to resolve these issues.

</div></figure>



<p>“Server maintenance was completed earlier today to address the issues mentioned above for Online Dynasties,” the game’s <a href="https://x.com/CFBDirect/status/1821983511907319966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official developer account</a> posted. </p>



<p>“For Offline Dynasties, a Title Update will be required to resolve these issues. Our team is currently working to include these updates and more in our next Title Update.”</p>



<p>Regarding the larger Schemes and Playbooks issue, EA says that it won’t retroactively fix any player who may have had their rating and/or archetype changed from a switch. That said, it is “safe to use Schemes and Playbooks menu to change your playbook!”</p>



<p>In addition to this hotfix, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-to-expect-the-next-college-football-25-title-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dates are already seemingly scheduled</a> for the next set of title updates for College Football 25.</p>

                <p>Twitch streamer PointCrow is making it a point to prove that his Goldfish is better than most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> players because his pet fish's latest accomplishment involved killing the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/"> Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> final boss.</p><p dir="ltr">Shortly after PointCrows fish Tortellini did the impossible, they<a href="https://x.com/PointCrow/status/1820705153957363853" rel="nofollow "> took to X/Twitter to announce its victory</a> (via<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24216010/elden-ring-dlc-beat-by-goldfish" rel="nofollow "> Polygon</a>). Tortellini defeated Radahn by using custom software with a machine-learning algorithm that tracked the fish's movement as it swam in its tank. It's also worth pointing out that the fish tank was digitally mapped out, and the game would respond based on where Tortellini swam.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though Tortellini was the one to slay Radahn, the fish did have some help. PointCrows ensured their character was properly equipped for the fight, and by the time they got to the final boss, their tarnished was level 713. Some of the buffs Tortellini used during the final fight included the Blessing of the Ertree, the Golden Vow spell, and the Iron Jar Aromatic. Despite being such a massive level, it's still impressive to see a fish defeat one of the most challenging bosses in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">This wasn't the first time Tortellini played Elden Ring, either. The<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-goldfish-is-better-than-youll-ever-be-at-elden-ring/1100-6515719/"> fish has gone toe-to-toe with Malenia and defeated her first phase</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To kick off yet another eternity-spanning week in noted crumbling empire America, Kick streamer Adin Ross <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/adin-ross-interviews-trump-gifts-cybertruck-rolex-rcna165225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned over his broadcast to Donald Trump</a>, the Republican presidential candidate who <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-should-we-talk-about-the-trump-thing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost got assassinated</a> a few weeks ago, but in a way that caused pretty much everyone to immediately forget. Antics of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/trump-adin-ross-tesla-rolex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debatable legality</a> ensued. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin the show by reflecting on the legacy of Game Informer, a magazine whose 33-year run unexpectedly <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came to an end</a> late last week when GameStop unceremoniously laid off its entire staff and <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took down its website’s archive</a>. GI’s own staff <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eulogized it better than we ever could</a>, but there’s no harm in adding a few more fond memories to the pile.</p><p>Then we discuss the parasocial pivots of both the Trump and Harris campaigns, with the former appearing on the broadcast of the aforementioned sycophantic Kick streamer – who gifted Trump an expensive watch and a Cybertruck with his near-death experience emblazoned on it – and the latter embracing Brat Summer, a social media phenomenon born of resurgent pop star Charli XCX. Also, people apparently want vice presidential candidate <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-walz-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Walz</a> to be their dad. Everyone’s being super normal about this! I’m sure it will definitely not hamper their ability to criticize and pressure their aspiring presidential pals when the time comes!</p><p>After that, we welcome <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borderlands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Borderlands</em></a><em> </em>into the pantheon of bafflingly bad video game movies by talking about all the other ones, of which there have been approximately one million. Paradoxically, though, there has been one good <em>Borderlands </em>movie: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/330830/Tales_from_the_Borderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tales from the Borderlands</em></a>, a cinematic narrative game that came out years ago. Go watch/play that instead.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can someday stream with every currently-living president – and also some of the dead ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>It’s the only thing that’s convinced me that Trump might be cooked. Once you’re on Adin Ross’ stream, you are slotted into a particular genre of human being, and you can’t escape. Because he’s just a butt sniffer. He was doing that on the stream [with Andrew Tate]. He’ll suck up to anybody. If you allow that into your circle, you’ve conceded that you let people suck up to you. And that’s disgusting.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, although at the same time, I feel like far-right figures love that shit. That’s the whole thing: You’re an authoritarian, and you surround yourself with suck ups.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Yeah, but the quality of suck up matters, right? Adin Ross is not a pedigreed suck up. It’s not like hanging out with Ye, who’s still a celebrity even though he’s an insane person. If you hang out with Ye, you’re hanging out with someone who has at one point in time been culturally significant. That is not something you can say about Adin Ross. He’s been a loser the whole time. He just had a lot of Twitch followers, which is not that cool.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Is this the first time that a politician has been on Kick?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> In terms of big names, definitely. Aside from Trump’s own channel, he never appeared on Twitch. I can’t really think of another instance like this [on Kick or Twitch]. The best point of comparison – a politician appearing on a livestreaming platform with a content creator – is probably when <a href="https://kotaku.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-streams-on-twitch-with-hasan-p-1845431479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AOC streamed <em>Among Us</em></a> with a bunch of people from the Twitch and YouTube ecosystems, including Hasan Piker, Pokimane, and others who are generally left leaning.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That was explicitly not an interview, also. That was her playing a game on Twitch. This was different in that it was framed as an interview, even though it’s definitely hilariously not an interview at all. It’s just pathetic stuff. It’s sad to watch. It doesn’t make him look powerful. That’s what I mean when I say that Adin Ross is the wrong pedigree of suck up. It makes Trump look pathetic because he’s glomming onto the energy of this pathetic little worm. He’s like Grima Wormtongue in<em> Lord of the Rings</em>,<em> </em>which I recently rewatched. But that’s what it feels like!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Also, Trump is doing it seemingly because his son, Barron, was like “Hey dad, there’s this guy. You should go on his stream.” And Trump was like “Well OK, if you think so, because I guess I have to beat Brat Summer now.”</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Just the idea of Barron Trump knowing who Adin Ross is, that’s the most loser-y loser shit I could possibly think of. You are taking advice from a teenager, my man. Come on. … Just seeing him on the stream, and when they gave him the wrapped Cybertruck, it’s like, god, you guys look like losers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Adin Ross gifted two different things to Donald Trump: a very expensive watch – which I’ve seen people estimate cost between $50,000 and over $100,000 – and a Cybertruck emblazoned with the moment right after Trump got shot, where he’s raising his fist in the air. This reeks of desperation in so many different directions: both Adin Ross being like “Notice me, daddy! Look at how much thought I put into your presents” and then also Trump being like “I’ve gotta get the youths more interested in me because that’s a way to maybe shift this from being a deadlock.”&nbsp;</p><p>But I still find it telling in terms of how all of this works in that Trump is massively wealthy. Why would you get him presents? But again, Adin Ross is a born suck up. That’s what he does. And authoritarian figures love suck ups. They love people who will not question them in any way and who will instead be like “I’ll get you everything you could possibly want and even things you didn’t know you wanted.”&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like, in that way, Adin Ross is the perfect kind of useful idiot for the moment. He is somebody who’s not typically a political streamer – although he’s flirted with far-right ideologies in the past – but he has an audience of viewers who probably wouldn’t describe themselves as political. But if somebody like Trump goes on his stream, he models being a suck up to a powerful figure. These people who are young and uninitiated to the world of politics, they look at Adin Ross and say “Well I think he’s cool. I like him.” He’s somebody who’s palled around with all these famous people. He’s hung out with LeBron James’ son. He’s friends with all these rappers. And now he’s hanging out with Donald Trump and sucking up to him and demonstrating that that’s a cool and good and alright thing to do. Viewers might start to think “Alright, maybe that’s what I’ll start to do in my own life, too.”</p><p>Despite how fumbling and flailing all of this appears, it does give this impression to the audience that in the face of fascism, what you should do is kneel down and kiss the ring.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah, it does also suck. Ultimately, it’s on Kick for allowing people like Adin Ross to stream. I don’t think we need edgy Twitch. It’s also clear that this website only exists as a front to get people to gamble. It’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2023/07/26/how-kick-plans-to-monetize-streaming-in-a-way-twitch-couldnt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built by gambling money</a> and sustains itself on gambling money. It sucks, and I don’t think it should exist, and part of the reason I don’t think it should exist is that they don’t seem to have a problem with this stream that happened where crimes may have occurred.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One big complaint is that the PG-13 film lacks the gore and violence found in the M-rated games. However, according to one person involved in the creation of the live-action adaptation, they filmed plenty of gory moments that didn’t make the final cut. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Reviews have criticized the movie’s lack of humor, boring action, ugly sets, and bad casting choices. And many have wondered why the film is PG-13, considering the source material and the fact that Eli Roth is a talented horror director who likely would have been on board for a bloody <em>Borderlands </em>movie. Well, that was the plan at one point, according to the film’s stunt coordinator. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/borderlands-movie-filming-method-rated-r-jimmy-odee-response/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/borderlands-movie-filming-method-rated-r-jimmy-odee-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new interview with <em>Screen Rant</em></a></span>, <em>Borderlands</em>’ stunt coordinator Jimmy O’Dee confirmed that they shot the film with an R-rating in mind.</p><p>“We always knew that we were going to go either 15 or R rating, it’s 15 in UK, for a slightly mature audience,” said O’Dee. “So, we were blowing people’s heads off. And we were cutting feet off. We were doing all of that.”</p><p>O’Dee reiterated this point saying “But literally the idea and the brief was carnage, head cutting off, feet cutting off” and that he and the crew were told to “go for it” and that everything would be figured out in post-production. But then something changed and <em>Borderlands</em> became PG-13. </p><p>“But then, you know, a lot happens,” said O’Dee. “We shot that nearly three years ago, or we just finished it. So, I guess a lot happens in post, and they see where it’s going to go and what market they’re aiming for.”<br></p><p>You might be wondering if famous horror director Eli Roth was holding back on set. According to O’Dee, that wasn’t the case at all as Roth was upping the gore during production. </p><p>“It was funny, he was on the second unit, he came over, and he was like, ‘Uh... just cut the ankles off. Yeah, get the knife and cut the ankles and we will leave these stubs.’ It was kind of like there wasn’t enough gore for him sometimes.”<br></p><p>But it seems the higher-ups decided that the best chance <em>Borderlands </em>had was if it was PG-13 and more accessible to younger people who might love the games. However, considering a lot of this stuff was filmed, Eli Roth’s involvement, and the lackluster reviews, I’d not be shocked if an unrated version of the movie with more gore and extra scenes arrives in the future in an effort to make some more money off this misfire. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sometimes I want to play a video game, and sometimes I just want to assemble a quiet little Dutch town with iron bridges, fountains and dinky trams bustling about like bumble bees. The project in question is <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/tramstertram">Tramstertram</a>. Aside from being a terrifying feat of punmanship, it's a browser-based building toy from Matt Stark, creator of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/viewfinder-review">really rather lovely Viewfinder</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Released a few hours ago, Tramstertram gives you a rotatable 3D scene with a choice of tiles to plonk down - townhouses, streets, tram rails, and parkland, all of which coalesce into larger structures when you slot them together. It's a homage to Townscaper, but not nearly as elaborate, just a small gift left on a digital windowsill for any passerby who, for whatever reason, might need to lose a few minutes enjoying the sight of a tramcar sparking and trundling along a row of trees.</p>
<p>Tramstertram comes with a small selection of prefabricated towns, including a fourth map that gives away the alchemy behind the tile combinations, and the ability to copy-and-paste a world code to share your creation. If you're not so keen on trams, Stark has extensive prior for this kind of thing. He's made similar building toys involving <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/treehouse-canvas">treehouses</a>, <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/fish-tank-greenhouse">fishtanks</a>, and <a href="https://mattstark.itch.io/coal-toy">mining carts</a>.</p>
<p>Nice note to end the week on, I think? If you need a bit more meat on these bones, keep an eye out for the "whimsigoth" cottage builder Tiny Glade, due for release this year - Kiera <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">loved it</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
