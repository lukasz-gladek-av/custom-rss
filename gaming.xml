            <p>Warframe developer Digital Extremes has given us another peek at its upcoming free-to-play fantasy action-MMORPG, Soulframe.</p>
<p>Back in July 2022, Digital Extremes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-announces-free-to-play-fantasy-action-mmorpg-soulframe">unveiled its first new property since Warframe's release</a> back in 2013. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-devs-free-to-play-fantasy-mmorpg-soulframe-shows-off-30-minutes-of-gameplay">Besides a 30-minute gameplay teaser this time last year</a>, though, we've seen very little else, but today DE has given us a closer look during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u9M88FQQB0">TennoCon 2024 fan convention</a> this weekend.</p>
<p>You can check it out towards the beginning of today's mammoth livestream:</p>

<p>Soulframe's development team took "centre stage for its inaugural Soulframe devstream". As well as meeting the team, we learned much more about the game's development, saw a little concept art, and learned how it listens to its community, as well as how its Soulframe Preludes have impacted development.</p>
<p>The gameplay shared showed how the physical attributes you choose for a mother impact how your character looks – which gives us a peek at the cinematic prologue – and then we're propelled forward to a point where we "get the next ancestor" and see our character in action with a little hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>While we still don't yet have a release date, creative director Geoff Crookes says the team hopes "to open this up to a lot more players this [autumn] (Q3)".</p>
<p>Soulframe will be Digital Extremes' first new game in over five years, following on from 2017's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-hits-pause-on-deck-building-shooter-the-amazing-eternals">short-lived team-based FPS The Amazing Eternals</a>.</p>

<p>The teas themselves – Fat Cat Brown Sugar Milk Tea, Fat Chocobo Mango Frozen Tea, and Cactuar Matcha Milk Tea – come in their own limited edition cups, and super cute commemorative key chains are also available with qualifying purchases.</p>
<p>To get a Porxie of your own, you'll need to purchase "at least three" teas in a single transaction to secure your "unique code". From there, you can redeem it on the FF14 website.</p>

<p>There are a select number of Gong Cha outlets <a href="https://www.gong-cha.co.uk/locations/">across the UK</a>, including London, Bristol, Norwich, Birmingham, Leicester, Nottingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Lees, and Newcastle (sorry, Scottish and Welsh fans).</p>
<p>Final Fantasy developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-reportedly-coming-to-mobile">Square Enix has reportedly linked up with Tencent to develop a mobile version of its fan-favourite MMO, Final Fantasy 14</a>.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi recently said he's reluctant to work on a Final Fantasy game again <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creator-would-prefer-to-keep-enjoying-final-fantasy-14-as-a-player-than-work-on-the-series-again">as he's having too much fun playing Final Fantasy 14</a>.</p>
<p>"If I take on the Final Fantasy brand again, I don't know if I'll be able to genuinely enjoy Final Fantasy 14 as much," he said.</p>

            <p>Station wagon survival 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> has received a summer update which adds a photomode, new upgrades for garage machinery, a new sideways dodge manouver for the car, and a piece of paid cosmetic DLC. This is the first of a new roadmap of post-release updates still to come.

<p>The photomode can now be launched from the pause menu, and lets you fiddle with depth of field, focus control, and exposure times, as well as overlaying visual filters and altering weather conditions and time of day. Standard stuff now, as far as photomodes go, but very welcome in a game world as atmospheric Pacific Drive's hazily lit forests.
</p>
<p>Your new equippable car ability is the Juke Jet, which literally seems to be a small jet engine you can tape to both sides of your vehicle. It lets you horizontally dodge your car left or right, all the better to avoid obstacles looming out of the fog.
</p>
<p>Finally in the free update, there's two new nodes to unlock via the Fabrication Station on the garage upgrade tree. Those are the Smart Matter Deconstructor, which processes all the junk you collect but don't want, and the Vargas Auto-Pac-Vac, which will automatically "deposit materials into your transfer trunk".
</p>
<p>You can read about the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/4370264092250180290">new paid DLC over on Steam</a>. The cosmetic items don't interest me much, but the sale of these items is what's funding post-release free updates to the game. Of which there are more to come: this autumn they're planning on adding new difficulty modes, game customisation settings, and free cosmetics, with another as yet "redacted" update planned for the winter.

            <p>A game called "Hunt: Showdown 1896" has popped up on the ESRB website.</p>
<p>Although a follow-up to the acclaimed PvEvP bounty-hunting horror shooter from developer Crytek has yet to be formally announced, a <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/">rating</a> for Hunt: Showdown 1896 on the US' Entertainment Software Rating Board intimates either a sequel is on the way, or the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-ditching-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-in-august-as-part-of-significant-relaunch">eagerly-anticipated update</a> scheduled to drop on 15th August is big enough to necessitate a new rating.</p>

<p>The listing – which states Hunt: Showdown 1896 has been awarded a Mature 17+ rating – hints at plenty of blood, gore, and violence, and tells us the game is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>"This is a first-person monster-hunting game set in a fantastical version of the Victorian era. Players use bladed bats, clubs, brass knuckles, and pistols to kill zombie-like creatures and human rivals," the summary says.</p>
<p>"Combat is highlighted by impact sounds, gunfire, and blood-splatter effects. Some weapons allow players to cave in zombies' heads or to cut off their limbs. One type of zombie explodes into blood and viscera when killed; another type is depicted wearing human skin as a cape."</p>
<p>In May, we learned that Hunt: Showdown <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-ditching-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-in-august-as-part-of-significant-relaunch">was waving goodbye to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on 15th August</a>, but owners will be able to upgrade to the current-gen versions for free.</p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown got its full launch back in 2021 after a few years in early access. Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell liked it a lot on release, calling it a "stealth survival game like few others" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-review">his Recommended review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ropz-faze-negative-rating/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>FaZe Clan was recently eliminated from the running at the Esports World Cup, losing 0 – 2 against Natus Vincere and falling out of the tournament. The team left the competition with a $40,000 prize, but the loss threw extra concern in Robin ‘ropz’ Kool’s corner, with fans questioning where his mind was at as he landed his first negative event rating ever while flying the FaZe Clan banner.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ropz-flops">Ropz Flops?</h2>



<p>Ropz is one of the most recognisable players in the Counter-Strike space. He’s an accomplished competitor with more than $1.4 million in the bank from CS winnings, and in the last year alone, he has claimed the top spot at several prestigious events:</p>



<ul>
<li>IEM Chengdu ($100,000)</li>



<li>CS Asia Championships 2023 ($250,000)</li>



<li>Thunderpick World Championship 2023 ($250,000)</li>



<li>IEM Sydney ($100,000)</li>



<li>ESL Pro League S17 ($200,000)</li>



<li>Intel Grand Slam Season 4 ($1,000,000)</li>
</ul>



<p>During the Esports World Cup, ropz failed to go big, securing an HLTV rating of just 0.95, which is the lowest score he’s received in more than three years. In a breakdown, it was highlighted that in the last three months, ropz has managed to claw together an average rating of 1.07, which is quite a drop from his career average (1.15).</p>



<p>One major concern is that ropz has been slipping since Counter-Strike 2 was released. He has been outspoken on several occasions about the state of CS2, going so far as to say it sucks and he prefers CSGO, which was taken offline late last year to make room for the new version. As he’s getting increasingly frustrated, he seems to be losing motivation, and some fans have noted that he ‘still plays like it’s CSGO’. </p>



<p>Ropz was known as a solid movement-focused player, and it’s no big secret that Valve nerfed some of the more acquired movement tactics in CS2 – perhaps that has a lot to do with the downward trend. </p>

<p>It has been claimed online by Valorant leakers that the game’s ‘Agent 26’, whose identity is unknown at present, will be revealed on August 25. This unveiling will coincide with the final of Valorant Champions 2024. Riot Games hasn’t confirmed anything about the next Agent aside from offering a tiny nod to the new character in a recent trainer showcasing Abyss, the game’s newest map.</p>



<p>It has been more than four months since the last Agent – Gekko – was added to Valorant, and fans are hungry for something new.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-you-control-time">When You Control Time…</h2>



<p>In an image obtained by Valorant Updates on Twitter, it was indicated that Agent 26’s abilities will be centred around time control in some capacity. In the shot, we see thorny vines wrapping around and shattering sand timers, and there’s a glimpse of a chrome and neon rose. Could this indicate something geared more towards a female character with a penchant for controlling time?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It has been suggested that Agent 26 will be an Initiator, joining the line-up of those characters that are typically geared towards kicking off the action and uncovering enemies on the map. Here are the Initiators currently in Valorant for reference:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sova</li>



<li>Breach</li>



<li>Skye</li>



<li>KAY/O</li>



<li>Fade</li>



<li>Gekko</li>
</ul>



<p>It might seem strange for Riot Games to be introducing another Initiator so soon after the last one, but that’s for minds smarter than mine to figure out. Many players are calling for more Sentinels to be added, as presently, it’s the most underrepresented group in the game.</p>



<p>The claims are that Agent 26 will be revealed in full on August 25, when the final of the Valorant Champions 2024 tournament takes place. It makes sense, right?</p>

<p>If you’ve never heard of The Warriors, I’m disappointed in you. In 1979, this low-budget action flick directed by Walter Hill was released, and it became a cult classic, doing well at the box office and achieving a timeless status despite featuring some stale dialogue here and there and having some issues behind the scenes. </p>



<p>It’s one of my favourite movies of all time, and in 2005, Rockstar Games released an authentic representation of the film in game form, bringing an expansive and highly entertaining title to fans everywhere. It builds on the universe kicked off by the 1979 movie and broadens the narrative immeasurably, and according to a recent report, Rockstar Games almost released a port of the game on an unlikely device.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-warriors-on-gba-suckah">The Warriors on GBA, <em>Suckah</em></h2>



<p>Rockstar Games came remarkably close to releasing The Warriors on Game Boy Advance. That’s what was recently claimed by former Rockstar Games employees close to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/rockstar-came-extremely-close-to-releasing-the-warriors-on-gba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>, which is where the original report surfaced regarding the GBA port. </p>



<p>In the report, it’s said that a former employee of Rockstar Leeds said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We were going for four-player co-op using the link cable and stuff. We finished the game. It was actually fun to play. But there it sits never to be released because that’s when the PSP was gaining momentum and we weren’t really seeing good returns on Nintendo. Nintendo at the time didn’t like promoting M-rated games. We were comfortable in Sony land, so we went with The Warriors direct port on PSP.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Warriors was a phenomenal game, letting players assume control of almost every member of the gang in a series of missions that transcended the basic timeline of the movie. In a ‘build-up phase’, players are shown the inner workings of the fictional gang that headlines the 1979 movie before transitioning to replicate the events as they unfolded in the film.</p>



<p>In The Warriors, there are also side modes that involve tagging areas with spray paint, and there’s an ‘arena’ mode of sorts that allows players to duke it out against other gangs in a ‘last man standing’ kind of environment. </p>



<p>Forget GTA 6, I want The Warriors 2.</p>

The bird flies into a window to find a woman holding a baby in her arms. The narrator then asks questions to the player, and based on their responses, the woman's appearance will change.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336710-soulframe_screenshots_nimrod1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336710" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336710-soulframe_screenshots_nimrod1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336710"></a><figcaption>The Nimrod</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336710-soulframe_screenshots_nimrod1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The stream then jumps to later in the game, and it showed off a few key locations in the world of Soulframe--The Nightfold, for example, is a hub world where players can upgrade skills, weapons, and more. The scene then jumps again to the overworld map, where we see the hero take on a group of knights in open combat while wielding a massive axe.</p><p dir="ltr">After freeing some captive animals in a cave, the hero is then attacked by a massive boss character called the Nimrod. The baddie wields a massive fork-like weapon, and it can also conjure lightning strikes to deal massive damage. Once the Nimrod is defeated, the player finds a cave where an Ancestor is waiting--but the demo concluded before we could meet them.</p><p dir="ltr">Soulframe does not have a release window as of this writing, but it is confirmed for a PC release when it does launch.</p>

What better way to follow <a href="https://aftermath.site/anger-foot-dark-messiah-kick-button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a passionate plea for all games to have a kick button</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/kick-button-all-games-moving-houses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the beginning of a revolution in which all games will</a> than by honoring the many flying feet that have come before? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we remember all the kicks that have knocked us flat over the years.</p><p>We begin the episode by discussing a week that feels like it’s lasted ten years, largely due to an assassination attempt against Donald Trump, the aftershocks of which have rattled every corner of the internet, including the world of video games. Almost immediately after it all went down, players of games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Minecraft </em>began <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-roblox-minecraft-steam-trump-assassination-attempt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digitally recreating the scene</a>. Companies, in turn, have moderated some instances of this and washed their hands of others. We reflect on <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-should-we-talk-about-the-trump-thing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what it all means</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We also dig into some significantly more lighthearted topics, including the best kicks in video games and <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris’ espresso-centric mad science projects</a>. Then we, three people who are not licensed therapists, offer some extremely good mental health advice: <a href="https://aftermath.site/log-off-cross-intro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">log off</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can amass the time and resources necessary to retroactively add a kick button to every game that’s ever existed.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What kicks do you think best represent the form?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Most obvious is Chun-Li. I mean, that’s just all kicks.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I’ve thought about this, though, because how are we defining this? There’s a lot of games where you kick, like <em>Street Fighter</em>, like you just said, Chris. There’s a lot of kicking. But it feels like there’s a distinction between a game that features kicking and a game that specifically breaks down a kick button, like a first-person game. In a fighting game, you expect kicks. It’s standard. But a first-person shooter where you can kick a door down feels more special, more worthy of focusing on.</p><p>Otherwise, I would just say <em>Yakuza</em>. Because fuck, those kicks are awesome. You kick dudes into walls and stuff, and their faces break. It’s amazing. But I don’t think <em>Yakuza </em>qualifies. I think <em>Duke Nukem 3D </em>qualifies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think <em>Dying Light </em>has one of the best kicks, because it’s just a dropkick.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It sends zombies flying off rooftops. Incredible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That usually ends with them hanging off a light post or something like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> has something similar. It’s not as well staged, but a few bad guys you run into, you can just kick ‘em. I think you kick doors down, when you’re running full speed?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>That’s interesting, though, because I saw somebody talking about the <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> kick, and they were like “It’s a really good kick, but it also feels at odds with my conception of Faith as a character. I didn’t really feel like she’s somebody who would kill people, and so I tried to avoid using that.” Because you could just kick dudes off buildings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>You can avoid every fight, I think, except a brief quicktime event battle with a boss. I’m pretty sure every other piece of combat can be avoided. But yeah, that’s the broader argument with <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>: The combat itself doesn’t fit the game. But if you do want to do it, the sliding kick and the dropkick in <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> are – if you can put aside the conflict between the mechanics and the character – very cool.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It also just feels like a kick better fits any sort of game that’s very movement heavy. A kick arises from the legs, so you can jump right into it. Much harder to jump into a punch. Not impossible, but harder. And so anytime you slow that entire progression down and start to do hand-to-hand combat, it no longer feels in sync with the rhythm of the game. Which is another cool thing about kicks: They change the dynamic of the way that you’re fighting.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>A kick is more disruptive. You can come in and out of punches really quickly without disrupting your stance or the viewpoint, but for a kick, you have to be way more dedicated. And that’s why the coolest kicks you get in games – like the <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> one, like the <em>Dying Light </em>one – they actually disrupt your view. The camera will jerk in a weird way or there’s a specific sort of animation focus on it where it’s like, for 0.8 seconds, the entire game is focused on this kick. That sort of immersion and dedication to the act is I think what lies at the heart of conversations like this. It makes something that sounds mundane actually really fucking cool and special and fun.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I do think that, historically speaking, kicks in FromSoft games have been bad. However, the kick in <em>Sekiro</em>, if I remember correctly, is really, really good. And kicks in <em>Elden Ring</em>, that wasn’t a good Ash of War, but then they introduced Dryleaf Dane’s weapons. He has one that’s fists and kicks, and then you later on get one that’s just kicks. And so kicks just got better, and now there’s an actual amulet you can get that is all kicks, basically. So it buffs your kicks, which makes it a very powerful move, because a lot of things count as a kick. So there are kick-based builds that are now fun in <em>Elden Ring</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Going back to what Luke was saying for a second, I agree that the disruption of a moment with a kick is really key to what makes it so much fun. Because I got into this in one of my pieces a little bit, but I do think there are a lot of things that are not explicitly kicks that could be considered akin to them. I included the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> shove, just because it’s a means of very forcibly relocating your enemies – making them go flying from one place to another place, or off a ledge.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I don’t know if I agree with that on a basic level.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I’m building to a broader point here, though. You could also put, like, the Fus-Ro-Dah from <em>Skyrim </em>in a similar category <em>if </em>you were categorizing it this way. But, in both those cases, you do not have a giant foot coming out of nowhere to deliver that force and, as you were saying, Luke, disrupting your field of view – causing everything to shake and move in this tangible way. I think you can make both arguments, but sometimes you just want the big foot to appear.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think I’m a foot purist. I think I’m really a foot purist. I don’t think it counts if you use your hands. That’s a different thing.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Here on Aftermath Hours, we’re all foot guys.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I’m not. But I am a purist when it comes to the form. I think it being a concussive or pushing thing is a venn diagram of, there are many foot things that involve pushing, but there are many foot things that also involve striking, and so I think it can encompass both of them, but it’s sort of a logical fallacy to believe that all things involving pushes are implicitly kicks. It doesn’t make sense logically to me. But I understand the spiritual gameplay mechanic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think I mean more in the sense that, when we’re talking about games, some of the most enjoyable parts of a kick often involve people being sent flying backward and that forcing them to traverse terrain in a way they were not expecting – or being pushed onto new terrain, or being harmed by a wall, or a spike trap or whatever. And so, as a result, these other motions that kind of accomplish something similar feel like kicks to me, because that’s what kicks in games so often do. It’s the purpose they actually serve, mechanically.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I think <em>Bayonetta</em>’s got a lot of good kicks. Does<em> Devil May Cry</em> have a boot thing? I forget. It’s been a minute since I played the last DMC game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I feel like <em>God Hand</em> has some good ones.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> <em>God Hand</em> has a lot of good kicks. Anything in that lineage, I think, is going to have a pretty good kick. But <em>Bayonetta</em>’s all legs, so it’s gonna happen. And by extension, <em>Smash Bros</em> has some good kicks, I think. Doesn’t Ganondorf have one where he lifts his leg up and slams it down?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> He has a similar move set to Captain Falcon, so he has his own version of the Falcon Kick.&nbsp;</p><p>Did either of you play <em>Dark Messiah of Might and Magic</em>? That was the game that sealed the deal for me in terms of being a video game kick appreciator. It was such an interesting game for its time, because I believe it was running on the Source Engine, and it came out not long after <em>Half-Life 2</em>. But it was pretty radically different. It was not a shooter; instead it was a first-person melee sword-and-shield brawler game, with some magic. It was kinda immersive sim-y, but a little bit removed from that.&nbsp;</p><p>And yeah, it just ruled. The combat was very detailed and hard hitting in first person, which you still don’t see that much of and definitely didn’t see that much of back then. I remember back then it was, like, that and <em>Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</em> if you wanted really good first-person melee combat. But what <em>Dark Messiah</em> had going for it was this amazing kick. Opponents would cover up a lot, so then you’d kick them, and because the game was Source-based, it was very physics-y. And so if there was somebody standing next to stairs and you kicked them, they’d go tumbling down and ragdoll around.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Source had the best fucking physics.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yep. It was amazing. And then enemies would climb back to their feet, but what this game got right is, instead of them just being perfectly OK after that terrible experience, your enemies would be pretty beat up from falling down the stairs. And then they’d drag themselves at you very slowly in this honestly pretty pitiful way. But when you’re in that mindset already, you’re like “Hahaha, I feel so evil.” That, to me, is the best kick in video games.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Digital Extremes invited Wccftech to a recent media preview of TennoCon 2024, where we got to watch today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tennocon-2022-roundup-new-mmo-soulframe-announced-veilbreaker-teaser-trailer-duviri-paradox-details-announced-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulframe</a> presentation in advance.</p>
<p>The presentation started with a first look at the character customization process, where players will be able to choose the physical traits of their mother (complexion, hair, eyes, etc.) to determine their own. The player character's mother is a Night Maiden, a role that was described as a ward of different counties in the part of the world where the game is set.</p>
<p>The developers then moved to discuss the Warsongs Prologue, a Fable introducing the world, its characters, and beasts. It's a sneak peek at an experimental approach to choices and character design. As an Envoy, players must heal the Ode curse to restore the forgotten culture and memories to the beings of Alca.</p>
<p>Ancestry is a big theme in Soulframe. Players will gather various Ancestors in the Nightfold (a sort of parallel dimension) to make use of their skills. In the presentation, Digital Extremes introduced Verminia, the Rat Witch, who can enhance the customization of cosmetics while also assisting in crafting potions, elixirs, and other tinctures. Interestingly, we got confirmation that you can go back to the Nightfold from anywhere in the world as long as there is no enemy in the vicinity, which will allow you to craft things easily or just change gear as needed.</p>

<p>Digital Extremes is calling Soulframe's structure Overworld, a 'very large' overworld. Later, during the Q&amp;A, I asked for a comparison with Warframe's open zones and was told that just the starting island is twice as big as the Plains of Eidolon. Still, the studio is spending much time on adding content density rather than just focusing on map size.</p>
<p>The developers also provided a first look at a new enemy called Nimrod, who manipulates thunder and lighting while wielding a devastating tesla-coiled melee staff.</p>
<p>We then learned that the next game from Warframe's developers will launch in some form of early access later this year. Preludes (the current Pre-Alpha build) is going to be opened to everyone at some point this Fall, though the developers warned it might be rough at first, just like Warframe when it launched in 2013. Soulframe Creative Director Geoff Crookes said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The closed testing we’ve been doing with our community has been so impactful; we’ve learned a ton, and we continue to listen and learn each day. We’re hoping to open this up to a lot more players this Fall. Everything is still rough around the edges, but that’s part of our style - the feedback is important to us, and we really do iterate on it regularly.</em></p>
<p>There will be some Founder's Packs things, but Digital Extremes will try to make it 'less exclusive' than Warframe's.</p>

<p>Netflix has enjoyed a successful push into the games industry, with the platform’s more interactive elements peaking in popularity with the introduction of classic Grand Theft Auto games. To that end, the streaming titan has reiterated that it has more than 80 games in development, many of which are based on ‘specific Netflix IP’, such as the Squid Game title that was recently given a release window.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-very-different-types-of-games">‘Very Different Types of Games’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/18/netflix-nflx-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent earnings call</a>, Netflix’s representatives stressed that the playing field is set to become more diverse. While the company has been able to capitalise quite quickly on ‘interactive narrative games’, a diversification effort is in the pipeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have lots more, including very different types of games yet to come in the quarters and years ahead.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s ultimately a mission to keep users on-platform when the inevitable pause between seasons lands. Netflix wants to keep subscribers engaged, even when their favourite show is taking a break or has hit a lull. That was a sentiment raised by Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO at Netflix:</p>

<p>I think our opportunity here to serve super fandom with games is really fun and remarkable. I think the idea of being able to take a show and give the super fan a place to be in between seasons, and even beyond that, to be able to use the game platform to introduce new characters, the new storylines or new plot twists, now, you could do those kinds of things and then they could then materialize in the next season, or in the sequel to the film.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Netflix has released several show- and movie-themed games on the platform, including the likes of of:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Queen’s Gambit Chess</li>



<li>Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales</li>



<li>Too Hot to Handle: Love is a Game</li>
</ul>



<p>And of course, indie developers have flocked to the platform to use it as a staging ground to bring their games to a new and thriving market. Pretty soon, consoles will be a thing of the past as users just turn on their television, grab a remote, and start streaming or downloading games through an application like Netflix. That’s what Xbox is aiming for with Game Pass, of course – why not Netflix, too?</p>

<p>Until July 25, Epic Games is offering Maid of Sker for free on the Epic Games Store (on PC). This is one of the most chilling games I’ve ever played, and it boasts some seriously innovative elements. It’s also beautiful, featuring a gorgeous world, masterful set pieces, and a stunning soundtrack that’s borderline ethereal. </p>



<p>It’s 100% off on the Epic Games Store – that’s a <strong>sweet </strong>deal.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-even-breathe">Don’t Even Breathe</h2>



<p>Maid of Sker was released in 2020 by Wales Interactive, the talented team that also recently released Sker Ritual, a Call of Duty Zombies-like wave survival game that features some of the grotesque enemies from Maid of Sker. Today, it’s available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>In this puzzling horror game, you’re challenged with surviving the many threats lurking in the darkness in a remote hotel, with the game taking on inspiration from the likes of Outlast and Resident Evil. It’s one of those games that restricts you by making you unable to fight back, so your survival is dependent on running and hiding, or using a gadget to stun enemies. </p>



<p>One of the most innovative elements in Maid of Sker is the way enemies interact with the environment, relying on <strong>listening </strong>to catch the player out. When trying to navigate past enemies, players need to watch their every step, even going so far as to hold their breath to avoid alerting terrifying creatures and faceless hunters. </p>



<p>It might have some questionable design elements here and there, but that’s just me being honest. As a horror game, it’s fantastic, and as it’s <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/maid-of-sker-2ae24e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">free now on the Epic Games Store</a>, it’s the perfect time to try it out.</p>

<p>It’s official – Bethesda Game Studios is the first Microsoft studio to unionise, having joined force under the CWA banner fully. In recent news, it was confirmed that workers at Bethesda Game Studios’ Dallas, Rockville, and Austin studios had formed a ‘wall-to-wall’ union. Microsoft has formally recognised this union and presently, there’s no conflict.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stronger-together">Stronger Together</h2>



<p>In a press release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-microsoft-game-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picked up by IGN</a>, the move was celebrated by Mandi Parker, senior system designer at Bethesda Game Studios:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are so excited to announce our union at Bethesda Game Studio and join the movement sweeping across the video game industry. It is clear that every worker can benefit from bringing democracy into the workplace and securing a protected voice on the job. We’re thrilled to get down to brass tacks and win a fair contract, proving that our unity is a source of real power to positively shape our working conditions, our lives, and the company as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>More than two years ago, when Microsoft started to lock down the Activision acquisition, the tech titan stressed it wouldn’t stop AB from unionising post-purchase. It has made good on those promises by not standing in the way of Bethesda Game Studios’ unionisation efforts. BSG isn’t alone in this, though. Over time, team unionising in the games industry has become a trend, and it has been gathering pace since drama unfolded over the last year-and-a-half with layoffs and shutdowns occurring almost daily.</p>



<p>Johnny Brown, the president of CWA Local 2108, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In a groundbreaking achievement, the dedicated professionals at Bethesda Game Studios have demonstrated that, no matter your job title, you too can benefit from having a union. Through securing a protected voice on the job, workers are taking a step forward to negotiating better working conditions, helping to raise standards across the industry.

<p>"Joining in solidarity with our fellow members at ZeniMax Workers, OneBGS_MTL, and all of CWA Union, we push for increased job security, compensation transparency, and flexibility to continue creating the games we love."</p>
<p>The statement concludes with: "As we work towards our first contract with Microsoft, we hope you'll join us in voicing your support as we serve as an example for all, into the next era of game development."</p>
<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1814441444624445637">reportedly</a> "recognised the union".</p>
<p>Bethesda is just one of several studios that have moved to unionise in response to more than 15,000 job cuts and studio closures over the last 18 months. Back in April, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-100-avalanche-studios-developers-are-unionising">Just Cause developer Avalanche confirmed plans to enter a collective bargaining agreement with Swedish unions</a>.</p>
<p>GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">took a closer look at the layoffs for Eurogamer</a>, offering insight into what, exactly, is going on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>When <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23758032/capcom-showcase-2023-news-trailers">debuted during Capcom’s digital summer showcase last year</a>, I didn’t pay much attention. It looked like a high-concept action RPG based in Japanese mythology that took some of its artistic cues from another one of Capcom’s highly stylized games, <em>Okami</em>. And while I have nothing but love for action RPGs and Japanese folklore, nothing in that initial trailer, nor the ones that followed, showed me enough of what the game was about to be interesting.</p><p>It was only after trying the game’s demo at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">this year’s Summer Game Fest</a>, and later getting my hands on a copy, that I finally <em>got it. </em>And damn is this game worth getting into.</p><p>In <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, you play as Soh, the guardian of the priestess Yoshiro who you must protect and guide through the land helping her purge it of evil demons. In an email to <em>The Verge,</em> art and game director Shuichi Kawata wrote that it wasn’t intentional that the marketing surrounding <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> made it unclear what kind of game it was. </p><p>“This title is a mix of several genres,” Kawata wrote. “And we imagined the possibility that there would be a range of impressions people would have.”</p><p><small>I defy you to guess what kind of game this is based on this launch trailer.</small></p><p>Kawata described <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> as a “maiden” defense game. Gameplay is divided into three parts: day, night, and a base-building cycle. During the day, Soh goes about mountain villages blighted by demonic corruption. He cleanses the corruption and rescues villagers who will help him in the night cycle to come. At night, demons attack, hoping to make their way to Yoshiro to kill her. To stop them, Soh assigns villagers different jobs, each with their own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, and positions them throughout the village to prevent the demons from reaching Yoshiro. Once Yoshiro gets to the end of a village, it is permanently cleansed, making it a new base Soh and the villagers must repair before moving on to the next location.</p><p>I love how <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> cleverly iterates on tower defense games. You assign roles to villagers with crystals, a resource gained through defeating demons at night and cleansing a village in the day. Not every villager can perform every role, and some roles aren’t combat viable, though they have other benefits. During a day cycle, I might assign a couple of my people to the thief role, sending them out to dig up more crystals or rations that act as health potions for Soh and the villagers. But thieves are useless at night, requiring me to burn up precious time and crystals to reassign and redeploy them. Sometimes, I might not have enough crystals, having used them all to buy the expensive sumo wrestler role — who draws demons’ attention to themselves and away from Yoshiro — or the acetic who uses their power to freeze demons in their place, making them easy pickings for the archer’s bow or the woodcutter’s axe.</p><div><p><em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> offered the kind of challenge that makes my puzzle and strategy-obsessed brain sizzle with excitement</p></div><p>In addition to simply completing a stage, each village battle also comes with a set of special parameters that, if met, will get you extra goodies. One parameter required that I use no more than 1,900 crystals. While that initially seemed trivial, that goal got a lot harder to meet because that stage <em>also</em> required that I give 1,500 crystals to Yoshiro to complete it. I was then left with only 400 crystals for my villagers — an extremely tight budget when the basic roles like the archer and the woodcutter are 50 crystals a pop, while the more powerful roles cost between 150 to 300. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</p><div><figcaption>The woodcutter is one of your basic villager roles, specializing in melee attacks.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Capcom</cite></p></div></div><p>I really enjoyed that tension between strategic assignment and deployment. Do I spend the crystals to get the powerful roles, leaving me with fewer defenders? Or do I risk my larger but weaker army getting overrun? <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> is also special in that it never fell into the trap of being too trivial. In other tower defense games, it’s possible to set your defenses so well that you can sit back and watch the game play itself. That never happened for me. No matter if I had a glut of resources and well-placed villagers, I always had to stay on high alert, often coming to Yoshiro’s rescue with one of Soh’s ultimate attacks. At every level, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> offered the kind of challenge that makes my puzzle and strategy-obsessed brain sizzle with excitement.</p><p>While it’s not a prominent feature, there’s also an interesting bit of narrative to the game. Each villager you rescue has a name and a bio, and I enjoyed reading their stories and how they all intertwined. These people became more than nameless units to throw at a demonic horde, but members of a living, breathing community made up of married couples, family, and friends. It made for a beautiful message that reminded me of the aphorism “we all we got.”</p><p>In <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>, Soh is the only one with martial training while everyone else is farmers, fishermen, and housewives. Instead of waiting for outside help or succumbing to the relentless demons, those ordinary people took up what little arms they had to defend their homes and families. In a political climate that seems determined to roll back protections for women, queer people, and people of color, it’s nice to see that message. Help isn’t coming — we are the help. It’s a sentiment supported by what Kawata shared as <em>Kunitsu-Gami’s</em> main theme. </p><p>“Challenge is the driving ethos for this game,” he wrote. “We face various conditions seriously and push forward without fear.”</p><p><small><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is out now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
