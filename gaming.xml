            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24262053/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a long time coming for <em>Starfield</em> players. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc">Bethesda’s sci-fi take on <em>Skyrim</em> originally launched last summer</a>, and while there have been some updates and improvements since then, it’s taken more than a year for the game to get its first major expansion. This lead-up means there’s a lot riding on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172097/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-xbox-bethesda-release-date-trailer-date"><em>Shattered Space</em></a> — which is a perfectly fine addition to the game that also feels incredibly underwhelming. After a promising setup, it ends up mostly being more of the same.</p><p>Things start, as they so often do in expansions, with a distress call. This one leads you to a derelict space station that is brimming with ghostly apparitions and which eventually whisks you away to the home planet of the House Va’ruun, a religious sect that worships a giant serpent. There, you learn the Va’ruun have been beset by a calamity that has caused some members to disappear, others to turn into violent wraiths, and a number of other strange and disastrous happenings in and around their main city. After a ceremony that actually converts you to the church, your job becomes solving the mystery of the calamity and helping the House put things back in order.</p><p>(Note: you can technically access <em>Shattered Space</em> at any point after <em>Starfield</em>’s opening mission, but Bethesda recommends being level 35 or higher to get through it. I played on a New Game Plus save at level 32 and didn’t really have any problems.)</p><p>It’s a great premise that promises all kinds of cosmic horror. The planet you’ll explore is rendered in a garish red and purple, filled with strange glowing growths, bubbles where gravity doesn’t exist, and oddball creatures that would look right at home in <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. The main city — which looks like a cross between a frontier town and an ancient temple — is filled with people struggling through the turmoil, whether it’s lost loved ones, food shortages, or a crisis of faith.</p><p><em>Shattered Space</em> is also notable for being incredibly focused. While much of <em>Starfield</em>’s appeal has been the sheer scale of its universe, here, you’re limited to a single planet that’s dense with things to do and see. It’s reminiscent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/24/11760860/fallout-4-far-harbor-expansion-review">the largely standalone <em>Far Harbor</em> expansion</a> for <em>Fallout 4</em>.</p><p>This results in some great storylines, particularly in the sidequests, which have you doing everything from investigating a haunted orphanage to hunting down a livestock thief. At first, the religious sect seemed standoffish and difficult to understand. But eventually, it became clear that despite their complete isolation and belief in a big snake, they were all just people struggling to get by. Even the simple missions give you some new insight into the human side of this group, which, in the main <em>Starfield</em> campaign, is largely branded as a sect of violent zealots.</p><p>But how you do that is typical <em>Starfield</em> (and Bethesda) stuff. Quests have you fighting through dungeons, collecting or delivering items, and occasionally talking your way out of problems. There’s a new backdrop, but nothing much has changed in terms of the structure or moment-to-moment experience of <em>Starfield</em>. Those alien monstrosities are just more enemies to fight; the ghostly wraiths are just more soldiers shooting at you. At the very least, the fetch quests are a good chance to try out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224568/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-trailer-release-date">the new dune buggy</a>.</p><p>There’s nothing particularly bad about <em>Shattered Space</em>. And if you’re just looking for more <em>Starfield</em>, that’s exactly what this is, only in one of the more visually and narratively interesting locations in the game. But after so much time, I can’t help but want a little more than just <em>more</em>. <em>Shattered Space</em> had the potential to be weird and creepy and different, but it looks like players will have to keep waiting for something that feels truly new.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only has it historically been one of the most significant showcases for games and new hardware for nearly three decades, it’s also a fantastic space for developers based in Japan and across Asia to showcase their latest work. Along with Capcom’s massive presence at the show, Square-Enix, PlayStation, Konami, and Sega left a big impact on the show floor following the reveals of their latest games. Even as the gaming industry has evolved, TGS is still one of the most hotly anticipated events each year, affording an opportunity to see some stellar games coming down the pipeline. - Alessandro Fillari <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-monster-hunter-wilds-mgs-3-remake-1851661898&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-monster-hunter-wilds-mgs-3-remake-1851661898">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8b4d831177d9afe1d65d1c2cc67928a0" data-recommend-id="image://8b4d831177d9afe1d65d1c2cc67928a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows characters from FF7, Dino Crisis and other games.

And with over 150+ so-called “Cameo Bots” representing various PlayStation characters, like Nathan Drake from <em>Uncharted </em>or Ratchet from <em>Ratchet and Clank</em>, it might seem like every big Sony franchise and cult classic is represented.

Things can go from bad to dead in just a few turns. Unless you take a step back and try to see the larger picture, it can feel like an overly simplistic and needlessly punishing experience. My first, brief sessions with <em>Shogun Showdown</em> spread over a few different nights felt like homework and I am increasingly feeling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMno8d0Tzw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMno8d0Tzw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too old for that shit</a></span>.

		<p>We’re officially in the spookiest month of the year, so it absolutely tracks that we’ve already had a pair of fan favourite horror game remakes released. Of course, I think people were much more excited about Silent Hill 2’s remake and what Bloober Team would do, than the more… constrained remake of Until Dawn, but both games have their diehard fans. Which are you picking up?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/5/24262376/epic-unreal-engine-6-fortnite-metaverse-plans<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just over a year ago, Epic Games laid off around 16 percent of its employees. The problem, Epic said, was its own big ideas for the future and just how expensive they were to build. “For a while now, we’ve been spending way more money than we earn,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote in an email to staff.</p><p>On Tuesday, onstage at the Unreal Fest conference in Seattle, Sweeney declared that the company is now “financially sound.” The announcement kicked off a packed two-hour keynote with updates on Unreal Engine, the Unreal Editor for <em>Fortnite</em>, the Epic Games Store, and more.</p><p>In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Sweeney says that reining in Epic’s spending was part of what brought the company to this point. “Last year, before Unreal Fest, we were spending about a billion dollars a year more than we were making,” Sweeney says. “Now, we’re spending a bit more than we’re making.”</p><div><p>“The real power will come when we bring these two worlds together”</p></div><p>Sweeney says the company is well set up for the future, too, and that it has the ability to make the types of long-term bets he spent the conference describing. “We have a very, very long runway comparing our savings in the bank to our expenditure,” ​​Sweeney says. “We have a very robust amount of funding relative to pretty much any company in the industry and are making forward investments really judiciously that we could throttle up or down as our fortunes change. We feel we’re in a perfect position to execute for the rest of this decade and achieve all of our plans at our size.”</p><p>Epic has ambitious plans. Right now, Epic offers both Unreal Engine, its high-end game development tools, and Unreal Editor for <em>Fortnite</em>, which is designed to be simpler to use. What it’s building toward is a new version of Unreal Engine that can tie them together.</p><p>“The real power will come when we bring these two worlds together so we have the entire power of our high-end game engine merged with the ease of use that we put together in [Unreal Editor for <em>Fortnite</em>],” Sweeney says. “That’s going to take several years. And when that process is complete, that will be Unreal Engine 6.”</p><p>Unreal Engine 6 is meant to let developers “build an app once and then deploy it as a standalone game for any platform,” Sweeney says. Developers will be able to deploy the work that they do into <em>Fortnite</em> or other games that “choose to use this technology base,” which would allow for interoperable content.</p><p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24025596">“persistent universe”</a> Epic is building with Disney is an example of the vision. “We announced that we’re working with Disney to build a Disney ecosystem that’s theirs, but it fully interoperates with the <em>Fortnite</em> ecosystem,” Sweeney says. “And what we’re talking about with Unreal Engine 6 is the technology base that’s going to make that possible for everybody. Triple-A game developers to indie game developers to <em>Fortnite</em> creators achieving that same sort of thing.”</p><p>If you read my colleague Andrew Webster’s interview with Sweeney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23652928/tim-sweeney-interview-epic-games-fortnite-metaverse">from March 2023</a>, the idea of interoperability to make the metaverse work will seem familiar. At Unreal Fest this week, I got a better picture of how the mechanics of that might work with things like Unreal Engine 6 and the company’s soon-to-open <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/fab-content-marketplace-launches-in-october-publishing-portal-opens-today">Fab marketplace to shop for digital assets</a>.</p><p>Fab will be able to host assets that can work in <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Roblox</em>, Sweeney says. But the bigger goal is to let Fab creators offer “one logical asset that has different file formats that work in different contexts.” He gave an example of how a user might buy a forest mesh set that has different content optimized for Unreal Engine, Unity, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>. “Having seamless movement of content from place to place is going to be one of the critical things that makes the metaverse work without duplication.”</p><p>But for an interoperable metaverse to really be possible, companies like Epic, Roblox, and Microsoft will need to find ways for players to move between those worlds instead of keeping them siloed —&nbsp;and for the most part, that isn’t on the horizon.</p><p>Sweeney says Epic hasn’t had “those sorts of discussions” with anyone but Disney yet. “But we will, over time,” he says. He described an ideal where companies, working as peers, would use revenue sharing as a way to create incentives for item shops that people want to buy digital goods from and “sources of engagement” (like <em>Fortnite</em> experiences) that people want to spend time in.</p><p>“The whole thesis here is that players are gravitating towards games which they can play together with all their friends, and players are spending more on digital items in games that they trust they’re going to play for a long time,” Sweeney says. “If you’re just dabbling in a game, why would you spend money to buy an item that you’re never going to use again? If we have an interoperable economy, then that will increase player trust that today’s spending on buying digital goods results in things that they’re going to own for a long period of time, and it will work in all the places they go.”</p><div><p>“People are not dogmatic about where they play”</p></div><p>“There’s no reason why we couldn’t have a federated way to flow between <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and <em>Fortnite</em>,” Epic EVP Saxs Persson says. “From our perspective, that would be amazing, because it keeps people together and lets the best ecosystem win.” Epic sees in its surveys that “people are not dogmatic about where they play,” Persson says.</p><p>Of course, there’s plenty of opportunity for Epic, which already makes a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259463/tim-sweeney-is-on-stage-and-says-fortnite-hit-a-monthly-active-user-peak-last-holiday">widely played game</a> and a widely used game engine and is building <em>Fortnite</em> into a game-making tool. (And I haven’t even mentioned how Unreal Engine is increasingly used <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/unreal-engine-hollywood-tv-films-epic-games-tim-miller-secret-level-1236162191/">in filmmaking</a> and <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/10/qualcomm-and-epic-games-partner-to-elevate-in-vehicle-user-exper">other industries</a>.) The end state sounds great for Epic, but Epic also has to make the math make sense for everyone else.</p><p>And it has to do that <em>without</em> much of a presence on mobile. The company has spent years in legal battles with Apple and Google over their mobile app store practices, and it just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker">sued Samsung</a>, too. The Epic Games Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">recently launched</a> on Android globally and on iOS in the EU, but thanks to restrictions on third-party app stores, the company’s game store boss, Steve Allison, tells <em>The Verge</em> that reaching its end-of-year install goal is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24260534/epic-games-store-pc-social-features-suck">“likely impossible.”</a> Any major change could take quite a while, according to Sweeney. “It will be a long battle, and it will likely result in a long series of battles, each of which moves a set of freedoms forward, rather than having a single worldwide moment of victory,” Sweeney says.</p><p>There’s one other battle Epic is fighting: <em>Fortnite</em> is still hugely popular, but there is waning interest — or hype, at least — in the metaverse. Sweeney and Persson, however, don’t exactly agree about the term seemingly falling out of popularity.</p><p>“It’s like there’s metaverse weather,” Sweeney says. “Some days it’s good, some days it’s bad. Depends on who’s doing the talking about it.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For one, his stardom is apparent to the millions who’ve built it, rather than something fans need to be convinced of, unlike the supposed popularity of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/noche-ufc-deserved-our-reservation-now-it-deserves-our-1851648725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/noche-ufc-deserved-our-reservation-now-it-deserves-our-1851648725">Sphere-headlining Sean O’Malley</a></span>. Moreover, he’s maintained a McGregor-esque ascent while avoiding similar controversies, escaped the shadow of Israel Adesanya without stooping to his level of immaturity, and become the most beloved Brazilian fighter this side of José Aldo—all while making himself a two-division champion in a combat sport for the second time, having first done so in Glory Kickboxing before his move to MMA.</p><p>Granted, when fans and pundits stop talking star power and start discussing GOAT cases, arguments can be made for many other fighters ahead of Pereira. Pioneers like Anderson Silva can hang there hats on history, the Demetrius Johnsons of the world can point to their dominance, and Jon Jones has his unbeaten streak on his side (and Dana White). After duplicating his kickboxing success in a second sport, Alex Pereira has one thing left to do to before he can be included among those greats: He has to move to heavyweight and become the UFC’s first three-division champion.</p><p>As the Light Heavyweight Champion prepares to defend his gold at UFC 307 against Khalil Rountree, read on as I look past his opponent, perhaps committing a cardinal combat sport sin in the process, and plot Poatan’s potential road to heavyweight glory.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b3ace7d51088cf10f57ff9c34f2c6c1d" data-recommend-id="image://b3ace7d51088cf10f57ff9c34f2c6c1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5098" data-height="3399" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b3ace7d51088cf10f57ff9c34f2c6c1d" data-recommend-id="image://b3ace7d51088cf10f57ff9c34f2c6c1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5098" data-height="3399" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout the build-up to this fight, Khalil Rountree has repeated some version of the famous last words uttered by most of Alex Pereira’s opponents. Like Sean Strickland, Jamahal Hill, and, to an extent, Jiří Procházka before him, Rountree intends to have a kickboxing match with the most dangerous kickboxer on the planet. This in combination with Rountree’s somewhat star-less resume seems like a recipe for something more reliable than a home-cooked meal at mama’s house—a devastating left hook that’ll put the contender’s lights out.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="68b152ceaac23883e97dc0fdd11789dc" data-recommend-id="image://68b152ceaac23883e97dc0fdd11789dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="5616" data-height="3744" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68b152ceaac23883e97dc0fdd11789dc" data-recommend-id="image://68b152ceaac23883e97dc0fdd11789dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="5616" data-height="3744" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>After making quick work of Rountree, the next step on Alex Pereira’s path to a third belt is ignoring Dricus Du Plesis altogether.</p><p>We get it.

But despite how confident Pereira may feel about his chances against the middleweight champ, if he aims to create an iron-clad MMA legacy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/9/3/24234732/alex-pereira-go-down-one-more-time-challenge-dricus-du-plessis-after-ufc-307&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/9/3/24234732/alex-pereira-go-down-one-more-time-challenge-dricus-du-plessis-after-ufc-307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving back down to 185</a></span> would literally and figuratively be a regression. He’s won that belt already. Winning it again would be mostly meaningless.</p><p>As far as retreads are concerned, Pereira should only be looking in his rearview to get a glimpse at one man.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="88f5b440e4ab595ea1f3fd823a7f4086" data-recommend-id="image://88f5b440e4ab595ea1f3fd823a7f4086" data-format="jpg" data-width="5256" data-height="3504" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="88f5b440e4ab595ea1f3fd823a7f4086" data-recommend-id="image://88f5b440e4ab595ea1f3fd823a7f4086" data-format="jpg" data-width="5256" data-height="3504" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Before getting his topknot kicked crooked at UFC 303, Jiří Procházka accused Pereira of using “magic” and “spells” to win their previous fight, which is as hilarious as it is bizarre. But on the off chance that’s it’s true, Pereira’s GOAT resume could benefit from a spell that grants Izzy the courage to give 205 a second chance.</p><p>In 2021, following a decision loss in his debut light heavyweight bout against then-champion Jan Błachowicz, Adesanya spoke one of his favorite idioms: “Dare to be great.” It’s a saying he’s repeated since, sometimes followed by an affirmation: “And I am.” He said this at a time in his career when language was his own sort of magic, a narrativizing force so powerful it’d turn the world into a manga page and bend destiny into the shape of the anime arc in his head. Somewhere along the way, though, perhaps even before getting beat up by Strickland and choked out by DDP, Adesanya stopped daring to be great and now prefers to assume he already his.</p><p>Given the “last goal wins” attitude he’s taken after finally defeating Pereira in his fourth try in two sports, it’s clear, at least to me, what’s stopping the two from completing their MMA trilogy: Adesanya wants no parts of Poatan’s full power at light heavyweight. Despite being visibly more muscular than he was the first time he moved up, having absolutely no interesting matchups left for him at middeweight, and potentially having a better chance against a striker at 205 than he did against a wrestler like Błachowicz, the former champion seems content avoiding another fight with his nemesis. In turn, this makes both of their claims to greatness seem slightly less daring.</p><p>Sure, Pereira’s move to heavyweight could and should happen with or without an MMA tie-breaker with Adesanya. But imagine how much more special it’d be if it came after an ancient Brazilian ritual granted Izzy his former spirit and compelled him to complete the greatest UFC rivalry in the modern era.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eb9b5d3339722c048fc33efdb957d7ab" data-recommend-id="image://eb9b5d3339722c048fc33efdb957d7ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1782" data-height="1260" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eb9b5d3339722c048fc33efdb957d7ab" data-recommend-id="image://eb9b5d3339722c048fc33efdb957d7ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1782" data-height="1260" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This one is pretty self-explanatory. In order for Pereira’s move to heavyweight to signify what I think it could, it must follow what’d be his most meaningful title defense at light heavyweight: Another decisive stoppage over Adesanya.</p><p>Should Izzy find the courage to once again bang with the big boys, I only see it going one way if the man who’s beaten him three out of four times is standing on the other side of the cage.</p><p>If GOAT cases are built on a combination of narrative and accomplishments, then a third belt for Alex Pereira would be slightly diminished if it came without him getting a chance at a rubber match with his greatest foe. While the former would be the more impressive accolade, the latter is essential to both men’s stories as fighters. </p><p>Ironically, it could be argued Pereira-Adesanya 3 (or 5) is far more critical to each athlete’s resume than the legacy fight fans are being force fed in November.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9fc36e7e8d88649b3dda9fa0e057319a" data-recommend-id="image://9fc36e7e8d88649b3dda9fa0e057319a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Chris Graythen/Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9fc36e7e8d88649b3dda9fa0e057319a" data-recommend-id="image://9fc36e7e8d88649b3dda9fa0e057319a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I don’t think I’m breaking any news by saying very few people are interested in seeing Jon Jones fight Stipe Miocic in what’ll likely be a retirement fight for both men. Unlike what I’m suggesting with another fight between Pereira and Adesanya, there’s no drama, no intrigue, and ultimately no meaning in the upcoming heavyweight championship bout. Miocic has effectively been retired since 2021 and hasn’t won a fight since 2020, and Jones is ducking Tom Aspinall more flagrantly than Izzy is ducking Poatan, which is saying something.</p><p>In a perfect world, this step would be called “Beat Jon Jones,” as that’d perhaps put Pereira in GOAT contention with or without a heavyweight belt around his waist. But that can’t happen because Jones is intent on ending his career facing a 42-year-old coming off a vicious knockout and an interminable layoff. So, instead, all Pereira has to do upon his arrival at heavyweight is sit back and await the next undisputed king of the division.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c87cc2d421b7082fdf2168b97764503" data-recommend-id="image://7c87cc2d421b7082fdf2168b97764503" data-format="jpg" data-width="6563" data-height="4376" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c87cc2d421b7082fdf2168b97764503" data-recommend-id="image://7c87cc2d421b7082fdf2168b97764503" data-format="jpg" data-width="6563" data-height="4376" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Part of what’s so unfortunate about Pereira not getting to fight Jones is I don’t think he can beat Tom Aspinall. The Interim Heavyweight Champion has a combination of size and athleticism that the Brazilian hasn’t had to face at 185 or 205, plus he has youth on his side. </p><p>I know what you’re thinking: “You’re saying Alex Pereira has a better chance against Jon Jones than Tom Aspinall?!” Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying. Because despite remaining unbeaten, Jones ended his run at 205 on a visible decline and is now returning to heavyweight following a catastrophic injury. Tom Aspinall is the far more dangerous opponent today given those circumstances.</p><p>A win over Aspinall wouldn’t be impossible, especially with Pereira’s one-punch power and Tom’s subtle defensive recklessness on the feet. But if we’re plotting a path to Poatan’s third belt in the UFC, there are easier roads to get there that don’t go through the UK.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="59aeb044012f1678f1aad5753b1ee6a3" data-recommend-id="image://59aeb044012f1678f1aad5753b1ee6a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="4760" data-height="3238" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59aeb044012f1678f1aad5753b1ee6a3" data-recommend-id="image://59aeb044012f1678f1aad5753b1ee6a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="4760" data-height="3238" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Without Jon Jones in the picture, the pickings at heavyweight will be so slim that the first fighter to challenge Aspinall’s eventual undisputed gold will likely be either a man he’s already beaten or a man who just lost a title shot two fights ago. This bodes well for Alex Pereira as far as his hopes for a belt in a third division are concerned.</p><p>Do I think either Alexander Volkov or Ciryl Gane stand a chance against Tom Aspinall? Not really, no. But let’s face it, like other greats before him, a part of what has helped Alex Pereira’s MMA resume has been accruing favorable matchups. A realistic roadmap for him to realize three-division glory would have to include a lesser heavyweight than Aspinall. So, whether the Englishman slips on a banana peel, catches a cold, or comes down with a serious case of the yips, in my mind, he must relinquish his belt to either Volkov or Gane before Pereira gets a crack at it.</p><p>Would this make a heavyweight title for Pereira less impressive? Only if you found similar reasons to diminish his championships at middelweight and light heavyweight. Luckily for me, I’m not that boring. But if you are, even after becoming the UFC’s first three-divsion champion, Alex Pereira will likely have to complete one more step before being considered a combat sports GOAT.</p><p> Which is...</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8d1ce0b6887f8ef2d43fea08e15242ea" data-recommend-id="image://8d1ce0b6887f8ef2d43fea08e15242ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="8640" data-height="5760" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d1ce0b6887f8ef2d43fea08e15242ea" data-recommend-id="image://8d1ce0b6887f8ef2d43fea08e15242ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="8640" data-height="5760" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Despite capturing belts across three different weight classes in this entirely made-up fantasy of mine, clearly, legally becoming Jon Jones is the only way Alex Pereira can cement himself as the pound-for-pound king.

It’s all cherrypicked stats and storytelling. Nothing proves this more than Dana White’s unwavering devotion to Jon Jones. But to me, that’s what makes sports so compelling, the natural drama that occurs as competitors and spectators alike attempt to make narrative sense out of wins and losses. It’s a joy to witness an athlete like Pereira tap into such authentic gladiatorial theater, especially at a time when hype trains are promoted to fans so relentlessly the whole thing starts to feel like pro wrestling.</p><p>My only fear is that looking past Pereira’s current act with Rountree may interrupt the show and come back to haunt me. But only time will tell.</p><p><em>UFC 307 will be available through pay-per-view in the United States on ESPN+, with the main card starting at 10 PM ET and the prelims beginning 8 PM ET.</em></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-championship-series-2025-season-confirmed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed that the Halo Championship Series will return in 2025 with another $1 million World Championship event. This news comes amid the ongoing HCS World Championship in Seattle, and it’s joined by other tidbits, such as the third-person mode coming to Halo Infinite.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-again">Back Again</h2>



<p>Between 2018 and 2021, the Halo Championship Series went on something of a hiatus. It was a tough time for the Halo esports ecosystem, with few major tournaments taking place as the HCS was sunsetted with an uncertain future. In 2021, things were brought back to life as Halo Infinite was released.</p>



<p>Although the Halo Championship Series struggles with viewership and grandeur today, it remains relatively consistent as an esports league. With that in mind, 343 Industries and Esports Engine have just confirmed that <strong>another season </strong>of the HCS will land in 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Despite not being considered one of the premier esports titles, Halo has a legacy that cannot be denied. It was once one of the spearhead titles that caused the esports industry to evolve and expand, and it paved the way for other FPS games to surface. Typically, Halo events – even major tournaments – are smaller and less valuable to the industry, but for fans, they’re electrifying.</p>



<p>Let’s not forget that the Halo Championship Series is represented by some of the biggest names in esports – Cloud9, OpTic, FaZe, and Speacestation, to name a few organisations.</p>



<p>It’s great news that the HCS is coming back next year, but what would you like to change ahead of the 2025 season? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/05/sony-sort-of-delists-original-horizon-zero-dawn-on-pc-ahead-of-remaster-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launches-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered around the corner</a> and pre-orders going live, Sony has removed the original game from sale on PC (kind of), and increased the price of the game on PS4 as they look ahead to the game’s relaunch.</p>
<p>The original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> is no longer available for sale individually on PC via Steam and Epic, but it is still available as part of a bundle with Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered at no additional cost. This means you can still buy the game on PC and play straight away, but the price has been reset to the £45 price point that the remaster will hold. The original game is still available separately on PC via GOG.com for £40.</p>


<p>Over on PlayStation, it’s a similar story of cost bumps. The price of Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition for PS4 has been bumped up to £35, while Remastered for PS5 will be £45 and includes the un-upgraded game for PS4 – the £10 difference being the cost of upgrading to the new generation release, and you’re actually buying Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition (original version) along with the Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered upgrade.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s an awful lot of people out there who already own Horizon Zero Dawn, whether they bought the base game at launch on disc, grabbed the Complete Edition bundle, bought it on PC, or snagged it as a freebie during <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/20/free-horizon-zero-dawn-play-at-home-how-can-i-download-link-ps4-ps5/">the Play At Home initiative</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>For pretty much all players, you will be able to upgrade to Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered for £10. The only caveat is that if bought on disc, you will then need the disc to be inserted to play.</p>

<p>The added caveat for PC players is that Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will also require a PlayStation Network account, as is now an enforced requirement for PlayStation’s PC games – it was an optional log in for Forbidden West’s PC release, but is now mandatory and a bone of contention for PC gamers.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is coming just seven years after the game’s breakout success in 2017, with Sony and Guerrilla Games deciding that’s enough time to be able to show an appreciable step up in terms of visual fidelity and production. The graphics have been updated so that they match the fidelity found in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, and there will be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> support right from the off. Additionally,&nbsp;over ten hours of dialogue has been re-recorded with improved motion capture and facial animations.</p>
<p>We scored the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review/">a great 8/10 upon its original 2017 release</a>, enjoying the deep sci-fi tale that Guerrilla told, the precision battling against the robots that now roam the Earth, and soaking in the technical showcase that Guerrilla had cooked up on PS4. We think it still holds up very well to this day.</p>

			<p>The Bloodborne PC remaster project is being developed with great attention to detail, as showcased in a new video shared online this week.</p>
<p>The project developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a> is taking great care in the creation of the project, showcasing in a new video how much the game changes by adding point lights to candles while explaining how the game renders point lights and how much performance could be impacted by these changes. The video also showcases some of the improvements made to Yahar 'gul Unseen Village, performance concerns, and how the performance impact could be mitigated.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bloodborne PC Remaster Project is all about attention to detail" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6beXWLRYJd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Bloodborne remaster project is being made possible by the amazing improvements made to the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator. In just a few months, the emulator went from being able to only boot the game to running it with improved resolution and performance, and even managing to run it on a dated machine sporting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-fanmade-remaster-improved-models/">GTX 960 with only 2 GB of VRAM</a>. Emulation still isn't 100% perfect, but it definitely won't take long to finally be able to properly experience Bloodborne on PC, something that Sony still doesn't seem to be interested in offering.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator that is making the Bloodborne remaster project possible can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-new-model-review-seeing-red<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Blood Angels are one of the most iconic Founding Legions of the Space Marines. Decked out in deep, blood red power armor (or shimmering gold armor), they represent flawless perfection and - ever since the tragic death of their Primarch - maddening rage. Games Workshop just sent us a batch of new <em>Warhammer 40K </em>Blood Angels&nbsp;models, so follow along as I see red with my review.</p>
<h2><b>Warhammer 40K Blood Angels: Sanguinary Guard</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinary-guard.jpg?itok=XLDjV6BG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinary-guard.jpg?itok=jJmKBH1x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What the Sanguinary Guard do best: </em>The Sanguinary Guard, clad in gold masterwork armor (giving them a nice 4+ Invulnerable Save), are particularly good at holding objectives, thanks to their two special abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>How to run them:</em> If you’re really hoping to hunker down on an objective and control it with your Sanguinary Guard, make sure you build a model with the banner (bumping up their OC to 2 per model), and I would also recommend building them with Inferno Pistols, which have Melta 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means any enemies who come within 3” of your Sanguinary Guard will have to face down pistols dishing out D3+2 damage per successful wound. So get them in there on an objective and severely punish anyone who comes too close!</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-captain.jpg?itok=N329GAEY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-captain.jpg?itok=Er6YE3oM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What the Blood Angels Captain does best:</em> The Blood Angels Captain is much like many other Captains in your typical Space Marines army, with only slight differences between him and a traditional Space Marines Captain. For one, he comes with an Invulnerable Save 4+ built in, and has a Heavy Bolt Pistol instead of a regular Bolt Pistol. Along with that, he also has a Master-crafted Chainsword instead of a regular Chainsword (the difference there being 2 Damage on the Master-crafted, vs. 1).</p>
<p><em>How to run him:</em> You’ll want to attach him to a group that’s comfortable getting stuck in and battling in hand-to-hand combat, as his “Finest Hour” ability is really strong with the Master-crafted Chainsword, as it reads: Once per battle, at the start of the Fight phase, this model can use this ability. If it does, until the end of the phase, add 3 to the Attacks characteristic of melee weapons equipped by this model and those weapons have the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability.</p>
<h2><b>Warhammer 40K Blood Angels: Sanguinary Priest</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinary-priest.jpg?itok=3oF33-0q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinary-priest.jpg?itok=eAnJoqs0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What the Sanguinary Priest does best:</em> The Sanguinary Priest, looking very sharp in shock-white armor with hints of that classic crimson, is all about the unit it’s attached to. With his “Sanguinary Priest” ability, when he’s leading a unit, models in that unit have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. Thank the good doctor here, for the wounds your unit may end up shrugging off.</p>
<p><em>How to run him:</em> The above ability, paired with his other ability “Blood Chalice,” means you’ll want to attach him to a unit that’s not afraid to peek their heads out and take their shot. The “Blood Chalice” ability reads: While this model is leading a unit, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of melee weapons equipped by models in that unit by 1.</p>
<p>Of the units you can attach the Sanguinary Priest to, the best to benefit from “Blood Chalice” is probably the Assault Intercessor Squad, Devastator Squad, or the Tactical Squad because of their Chainswords (and the ability to upgrade a Sergeant’s Chainsword with something even better).</p>
<h2><b>Warhammer 40K Blood Angels: The Sanguinor</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinor.jpg?itok=625Ioydb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-blood-angels-sanguinor.jpg?itok=XRrt2KzZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What the Sanguinor does best: </em>Saving perhaps the most exciting for last (although I’m a BIG fan of that Sanguinary Guard, to be honest), is The Sanguinor. Described as a mysterious figure who only fights in the most momentous battles, the Sanguinor hits VERY hard with his Encarmine Broadsword (8 attacks, WS 2+, 6 Strength, -3 AP, 2 damage), and can pop in to surprise your opponent from reserves.</p>
<p><em>How to run him: </em>As mentioned above, his “Miraculous Saviour,” ability can truly catch your opponent off guard. It reads: Once per battle, at the end of your opponent’s Charge phase, if this model is still in Reserves, you can select one enemy unit that made a Charge move this phase. Set this model up on the battlefield within Engagement Range of that enemy unit.</p>
<p>To pop the Sanguinor in just as an enemy unit is charging, and then hit them hard and fast (this unit has Strike First), can really throw them off their game. And the threat of holding The Sanguinor in the wings will keep your opponent thinking (and hopefully over-thinking) each charge they make.</p>
<h2>Warhammer 40K Blood Angels New Models - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>These new models look (as with any Astartes that eschews the very basic army look) incredible. From solid-gold warriors to heroes and leaders that stand out from the crowd, there’s no denying the dynamic look of these units on the table. As for how the play, each of the units we’ve covered here does their job well, with The Sanguinor and the Sanguinary Guard being the two true standouts.</p>
<p>If you’re building a Blood Angels army, I think it’s worth seriously considering at least one or two Sanguinary Guard units, as their ability to hold an objective can’t be denied.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-rumor-skull-and-bones-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of Assassin's Creed Black Flag</a> may be closer than we thought. That's what insider Tom Henderson has shared in his latest report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on Insider Gaming</a>.</p>
<p>Henderson admitted to having believed that this project was still some time off in the future. However, he recently got his hands on new documents that suggest the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake was actually scheduled for a November 2025 launch, around the same time as Assassin's Creed Invictus, the new multiplayer experience. That was before the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, though; Henderson also saw an internal Ubisoft email confirming that the postponement of the new installment would affect the rest of the Assassin's Creed roadmap. As such, it seems prudent to assume the remake is now coming at some point in 2026.</p>
<p>We first heard of this project <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-rumor-skull-and-bones-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in June 2023</a> through a report published by Kotaku. That report also suggested Ubisoft Singapore, the developer behind Skull &amp; Bones, would be heavily involved with the remake. Fans might balk at this, given how Skull &amp; Bones turned out, but that game was very much based on Black Flag's ship combat and as such, the studio will have certainly researched the Assassin's Creed title in great detail.</p>
<p>The sixth mainline installment in Ubisoft's most successful series launched in October 2013 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii U, and PC. Assassin's Creed Black Flag quickly garnered critical acclaim for its open world gameplay, improved naval combat, interesting side quests, amazing graphics, enticing story and characters, and of course the unique pirate theme.</p>
<p>The main story followed the historical figure of Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, who, in the series' lore, is also the grandfather of Assassin's Creed III protagonist Connor. Players can freely roam the Caribbeans, engage in ship combat, and even dive underwater to find treasures. The biggest cities featured in the game were Havana, Nassau, and Kingston.</p>
<p>In other news, Ubisoft is reportedly looking into a partnership with Tencent to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy out the company and go private</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Like the 2001 original, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> is a dense game with lots to find within it if you're willing to scour its foggy and dark corners. With a greater emphasis on combat and a few areas that feel larger and more involved, and with new puzzles that often require multiple steps to complete, though, it's going to be a while before you can escape that town. If you're wondering just how long it'll take, that depends greatly on how completionist you intend to be and whether you want to leap into Silent Hill 2 Remake's depths to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/silent-hill-2-remake-endings-guide-how-to-unlock-all-eight-endings-including-new-ones/2900-5831/">find its many endings--eight in all</a>--and other secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's everything you need to know about Silent Hill 2's playtime and what you can expect to uncover if you're willing to spend more time within the nightmare. Naturally, <strong>beware of some light story spoilers</strong> in this article.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long to beat Silent Hill 2</h2><p dir="ltr">Your playtime on Silent Hill 2 will vary greatly based on how much time you spend exploring the town, searching out-of-the-way places, and gathering extra materials. This is especially true at key points like the early game, when you'll have access to a lot of the town and can check a number of spots that aren't part of the essential path forward. Among the members of GameSpot's team who played Silent Hill 2 Remake ahead of launch, <strong>we found the game to last between 17 and 19 hours on an initial playthrough</strong>, when we were pretty diligent about searching for secrets. If you're less worried about searching for secrets and extra ammo, <strong>you can probably expect Silent Hill 2 Remake to last you 15-16 hours on your first run</strong>.</p><div tabindex="0"

For the additional endings, however, you'll need to find new items that can add a little time to your overall trip.

			<p>Surprisingly, Halo Infinite is getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-update-march-2024-networking-overhaul-easy-anti-cheat/">new update</a>. A game that some Halo fans thought was forgotten about by 343 Industries, today announced some groundbreaking news for those who still play the game. During a Forge panel at the 2024 Halo World Championship, 343 Industries announced that they are working on a <a href="https://x.com/Halo/status/1842316353719402932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1842316353719402932%7Ctwgr%5Eea37bb3341dd1839f9adae1d399ee8faef7c42c3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fhalo-infinite-is-officially-getting-a-third-person-mode-this-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-person mode in-game</a>. This is a huge deal for fans of the Halo franchise, as this is the first time ever that a third-person mode has been offered up in a Halo game. All previous iterations in the franchise have been strictly first-person. During the Forge panel at the Halo World Championship, Senior Community Manager John "Unyshek" Junyszek and Skybox Labs Senior Software Engineer Colin Cove spoke in more detail about the third-person mode and what it will entail for players in Halo: Infinite.</p>
<p><iframe title="Community Stage at Halo World Championship 2024 – Day 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jLgH0jgAhB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For starters, they will be adding the third-person mode to Firefight in a future update, "but we also have the ability to do it in PvP and control it in Forge," says Cove. They made sure to clarify that the third-person mode will be supported at the mode level, and using Forge Controls, modes can switch individual players or all players between first and third-person modes whenever they want.</p>
<p>At the moment, it hasn't been specified whether this groundbreaking third-person mode will be restricted to multiplayer, or whether it will be offered to those who prefer to play the game solely as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-campaign-dlc-isnt-in-active-development-community-director-confirms-focus-on-multiplayer/">campaign</a>. Over the years, Halo Infinite has seen many mods, with a number of these mods being used to add a third-person perspective to the game. While this is a monumental occasion for Halo: Infinite fans, it is unlikely that any of the previous Halo games will receive the same treatment despite getting a remaster.</p>
<p>Halo has a huge modding community, with a number of mods being made for the original Halo games as well as Halo Infinite. While there are mods out there that can add a third-person perspective, it will now be much easier for players to switch between the two perspectives as it will be fully built-in to the game. However, if it isn't brought over to the campaign, it may be something that people will still need to mod in.</p>
<p>Halo Infinite was first launched in 2021 and has received plenty of updates over the years to keep the game fresh. Despite this, some fans felt that there was still a lack of content, especially in 2024. However, the Halo World Championship is currently taking place, and this would be the perfect time for 343 Industries and Xbox to announce more Halo content. It's entirely possible that there will be more announcements to come through the weekend of the Halo Championship.</p>

Senior community manager John "Unyshek" Junyszek and Skybox Labs senior software engineer Colin Cove offered a bit more information at the Halo World Championship panel, saying they'll be starting with third-person Firefight mode in a future update, "but we also have the ability to do in PvP and control it in Forge," per Cove.</p><p>They clarified that third-person will be supported at the mode level and that, with Forge controls, modes can switch individual players (or all players) between first- and third-person perspective whenever desired.

With the Halo World Championship well underway, we wouldn't be surprised if more Halo-related announcements were made through the weekend.</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

Needless to say, these Prime Big Deal Days early offers drop both editions to their lowest prices yet, by a <em>wide </em>margin. Amazon has limited quantities of each, so Binding of Isaac fans should snag one while they can.</p><h2>The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls - Ultimate Collector's Box</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379298-bindingofisaacfoursouls.png" data-ref-id="1300-4379298" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379298-bindingofisaacfoursouls.png" data-ref-id="1300-4379298"></a><figcaption>The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls - Ultimate Collector's Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379298-bindingofisaacfoursouls.png"></figure><p>The Binding of Isaac: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Maestro-Media-Binding-Isaac-Gameplay/dp/B0B2R6CGSF?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Four Souls</a> adapts the beloved rogue-like video game into a replayable strategy card game for one to four players. Designed by the video game's original creator, Edmund McMillen, The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls is a strategy card game with cooperative and competitive elements. You and up to three friends will join forces to collect souls--four of them, naturally--from the game's monstrous bosses. During your journey, you'll find loot, upgrade your abilities, and fight a wide variety of creatures pulled from the video game. If you're feeling diabolical, you can deliberately sabotage your own teammates. That said, if you're playing solo, you probably won't want to sabotage yourself. Each run lasts around 30 minutes.</p><p>The Ultimate Collector's Edition comes with the revised, 2nd Edition base set and both expansions, Requiem and Four Souls+. All told, you're getting 707 cards across the three sets. That's <em>a lot </em>of cards to keep track of, but the 12 included dividers should help you keep the collector's box organized. You also get two dice, one of which is Binding of Isaac-themed, two different types of tokens, and everything else needed for the complete Foul Souls experience. </p><p>Here's everything you'll find inside the Ultimate Collector's Box:</p><ul><li>340 Binding of Isaac 2nd Edition Cards (Base Set)</li><li>269 Requiem Expansion Cards</li><li>98 Four Souls+ Expansion Cards</li><li>Instruction Booklet</li><li>12 Card Dividers</li><li>15 Heart Tokens</li><li>15 Tear Tokens</li><li>100 Plastic Pennies</li><li>10 Plastic Nickels</li><li>Coin Bag</li><li>Dice: D6 with Isaac graphic on one side and D8</li></ul><hr><h2>The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Base Set</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379299-bindingofisaacstandard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379299" data-ratio="0.573" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379299-bindingofisaacstandard.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379299"></a><figcaption>The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Base Set</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379299-bindingofisaacstandard.jpg"></figure><p>The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Base Set comes with 340 cards, plastic pennies, two dice (D6 and D8), and instructions.
