			<p>The next major update to Infinity Nikki will be coming soon and will launch after server maintenance takes place on February 26. The new season will launch on February 26 and will run until March 25, where players will be given the opportunity to explore the Queen's Palace Ruins and uncover all of the secrets that lay on the grounds. This comes in the form of a cursed song, and players will have to help out the legendary creature Bullquet in a sweet side quest. If you are interested in what the Eerie Season has to offer in Infinity Nikki, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The official trailer for Version 1.3 [Eerie Season] is now live!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQG9MKHvB_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Eerie Season will take players away from the vibrancy and pastel colors and instead transport them to a world filled with Gothic aesthetics, Supernatural phenomena, and new challenges.</p>
<p>Throughout the ruins of Queen Philomia's palace, there have been peculiar singing voices that echo off of the walls of the palace, which has led people to believe that the ruins are cursed. Once the day turns to night, the melodies can be heard through the corridors, where the residents of Florawish have become unnerved and fear the grounds of the ruins. As a result of this, Nikki and Momo take a journey into the Queen's Palace Ruins, where there are plenty of secrets to be uncovered.</p>
<p>The initial event will be named The Queen's Lament. Once players have completed this, they will then gain access to the Queen's Palace Ruins: Inner Court dungeon, which provides a new, scary challenge to take on.&nbsp; In addition, once players have cleared this dungeon, they will then be able to visit the high tower in the Queen's Palace Ruins at night, where they will be able to play the piano beside Ms. Glove.</p>
<p>Through the Eerie Season, players will be able to obtain 15 Revelation Crystals and a new outfit named the Dream Chaser completely for free. In the Heartfelt Gifts Store, there will be three more free outfits to obtain, which brings the grand total to nine free outfits throughout the history of Infinity Nikki. <a href="https://www.infoldgames.com/en/home#product">Infold Games</a> continues to be dedicated to the community of Infinity Nikki, and continues to work to optimize the game and ensure that players are having a good time playing the game, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-available-to-wishlist-on-steam/">title set to soon release</a> on Steam.</p>
<p>Players will be able to experience the Gothic and supernatural beauty of Eerie Season once it is released after the maintenance on February 26, where the season will then run until March 25.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A giant rooster that sets a desert sea on fire every time it brushes its beautiful but deadly tail feathers. A toad-like octopus that sends mini-tidal waves roiling through a thick jungle forest as it flops around like a violent puppy. These and other majestic creatures I’ve killed dozens of times in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, and I would gladly do it again.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter</em>’s greatest trick has always been making ecological slaughter feel so engaging, necessary, and urgent that players repeat the same tasks with slight variations for dozens of hours on end. Instead of being bored or exhausted, the endless, vicious cycle leaves us exhilarated and rejuvenated. Slicing rare horns, hides, and relics from fallen prey for the 100th time leaves us not with an existential crisis but with a fresh grin on our face. </p><p>That magic is as alive and cleverly engineered as ever in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. The blockbuster sequel, out February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, presents Capcom’s long-running action-RPG series at its most visually impressive and intricately designed yet, with striking vistas transformed on a dime by sudden storms and beasts of all shapes, sizes, and temperaments living in them. It takes players to the Forbidden Lands to research a previously unexplored region that’s home to new monsters, mysterious weather events, and the remnants of an ancient civilization. </p><p>It’s a massive undertaking full of sprawling maps to explore and some of the coolest boss fights in modern gaming. I’ve had a blast giving myself over to its mesmerizing reward loop, and it’s a game I will continue playing a ton of in the future. At the same time, the few dozen hours I’ve spent with  <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> so far have left me slightly disappointed at just how familiar and unsurprising it all feels. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is a comprehensive visual and combat spectacle that still is still very much a <em>Monster Hunter </em>game, often for better but occasionally for worse.</p><p>It doesn’t feel like the <em>Monster Hunter</em> of the future so much as the super ultra deluxe version of the series as we know it today. Its bells and whistles are mostly quality-of-life improvements, and the splendor of its world is richly layered but more subtle than it’s been in the past. The formula of 1.) find monster, 2.) kill monster, 3.) turn it into cool stuff has been streamlined within an inch of its life, both to deliver the franchise’s core pleasures in rapid, breakneck succession, and also perhaps in a bid to make an infamously dense, arcane, and overwhelming series more hospitable than ever to newcomers. </p><p>The big back-of-the-box innovation this time around is a more seamless  world. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is divided into a series of large open zones. These biomes, from icy caverns to volcanic pits, become characters in their own right as you spend hours combing through them for your quarry and crafting resources. Traveling between these areas involves astoundingly brief loading screens. More importantly, players can travel between their camps and the hunting zones themselves without any loading screen at all, engaging in quests one after the other without constantly being forced to hop back and forth. </p><p><br>You can even cook up meals—an important preparation technique for getting battle-enhancing status buffs—mid-mission now. It is both ridiculously absurd and absurdly satisfying to break out the grill 25 feet away from the dragon-like Rathalos, fry up some fish, and watch my hunter’s eyes briefly glaze over with foodie pleasure before she needs to rapidly dodge away from the incoming beast’s attacks.</p><p> The actual “hunting” part of the series is more nonexistent than ever. Playing through the campaign, I simply selected quests from a menu and then immediately bee-line toward my objective. Finding monsters while simply roaming around environments is equally a breeze. They’ll pop up on a 3D map bursting with icons on which all of their movements can be followed with drone-like surveillance precision. Selecting them gives the option to turn them into quests and then be guided to them automatically by new mounts called Seikrets. The frictionlessness of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>can be liberating, but it also feels like a missed opportunity. </p><p>Man, do I love my Seikret though. The galloping bird, a cross between a raptor and an ostrich, feels better to ride than any horse I’ve ever encountered in an open-world game. It’s superbly animated and controls with just enough imprecision and lag to make it feel like you’re actually riding something while gracefully leaping over most impediments in the environment without ever losing speed or getting snagged. While this can make <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ world feel smaller and less intimidating, it’s a great way to show off its grandeur. Zipping up tree vines and down sand dunes turns  drudgery into a theme park ride as I rapidly pick up resources scattered around the ground along the way. </p><p>To the degree that the Seikret is the star of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it shines most during battle. It can serve as a springboard for hopping onto monsters’ backs or quickly pull you up off the ground right after you get clobbered. Its saddle bag contains not just supplies that let you restock important items, but also a second weapon you can take with you wherever you go. Tired of that slow bulldozer of a hammer? Switch to dual blades completely change up the rhythm of a fight in an instant. Or pair a long blade with a heavy bow gun to switch between short-range attacks and long-range damage. More options, less hassle is one of the mantras animating <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. <br></p><p><br>I spent much most of my time with my tried-and-true greatsword, opting for an iconic <em>Monster Hunter </em>archetype that hits like a jet engine but moves much more slowly. The lack of speed is meant to balance out its high damage potential, yet it also reinforces the natural physics of a six-foot person trying to swing around an eight-foot broadsword. I can feel my hunter’s muscles burning under the weight of a missed double swing as she tries to pick the weapon back up off the dirt, each frame meticulously animated to look at home in the world and also convey to me, the player, that I need to aim better.</p><p>Details like this add up to make the moment-to-moment combat in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> rewarding and entertaining long-past its sell-by date. It’s chunky yet fluid, like a delicious soup of high-stakes creature looting. Hitting the same spot on a monster over and over yields wounds that can be targeted with new cinematic focus attacks to deal extra damage and earn extra rewards. The game’s 14 weapons each have their own focus attacks, which were reason enough for me to experiment with ones I wouldn’t have otherwise tried like the Insect Glaive. </p><p>Hopping off the Seikret and onto a monster’s back turns encounters into <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> for a moment, as you move up and down the creature’s spine to avoid being shaken off while stabbing it to create new wounds. Combine it all with shock traps, pitfalls, exploding barrels, and other players and you have a recipe for making my sixth knock-down, drag-out fight against the roaring lion bear hybrid Doshaguma<strong>&nbsp;</strong>something I wish I were doing  right this second.</p><p> Story has never been <em>Monster Hunter</em>’s strong point and none of this is propelled along by compelling drama or intriguing mysteries. The characters this time around are charming and dutifully carry out their roles, but rarely rise beyond the level of glorified quest giver or exposition vehicle. A journey to reunite a strange child with his secret tribe who are being terrorized by an unknown “White Wraith” is aggressively predictable at every turn. All of it is briskly paced and does an admirable job of table setting for the endgame in which players are meant to spend the majority of their time, even if it much of it still feels like a formality before the “real game” begins in the back half. <br></p><p><br>This post-game that opens up after the credits roll introduces the “higher ranks” at which players get to hunt stronger versions of the monsters they’ve already encountered, including new Tempered and Frenzied variants which contain even more unique materials necessary for crafting additional sets of armor and weapons. I’ve only scratched the surface of this loot chase, and all I can say is that I’m looking forward to excavating it as deeply and completely as my time allows. This high-end gear bestows bonuses and enables strategies for taking on the game’s toughest bosses and, more importantly, it looks really cool. Fashion is the low-key driver of the series’ grim in-game economy, and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has the drip.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter</em> has always traded in eye-popping scale, and the latest sequel carries on that tradition. But it hasn’t done so at the expense of depth, or at least the feeling of depth. Some video-game world simulations feel paper thin with the machinery poking through at the seams. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ feels naturalistic and multi-layered. I’ve spent most of my time with it so far tangling with its largest creatures, but the wildlife is much more extensive than that, and so subtly executed that it’s easily missed while you’re focused on chasing down giant sandworms and oily wyverns. Smaller herds of giant possums, flocks of birds, and families of river lizards abound, occasionally asserting themselves when you least expect it. </p><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is at its most beautiful and chaotic when all the elements and residents of its dynamic world accidentally collide; multiple monsters locked in a turf war as smaller creatures scurry around, some trying to escape, others following their pack leader into the action, all while hunters set exploding traps and raging storms pass through before eventually breaking into daylight. I wish all of this were  integrated into the harder, better, stronger, faster logic at the heart of the game’s RPG progression in more sophisticated ways, but that liveliness does inject more life and zeal into a very familiar pattern, one that still works and now feels more robust than ever. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-ceo-says-company-will-train-new-ai-on-a-catalog-of-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft’s plans for its new Muse AI technology for video games appears to be ready to move into full gear. In a recent interview, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the company is getting ready to start training its new AI system on a “catalog of games”.</p>



<p>Speaking on the Dwarkesh Patel Podcast—h/t to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-train-its-gaming-ai-on-a-catalogue-of-titles-soon-satya-nadella-says-and-then-start-playing-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>—Nadella says that the plan is to train the AI system on games so that it can actually start playing them.</p>



<p>“When&nbsp;Phil Spencer&nbsp;first showed it to me, he had an Xbox controller and this model basically took the input and generated the output based on the input. And it was consistent with the game,” Nadella said.</p>



<p>“That to me is a massive, massive moment of ‘wow’. It’s kind of like the first time we saw ChatGPT complete sentences, or Dall-E draw, or Sora. This is one such moment.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As far as how this ability and training will help with game development and gamers, in general, Nadella didn’t go into any specifics. </p>



<p>According to Microsoft’s announcement of Muse, not only does it have the potential to assist with game development and accessibility, but it could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-technology-could-help-game-preservation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help with game preservation</a> as well.</p>



<p>The idea of AI in gaming continues to be a much discussed topic. Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-players-want-to-filter-out-games-that-use-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam users began requesting</a> the ability to filter out games that use generative AI. Even CEO’s have gotten in on the topic with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick believing</a> that there’s truly no such thing as “artificial intelligence”.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft using games to train its AI model to play them? Let us know down below, and join the discussion further in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1691/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

TESRenewal, the modding group working on the project, made the announcement in a new gameplay video showcasing some of Oblivion's upgraded cities, but the team said they still don't have an anticipated release date yet. It'll just be sometime in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">"Making games takes time, this goes double for a volunteer project the size of a AAA game that took a team of full-time devs years to make," the group said, echoing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-to-release-by-2025/1100-6510685/" data-ref-id="1100-6510685">similar statement made in 2023</a>.

            <p>Balatro, the poker-themed roguelite, has successfully appealed PEGI's decision to classify it as PEGI 18 and has now been recategorised as suitable for players aged 12 and up.</p>
<p>About a year ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-speaks-out-on-gambling-rating-drama">developer Localthunk commented on PEGI's perceived mishandling of the game's rating</a> after it was pulled from sale in some countries due to a "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'", stating "it is what it is".</p>

<p>"The PEGI 18 rating for the game Balatro has been changed to a PEGI 12 following a successful appeal submitted by publisher Sold Out Sales &amp; Marketing," the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) organisation announced on its <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12">website</a> earlier today.</p>
<p>"The Complaints Board concluded that, although the game explains the various hands of poker, the roguelike deck-building game contained mitigating fantastical elements that warranted a PEGI 12 rating."</p>
<p>Similarly, Luck Be A Landlord has also been reclassified as PEGI 12.</p>
<p>"At this moment, any teaching or glamorisation of simulated gambling automatically leads to a PEGI 18 rating," the ratings board stated.</p>
<p>"On the basis of these appeals, the PEGI Experts Group will develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorisation of gambling in different age categories, which will now include 12 but also keep 18 as an age category for games that simulate gambling typically played in casinos and betting halls."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-720p-ps5-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is a more than worthy new entry in the series, but it fails to deliver a technically sound experience on consoles, with image quality and performance issues on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> released their analysis of the console versions of the new entry in the series launching this week, detailing the three display modes featured on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and what exactly they deliver in terms of resolution and performance. Among the three modes, the only mode that delivers 60 FPS gameplay is Resolution mode, which targets 900p resolution but employs dynamic resolution that hits as low as 720p resolution in demanding sequences and as high as 1080p in lighter sequences. With such low resolutions, it is not surprising to see how Performance mode delivers disappointing image quality, featuring not only blurrier visuals than the other modes, but also some evident visual settings cutbacks, such as aggressive LOD behavior, simplified screen space reflections, and more. The game also uses AMD FSR 1 to upscale to 4K resolution with no temporal upsampling process, which only makes the visuals look worse.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds performance on consoles also leaves something to be desired, as Performance mode doesn't deliver smooth 60 FPS gameplay, with some frequent dips below the target that are only alleviated on a VRR-capable display. Resolution and Balanced mode do a better job at keeping their 30 and 40 FPS targets, though still with some drops. The uncapped framerate option also doesn't seem to be doing a lot, as all display modes run at their framerate target for the most part, with infrequent performance uplifts in light sequences.</p>
<p>With the more powerful current-generation systems struggling in certain scenarios, it's not surprising to see Monster Hunter Wilds look and run the worst out of all consoles on Xbox Series S. This version of the game not only sports worse image quality with even more visual cutbacks than Performance mode, such as the complete removal of screen space reflections and lower texture quality, but it also runs the worst, with frequent framerate drops from the 30 FPS that are far from ideal for a game like this.</p>

<p>On PC, sadly, things don't fare much better, and only top-end machines can run Monster Hunter Wilds at 60 frames per second and above. You can learn more about this version of the game with my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-talos-principle-reawakened-release-date-revealed-for-april.1117230/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital and Croteam have announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened</em>, the remastered version of the two studios' philosophical 2014 puzzler.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/the-talos-principle-reawakened-launches-april-10" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>officially launches across PC and current-gen consoles (sorry, Switch owners) on April 10th. What's more, you can check a demo of the game out right now as part of the always-excellent Steam Next Fest.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-2025" rel="nofollow">back in December</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>is a remastered version of the 2014 original, although when it was first announced, Devolver and Croteam promised it would be "more than a remaster", serving instead as the "definitive edition" of the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-release-date-water.jpg?itok=cWo5ukrx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-release-date-water.jpg?itok=BUnL2SxS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>will offer a sumptuous visual upgrade over the 2014 original when it arrives in April.</figcaption></figure><p>Major changes compared to the original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>include a full visual overhaul courtesy of a switch to Unreal Engine 5. You can expect new lighting, new visual effects, and new design elements as well.</p>

<p>Devolver and Croteam are also promising "modernized quality-of-life updates that maintain the vision of the original classic", although the two studios don't go into detail regarding what those changes are.</p>

<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>also includes the DLC expansion&nbsp;<em>Road to Gehenna</em>, which was released in 2015. As well as that, it'll pack in a brand new chapter titled "In the Beginning", which will explore "the origins of the Simulation", according to the devs.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense of some of the visual improvements made in&nbsp;<em>Reawakened&nbsp;</em>(although the original&nbsp;<em>Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>was certainly no slouch in this area), you can check out the original announcement trailer here.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle</em>, it's a puzzle game by&nbsp;<em>Serious Sam&nbsp;</em>developer Croteam, and it eschews the frantic action of that franchise for a more thoughtful, contemplative approach.</p>

<p>I don't want to spoil the game's mysteries, but suffice it to say that if you're in the mood to debate philosophy with computers and solve some brain-teasers along the way, then this is very much the game for you.</p>

<p><em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2806640/The_Talos_Principle_Reawakened/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012495" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10th. You can check out the Steam Next Fest demo of the game on PC right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617587/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-xbox-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In my first few hours with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, I fought against a gigantic spider in waters that were as red as blood and dodged the onslaught of a twisting dragon amid a desert storm, complete with powerful strikes of lightning terrorizing the ground around me. I went up against sandworms and giant apes and a poisonous bug that could inflate itself while causing a cascade of explosions in the ground below. Each battle felt monumental — and the scale only increased the more I played.</p><p>This focus on spectacle is what sets <em>Wilds</em> apart. The game is the follow-up to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/25/16931366/monster-hunter-world-review-ps4-xbox-one-release-date"><em>Monster Hunter World</em></a>, which shook up the series with a larger, more open world and catapulted it from Japanese phenomenon to global blockbuster. <em>World</em> went on to become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682599/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-preview-kaname-fujioka-interview-e3-2019">Capcom’s bestselling game ever</a>, no small feat for the company behind <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em>. Instead of changing things up once again, <em>Wilds</em> ups the ante and makes its monster battles feel bigger than ever.</p><p>The <em>MonHun </em>games are all built around a specific gameplay cycle. You prepare for a hunt by getting your gear in order, you head out and study your target, and then you spend a long time slowly whittling down the health of a giant monster before killing it. Once it’s dead, you carve some pieces off the creature and head back home to forge new armor with it and start the cycle all over again, only more powerful this time. Also, you have a giant talking cat that serves as your assistant.</p><p><em>Wilds</em> follows this same structure but moves it to a new, mostly uninhabited locale known as the Forbidden Lands. There’s a story about helping a young boy whose village was decimated and following a particularly dangerous creature known as The White Wraith. Mostly, though, the story is just an excuse to take on increasingly challenging hunts across this surprisingly diverse landscape.</p><p>There are a few new details to <em>Wilds</em>. A targeting system lets you really focus on a particular part of a monster’s body in battle, so you can open up a wound and hack away at it to cause lots of damage. You can also store a second weapon type on your mount, opening more options in combat, since weapons greatly determine your playstyle. And of course, there are new monsters and items and locations. You start out in a barren desert, but the Forbidden Lands eventually opens up to include locales like a lush jungle teeming with wildlife and a volcanic oil field that looks ripped out of a postapocalyptic future.</p><p>What’s really different this time around, though, is how massive and cinematic the battles feel. You’ve always fought against giant beasts in <em>MonHun</em> — that’s kind of the whole point — but here, more care has been put toward the backdrop. The action set pieces are ripped right out of a blockbuster movie, and they all have their own feel. That could mean the almost horror-like sensation of that spider swiping at you while your vision is filled with red or facing off against a beast during a dramatic downpour with the wind creating huge waves crashing down all around you. These moments can be terrifying, thrilling, or exciting — and often all three at the same time.</p><p>In a lot of ways, <em>Wilds</em> represents the <em>MonHun</em> team slowly perfecting its more modern formula. It in no way represents a dramatic change, which means it can still be a little rigid in places, particularly when it comes to futzing with menus to use all of the various items at your disposal. More than once, I accidentally whipped out my portable barbecue in the middle of a tense conflict because I hit the wrong button. But for the most part, this is the most accessible <em>MonHun</em> to date, and one that builds on the open-world foundation laid down by <em>World</em>, including more seamless transitions between areas that makes it feel like one big, cohesive place.</p><p>Even in its first real competition with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23599391/wild-hearts-review-ps5-xbox-pc">2023’s <em>Wild Hearts</em></a>, which infused monster hunting with <em>Fortnite</em>-like building, <em>Wilds</em> shows that there’s still nothing quite like the thrill of a hunt in <em>MonHun</em>. They can be exhausting and challenging and, at times, frustrating; my thumb remains sore from all of the rolling and dodging I’ve done over the past week. But it’s also immensely satisfying to actually pull off taking down one of its massive beasts, a combined sense of relief and joy that few other experiences can replicate. <em>Wilds</em> doesn’t change any of that — it makes it feel even bigger.</p><p><sub>Monster Hunter Wilds <em>launches February 28th on PC, PS5, and Xbox.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I have upsetting news. Some months back, I had electrical work done on my office to install ceiling lights. In trying to figure out a problem with the grounding of an outlet, we reset some breakers around the house to diagnose the issue. In doing so, my tiny Costco hot tub was turned off. It does not have a fancy app to tell me it turned off, and so, instead, it just slowly got colder and colder, until the heating pump broke, and simply beeped instead of working. It is now a brick of ice on my patio, waiting for the spring to unthaw it, so I can throw it out.

                <p>Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi has announced that his new game, To a T, launches on May 28 for PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It's also going to be included on Xbox Game Pass on release day.</p><p>The trailer features a musical performance of Giraffe Song, which is sung by Rebecca Sugar, who's best known for being the creator of Steven Universe. To a T focuses on a teenager named Teen, who is stuck in a T-Pose and their dog needs to assist them with everyday activities such as getting dressed and washing their face.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7PWNpBDPjI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L7PWNpBDPjI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The AbleGamers organization is collaborating with Takahashi and his studio, uvula, as To a T is an allegory about being disabled. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23777644/to-a-t-keita-takahashi-uvula-annapurna-interactive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AbleGamers provided feedback</a> on the game's design as the studio was seeking input on sensitivity and accessibility.</p><p>Described as a narrative adventure game, To a T follows Teen as they discover some sort of mysterious ability due to their T-pose posture and must uncover its origins while exploring the town and going to school. Interactions such as opening Teen's mouth to eat food or drink water act as minigames for players to engage in. Players will also be able to customize Teen with a variety of different outfits.</p><p>To a T is being published by Annapurna Interactive, the same publisher behind one of Takahashi's previous games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wattam-review-forever-wondering/1900-6417388/" data-ref-id="1900-6417388">Wattam</a>.</p>

			<p>Cloaked in high-level parts carved from many, many fallen creatures, there’s a point in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, as in all Monster Hunter games, where you start to feel sorry for the monsters. Your character and skills have evolved to such a point that you can wade through the less powerful amongst them in moments and, as they flail before you, parts pinging off them like sparks from a fire, you wonder whether it’s you that’s the bad guy. Then, you’ll do it again. And again. And again.</p>
<p>This is the unalterable loop of Monster Hunter. You hunt monsters. You kill or capture those monsters. You use their bones, webbing and tails to make yourself fancy new gear with better statistics, and then off you trot to murder another victim.&nbsp;Monster Hunter Wilds is the current culmination of years of perfecting that loop.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_wNFT4j6qI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Where early games were obtuse, with control schemes that felt like playing an Ocarina and gameplay mechanics that had players crying into their strategy guides, the series has come on leaps and bounds in recent years, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-world-iceborne">Monster Hunter World</a> the game that truly brought it to the masses with a much smoother, more accessible experience. Wilds is fundamentally a direct continuation of that game, though at least one or two of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise’s</a> best tricks have also made it along for the ride.</p>
<p>The storytelling is one of those key improvements. Monster Hunter stories have either centred on enemy creatures entering the wrong habitat, spreading a disease, or a combination of the two. Wilds tells a similar tale, but the way it is told is easily best directed in the series’ canon.</p>

<p>Your created hunter is fully voiced, lending an immediacy to every cutscene, while the cast here – also fully voiced, with an excellent dub in both Japanese and English – are endearing and memorable. The only misstep has been to grant your feline Palico companion full voice acting, when they’ve always made cat sounds in the past. Thankfully you can revert to the original cat sounds in the menu, because their voice is amongst the most annoying things to ever happen to Monster Hunter.</p>
<p>The story is kicked off by the discovery of a young boy named Nata on the edge of the Forbidden Lands. This region is thought to be uninhabited, but you soon discover that’s not remotely true, instead finding a region stuffed with new creatures and a series of villages and new tribes.</p>

<p>A key change to the environments is that the majority of these areas are connected. It’s one whole open-ish world, though the corridors or tunnels that you’re funnelled through between each biome are clearly hiding some loading, with a bit of judder while it all tries to catch up. Either way, you can run through a series of distinct locales, hunting your way through them without pause.</p>
<p>You don’t even need to return to your base between each quest. You can run up to any monster you encounter in the open world, whack it a few times with your sword, and the game will automatically set you off on a full quest, with the resulting rewards and framing to match. I’ve hared after five monsters in a row, all without having to return home, and it’s an absolute blast, making everything flow so much better than it did previously.</p>
<p>Helpfully, there’s a new mount to get you through these immense landscapes. Replacing Rise’s canine Palamute, the Seikret is a feathered friend that you can ride on, and they’re incredibly handy, able to automatically take you to your destination, whether that’s the monster you’re hunting or a shopping list of ingredients you need for crafting. Some might decry that there’s now much less in the way of actual ‘hunting’, but when those old days could be 30 minutes of hide and seek with a giant ape before even swinging a sword, I know which one I prefer.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds plays host to the most memorable cast of monsters the series has ever seen, initially giving more focus to its new members, before ushering in a batch of the most recognisable faces. More time is given to the Arkveld – Monster Hunter Wilds’ signature monster – than they would have been in World or Rise, and when it’s a wicked combination of a Viking helmet, chains and a dragon, that’s the correct decision.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are various stars, from Lala Barina, an arachnid-like with a giant scarlet flower instead of an abdomen that flutters paralysing spores around the arena, through to Nu Udra, an octopod that lives in the Oilwell Basin, sliding through the oily landscape while setting itself on fire.</p>
<p>Witnessing one of its multiple-limbed fireball-chucking attacks would be one of the highlights of the game, if you weren’t running for your life while it happened. It gives you a wholly new set of problems that are distinct and different from the winged dragon, great apes or oversized iguana archetypes that remain the series’ staple, and it’s refreshing in all the right ways.</p>

<p>There is a lingering question about how quickly you can put these incredible creatures down, though. Difficulty creep is a real thing, and it can be harder to quantify when I have twenty years of Great Sword experience already, but this is undoubtedly the easiest it’s felt. Monster Hunter World was capable of knocking some sense into you, especially by the first time you face Nergigante, and Rise’s mix of tower defense and hunting proved tricky to master at first too. Monster Hunter Wild’s has been a hell of a good time, but it’s rarely pushed me to the limit when playing solo.</p>
<p>There’s the sense that Wilds is, as with the last two games, an opening salvo, a tasty bit of hunting that’s been designed to get you into the flow of things, sampling all the new delights, while a main course waits in the wings. Some of that will come as free updates with new monsters special events and crossovers – the Monster Hunter team are one of the best in the industry at this – but you can bet that there will be an Iceborne or Sunbreak style expansion in around 18 months to give us the full vision for this generation and add Master Rank gear on top.</p>
<p>That won’t mean much to newcomers,&nbsp;but returning players will know that this isn’t the finished article, despite being a wholly complete game. That hard-won armour and weaponry will be made a mockery of the moment that the expansion arrives. This fact has never felt as immediate to me as it does here, but I don’t want to wish the next year and a half away. There’s still a huge amount to enjoy.</p>

<p>Once you’ve rolled the first set of credits, and then completed the actual story some thirty hours later, you can settle into the rhythm of hunting, collecting and crafting. You’ll find tracks or monster parts while exploring, which give you access to special investigations and hunts, and they’re much more controlled than the insane number of quests you’d find in World.</p>
<p>Besides that, it’s all about the fashion and function. Your endgame drive is to collect every single piece of armour – which can immediately be used as cosmetic layered armour – as well as every single weapon, and to then min-max your build to your heart’s content.</p>
<p>It’s a timesink that Monster Hunter aficionados will know well, and it’s no less enticing here, particularly when the overall visuals and armour designs are an exquisite new high-point for the franchise. There’s also Artian weapon crafting to dabble in, collecting special rewards from certain hunts that you can combine to create specific weapon types, with a spectacular set of stats. An Artian blade was my endgame weapon, and so far it’s proving hard to put down.</p>
<p>Focus Attacks are a powerful new addition to the formula, and help to add even more weight to the already hefty strikes the game is known for, but Monster Hunter Wilds biggest change to combat has been the ability to take two weapons into the field with you, stowing an extra one away on your Seikret to give you options in the field.&nbsp;I played through much of the game with a Great Sword and a Bow, giving me the perfect mix of close combat and ranged offence. It helped to force me out of my comfort zone, changed the way I play the game, and slowed my progress down in the process – perhaps the lower difficulty was a deliberate choice to get people experimenting with different weapons?</p>
<p>It certainly helps that Monster Hunter Wilds’ bow feels unbelievably good to use, mixing up powerful dodging, different arrow types, and the ability to drop a hail of arrows on any monster’s head before following it up with explosive homing attacks. They’ve already tweaked this following the beta as people again felt that it was too easy, and there’s every chance that the team will go in and make further changes following the game’s initial release. It’s going to be very interesting to see how that pans out. </p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is at its best when played with others. The difficulty scales up alongside this, and each monster’s elongated health keeps them in the fight far longer than when playing solo. There’s also crossplay here so you can hook up with players on any other platform, either sharing a lobby or using the new Link Party. This ties you together, no matter what platform you’re on, bringing you across automatically when one of you starts a quest. It’s a slight faff to set up, but once you’re connected with friends it works incredibly well, and has to be one of the greatest additions to the game’s underpinning tech.</p>
<p>Across the board there are further changes, both big and small. Amongst the group of players we’ve had for review, the one that has caused the most controversy is the changes to eating a meal. You used to have to dine before every quest, but now, since you’re out in the field, you can just whip out your BBQ spit, and make a host of hearty meals whenever you want, even in the middle of a fight.</p>

<p>It breaks the fiction of it, not least because you shouldn’t be able to do it when involved in combat, and sitting down to a meal with your friends in a lobby used to be a highlight. Whether that was due to the glorious cutscenes – there’s still some good munching action here at least – or Rise’s saccharine Bunny Dango song, it’s hard to say, but I’d like to see the option to sit down for food return.</p>
<p>This is getting into the weeds, though. After twenty years of monster hunting, it’s hard not to pick at the small things and miss the greater whole. Monster Hunter Wilds is absolutely a remarkable entry in the franchise, and one which furthers the lore and refines the action a few increments further. Is it the best one yet? Yes, it is, but greed and expectation will keep me waiting for the second wave, the Master Rank it will bring with it, and the ‘complete’ experience of this hunting generation.</p>

			<p>Despite running since 2004, it took the Monster Hunter series multiple installments to reach the level of popularity it enjoys today, and that's largely due to the much-improved accessibility. Much like the first entries in FromSoftware's Souls series, the early Monster Hunter games had some obscure mechanics that weren't properly explained in-game and required some experimentation to properly grasp. Since 2018's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/">Monster Hunter World</a>, however, making the series more accessible has become one of the main focuses, an effort that has paid off immensely, as working on making the franchise more accessible to newcomers also addressed some of the series' archaisms and brought massive gameplay improvements, such as the introduction of seamless maps whose different zones aren't separated by loading screen, streamlined hunting preparation and more.</p>
<p>Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, which features a very straightforward approach to the series' gameplay experience that puts the action at the forefront, fans of the Monster Hunter World approach have been eagerly anticipating the proper evolution of its gameplay formula, which has finally come with Monster Hunter Wilds, the most accessible entry in the series to date. The increased accessibility, however, takes nothing away from the complexity of the series' formula. On the contrary, it offers Hunters more ways to enjoy the latest evolution of the series' gameplay, which takes full advantage of some open-world mechanics to deliver an amazing experience.</p>

<p>Like Monster Hunter World, Monster Hunter Wilds features a story campaign with actual cutscenes that develop the new area of the series' expensive world, the Forbidden Lands, and several central characters, such as the young boy called Nata, who was found years before the beginning of the game near the border of the uncharted region which the Guild believed to be uninhabited. After hearing from the boy how his village was attacked by a mysterious monster known as the White Wraith, the Guild organizes an expedition into the uncharted region to investigate this mysterious monster and rescue Nata's people, known as the Keepers. Being part of the expedition's Avis unit, the player will get to experience firsthand this uncharted region and its every-changing environments, learn how its inhabitants have learned how to coexist with some fearsome monsters, and eventually come face to face with the White Wraith itself, the game's flagship monster Arkveld.</p>
<p>Right from the start of the campaign, it's clear how the development team wanted to give Monster Hunter Wilds a marked cinematic feel and better involve the player with the story. For the first time ever, the Hunter is fully voiced and interacts with other characters in cutscenes and dialogue sequences, greatly enhancing immersion. While the story takes a while to get going, once things got going, I found the campaign surprisingly interesting, thanks not only to the Hunter now feeling an integral part of the story but also to some pretty impressive, action-packed cutscenes that pump the player up properly before the intense fights against some of the game's strongest monsters. As such, the 18 or so hours that separated me from when the proper Monster Hunter experience begins with High Rank went by smoothly, almost leaving me hungering for a little more.</p>
<p>The more involving campaign isn't the only one of Monster Hunter Wilds that suggests how the game aims to be more welcoming to newcomers. Besides not being particularly challenging for the most part, the campaign feels effectively like an introduction to the series' main mechanics and the new ones introduced in the game, as things like crafting, cooking, Charms, Decorations, and melding are introduced gradually to allow new hunters to come to grips with them. Monster design, in combination with the generally low level of the campaign's Low Rank hunts, also suggests how the experience was created to get as many new players as possible to experience at least the main story. Reading monsters' attacks and learning their patterns is rather easy compared to the past, and the high efficacy of the vast majority of the 14 weapon types makes it so that it is possible to have fun straight away, even before the Hunter is lured into the addictive gameplay loop of the series which effectively begins in High Rank.</p>
<p>In terms of improving the Monster Hunter's formula accessibility, the introduction of a mechanic like Focus Mode is as unsurprising as it gets. This new gameplay mechanic allows the Hunter to properly aim the attacks of any weapon, giving them more control over their techniques and making some weapons easier and way more fun to use, such as the Great Sword, as Focus Mode allows the Hunter to properly aim all charged slashes, including the powerful but very slow True Charged Slash. The&nbsp; Wounds mechanics is yet another mechanic that has been clearly introduced to make the hunting experience a little less obscure, but it also improves the experience for more seasoned Hunters, as it is used to highlight the damage on monsters' parts, directing players to continue attacking those parts to break them and possibly collect rare parts that can be used to craft better weapons and gear.</p>
<p>Focus Strikes, special attacks available only in Focus Mode for all weapons that allow Hunters to immediately destroy a wounded monster part, have also been seamlessly integrated into the game plan of each weapon type, making them even more fun to use. For the Long Sword, for example, destroying a monster part with a Focus Strike increases Spirit level by one, a mechanic that can be used to unleash multiple Level 3 Spirit Helmbreakers in quick succession; for the Great Sword, it is possible to go straight into a True Charged Slash after unleashing a successful Focus Strike. And if a novice Hunter still needs time to understand these mechanics, it is possible to summon support AI-controlled Hunters when real players may not be available that can take the heat off them and give them more breathing room to understand the intricacies of the combat experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250211174013_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the mechanics may be a little difficult to grasp for newcomers, Monster Hunter Wilds does a decent job explaining them with many tutorials as it eases players into its aforementioned gameplay loop, which, on the surface, hasn't changed a whole lot. Like the rest of the series, Monster Hunter Wilds approaches action gameplay in a very peculiar way, doing away with useless mob fights, pitting the player against massive beasts with unique attack patterns and behaviors that require proper preparation and good knowledge of the mechanics and of the monster itself to win. After a monster has been defeated, it is possible to carve its remains to obtain items that can be used to craft better weapons and gear. Both weapons and armor pieces come with a variety of skills that improve the Hunter's performance and are best suited for certain weapon types or playstyles. With these improved tools, it becomes possible to hunt even more powerful monsters, get new items, craft better gear to perfect builds and take on even more powerful monsters. This gameplay loop is as addictive as ever and won't fail to lure in those who like a certain type of action RPG where gameplay and build crafting are always at the forefront.</p>
<p>First impressions, however, can be deceiving. While it is entirely feasible to play Monster Hunter Wilds like previous entries in the series (essentially using the various Base Camps that have replaced villages and towns and Gathering Hubs that are unlocked on all maps during the campaign to prepare for hunts before accepting quests from the Quest Handler Alma as it has always been done in the series), the new entry in the series really wants players to always be out on the maps hunting monsters, returning to Base Camp only to access specific features. Like in past entries in the series, it is possible to unlock additional camps on maps, only this time, you will get access to the vast majority of the Base Camps' features. Cooking, for example, can be done anywhere on the map by using the Portable BBQ Grill, while Alma will follow the Hunter at all times, allowing players to accept quests on the fly.</p>
<p>And if you are into a more organic way of playing the game without wasting time going from one menu to another, you can simply start field surveys right from the map, mount on your Seikret, a giant bird that can be used not only to traverse maps quickly and effectively but that also gives access to a couple unique attacks, and let it take you to your target monsters. And if you're looking to gather items as well, you can use your Slinger to pick up items or interact with Endemic Life, all without getting off the Seikret. As Monster Hunter Wilds turns each of its maps into actual living ecosystems, it is possible, for example, to hunt all monsters on a map and wait for others to appear, which doesn't take a lot of time to happen, although one will have to look out for weather condition changes that have a noticeable impact on all maps. All of this has been clearly designed to further streamline the experience without taking away its complexity, and the fact that taking advantage of these mechanics is essentially optional is a great way to implement them. If one were to play Monster Hunter Wilds in the old way, there's no penalty for it whatsoever.</p>
<p>Much of the popularity of the Monster Hunter series comes not only from monster design but also the very diverse weapon line-up, and in these regards, Monster Hunter Wilds delivers without question. All of the new monsters debuting in the game have clearly been created to ease new players into the experience, but not all of them are complete pushovers, as some of the late-game new monsters sport complex movesets and plenty of variables to make them unpredictable without getting into "randomly throwing out an attack" territory, such as the flagship monster Arkveld and a few others. In addition to these sorts of basic variables, the vast majority of monsters react to the changing weather conditions of the environment, potentially making them even more powerful depending on the situation. As highlighted by those revealed before launch, all of the monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds are also quite diverse, and their unique features are sure to make some of them staples for the series going forward.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250214200212_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As both new and returning monsters get new tools to force Hunters on their carts, so do the Hunters themselves. Focus Mode is only one of the new additions to the combat, as weapons that can guard, like the Great Sword, Sword and Shield, and Charge Blade, can initiate Power Clashes by guarding at the very last second before a monster attack connects. By winning these Clashes, it is possible to topple monsters and create a window of opportunity to deal massive damage and destroy wounds with ease. Offset attacks are also another big addition to the combat system, as certain techniques can interrupt a monster's attack, and open them up for a powerful follow-up attack while negating all damage.</p>
<p>The introduction of these two techniques is as huge as the introduction of Focus Mode, as it gives players new tools to play more reactively and make combat way more fluid. For example, both Power Clashes and Offset attacks are massive game changers for the Great Sword, as they turn the weapon into the proper tank that it was always kind of meant to be, finally sunsetting the old hit-and-run playstyle which is still somewhat viable, especially considering the buff to the charged slashes other than the True Charged Slash, which was slightly nerfed, but it's most definitely not as fun as Perfect Guarding monster's attacks and retaliate quickly as they recover, or meeting a deadly technique with a perfectly timed Offset Rising Slash.</p>
<p>Besides introducing the new universal mechanics above, Monster Hunter Wilds also makes some big changes for every weapon type beyond those seen in the open beta tests held before launch. Going over all of the changes would take a long time, but speaking about the weapons I am most familiar with - Long Sword, Great Sword, and Insect Glaive - I have found the changes to make the weapons even more enjoyable to use. For the Long Sword, for example, unlocking new techniques while Spirit Gauge is red adds a whole new dimension to the weapon, giving the Hunter some good reasons to hold onto the powerful Spirit Helmbreaker until the very last second; for the Insect Glaive, being able to get Extracts by using regular attacks in Focus Mode is a massive change that makes the weapon way less stiff than before, although the introduction of charged attacks and a few other changes may force the player to use a claw grip for any controller without back buttons or paddles, which can be uncomfortable. Over the closed beta, the Insect Glaive also got back its aerial capabilities, making it even more varied but also slightly more complex, though not by much if you have used the weapon in Monster Hunter World or Rise and constantly took the fight to the sky.</p>
<p>While Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't add any new weapon type, it still does, in a certain way: the environment. Besides featuring some natural traps that can be activated by interacting with them or using the Slinger from afar, it is possible to use monster's tendencies against them to make them, for example, crash against rock formations or walls, position them right under some hanging elements like boulders that can be brought down as needed and so on. I expect proper environment usage will be a big part of the best future speedruns, as the open beta tests already highlighted.&nbsp; The environment now playing a big part in combat has also elevated map design to new heights, as the maps are no longer just a fancy background for hunts but an integral part of the entire experience that can be used to make hunts easier. Following in the footsteps of World and, in some ways, Rise, the maps feature complex layouts and a prominent verticality that makes them believable as locations in an unexplored, and mostly untamed, land.</p>

<p>Being the next main chapter of the series, Monster Hunter Wilds attempts and succeeds at upgrading pretty much every one of the franchise's core features, and, as such, even the multiplayer features got a massive glow-up with the introduction of lobbies with visible players. While the limited online population in the early access period didn't allow me to properly test out how this changes interactions with other Hunters, the little I was able to experience made me feel like the series has moved one step closer to an MMO-like experience, doing away with the aforementioned Gathering Hub and introducing online lobbies that make it easier than ever to team up with other Hunters and complete quests together. For mostly solo players like myself, it is also possible to play the game in single-player lobbies but still enjoy some of the multiplayer features, which include joining Squads, asking for help with SOS Flares, and responding to help calls via the Quests menu.</p>
<p>All of the features outlined above shine even more in Monster Hunter Wilds endgame content, where the hunter can experience an even more intense experience on all the maps, which feel more alive than ever with unpredictable environmental changes, which also include the frequent appearance of monsters, of both the regular and the stronger Tempered variant. By taking down these monsters during the High Rank postgame, hunters can also get a variety of additional rewards that are randomly determined, including Decorations sporting two different skills and special parts that can be used to craft Artian Weapons. These weapons are rather peculiar compared to regular weapons, as the player can determine their properties depending on the parts that are used during crafting, and they usually come with three Decoration slots at the cost of innate skills. And, if you are lucky enough to get a monster that comes with some high rarity bonus rewards, you can save this hunt as an Investigation at the cost of a few points and replay it multiple times as if it were a regular quest to farm these rewards. Considering how Monster Hunter Rise essentially did not have much postgame content before the release of the Sunbreak expansion, the engaging postgame of Monster Hunter Wilds is a major step forward that has a lot to offer for those who want to push their builds to the current possible limit.</p>

<p>If there's an area where Monster Hunter Wilds disappoints slightly, it's visuals and performance. While the RE Engine handles the changing weather conditions extremely well from a visual standpoint, delivering these changes in a very believable way, the visuals sometimes lack the vibrancy of past entries in the series, feeling a little too drab even in the Springlike season of Plenty. That is not to say that the game looks bad, however, as some environments look stunning under the right conditions, and character and monster models look great, with amazing detail and animations, so it's mostly a matter of getting used to different aesthetic choices from the past. What most players are never going to get used to is performance, at least on PC. Just as the system requirements and the benchmark tool suggested, performance is really all over the place, reaching an acceptable level of smoothness only with Frame Generation.</p>
<p>In an early game Ajarakan hunt set in the Oilwell Basin map, with a lot of fancy fire effects going off, at 4K resolution with DLSS Quality and Frame Generation, and a mix of high and ultra graphics settings, the game ran at an average of 86 FPS, 45 FPS 1% Low on a system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) that runs the vast majority of recent games well. In the heat of the hunt, I did not notice the frame rate drops too often, but watching the recording, in reality, it was very choppy instead. So, if you don't have a top-of-the-line machine, you may have to drop most settings and resolution to hit 60 FPS, which is the bare minimum for a game like this. Following the game and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, it's quite clear how the RE Engine may not have all it takes to handle open-world experiences properly.</p>

<p>Despite a generally low challenge level and performance issues on PC, Monster Hunter Wilds is undoubtedly a new peak for the series. The increased accessibility, which is sure to expand the series' reach beyond its current fanbase, didn't water down what makes Monster Hunter the unique series it is, while the open-world mechanics have been seamlessly integrated with the classic formula to provide new and better ways to enjoy these hunts solo or with others while further streamlining the experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is Capcom's most polished entry in the series so far. It refines the foundation the series has been built on for decades: fight monsters, make gear from monster parts, rinse, repeat. It also tries to bring in new players with some creative swings. This is admirable since the series is notoriously impenetrable to those not already onboard, even with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review-hunt-worth-going-on" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Hunter World</em></a> finding mainstream success.</p>

<p>While some of these decisions are hit and miss, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> still provides that exciting dopamine rush when tearing through a dragon with some friends.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-desert-trek.jpg?itok=pIew5JMf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-desert-trek.jpg?itok=G6AdXIOc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A herd straight out of a National Geographic. Here's hoping a predator doesn't show up.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> Review – By Order of the Guild</h2>

<p>For the longest time, every <em>Monster Hunter</em> story was told in brief, impersonal text on a quest select menu. If you were lucky, there were worldbuilding details peppered in the environment or in supplemental material. That story usually amounted to, “Some monsters are attacking some people, go stop them,” or “Some monsters are acting odd, go deal with it.” Serious storytelling was never this franchise's strong suit; the narrative has always been a vehicle for the next hunt.</p>

<p>I bring this up because <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> manages to bring a conventional cinematic narrative into this franchise. The Hunter's Guild has sent your character to investigate the Forbidden Lands. What was believed to be an untamed frontier of monsters is home to a secret tribe of people with ties to the land's ancient roots.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-lala-barina-hunt.jpg?itok=YXqJDRjU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-lala-barina-hunt.jpg?itok=A51AYZoE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That's it, breaking out the flaming sword for this thing!</figcaption></figure><p>But something has gone wrong in the Forbidden Lands. Monster outbreaks are threatening the populace and the environment is suffering for it. This means your job is to gather research data, hunt what is in your way, and figure out the cause of these monster attacks.</p>

<p>It's a familiar set-up, but the difference with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is the presentation. Every story mission in this game has extensive cutscenes leading up to the hunt. These cutscenes involve multiple recurring characters, all with unique voices and personalities. In a franchise first, the player character and their palico companion talk. They're characterized as broadly taciturn, but it's something.</p>

<p>This guided narrative approach extends to the game's opening hours. Whenever you start in a new area, you get a guided tour. Rising and falling water levels in a forest. Mysterious ruins that act as lightning rods in the middle of the desert. Caverns with sludgy deposits of flammable oil. The list goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-village-meal.jpg?itok=6gYowTtz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-village-meal.jpg?itok=WmmLz9-X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The meal was good. The buffs were better.</figcaption></figure><p>I am of two minds about this new approach. It is a concerted effort by Capcom to bring the worldbuilding of <em>Monster Hunter</em> from the margins into the spotlight. In addition, it puts one of the franchise's greatest strengths center stage: making every monster feel like one part of a living ecosystem.</p>

<p>If you have never played a <em>Monster Hunter</em> game before, <em>Wilds</em> does a great job bringing you in with this cinematic presentation.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are a longtime fan like me, this approach has reined the series' sillier side. The tone is less playful and certain parts of the game lack the series' campier elements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A good example is cooking a meal. Instead of meals being prepared by a goofy band of palicos at a canteen, complete with the kind of showmanship you'd see at a Benihana, you just cook your meals yourself over a small grill. The presentation of the food still makes your mouth water, but how it is delivered to your table is more forgettable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ajarakan-hunt.jpg?itok=vTDHUMHe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ajarakan-hunt.jpg?itok=gZxOjQm6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Go ahead, move forward. See what happens.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> Review – Sharpening Old Blades</h2>

<p>In the gameplay department <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is a refinement across the board. The 14 different weapon types are still here and play exactly as you expect but with some notable quality-of-life improvements. Certain weapons that require charging like the Switch Axe or Charge Blade, will automatically do so the first time you try to use a relevant ability. No more impotently hitting a dragon's flank here.</p>

<p>In addition, the Long Sword and Dual Blades have gotten faster and more acrobatic. Attack animations are packed with fluid spins and twirls, giving you more control over your positioning during a battle. As for Hunting Horn mains, the old support buff system from <em>Monster Hunter World</em> has returned.</p>

<p>A new wrinkle to these monster hunts is the introduction of wounds. If you hit a certain body part enough times, that monster will gain a wound. These are represented as red glowing spots on the monster. Hit this area with a focused attack and you'll deal a bunch of damage, stagger the monster, and get a monster part for your trouble. It is a fantastic addition to the hunt gameplay since it allows you to strategically stagger your target, giving you more control over the battlefield.</p>

<p>Complimenting this are new creative ways the environment is affected as you hunt. Fighting a monster in the desert can lead to sinkholes forming. Vines of jungle trees can be struck down for improvised net traps. Some of these elements were in place in <em>Monster Hunter World</em>, but they feel more fleshed out in <em>Wilds</em>, leading to some stellar setpieces.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-uth-duna-mount.jpg?itok=C22nI_i9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-uth-duna-mount.jpg?itok=bqCTMcyZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to break this thing's face open.</figcaption></figure><p>These are welcome additions that bring more tactility to the <em>Monster Hunter</em> experience. But the trade-off is a lack of hunt variety. There are no alternate hunt challenges like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Hunter Rise's</em></a> Rampage hunts or any unique weapon stances or abilities to figure out. There is meaty endgame material here as well as some arena hunts, but they are few and far between.</p>

<p>As for the new player experience,<em> Monster Hunter Wilds</em> does its best not to overwhelm. From the start, the game gradually introduces mechanics and systems. It slowly rolls out tutorials for whatever weapon you are using, how to sharpen your weapons, certain item crafting recipes, the importance of honey, etc. The game even has friendly NPC hunters you can call in for help, and their AI behavior is rock solid.</p>

<p>These are welcome concessions, but Capcom's answer to teaching new players still amounts to some text boxes. If you're starting out you will need to intuit some things. Things veteran players take for granted like focusing more on consistent combos than giant kill-shots, navigating the map, using the environment to your advantage, or applying poison or paralysis status effects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-rey-dau-hunt.jpg?itok=LFUPwhbO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-rey-dau-hunt.jpg?itok=F6o1dWFZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wearing metal armor to fight this thing in the middle of a lightning storm. Not one of my best moments.</figcaption></figure><p>This is not a failing on Capcom's part. <em>Monster Hunter</em> as a whole is a very hands-on experience. You are expected to get your hands dirty, get smacked around, and even fail at your first handful of hunts. In addition, the cadence of the combat is heavier than other action RPGs out there. While this makes the core gameplay experience unique, it is something you click with or not.</p>

<p>As always, the real stars of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> are the monsters. The Forbidden Lands does feature some returning beasts like the Nerscylla and the iconic Rathalos, but the new creatures also make a good impression. Highlights include the Nu Udra, a giant octopus monster covered in flaming oil, and the Rey Dau, the result of someone combining a dragon with a railgun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-rompopolo-artwork.jpg?itok=GAVEH3br 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-rompopolo-artwork.jpg?itok=acdVKC1- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A few more of these and I'll have a viable support set.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> Review – Grab Your Friends</h2>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is the first entry in the series to introduce cross-platform play. And on paper, a lot of the endgame content highly encourages you to play with friends.&nbsp; You will need a crew to get the most bang for your buck.</p>

<p>On the technical side, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds'</em> multiplayer works. When I finally got a group together, it gave me flashbacks to playing <em>Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</em> on my 3DS back in the day. Didn't matter if we were on PC or console, everything worked. Connections were smooth, shenanigans with bombs happened, and good times were had. On a less formal note, getting random help from sending up an SOS Flare never gets old.</p>

<p>What sours the experience a bit is how finding groups or matchmaking is handled. You can't just search for players on your Friends List or jump into a hunt in progress. Instead, there is a cumbersome code system alongside the same confusingly laid-out lobby used in past entries. It isn't as bad as Nintendo's Friend Code system, but it gave me flashbacks.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is a great entry in a beloved series. If you're a longtime fan, the gameplay improvements and new monsters are more than enough to pick this up. Alternatively, if you haven't touched the series before and are willing to get through a steep learning curve, the cinematic narrative presentation and imaginative monster designs will welcome you with open teeth and claws.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-there-should-never-be-a-bloodborne-remake.1117146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/why-there-should-never-be-bloodborne-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just before February's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-recap-february-2025" rel="nofollow">State of Play presentation</a> aired, rumors began to swirl that a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake, or at the very least a remaster, could be imminent.</p>

<p>Those rumors were aided by Sony's move to DMCA two major&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>fan projects, namely a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca" rel="nofollow">60fps patch</a> created by modder Lance McDonald and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-psx-demake-dmca-sony" rel="nofollow">PlayStation-style demake</a> made with love by the very talented Lilith Walther.</p>

<p>Of course, the State of Play came and went, yielding nothing in the way of PS4 revivals barring the frankly bizarre&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/days-gone" rel="nofollow">Days Gone</a> </em>remaster. Most other&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>fans breathed a sigh of frustration, but mine was one of relief.</p>

<p>Let me lay my cards on the table.&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is probably my favorite game of all time. I've got its platinum trophy, and I've spent close to 200 hours in Yharnam, breathing in its eerie atmosphere and battling its deranged, skeletal beasts. I know that doesn't sound like a lot, but trust me, it is for me.</p>

<p>Here's the thing. There should never, ever be a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake. I'm not even convinced there should be a remaster, although that's an argument I'd be far more ready to come around on. Here's why a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake or sequel is a terrible idea and why Sony should never do it.</p>

<h2>The&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>Conundrum</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-demons-souls.jpg?itok=UGjTxGi2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-demons-souls.jpg?itok=0qajyxqX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bluepoint's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake serves as an excellent cautionary tale.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2020, when Sony released the PlayStation 5, one of the console's launch titles was a remake of the 2010 action RPG (for there were no "Soulslikes" back then)&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>.</p>

<p>Developed by Bluepoint, the remake garnered critical acclaim, with many praising its faithfulness to the original. This is a take that has always baffled me. Bluepoint's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bluepoints-remake-of-demons-souls-coming-to-ps5" rel="nofollow"><em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake</a> is certainly shinier and more "presentable" than the original, but it has none of the trademark strangeness and atmosphere of FromSoftware's effort.</p>

<p>Much of that is down to creative choices that I'm sure were made in order to sell the power of the PS5. The land of Boletaria is now one of much higher detail, much shinier surfaces, and much slicker animations, but it has completely lost the creeping, misty dread of the 2010 original.</p>

<p>The music choices, too, are irritatingly tone-deaf. Listen to Flamelurker's boss theme. Composer Shunsuke Kida wrote a theme that sounded like a long-forgotten demon "lurking" in the darkest recesses of the world. Bluepoint's remake, by contrast, drowns the boss in the kind of bombastic orchestral arrangement that Hollywood would kill for.</p>

<p>Like many other gaming companies, Sony's attitude towards game preservation is occasionally commendable but usually selective. While the company has made an effort to add many PlayStation classics to its modern store, there are also a lot of games - many of which are exclusives - that remain unavailable.</p>

<p>A lot of the games featured as little collectible robots in Sony's celebratory platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right" rel="nofollow"><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>(which is great, by the way)</a>, including major titles like&nbsp;<em>Ico</em>,&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>, and even the first few&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games, are unplayable on modern hardware despite being hugely celebrated and beloved landmarks in the medium of gaming's history.</p>

<p>Sure,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Colossus&nbsp;</em>has its Bluepoint remake, but here, we run into the same issue as&nbsp;the studio's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>work. What if I don't like the Bluepoint version? What if I want to play the original? Well, it's tough luck for me in that regard, I suppose.</p>

<p>In short, I don't think Bluepoint's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake gets close to the original for atmosphere and feel, but more to the point, Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/sony-playstation-3-psp-vita-store" rel="nofollow">slipshod approach</a> to game preservation means that for many - myself included - it is now impossible to legally source the original without resorting to the second-hand market.</p>

<h2>The&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>Remake Game Preservation Problem</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-doors.jpg?itok=MHjUIds1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-doors.jpg?itok=CF1VOclL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony's attitude towards game preservation has me worried about a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony has seemingly decided that nobody would ever want to play the original&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, and that the only legitimate version is the remake. This is a terrible attitude to take; even if you prefer the shinier, more "AAA-feeling"&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, this attitude leaves no room for those like me who prefer the 2010 version.</p>

<p>Should Sony ever make the decision to remake&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, there's every chance that just like the 2020&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, original director Hidetaka Miyazaki, as well as many of the other creative personnel who originally worked on the game, wouldn't be asked to return.</p>

<p>In the worst-case scenario, this would result in a remake that utterly butchers FromSoftware's original vision for&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, ruining the game's subtle, creeping journey from beast-strewn, blood-soaked horror to something altogether darker and more eldritch.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you're thinking. There's no guarantee Sony would ruin a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake. Maybe it would be better! Perhaps that's true, but&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is a work of art born (no pun intended) of its particular time and circumstances. Any remake produced by Sony would inevitably be a different product, because of course it would.</p>

<p>Remaking&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>would be an act of monumental arrogance on several levels, and one that would only be slightly lessened by ensuring that the original remains available to play in perpetuity. Given Sony's previously demonstrated selective approach to game preservation, I don't have confidence this will happen.</p>

<p>In fairness to Sony, one of the reasons the original&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>may not have been preserved has to do with the PS3's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps3-emulation-playstation-plus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notoriously difficult hardware</a>. Other games, like Konami's&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4&nbsp;</em>and Sucker Punch's&nbsp;<em>inFamous</em>, also remain unplayable on modern systems (although I note the latter doesn't seem to have been considered for a remaster).</p>

<p>The point, though, is that the ball, as with many other companies, is very much in Sony's court here. It's not so much that Sony definitely will decide to replace&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>with a remake (although I think I've demonstrated prior for that), but that it could, and if it does, the artistry of the original, like&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, could be lost forever.</p>

<h2><em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>Isn't Perfect, but It's Perfect to Me</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-cleric-beast.jpg?itok=XCMY3LNM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-cleric-beast.jpg?itok=9szq5DO1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I think&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>does everything it set out to do artistically.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there's also the artistic argument for why&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>shouldn't be remade.</p>

<p>Let's go back to&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>for a moment. It's not just a product, a piece of entertainment to be consumed and thrown away. It's a work of art. To remake it largely without the involvement of the original creative team and then proudly stamp the original name on the remake with no embellishments seems to me to be a little insulting.</p>

<p>By doing so, Sony is essentially saying "this is our new definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls.</em>" I don't think Sony has, or should have, the artistic authority to do so. I'm fully aware it has the corporate authority, but I don't find arguing for or against remakes from a corporate perspective particularly interesting or illuminating.</p>

<p>For reasons we've already been over, a&nbsp;remake would probably be given to people who may well be huge fans of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, but who didn't make it, and whoever would end up making the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake, they probably wouldn't have been heavily involved in the creation of the original.</p>

<p>Miyazaki <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring" rel="nofollow">has moved on</a>. Sony's Japan Studio, which helped out with the development of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-japan-studio-reportedly-shutting-down-this-year" rel="nofollow">has been closed down</a>. The team that came together to create the singular vision of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>no longer exists in its original form.</p>

<p>If you love&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>like I do, and I really, really love&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, then you should rage against the concept of a remake for this reason.</p>

<p>To me,&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is a beautiful, precarious marriage of everything I want from both an action game and a horror game. I'm aware of how precious I sound here, but if just one element was pushed out of alignment, the whole house of cards could come crashing down.</p>

<p>I can't imagine a realistic scenario in which&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is remade and some beautiful, wonderful element of the original experience isn't carelessly tossed aside for some redundant quality-of-life improvement or gameplay tweak because someone didn't realize how important it was to the full picture.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's a failure of my imagination, but I'll offer you this guarantee (which is audacious, I know). If&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is ever remade, it will not live up to the remake you're currently imagining in your head. Not even close. Better to close that book and wait, likely in vain, for the remaster that barely does anything besides touch up the game's minor technical problems.</p>

<h2>Okay, So Why Not Remaster&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-alfred.jpg?itok=CBQpQ25q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-alfred.jpg?itok=DPr2RgmS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Beast hunting is a sacred practice, and so is leaving&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>alone.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a thornier question, and it's one I grapple with from time to time. When I revisited&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>for this article, I found myself occasionally wishing it ran a little more smoothly or that its resolution was just a touch sharper.</p>

<p>A remaster could, in theory, fix these problems, but remasters aren't exactly perfect solutions either, at least not all the time. Let us remember the tragic, terrible story of Rockstar's&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>remasters and how they <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-games-apologizes-for-gta-trilogy-launch" rel="nofollow">desecrated the classic originals</a>.</p>

<p>Ah, but it wasn't just technical glitches that marred those particular remasters, was it? Fans also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/remaster-fatigue-ballad-of-gta-definitive-edition-failures" rel="nofollow">complained</a> about odd-looking character models and newly introduced migraine-inducing rain effects. Proof, if proof were needed, that remasters also have the potential to ruin a game's artistic vision, even if they seem initially innocuous.</p>

<p>What about&nbsp;<em>Sonic Colors: Ultimate</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-colors-ultimate-shadow-dropped-today-on-pc-via-steam" rel="nofollow">remaster that dropped back in 2021</a>? At launch, it ran horribly, leading to widespread criticism from players. Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 3: Reforged&nbsp;</em>led to the company dropping support for the original RTS, but it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-3-reforged-developer-update-does-little-to-satisfy-irate-fans" rel="nofollow">hated by fans</a>. No matter, though; to the best of my knowledge, you still can't easily play the originals.</p>

<p>Again, in fairness to Sony, its own remasters and ports are generally well-received (with some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spider-man-2-pc-port-bad-reviews" rel="nofollow">notable exceptions</a>). All it would take, though, is one careless screw-up like the ones outlined above, and a game I consider to be one of the greatest of all time suffers as the result.</p>

<p>Of course, there are always updates and patches to fix issues, but, well... why not just play the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, which doesn't need any of those things to play well?</p>

<p>This may be a heretical statement, but I also think&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>still runs just fine. Sure, it's not 60fps, but guess what? Your eyes will adjust. Mine did after just a few minutes, and if you allow yourself to be immersed in&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>'s peerless atmosphere and excellent storytelling, yours will too. I can almost guarantee it.</p>

<p>No, I think I've found my perfect solution. Let's just leave&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>alone. No remakes, no remasters, and for the Moon Presence's sake, absolutely no sequels.&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>came, kicked all kinds of ass, did what it came to do, and left. Why, in our era of constant unnecessary corporate franchise revivals, can that not be enough?</p>

<p>The debate around the use of generative AI in video games is one of the more hotly debated topics of the last handful of years. While some find the value in what it could mean to the development timeline of larger games, others are worried that it will lead to lower-quality games being released and talent artists and developers losing their jobs. It appears that Steam users are concerned about generative AI in their games as well, and they want to be about to know which games are using the technology.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/10/595140105668154379/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam forum’s suggestions</a> thread, a suggestion to allow players to filter out games made with generative AI has picked up steam—no pun intended—since it was posted earlier this month. </p>



<p>Said original poster AyeforScotland, “I don’t have any interest in playing demos from games that use Generative AI in their development. It would be good if an option was added to filter these games in the same way players can already filter Adult/NSFW content.”</p>



<p>In 27 pages of replies, as of publishing, it appears to be a feature that everyone is in agreement with wanting. And the reasons, while similar, have some specific variance.</p>



<p>“I don’t want to play a game nobody wanted to make,” one user responded. “I want to play things people made, who love what they’ve created.”</p>



<p>Said another: “All the AIs out there are trained on stolen labour. I’d rather not financially support anyone who’s happy to use them to produce games, and every demo download translates into financial support via Steam’s own algorithms.”</p>



<p>What do you think about being able to filter games based on whether generative AI was used or not? Let us know down below, and join the discussion further in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1691/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-first-impressions-of-the-new-tcg-expansion</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-lorcana-archazia%E2%80%99s-island-%E2%80%93-first-impressions-of-the-new-tcg-expansion.1117131/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-first-impressions-of-the-new-tcg-expansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Disney Lorcana set, Archazia’s Island, is just around the corner with the early release on March 7 at local game stores, followed by the wide release on March 21. With this seventh set, the trading card game introduces dual color cards for the very first time. Two new starter decks also accompany the new booster expansion: a Ruby/Sapphire deck featuring characters from Beauty and the Beast, and an Amethyst/Steel deck featuring characters from Aladdin. Disney Lorcana starter decks have been a good way to tease what the new meta could be with its new mechanics, but one of these new decks seems stronger right out of the box than its counterpart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starter decks are, of course, not optimized for super competitive games, but they’ll get you part of the way. So generally, playing starter decks out of the box may feel slow. With that said, there are synergies with certain cards if you can find them in time. The Ruby/Sapphire deck, for instance, relies on the use of items whether they are on the field or not. The new dual-color Belle can be cheaper to play based on how many item cards are in your discard. When she quests, she also allows the player to put three items from the discard back into the deck. Outside of getting rid of your items normally, you also have characters like dual-color Beast, who banishes two items to deal damage to an opposing character. Then there’s Cogsworth, who becomes stronger if there’s just one item in the discard. So now you have this engine where you’re using your items as normal, benefitting from them in the discard, and putting them back into the deck to do it all over again. With so much opportunity for interactions, a player has to be careful about the order of their plays. For example, you don’t want to put back items into the deck if a character benefits from them being in there in the first place. Outside of that, the usual Ruby and Sapphire tendencies are there in the deck, like building up your inkwell or dealing damage and rushing down characters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana: Archazia’s Island Starter Decks</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Amethyst/Steel deck, this gets the most interesting mechanic from this set with the Vanish keyword. A character that has Vanish is immediately banished if it is targeted by an action, which are like single-use spells. For example, the action card Double Trouble deals 1 damage each to up to two characters. If your opponent has two cards with Vanish on the field, this action card will make both of those powerful characters go away for cheap – and they don't even need to damage them to do so. This keyword is seen on characters that are Illusions, which is also a new attribute to Lorcana. So like Illusions, they disappear as soon as they are waved away. This sounds pretty bad, of course, but the Illusion characters themselves are quite strong considering the cost for them. In this deck, for example, we have a 4/4 Mufasa that costs four ink to play. The Illusion Iago is 4/6 with evasive and also costs four ink to play. Generally, these Illusion cards can wreak some havoc as long as the opponent doesn’t have the necessary cards to get rid of them easily. The main beneficiary of these Illusion cards is the dual-color Jafar, who can return any Illusion cards that are banished on the opponent’s turn. Considering the value and threat these Illusion cards pose, Jafar is crucial to making this deck perform. Otherwise, playing an Illusion to only get banished immediately feels pretty bad. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/049-dlcs7-rcmx-iago-giantspectralparrot-en-150-1740005973182.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, the introduction of dual-color cards seems to be an obvious addition to a deck if you are playing the right colors with the right playstyle. As expected, they’re strong with new cards and a whole expansion, but they are locked with the deck color of choice, unlike Star Wars Unlimited, where you can splash other colors in the deck but incur an extra cost. In regards to deck brewing, it doesn’t leave too much room for creativity. For instance, if you run Illusions, you kind of have to have a card like dual color Jafar to give you the extra value with the negative kickback of Vanish. On the other hand, Illusions can be cheap throwaways to banish any opposing characters before they quickly disappear. Out of the box, though, Illusions are very susceptible to actions, and with one Jafar, those characters are not lasting too long in any game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Archazia’s Island starter decks showcase the new mechanics of the upcoming set well, but the Ruby/Sapphire deck just has a more consistent engine than what the Amethyst/Steel can pull off. Unfortunately, the featured characters are ones we’ve seen already in the game, but that does allow for some room to mess around with the older Belle or Jafar cards in this upcoming meta. With that said, these starter decks are always a good chance to see what the game has to offer so far.

                <p>The voice actor behind Spider-Man in Insomniac Games' Marvel's Spider-Man has revealed that Peter Parker will definitely play a role in Marvel's Spider-Man 3, despite the game not being announced yet.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, voice actor Yuri Lowenthal said, "There are very few things that I can say about this game, but you have somehow landed on the one thing that I can answer, and that's that, yes, Peter is not gone.

            <p>
Microsoft boss Satya Nadella has said the company plans to train its new gaming AI on a "catalogue of games" soon, so it can then "start playing them".
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/satya-nadella">Dwarkesh Patel podcast</a>, Nadella described seeing Microsoft's gaming AI Muse generate gameplay videos that reflected a user's input as a "massive, massive moment of 'wow'".
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-generative-ai-model-muse-isnt-creating-games-and-its-certainly-not-going-to-solve-game-preservation-expert-says">Microsoft lifted the lid on Muse last week, and described the technology as something that would help game ideation and preservation - though not everyone was convinced</a>.

<p>
In short, Muse has so far been trained based on years of gameplay footage from Ninja Theory's arena shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</a>. After ingesting this gameplay archive, Muse can then generate new gameplay footage and estimate how it might change based on a specific prompt suggested by the user. For example, Muse could generate gameplay footage with an additional jump pad in the level, if commanded to do so.
</p>
<p>
As yet, this is not an AI able to start coding its own games, or dreaming up its own concepts. Rather, it's a tool that could eventually become a shortcut for providing generated gameplay footage to speed up the process of development. 
</p>
<p>
"Can you actually generate games that are both consistent and then have the ability to generate the diversity of what that game represents, and then are persistent to user mods?" Nadella said. "That's what this is.
</p>
<p>
"What I'm excited about is bringing - we're going to have a catalogue of games soon that we will start using these models, or we're going to train these models to generate, and then start playing them."
</p>
<p>
Nadella did not elaborate on how users would be able to play the generated footage Muse provides.
</p>
<p>
"When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> first showed it to me, he had an Xbox controller and this model basically took the input and generated the output based on the input. And it was consistent with the game," Nadella continued.
</p>
<p>
"That to me is a massive, massive moment of 'wow'. It's kind of like the first time we saw ChatGPT complete sentences, or Dall-E draw, or Sora. This is one such moment."
</p>
<p>
Writing in response to Microsoft's announcement of Muse last week, <a href="https://www.possibilityspace.org/blog-before-you-post/index.html">gaming AI expert Michael Cook described the advancement as "impressive" but "not a practical process"</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It's impressive that it can do this using visual information because things like lighting, camera angles, user interface and so on are a lot for an AI model to handle. But ultimately, even with all of this data, all the time spent annotating datasets, and so on, it was still only just about able to generate footage predicting player behaviour.
</p>
<p>
"The research team behind this probably believe it will get more efficient over time, which might make it more affordable or tractable for small developers," Cook continued. "However, it still raises the question of how we get video footage of people playing our game in the first place."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">Strauss Zelnick weighed in with his opinion of AI</a>, saying that "artificial intelligence is an oxymoron, there's no such thing".

		<p>The original Gothic games played an important role in the history of PC RPGs. Pioneering the RPG subgenre affectionately nicknamed ‘Eurojank’, their immersive worlds and open-ended style attracted a legion of passionate fans. While the third game in the series saw a change of emphasis, titles such as Risen and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/12/21/elex-review/">Elex</a> continued the legacy. It was therefore a huge disappointment when longtime developers Piranha Bytes closed down in 2024, just one of a number of victims of the Embracer Group’s irresponsible purchasing spree.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the legacy of Piranha Bytes games can still be seen in the indie scene and particularly through the long-awaited release of a full Gothic 1 Remake by Alkimia Interactive. Having now been hands-on with the first playable demo – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1297900/Gothic_1_Remake/">available today via Steam Next Fest</a> – I can spill the beans on how it holds up to the original, both in terms of nostalgia and more recent memories of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gothic 1 Remake | Nyras Prologue Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_3VLY-B-LTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The original Gothic saw you follow the journey of the iconic Nameless Hero as he was thrown into the magical prison known as The Colony, in which prisoners are forced to mine for precious ore to supply the Kingdom of Myrtana with weaponry to fight off the invading hordes of orcs. This is such a classic fantasy story that still has resonance some 24 years later, but the real draw of the game was the freedom it allowed you in your adventure.</p>
<p>Gothic holds a special place in my own memories, but having replayed it in part recently it is clear where the ‘jank’ part of the subgenre came from. Gothic’s controls were an acquired taste at best and the ease with which you can venture off the path and meet instant death is a far cry from the handholding approach of more modern titles. My main hopes for the Remake were for it to improve the former, but still maintain the challenge of the latter and the demo goes some way to demonstrating that this has been achieved.</p>

<p>Rather than offering the start of the game itself, the demo takes the form of a prologue with a separate character in the spotlight – Nyras (who plays a small role in the original game; a nice nod to longtime fans). The demo is very aware that this could be seen as a big change from the original and most of the loading screen tips serve as confirmation that the Nameless Hero will be the protagonist in the full release. This defensiveness feels a little overdone, but it’s understandable. Nyras also finds himself thrown into The Colony, but the world is deliberately much more closed off in this demo.</p>

<p>Graphically, this remake is obviously a million miles ahead of the original. While not at the very cutting edge of modern graphics, it is far more detailed and benefits from beautiful lighting and design. Animation is much smoother and a vast number of extra animations are included allowing for quality of life improvements such as being able to pick things up without having to sheathe your weapon. There is still a sense of stiffness in the movement though and I hope that this is being refined before the full release.</p>
<p>You can talk to other returning characters, such as Diego, and these show a high level of detail and good voice acting. Background dialogue is suitably earthy and it feels like a land occupied by suspicious criminals. There isn’t a great deal of content here (in many ways it’s a proof of concept and the main game has developed a long way on a separate path since this build) but you get to follow a couple of questlines and carry out some exploration.</p>

<p>Your first challenge is to find a weapon and there are an encouraging number of ways to achieve this. You can either dive into the large pool at the start of the map, explore the caves, or find a sword near the first quest NPC. A weapon is essential, though, as even the most minor of enemies can kill you in seconds. This danger is particularly apparent if you rush headlong into combat with multiple enemies so it’s clear that the feel of the original has been maintained.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the changes aren’t restricted to the graphical details. A far more modern inventory system has been added which feels much more user friendly than the original – though it’s not really utilised in this demo. You can loot a vast number of items still, although there wasn’t a sign of the risk and reward stealing mechanic that is so important to the original. Controls feel much more in keeping with modern games but, as mentioned above, the animations leave it feeling a little stiffer than the original, especially in combat.</p>
<p>All in all, the Gothic 1 Remake holds a lot of promise, looking set to retain the feel and challenge of the original whilst updating the interface and graphics to appeal to modern gamers. It remains a crying shame that Piranha Bytes are no more, but Alkimia seem to be honouring their legacy in all the right ways.</p>
<p>Now to replay the original on Switch before the Remake is released. Weirdly it’s the version that works best for modern controls…</p>
