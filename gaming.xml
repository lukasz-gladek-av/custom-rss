            <p>
Stray Kit Studios, a studio that includes former developers of Age Of Empires, Borderlands and Bioshock, have revealed Wartorn, a real-time tactics roguelite in which two elven sisters pit spells and minions against a brace of fantasy opponents, including ogres. It's a smaller-scale, squad-managerial affair reminiscent of the ancient Myth: Fallen Lords, though the "painterly" art direction reminds me more of the impressionistic World War 1 fable 11-11: Memories Retold.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I come and go with "painterly" art direction in video games. Often, it just feels like an upmarket way of saying "looks a bit smudged", and smudginess isn't generally desirable in a game where you give soldiers waypoints. But Wartorn (not to be confused with venerable RTS <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/21304/wartorn/">WarTorn</a>) does look rather lovely, and the scenically concussed presentation seems to complement the ebb and flow of the game's elemental combos, environment destruction and physics interactions. Still, there's a slow-time mechanic if you feel overwhelmed. Here's a trailer.
</p>

<p>
I also like that Wartorn sounds quite story-driven, though I'm less enthused by the on-the-nose talk of moral choices. "Set in a fantasy realm torn apart by extremism and the unraveling of ancient bonds, Wartorn follows an extended family as they fight to reunite and survive," explains the press release. "Players will make tough decisions, from choosing who gets fed to deciding which lives can be saved, all while confronting the moral quandaries of violence and sacrifice."
</p><p>
As for the roguelite progression stuff - they're calling it "unique", but I don't really see how, based on the press release and trailer. Apparently it "rewards players for perseverance, offering heirlooms, hero upgrades, and new abilities that carry forward with each run", which sounds like business as usual for a liker or liter of rogues.
</p>
<p>
To give you a sense of the pedigree, Stray Kite's co-founder and chief creative officer is Paul Hellquist, former Bioshock lead designer and creative director on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a>. Co-founder and technical director Shovaen Patel was lead programmer for sparky tower defender Orcs Must Die and Age Of Empires Online - a defunct MMO which somebody called Brendan Caldwell <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-age-of-empires-online">rather liked</a>, an unreasonably long time ago. The studio have previously worked on projects for other companies, including Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep - which I myself reviewed for Edge and found pretty unexciting - and Fortnite. Wartorn is their very first original project.
</p>
<p>
Did you play Myth: The Fallen Lords? It was one of Bungie's old joints, before they got into man-shooting. I remember being obsessed with the units who could dual-wield and being sad when I got them all killed. Hopefully, I'll be a better custodian for Wartorn's elf sisters. They seem pretty capable. Wartorn launches into early access in spring 2025 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/">Steam</a> and the Epic Game Store (EGS storepage link to follow, once it's live).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I’ve been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I’m going away next month.”</p><p>Fortune’s Run has been in early access for over a year at a price of $20. It currently has just over one hundred user reviews with a Steam rating of 90 percent. It’s due to receive more updates and content, but there’s no telling when, if ever, the game will actually be completed at this point. “It’s a shame, but it’s the consequences of my actions,” the developer continued. “I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn’t going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that. So the game isn’t TOTALLY dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it’s unclear what will happen.”</p><p>The game is a boomer shooter take on PC classics like <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Thief</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>with the grimy post-apocalyptic punk visual style of the early <em>Fallout</em> games. It’s mission-based instead of an open-ended sandbox, making it a unique blend of old-school PC gaming sensibilities. <em>Fortune’s Run</em> is the kind of game about which people constantly write things like, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmersiveSim/comments/16y788y/how_is_nobody_talking_about_fortunes_run/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmersiveSim/comments/16y788y/how_is_nobody_talking_about_fortunes_run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How is nobody talking about Fortune’s Run?</a></span>” It was already a cult hit with the potential to be a lowkey GOTY-contender whenever it came out of early access.</p><p>“I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there’s absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it’s just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time,” Dizzie wrote. “I want to underline that I’m no longer in financial dire straits since our game actually sold OK, so I should be able to afford rent once I get out, so there’s a chance that if you wait a few years I’ll be able to cap off the release. In fact, there’s not very much content left to work on, I’ve been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time.”</p><p>Before going to prison, the developer left players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805320&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with one last update</a></span>. It includes new missions, story sequences, puzzles, objects in the environments to interact with, and “hundreds upon hundreds of bug fixes.” However, it’ll break players’ existing saves and there’s no one to QA it. It’s unclear if Dizzie will be communicating with fans again before development goes on hiatus or if this is the last communication for some time. The game remains available to buy on Steam.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Few gaming publishers are more fiercely protective of their IP than Nintendo. In the past year alone, Nintendo has reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-intensifies-crackdown-on-youtube-emulator-channels-report/1100-6526834/" data-ref-id="1100-6526834">cracked down on YouTube emulator channels </a>that featured the company's games and played detective <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">to locate and identify an alleged Switch pirate</a>. During a recent appearance at an event run by Japan’s Association of Copyright for Computer Software, Nintendo's patent attorney Koji Nishiura took the time to walk through the company's stance on emulation.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/kikakuthetower/250112a#i-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Denfaminicogamer</a> and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-attorney-weighs-in-on-what-makes-emulators-illegal/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Nishiura suggested that the emulators by themselves may not be illegal, but the way they are used can determine if they are breaking the law. To illustrate his point, Nishiura noted that emulators may copy proprietary programs or disable security encryptions, both of which are activities that Nintendo frowns upon. He also said that emulators can be used to play pirated copies of Nintendo's games, which the company still considers to be illegal.</p><p>Nintendo has emulated several of its own games for its modern systems, which clearly falls within the company's rights. However, many classic games released on the oldest systems--including NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and GameCube--aren't readily available to legally play from Nintendo itself. Some emulator hosts have argued that by maintaining a library of these games, they are preserving a piece of video game history.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Nintendo doesn't seem to share that view. Although the company is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-lawsuit-shuts-down-switch-emulator-yuzu-and-3ds-emulator-citra/1100-6521589/" data-ref-id="1100-6521589">laser-focused on shutting down Switch and 3DS emulators</a>, it also prevented the Dolphin GameCube and Wii emulator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dolphin-emulator-team-abandons-plan-to-launch-it-on-steam/1100-6516124/" data-ref-id="1100-6516124">from launching on Steam</a>. Additionally, Nintendo sued <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-suing-creators-of-switch-emulator-says-tears-of-the-kingdom-was-pirated-1-million-times-pre-launch/1100-6521417/" data-ref-id="1100-6521417">the creators of a Switch emulator</a> and contended that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/" data-ref-id="1900-6418063">The Legend of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom</a> was pirated 1 million times before launch. Even though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-announced-for-january-16-as-switch-2-reveal-rumors-heat-up/1100-6528766/" data-ref-id="1100-6528766">the reveal of Switch 2</a> may come as soon this week, Nintendo isn't likely to stop going after emulator creators anytime soon.</p>

			<p>There’s a really specific sort of nostalgia that hits me like a truck whenever the <em>Tales </em>series is mentioned. I grew up hovering around this series of JRPGs, but never playing them. Other series like <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>and <em>Final Fantasy </em>caught my attention, but I would still spot <em>Tales </em>in the periphery. The series seemingly spawning a new mainline entry almost every year, combined with me hardly following news of the franchise, led to this sort of awe I would experience whenever I continuously discovered more and more <em>Tales </em>games that I had no idea even existed. As I’ve gotten older and started digging deeper into games and series I never gave a shot earlier in life, I’m finally getting around to playing a lot of these <em>Tales</em> games that only existed as ideas and myths to me. <em>Tales of Graces f </em>was one such myth – a Wii game I barely knew existed, which became a PS3 game I downloaded but never touched, and finally, it arrives in my life for the third time as a massively remastered and polished multi-platform re-release. And with this kind of care and quality, I’m hoping every entry in the series can eventually re-materialize in my life this way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tales of Graces f Remastered – Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGlgsKCOSE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Narrative and character arcs are a huge focus of <em>Tales of Graces f – </em>although things seem deceptively lighthearted and simple in the opening hours of the game. You play as 11-year-old Asbel Lhant, spending lackadaisical days in his Lhant, which him and his younger brother Hubert are heirs to the throne of. Neither are concerned with that inheritance, though, because they’re far busier figuring out what to do when they encounter a girl with purple hair and amnesia in the middle of a flowery meadow outside of town. Asbel does his best to take care of her and help her remember who she is, with help from his sickly friend Cheria. As drama and disaster strike the trio, though, the game flings us seven years into the future where they’re caught in the middle of a disastrous clash between three powerful kingdoms.</p>


<p>Of the many quality-of-life upgrades made to <em>Tales of Graces f Remastered, </em>the new option to swap between the original English or Japanese voiceover is huge in helping the story and its characters properly pluck at your heartstrings. For some gamers, the dated and slightly stiff English dub of what was originally a 2011 Nintendo Wii game might be more cheesy than charming, so being able to play with the Japanese voiceover enabled is a boon. Especially when this new version of the game has added full subtitles for mid-combat and post-battle dialogue, ensuring you won’t miss any details no matter which language you set the audio to. The cheesiness of a dated JRPG English dub is well worth experiencing in my opinion, though, so I happily plugged along with that dub for most of my run through the game.</p>


<p>Another immediately noticeable and extremely welcome change in <em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em> is the incredible job they’ve done upgrading and enhancing the visuals of the game. Don’t expect a <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth </em>treatment or any kind of wildly different approach to the original aesthetic of the game – the designs, art-style, and vibe of the original version are perfectly preserved. With sharper textures, more defined lighting, and a resolution way higher than what was originally rendered on the Wii or even the PS3 re-release, this version of the game feels like the way it was intended to look from the beginning. A lot of modern remasters of old RPGs hit a weird uncanny valley where the ultra-high resolution and super sharp textures kill a lot of the charm of the original version’s aesthetic – but I felt no such thing here. This is the perfect window into a bygone era of JRPGs that celebrates the charm of it’s original aesthetic while also polishing it to a perfectly balanced degree for a modern, more future-proofed release.</p>
<p><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em> packs in a lot of other welcome quality-of-life changes – for main quests, side quests, and timed cutscene events, you now have icon marks visible that show you where those objectives are and how far you are from them. You’ve also got the ability to use a new Dash function to move faster than before through the map, and even the ability to disable Encounters when you aren’t in the mood for random mob battles. Skits, the iconic “bonus conversations” of the <em>Tales </em>franchise that give you a sillier look into the banter between your party, now have new dialogue controls so you can speed up or skip through text during them. A collection of skits that were only available in the Japanese version of the game have also been included in this release with English translation for the first time. There’s a massive amount of other enhancements too – like new audio settings, the difficulty-modifying “Grade shop” available from the beginning, colourblind support for certain puzzles in the game, and so much more. Plus – every wacky piece of costume DLC from the original release is included for free.</p>

<p><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em> is an incredible JRPG experience. Diving into the classic real-time arena combat and the endearingly goofy Skits that made this franchise so iconic is such a treat. To have so many ways to customize the experience on the fly and make it even easier to dig into my favourite parts of the game is a blast. Whether I’m trying to breeze through a dungeon to get to the next story beat or I want to dig into some Artes grinding and savor every battle, <em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em> lets me do just that. It’s a beautiful remaster of a game I should’ve played long ago, and one that feels on par with even the latest entries in this long-running franchise.</p>

			<p>Despite having attained more success in recent years in the West following a long period of time when new entries in the series took years to hit North America and Europe or never did, Bandai Namco has been pretty conservative regarding remasters of older entries in the Tales series. Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-vesperia-definitive-edition/">Tales of Vesperia: Definitive Edition</a>, the Japanese publisher only teased that older games would be hitting modern gaming platforms and PC in the future, only recently revealing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-series-remasters-consistently/">full-blown initiative</a> that will see the constant release of remasters. The first remaster spearheading this initiative is Tales of Graces f Remastered, a very solid remaster that leaves the original experience almost intact, enhancing it with welcome quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250108190600_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of game content, Tales of Graces f Remastered doesn't feature anything new, and the game's main story and the Lineage &amp; Legacies epilogue that was added with the PlayStation 3 port of the original Wii release have been left untouched. As such, players will once again get to experience Asbel's fateful encounter with the mysterious girl he later names Sophie, the childhood promise he makes with her and the prince of the kingdom of Windor Richard, the tragedy that made him abandon his duty as the future lord of Lhant to become a knight, and the journey he makes across the world and beyond to protect all he holds dear.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the story is possibly the worst feature of Tales of Graces f and, having been left unchanged, of the remaster as well. It isn't bad by any means, but everything that is set up in the first few hours of the game, including the personal conflict between some of the characters and the larger political conflict between different nations, is eventually resolved with some of the usual JRPGs' tropes, including the power of friendship. It is a shame, as some of the events in the first few hours of the game held some potential, but the execution leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the average story is salvaged by an incredibly strong cast, which includes the aforementioned main character Asbel, Sophie, and Richard, Asbel's estranged brother Hubert, who was forced out of Lhant to prevent a succession crisis, childhood friend Cheria, the knight captain Malik and the cheerful Amarcian technician Pascal. While not all of them have the same degree of involvement or development in the main plot, although every one of them gets a development arc of sorts, they are all rather charming, as are their interactions, mostly in the Groovy Chat skits, a returning staple in the series. These interactions become even better in the short Lineage and Legacies epilogue, also thanks to a bigger involvement of Richard in the party dynamics that lead to some hilarious exchanges.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250114224347_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If Tales of Graces f Remastered delivers a predictable tale, it does not fail to provide an extremely fun gameplay, possibly one of the best in the entire series. For a long time before getting unified and later becoming part of Bandai Namco as a whole, the Tales development studio was divided into two different teams - colloquially known as Team Destiny and Team Symphonia - which handled the development of the 2D and 3D entries in the series respectively. Tales of Graces is the only 3D game developed by the 2D-focused team and it shows, as the game is, in my opinion, the only 3D entry in the series that emulates the series' original gameplay the best. While the removal of a proper world map in favor of an interconnected world impacts the sense of scale considerably, as the roads connecting towns and dungeons are extremely linear and don't offer much in terms of content outside of treasure chests, optional Discoveries that provide some information on the world and visible enemy symbols, the linearity somewhat favors the experience nowadays, making for a more compact game that doesn't waste much time with traveling through an empty open-world map. Location design is just as straightforward and doesn't hold that many surprises, although dungeon design is decisively better than other more recent entries in the series, as it features some simple puzzles, some of them easier to complete in the remaster as color recognition is no longer required to solve them.</p>
<p>The star of Tales of Graces f Remastered gameplay is undoubtedly its combat system, the Style Shift Linear Motion Battle System, which served as the basis for the combat system used in later entries in the series such as Tales of Zestiria and Tales of Berseria. While enemies are fought on a 3D battlefield, it is only possible to move on the same axis as the targeted enemy unless using the Free Run mechanic, which is not particularly effective due to its slow speed and cost in terms of combat resources. This, however, doesn't mean that there are no defensive options besides the classic guard, and it is possible to backstep and sidestep to avoid enemy attacks. If done with the right timing, the character will also recover some Chain Capacity, a self-restoring resource that is used to perform Artes. CC, which comes in two different values, Min and Max which indicate how much CC is available at the start of battle, and the maximum possible value, is tied to the critical hit mechanics. Unlike in the vast majority of JRPGs, critical hits are not percentage-based, but happen when a gauge has been filled in combat, and every time a critical hit is performed, there's not only the high chance of stunning an enemy, which is very beneficial to keep the offense going, as hitting a stunned enemy with a base 1 CC attack restores a huge amount of CC, but also increases by one point the minimum value. All these mechanics are tightly woven, and mastering them makes combat feel extremely rewarding.</p>
<p>Even if one were to play Tales of Graces f Remastered at a low difficulty without engaging with the mechanics outlined above, the game would be extremely fun to play. While, visually, enemy design is nothing to write home about, their combat design is excellent, especially for bosses, and dodging their attacks by using the evasion mechanics properly is very satisfying. Character combat design is just as great, as every playable character essentially has two fighting styles that can be seamlessly combined, for the most part. Asbel, for example, can fight with his sword sheathed with his A Style Artes and fully drawn with his B Style, for example; Hubert uses his double-sided blade with his A Style Artes, which become twin guns with his B Style Artes; spellcasters like Malik, Cheria, Pascal, and Richard can combine the physical Artes of their A Style and the spells of their B Style to reduce casting times. With the fast execution of the vast majority of A Style Artes and the fact that it is possible to quickly sidestep after their quick animations have ended, Tales of Graces f Remastered feels snappy and fun at all skill levels.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250115121951_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of character customization, Tales of Graces f Remastered features some rather unique mechanics that leverage one of the series staples, Titles. Each title in the game, which is obtained by either story progression, leveling up, using Artes a set amount of time, or accomplishing a variety of feats such as traveling a certain distance or spending a certain amount of Gald, comes with five different skills between stats improvements, passive skills, Artes, and Mystic Artes, the powerful cinematic attacks that can be unleashed during this game's version of the traditional Overlimits mechanics, Eleth Rise. While the system is simple and doesn't offer a lot in terms of pure customization and character building, it makes players engage more with the game's combat mechanics, rewarding them as they take advantage of them over the course of the adventure. Providing players more customization options is the Dualize system that allows players to fuse together two items, which can be used to enhance gear and produce Gems sporting a variety of special effects, including CC values boosts, but this is a system that not too many will fully take advantage of, as it is a little obscure and not properly explained in-game.</p>
<p>While Tales of Graces f Remastered doesn't introduce any major change to the original, the quality of life improvements make it a great release for both newcomers and returning players. Besides making color-based puzzles clearable even without color recognition, the remaster features a slew of other new features, including being able to access the Grade Shop on the first playthrough, the ability to switch on and off some of the features it offers at will, such as the experience and SP multipliers, Destination Icons for main and time-sensitive sub-quests, the latter especially welcome as it is easy to miss side-quests in the original, dash and enemy toggle which can speed up progression a lot, an auto-save function, the ability to retry even normal battles upon defeat, and the ability to skip to the next line of dialogue during Groovy Chats.</p>
<p>Tales of Graces f Remastered also features enhanced visuals, although the improvements are relegated to a mere resolution bump, as the vast majority of visual elements, like character models, lighting, and textures, don't seem to have received a major overhaul. Still, this isn't a major issue, as the game's colorful visual style has aged incredibly well, and some of the low-resolution textures don't look out of place even at 4K resolution. Besides resolution options, the PC version also offers some graphics settings to tweak at three framerate caps - 30, 60, and 120 FPS. Being an undemanding title, Tales of Graces f Remastered ran extremely well on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) at 4K resolution and locked 120 FPS, and I expected less powerful system configurations to run the game just as well at resolutions higher than 1080p.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Tales of Graces f Remastered doesn't add much to the original experience, but the choice improvements it introduces make for a slightly more enjoyable game. While the story isn't all that exciting, the charming cast and the excellent gameplay make the remaster one that is worth getting for both series fans and those who may have never experienced Asbel's adventure before.</p>

<p>In a Steam news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2585830/view/514072769031307363" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the studio reveals five of the actors that will be playing characters in the open-ended narrative adventure, and you'll almost certainly recognize some of the names on the list.</p>

<p>First up is Takaya Kuroda, who's best known for voicing&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>'s Kazuma Kiryu. Kaizen says Kuroda "just turned up to the audition" and that the studio "didn't even dream to ask for him", but he's voicing player character Michi, which feels appropriate given Michi is a "stoic" ex-yakuza.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/promise-mascot-agency-voice-actors-dialogue.jpg?itok=pk0ldjki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/promise-mascot-agency-voice-actors-dialogue.jpg?itok=EzgPv3n0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ex-yakuza Michi will be voiced by Takaya Kuroda, best known for voicing ex-yakuza Kazuma Kiryu.</figcaption></figure><p>The next big name on the list is&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>'s Ayano Shibuya, who voices Purah in both that game and its sequel&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. She's voicing assistant manager and "chaos goblin"&nbsp;Pinky in&nbsp;<em>Promise Mascot Agency</em>.</p>

<p>Bizarrely, industry legend Shuhei Yoshida, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation" rel="nofollow">recently left PlayStation</a> after 31 years with the company, will be voicing "resident veteran gamer and arcade owner" MonouGe. Yoshida did say he didn't want to vanish from the industry, but this was not on my bingo card.</p>

<p><em>Chainsaw Man</em>'s Eri Saito, who Kaizen says also voiced a member of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>'s Beauty and the Beast Unit, will join the cast as Matriarch Shimazu.</p>

<p>Rounding off the voice cast announcements for today is none other than&nbsp;<em>Deadly Premonition&nbsp;</em>auteur SWERY, whose real name is Hidetaka Suehiro. He'll be playing "reformed ex-biker-gang-member priest" Kannushi-kun.</p>




<p><em>Promise Mascot Agency&nbsp;</em>is the next game from<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/paradise-killer" rel="nofollow">Paradise Killer</a>&nbsp;</i>developer Kaizen Game Works. Described by the developer as an "open-world narrative adventure", it sees disgraced ex-yakuza Michi running a mascot agency while trying to solve the mystery of his exile.</p>

<p>The game is set for release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585830/Promise_Mascot_Agency/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008195" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/promise-mascot-agency/9p6gcj303k9b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch sometime this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guerrilla-games-aspires-to-bring-over-1-million-players-to-horizon-multiplayer-title.1082937/</guid>

<p>A new job listing by Guerrilla Games suggests that the developers hope to attract more than 1 million players globally to their upcoming Horizon Multiplayer title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/horizon-multiplayer-game-live-service-player-count-ambitions-guerrilla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a> via (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horizon/horizon-zero-dawns-multiplayer-spinoff-has-big-dreams-as-guerrilla-confirms-its-hoping-to-attract-more-than-1-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), a new <a href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/join/senior-platform-engineer-decima/7779018002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> for a senior platform engineer at Guerrilla Games’ Online Infrastructure team has seemingly provided new details about the upcoming online multiplayer title based in the Horizon universe. One of the job requirements for this position is for the applicant to have experience in “building and operating multi-service, 1M+ user globally distributed systems across multiple public cloud providers”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though the listing hints that Guerrilla Games could expect over 1 million players for their Horizon Multiplayer game, the game itself is not mentioned. However, considering they do not currently have any other multiplayer games in the works (that have been confirmed), it can be speculated that it is the Horizon online title. At the same time, the million-player user base might be an upper limit to ensure the server can smoothly handle the influx of players during the launch period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Horizon Online Multiplayer title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in 2022, announcing, “A new internal team is developing a separate Online Project set in the Horizon’s universe.” Since then, no official announcements or news have arrived about the game; however, a recent job listing suggested that the online Horizon game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Horizon Zero Dawn movie was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced by Sony at CES 2025</a>. Also, according to a new claim, LEGO Horizon Adventures <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could come to Xbox in a few months</a>. What are your thoughts on Guerrilla aspiring to bring more than one million players to their Horizon online multiplayer game?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A isn’t being built to take advantage of the hardware improvements of the Nintendo Switch 2. That’s according to Jeff Grubb on his latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/TfkNfMonxoc?t=3942s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Last of the Nintendogs</a>” episode.</p>



<p>Grubb said that when the next Pokémon Presents takes place—likely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-pokemon-presents-date-seemingly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Pokemon Day</a>—all of the games shown will be developed for the current Switch console.</p>



<p>“I did hear that everything in that Pokémon Direct will be positioned as ‘These games are Switch 1 games’,” Grubb said. “They will work on Switch 2, but there will not be anything that is obviously made for Switch 2. Which is normal for The Pokémon Company.”</p>



<p>His co-host, Mike Minotti, seemed surprised by that with a belief that “of all that games that should get a performance boost on the Switch 2” it should be the next Pokémon game.</p>







<p>Announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during last year’s Pokémon Presents</a> on Pokémon Day, Pokémon Z-A is the follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus from 2022. The game features “a new adventure awaits within Lumiose City, where an urban redevelopment plan is under way to shape the city into a place that belongs to both people and Pokémon.”</p>



<p>More on the game is expected to be shown, including the announcement of a release date, during the upcoming Pokémon Presents event in February. There will also be new information on upcoming plans for Pokémon Go along with the expected surprises that always seem to appear during the events.</p>

                <p>The newest update for PUBG brings back a popular, fan-favorite feature--Recall. With the new 33.2 update, players on the Sanhok map can utilize the Recall system, which allows them to bring back fallen teammates mid-match. Recall was originally added to PUBG in 2023 before being removed.</p><p>Now, however, Krafton is bringing the feature back. "We heard your feedback!" the developer said in the official patch notes for update 33.2</p><p>Players can use the Recall system every 2.5 minutes, though the ability to bring back fallen teammates goes away from Phase 6 onwards. The Recall system also works with custom matches.</p><p>When Recall was originally added to PUBG, players had to acquire a special item, the Blue Chip, and take it to a special location, to revive fallen allies. Players could also pick up Blue Chips belonging to enemies to prevent them from coming back to the match, thus adding new layers of strategy. Whether or not the Recall system will change in any way for its forthcoming re-introduction is unknown.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSdDPhABJ4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pJSdDPhABJ4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Patch 33.2 also brings back the Loot Truck, which is a heavily armed vehicle that roams around the map and drops valuable loot when damaged. Matches begin with four Loot Trucks that travel on predetermined routes.</p><p>If players completely destroy a Loot Truck, it will drop all of its cargo, but players will want to be far away when this happens, as the 10-meter blast radius can knock down or kill anyone caught inside it.</p><p>You can <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/8119" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see the full patch notes for PUBG update 33.2 on the PUBG website.</a></p>

            <p>GOG has joined the European Federation of Game Archives, Museums and Preservation Projects (EFGAMP) as it continues to push for game preservation.</p>
<p>The PC game platform is the first Polish institution to join EFGAMP, which was founded in 2012 to represent over 20 organisations focused on collecting and preserving digital games. It's the largest organisation in Europe of its kind.</p>
<p>"GOG was created with video game preservation in mind," said GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski, emphasising the company's game preservation ambitions.</p>

<p>"Classic games and the mission to safeguard them for future generations have always been at the core of our work. Over the past decade, we've honed our expertise in this area. The GOG Preservation Program, which ensures compatibility for over 100 games and delivers hundreds of enhancements, is just one example of this commitment. We were thrilled to see the Program warmly received not only by our players but also by our partners and the gaming industry as a whole."</p><p>He continued: "As a European company, we feel a responsibility to lead in preserving gaming heritage. Joining EFGAMP reinforces this commitment. Our next step is to expand institutional collaboration with museums and governmental and non-governmental organisations worldwide. We hope our experience will contribute meaningfully to their efforts. We are also discussing exciting new game preservation projects, which we look forward to sharing soon."</p>

<p>Andreas Lange, COO of EFGAMP, highlighted GOG's "unique perspective" as a "European leader in digital game distribution".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyper-light-breaker-devs-promise-fixes-for-performance-and-accessibility.1082904/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Heart Machine's action roguelite&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>has officially launched in Early Access, and the developer has promised fixes for some of the game's most pressing issues by the end of the week.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s Steam review rating is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently sitting at Mixed</a>, with negative reviews often pointing to problems like accessibility restrictions and performance dips.</p>

<p>Now, in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heartmachine.bsky.social/post/3lfqn5mpqnk22" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a thread</a> on social media platform Bluesky, Heart Machine has promised that fixes for "performance issues and accessibility requests", such as mouse sensitivity options and the ability to invert the game's camera, will be introduced "by the end of the week".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-characters.jpg?itok=M66FpfHv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-characters.jpg?itok=80lHaCM1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fixes are on the way for some of&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s most pressing problems.</figcaption></figure><p>Addressing the Mixed review rating, Heart Machine says that Early Access games necessarily "take on the risk of negative early reviews and feedback" owing to different players' "expectations" for such a release.</p>

<p>The developer calls feedback received about&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s performance and accessibility problems "extremely reasonable" and says that receiving "large quantities" of such feedback "actually helps us determine how to prioritize future updates".</p>

<p>In closing, Heart Machine says it's heartening (that's my cheap pun, not theirs) to see accessibility concerns being raised, as the studio was "already planning" to add these features and the fixes required are "straightforward".</p>

<p>A more specific timeframe hasn't been given for the fixes to these issues, but given that we're already on Wednesday, the end of the week is fast approaching. We'll likely see an update in the next few days.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is, it's the third game by Heart Machine, following on from 2016's&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-style action-adventure game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter" rel="nofollow">Hyper Light Drifter</a>&nbsp;</em>and 2021's parkour platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/solar-ash" rel="nofollow"><em>Solar Ash</em></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike its predecessors,&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is a roguelite that's designed to be replayed, and it supports co-op play too. You'll traverse a variety of procedurally-generated worlds with "incredible freedom", slaying enemies and gathering loot to create unique loadouts.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

In them, Batman and Superman show up to finish Braniac off and reveal that the Justice League members the player killed were actually just clones. Everyone except Wonder Woman seemingly, who ended up getting killed at the hands of the Superman clone. Batman’s pivotal death? Also a clone.

It sounds about as well put together as the live-service pitch for the underlying game. </p><p>The Suicide Squad members remove their bomb implants and leave the planet to explore outer space, while the remaining Justice League members travel to all of the universes Braniac ruined to set things right and “atone.” The whole thing last less than two minutes, and despite being entirely an exposition dump, still feels like it leaves a lot unexplained. It’s also hard to know how much ofthis was Rocksteady’s original plan for the story’s year-one conclusion, and how much of it was cobbled together last-minute as the studio pivots to new projects. </p><p>“That was the most disappointing ending I’ve seen,” wrote one commenter on YouTube. “Pissed off the entire fandom, sullied their legacy,  only for it to go the ‘none of it mattered’ route just for the sake live gaming and money,” wrote another.

Games has released a new trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> that reveals a brief first look at upcoming guest character T-1000 Terminator and a Conan the Barbarian's Brutality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the trailer is focused on Mortal Kombat eSports, it showcases Conan the Barbarian gameplay that sees the warrior cut his hapless opponent in half during a particularly stabby Brutality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also get a brief first look at T-1000 Terminator, showing its hand returning to human form from liquid metal form in a scene that rekindles memories of blockbuster action movie Terminator 2. It very much looks like Mortal Kombat 1's T-1000 is based on Robert Patrick, who played the character in the film, and we understand Patrick voices T-1000, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/15/screenshot-2025-01-15-143119-1736951538114.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mortal Kombat 1's T-1000.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Conan the Barbarian, due out January 21 as part of the standard DLC early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners before wide availability a week later, features the likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who famously played Conan in the cult classic 1982 film, but does not feature his voice. The official Conan the Barbarian gameplay trailer will be debuted on tomorrow’s Kombat Kast, giving fans a deeper dive on this powerful fighter. Release timing and availability for T-1000 Terminator will be announced at a later date, Warner Bros. said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator is the final DLC character added to the gory fighting game as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and, later this month, Conan the Barbarian. Fans have been wondering for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s sales success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For its part, Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat 1 has sold more than four million copies, and in November Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady">the company plans to double down on just four titles, including Mortal Kombat</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago">NetherRealm chief Ed Boon said the developer decided on its next game three years ago, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, although neither NetherRealm nor owner and publisher Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You even help a living finger work through anger issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Promise Mascot Agency is punching above its weight is in the voice cast department. It’s nabbed PlayStation developer legend Shuhei Yoshida in his first ever video game voice role, and the announcement comes hot on the heels of Yoshida’s last day at Sony.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">At farewell party yesterday 😆 <a href="https://t.co/hpiPWQIO1z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hpiPWQIO1z</a></p>— Shuhei Yoshida (@yosp) <a href="https://twitter.com/yosp/status/1879264451079315564?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Shuhei Yoshida worked on PlayStation from the very beginning, playing a key role in the original console’s success from 1993. He was one of the more public-facing PlayStation executives while President of SIE Worldwide Studios from 2008 to 2019, championing indie and VR success in particular. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-retiring-from-sony-in-january">Yoshida announced his exit from Sony in November during his 31st year at PlayStation</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on,” he explained at the time. “You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Yoshida long-term plan remains up in the air, in the short-term he’s turned to video game voice acting, and that's where Promise Mascot Agency comes in. Yoshida plays Monouge, an odd-looking green-skinned former mascot who is opening their own game center.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida isn’t the only big name joining the Promise Mascot Agency voice cast. Yakuza: Like A Dragon’s Takaya Kuroda, who plays series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, and Legend of Zelda’s Ayano Shibuya also star, as do Eri Saito (Chainsaw Man, Metal Gear Solid 4, Way of the Samurai 3) and Swery, developer of Deadly Premonition, The Good Life, and Spy Fiction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see what Yoshida and co sound like in-game in the exclusive trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can’t believe that our weird game managed to attract such a strong voice cast,” said game director Oli Clarke Smith.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When our lead Japanese localiser, Roppyaku Tsurumi, told us that Kuroda-san had auditioned, we just about lost our minds. All of the cast have brought our group of misfits to life wonderfully. After working on these characters for four years, they have become like friends to us, and we’re so happy that they have all been given a voice. The team at the recording studio, Xenorex, did an amazing job.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Takaya Kuroda voices the disgraced ex-yakuza Michi, exiled to the forgotten (and quite definitely cursed) Japanese town of Kaso-Machi with two goals: pay off his debt and restore glory to the town’s defunct mascot agency! Recruit the weird and wonderful mascots across town with help from your severed finger assistant manager and chaos goblin, Pinky☆ - voiced by Ayana Shibuya, negotiate their contracts and assign them jobs they love.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Promise Mascot Agency will be available on PC and consoles early 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTA.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida announced he would leave PlayStation</a> back in November last year.

<p>In 2023, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-shuhei-yoshida-awarded-bafta-games-fellowship">awarded the BAFTA Games Fellowship</a> for his contributions to the industry.</p> <div>

<p>"I've been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation," Yoshida said in November, announcing his departure. "And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.</p><p>"You know, the company's been doing great," he continued. "I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I'm so excited for the future of PlayStation."</p>
<p>I'm not sure anyone expected him to move into voice acting, though.</p>

            <p>Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and Ubisoft's founding Guillemot family are reportedly considering a new venture using a foundation of Ubisoft assets.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-mull-ubisoft-asset-venture?leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> (paywall), the two companies will create this venture and then move select Ubisoft assets over, with sources close to the matter stating this is an attempt to give Ubisoft's value an overall boost.</p>
<p>Tencent and Ubisoft are said to be in the process of evaluating which assets to include in this venture. "A potential deal would allow Tencent to own a stake in the venture and gain more control over some of Ubisoft’s intellectual properties, while boosting its video game business outside of China," the report reads.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, no final decisions have been made with regard to this alleged venture between Tencent and Ubisoft. However, we already knew Ubisoft was looking at ways to try and increase its value.</p>
<p>As outlined earlier this month, the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry maker has appointed advisors to "review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". Meanwhile, last October, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">Tencent and Ubisoft were considering a buyout</a>. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">similar report was then released in December</a>.</p><p>Last year was a particularly bumpy one for Ubisoft. The company suffered at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">least three rounds of layoffs</a>, as well as staff walkouts, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">disappointing sales for titles such as Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Ubisoft additionally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">pulled the plug on live-service shooter XDefiant</a>, and shuttered a number of studios.</p>
<p>In the last week, Ubisoft delayed the next instalment in its Assassin's Creed series - Shadows - once again. The upcoming game was initially due to release in 2024, before its launch was then pushed to 14th February.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">Assassin's Creed Shadows will now release on 20th March</a>, Ubisoft announced last week.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yet another round of layoffs has hit Microsoft, affecting employees working at the tech giant's gaming division, as well as two of its other divisions.</p>

<p>A report by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> (which is paywalled; we're using additional reporting by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-to-lay-off-unknown-number-of-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) cites a spokesperson as saying that a small number of Microsoft employees would be affected, although the spokesperson stopped short of saying how many constitutes that small number.</p>

<p>Given that Microsoft is a massive company that employs hundreds of thousands of people, a small number could refer to tens of employees, a few hundred, or even a few thousand; anything short of thousands and thousands of employees being laid off would likely be a drop in the ocean for Microsoft.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025-flight-sim.jpg?itok=0Vm9UEUt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025-flight-sim.jpg?itok=KUruUp6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft's latest round of layoffs affect employees in gaming, as well as other divisions.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the gaming division, the latest layoffs also affect employees in Microsoft's security and sales departments, although we don't know what proportion of employees were laid off across each division.</p>

<p>As noted by GI.biz, the spokesperson said that these layoffs weren't related to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/microsoft-confirms-performance-based-job-cuts-across-departments.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">performance-based job cuts</a> announced last week, so it doesn't sound like these employees are being let go because their performance is unsatisfactory (or not solely because of that, anyway).</p>

<p>Back in January last year, Microsoft apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">laid off almost 2,000 staff</a> solely from its gaming division, with Xbox head Phil Spencer reportedly claiming the cuts were part of reaching a "sustainable cost structure" to support Xbox's "growing business".</p>

<p>Of course, those layoffs didn't prevent CEO Satya Nadella from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">scoring a payrise</a> to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Perish the thought that the C-suite could perhaps absorb some of the cost when it comes to considering layoffs.</p>

<p>Microsoft is kicking off the year the same way it did 2024, holding layoffs across the company. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a>, Microsoft is letting go people from its sales, security, and gaming teams.</p>



<p>Business Insider sources say that employees started getting notifications of the layoffs on Tuesday. Microsoft told the outlet that the layoffs “are small” while not giving information on the number of cuts.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft about the exact number of people being let go from the gaming division in this latest round of layoffs. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-layoffs-affect-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let go 1,900 people</a> from its gaming team after it closed on its purchase of Activision Blizzard. More layoffs were held throughout the year via studio closures and other mass layoffs, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-650-people-lay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including 650 people</a> in September 2024. The company even shut down four studios in May 2024, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. Tango Gameworks, however, would ultimately be purchased by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-acquired-by-pubg-publisher-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krafton </a>and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-rebirth-krafton-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunched</a>.</p>

<p>Last year saw nearly 16,000 people let go from their jobs in the games industry across more than 160 companies.  In the first 15 days of 2025, <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">there have been 10 known layoffs</a> and closures with at least 160+ people let go based on known numbers. With estimates, we are looking at well over 200 people thus far. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's Ending Is Really Dumb]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-ending-dumb</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-ending-is-really-dumb.1082832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-ending-dumb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rocksteady has released the final update for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and it looks like the joke's on you if you're still invested in the game's narrative for some reason.</p>

<p>Over on social media platform X, content creator Synth Potato <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1879239456320032790" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> the game's final cutscene in its entirety. It takes the form of a&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>-style 2D animated storyboard cutscene, probably - as Synth Potato notes - "due to budget cuts".</p>

<p>The cutscene is narrated by Harley Quinn, who tells the story of how she and the Suicide Squad entered Brainiac's lair only to find Superman alive and well (and, notably, not Brainiac-possessed). It turns out that the evil Justice League wiped out in the main story were just clones. Of course.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ending-superman.jpg?itok=-JFeShDJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ending-superman.jpg?itok=0Phn5dIy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can't scare me, Superman. You're just a clone.</figcaption></figure><p>The whole thing turns out to have been one of Batman's characteristically complex plans, although when Batman asks how the Suicide Squad knew the Justice League were clones, Quinn says they didn't. Ha, and indeed, ha.</p>

<p>Superman then says the Justice League needs to "atone" and put as many worlds right as it can, while Harley and the Suicide Squad get their collars shorted by the "wonder trio of Hack, Lawless, and Toyboy", pledging to go on a "road trip".</p>

<p>It's all exactly as abrupt and nonsensical as it sounds. I'll put my cards on the table and admit I didn't play&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, so I have no idea whether this is a satisfying ending to the story or not, but I'm going to hedge my bets and say that it isn't.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">announced back in December</a> that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s fourth season would be its last, and that an offline mode would be added in order to allow players to play without an online connection.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-harley-gang.jpg?itok=bZwP6Owb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-harley-gang.jpg?itok=KkqqP2ok 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s ending is unlikely to have many fans.</figcaption></figure><p>This decision was almost certainly made due to&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s terminally small player base, as well as the fact that its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">disappointing sales</a> contributed to a $200 million loss for publisher Warner Bros.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the best thing one can say about this ending is that it technically leaves the door open for another game in the&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>series, although with longtime voice actor Kevin Conroy now sadly no longer with us, that might not be such a good idea. Stay tuned for more.</p>

In March 2024, developers of Nintendo Switch emulator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settled-for-24-million-between-nintendo-and-tropic-haze"><u>Yuzu</u></a> were ordered to pay $2.4 million in damages after a court settlement with Nintendo. In October 2024, Switch emulator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-emulator-ryujinx-nintendo"><u>Ryujinx</u></a> ceased development following “contact from Nintendo.” In 2023, the developers behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dolphin-emulator-wont-release-on-steam-after-all"><u>Dolphin</u></a>, an emulator for Gamecube and Wii, were advised against a full Steam release by lawyers at Valve, who were contacted by Nintendo’s lawyers alongside “strong legal wording.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most famously, in 2023 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-still-owes-millions"><u>Gary Bowser</u></a>, a reseller of Team Xecuter products that allowed users to bypass the Nintendo Switch’s anti-piracy measures, was charged with fraud and ordered to pay $14.5m back to Nintendo, a debt he will repay for life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, a patent lawyer representing Nintendo has lifted the lid on the company’s approach to piracy and emulation, and discussed how the propagation of emulators could lead to software piracy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a report from <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/kikakuthetower/250112a#i-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Denfaminicogamer</u></a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/are-emulators-illegal-or-not-nintendo-lawyer-explains-why-its-been-taking-them-down/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>) at Tokyo eSports Festa 2025, “Intellectual Property Managers” from Capcom, Sega, and Nintendo gathered to discuss the laws designed to protect companies’ intellectual property. Speaking for Nintendo was a patent attorney and Assistant Manager of the Intellectual Property Division, Koji Nishiura. In a translation by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-attorney-weighs-in-on-what-makes-emulators-illegal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>, he explained: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To begin with, are emulators illegal or not? This is a point often debated. While you can’t immediately claim that an emulator is illegal in itself, it can become illegal depending on how it’s used.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nishiura explained further that if an emulator copies a program from the game it is running, it may constitute copyright infringement, and this is also the case if the emulator can disable a console’s security mechanisms. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is largely down to Japan’s “<a href="https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3629" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Unfair Competition Prevention Act</u></a>,” or UCPA, which is only enforceable in Japan itself. This makes it more difficult for Nintendo to pursue legal action overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The example given in a slide during the Tokyo eSports Festa talk was the Nintendo DS “R4” card, which allowed users of the cartridge to circumvent and run backed-up or pirated versions of games on a single cartridge. Ultimately, after Nintendo and 50 other software manufacturers cried out about the R4, Nintendo won a ruling that the manufacturers and resellers violated the UCPA, effectively <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-after-sales-ban-japan-finally-blocks-import-of-r4-cartridges" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>outlawing sales of the R4 in 2009</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nishiura further explained that tools that allow users to download pirated software within an emulator or piece of software would also constitute copyright law infringement. Named “reach apps” in Japanese law, these third-party tools like the 3DS’s infamous “Freeshop,” or third-party app installer “Tinfoil” for Switch, may also violate copyright laws.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its Yuzu lawsuit, Nintendo claimed that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-tears-of-the-kingdom-was-pirated-1-million-times-pre-release-in-lawsuit-against-emulator-creator">pirated one million times</a>. Specifically, the filing claimed that Yuzu's Patreon page allowed its developers to earn $30,000 per month by providing subscribers with "daily updates," "early access," and "special unreleased features" to games like Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech and hardware.
