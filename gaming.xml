			<p>Ecco the Dolphin creator Ed Annunziata announced in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">Xbox Wire</a> that remasters of Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco: The Tides of Time are on their way. Once those are complete, Annunziata and the rest of the original development team will work on a brand-new third Ecco game for modern players.</p>
<p>The full Xbox Wire post focused more on celebrating Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, and games made by Asian and Pacific Islander creators, with a short but impactful spotlight at the end where Annunziata answered a few questions.</p>
<p>When asked about what the future holds for Ecco, Annunziata did not mince words, saying, "<em>Me and the entire original team are going to Remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games. Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>
<p>Annunziata ended off by telling players to keep their eyes on <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">eccothedolphin.com</a>, which takes you to a landing page with a countdown that will end on&nbsp;<strong>April 25, 2026, at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm BT.&nbsp;</strong>Annunziata did not elaborate further as to whether that will be when the remasters release, or if it'll just be when we get our first look at Ecco's upcoming return.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1878873951344185652">Gematsu</a> spotted trademark filings from SEGA for "<em>Ecco</em>" and "<em>Ecco the Dolphin,</em>" which we now know were due to the series being brought back to life, and not just your bog-standard filing to keep the trademark.</p>
<p>Ecco the Dolphin has <a href="https://wccftech.com/ecco-metroid-orphan-of-the-machine-xbox-series-x-fall2020/">inspired</a> a number of games since its original release in 1992, with its focus on ocean conservation and marine life, and its meticulous and difficult brand of 2D side-scrolling. It'll be interesting to see how Annunziata and the team approach a remaster, if it'll be something akin to what Virtuos did for<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/"> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, with a big graphical overhaul while keeping the underlying game the same, or if it'll be more like a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-thing-remastered-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-from-nightdive/">Nightdive Studios</a> remaster, that keeps the original look and feel of the game intact, while adding a few quality-of-life improvements so it runs as smooth as possible on modern hardware.</p>
<p>If it's the former of the two, then that will also likely inform what Annunziata means when he talks about making a third game with "<em>contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>

Then in February, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer confirmed that four games, including <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, would arrive on PS5.

Bungie’s extraction shooter didn’t really win me over, but each time I booted it up I was greeted by a PlayStation Studios logo, as the former <em>Halo </em>maker is now owned by PlayStation. This was odd to see on my Xbox, but it didn’t stand out too much. But <em>Gears of War </em>on PlayStation is so bizarre. It’s one of Xbox’s big three:<em> Forza, Halo, Gears</em>. Now only one of them remains truly Xbox only. </p><p><em>Gears </em>on PS5 is the kind of weird idea that, a decade ago or more, you’d hear someone suggest and you’d laugh at. Like some random, clueless analyst pondering when Mario will arrive on Xbox. Never gonna happen dude, don’t you know anything? I remember being a younger lad and being one of the few people at my middle school to own an Xbox. They all had PlayStation 3s. They all were jealous of <em>Gears of War</em>. Some of them would tell me that <em>Gears </em>was coming to PS3 one day. And <em>Halo</em>. I’d shake my head. I knew better. I read all the gaming magazines of the day. I scrolled through gaming forums and consumed <em>GameSpot </em>articles. They were wrong. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-ps3-version-of-gears-of-war-3-is-now-available-1846937357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-ps3-version-of-gears-of-war-3-is-now-available-1846937357"><em>Gears of War</em> would <em><strong>never </strong></em>be on a PlayStation console</a></span>. Well, turns out they were right, they were just about 18 years ahead of the schedule.</p><p> So while I understand the business reasons for <em>Gears </em>coming to PlayStation and I’ve seen plenty of other Xbox-published games arrive on non-Xbox consoles, it’s all still very weird for me to watch. I’ll probably have to sit down when I see the news of <em>Halo </em>on PS5. At least more people will now have access to more games. That’s cool, even if younger me would never have believed any of this was possible. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The trusty steed helps get our heroine from the small town of Jackson to the warzone of Seattle. However, in one of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s most shocking moments, while on horseback the player is forced to accidentally trigger an explosive barricade set up by the W.L.F. A member of the militia is kind enough to put her out of her misery after the blast, but then captures Ellie for questioning. It’s a brutal scene, and it’s even worse when you don’t know it’s coming.</p><p>As such, people watching the <em>Last of Us </em>show after playing the game have been bracing themselves for this week’s episode, as this would have been the one in which Shimmer kicked the bucket in a more faithful retelling.

In the dead of night, the company updated the store's top games chart, and now displays games ranked by "highest sales for the past few days" and not "most downloads for the past two weeks." It wasn't until </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/3X6nDoGNfPc?si=xUNgqoJokQsQI9uq">YouTuber GVG</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> happened to spot the change that anyone took notice, and developers who've spent years building audiences on the eShop scrambled to understand how it would impact their game. Storefront visibility is a key driver of financial success in the digital age, and the quirks of every different platform from Steam, to PlayStation, to the Nintendo eShop all have developers trying different sales strategies at different times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 only a month away, it's notable that Nintendo would shake up how it displays games to players. Developers are counting on the new console to not only </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2s-dlss-support-to-be-a-big-part-of-future-nintendo-games">deliver better performance</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but to also serve as a gateway for players to jump from first-party to third-party titles.

It's also introducing a content recommendation system called "Game Finds For You."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both these changes, said Omdia analyst James McWhirter, help address what he called "the biggest threat" to Nintendo's generational transition: bringing over 15,000 Nintendo Switch titles to the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop. Nintendo needs to balance its promise that most Nintendo Switch games will be compatible with the Switch 2 while avoiding overpromoting what may be perceived as "low quality" games.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2-shows-nintendo-s-strategy-for-a-social-future" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo Switch 2 shows Nintendo's strategy for an online social future</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Changing the eShop ranking criteria from sales volumes to revenue will stop much of this content from surfacing on Switch 2, where Nintendo has already set in place measures—including the platform-wide "Switch 2 Edition" program—to favor positioning of higher-value Switch 2-branded content," he said. "The knock-on impact is going to be [fewer] opportunities for developers of lower-priced software to reach players."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He pointed to "breakout" Switch games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Exit 8</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suika Games</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thief Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as games that may not rank as high under this new system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">GameDiscoverCo founder (and former Game Developer publisher) Simon Carless offered a similar outlook, saying the change will stop a lot of the eShop "slop" that's released on sale at 90 percent off from dominating the charts. He called this "good," but added "it'll also be trickier for cheaper games to get high up the charts."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers and publishers behind cheaper games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>might</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> stand a chance of ranking high if they can still move high volumes of units, but as No More Robots publisher Mike Rose told Game Developer, that may favor companies with the ability to do "huge short-term marketing blasts, the size we can't compete with."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-redesigned-from-the-ground-up-the-nintendo-switch-2-will-launch-on-june-5" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Redesigned from the ground up:' The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $449</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's decent reason for small developers to worry, but with other discoverability options on the way, Rose said he's waiting to pass judgment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bitcraft-online-sandbox-mmo-to-launch-on-june-20-in-early-access-will-be-open-source/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, San Francisco based independent developer Clockwork Labs announced that their sandbox MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/bitcraft-is-a-community-sandbox-mmorpg-with-a-fully-editable-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcraft Online</a> will launch on June 20 in early access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3454650/BitCraft_Online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a>. Moreover, the game's code will be open source, allowing any user to contribute.</p>
<p>Tyler Cloutier, co-founder of Clockwork Labs, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The ethos behind BitCraft Online has always been about one core principle: collaboration. This is a massive in-game ecosystem, where we encourage players to work together to build towns, cities, or even empires. So to truly empower our community, it was important to ensure that the game would be open-source, allowing players to express themselves in their own unique way. We want to give our community not only the toolset to play within our world, but to participate in building it. Open-sourcing is more than just a technical decision—it's a philosophical one.</em></p>
<p>The game is set in a single procedural world, meaning that all players will play together, unlike in most MMORPGs. They'll join others to form communities, build cities and structures, and discover beautiful biomes.</p>
<p>The world terrain can be modified, too, allowing players to carve mountains and build their own legacy with a tangible impact on the land. As in any good sandbox game, Bitcraft Online promises multiple valid playstyles, from crafter and trader to explorer and monster hunter, or any such combination. Surviving and gathering resources are the keys to success. The economy is entirely player-driven, so the best merchants will thrive.</p>

This year's event certainly didn't disappoint, as we got glimpses of a wide range of upcoming products, ranging from less than $20 to over $1500. What can we say? Being a Star Wars collector is nothing if not an expensive hobby. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From Sideshow's epic Luke Skywalker Red 5 statue to Hasbro's nostalgia-heavy Episode III figures to Hot Toys' mind-bogglingly detailed Jar Jar Binks figure, these were the coolest figures and collectibles revealed during Star Wars Day 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hot Toys' Star Wars Figures</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hot Toys' Star Wars Day 2025 Figure Reveals - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot Toys revealed quite the impressive lineup of 1:6 scale figures for Star Wars Day, including a couple of major characters who have surprisingly never gotten the Hot Toys treatment before now. The real surprise is definitely<a href="https://zdcs.link/av4eXq?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> the Jar Jar Binks figure</a>. Love him or hate him, there's no denying that this Jar Jar looks like he walked right off the screen. He's even got seamless arm joints and two swappable face sculpts for recreating all those wacky poses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot Toys is also filling a glaring hole in the Sequel Trilogy lineup by finally releasing <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXO73?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a Poe Dameron figure</a>. Fittingly, Poe is wearing his Resistance X-Wing jumpsuit. We're also getting another of the fan-favorite Republic Commandos in the form of Clone Commando Boss, and the company's new Star Wars Rebels-inspired line of animated figures is getting <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqw2Xq?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a Darth Vader</a> to accompany the previously announced Stormtrooper figures.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hasbro's Star Wars Toys</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hasbro's Star Wars Day 2025 Figures - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro revealed a number of new figures in both the 6-inch Black Series line and 3 3/4-inch Vintage Collection line. Hasbro continues to capitalize on the 20th anniversary of Revenge of the Sith by releasing new Black Series figures in packaging based on the classic RotS toy line. Next up are Aayla Secura and a Magnaguard droid. Black Series collectors can also augment their Imperial trooper collections with a Rogue One-themed 2-pack that includes both a Shoretrooper and a Death Trooper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Vintage Collection front, Hasbro has a couple very interesting multi-pack releases in the works. The "Stormtroopers of the Empire 3-Pack" features a Snowtrooper, Scouttrooper and a Sandtrooper. The "Cantina Adventure 4-Pack" includes four aliens from the iconic Mos Eisley sequence, including Hammerhead, Walrus Man, Greedo, and Snaggletooth. It should go great with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hasbro-reveals-massive-mos-eisley-cantina-playset-for-hardcore-collectors">Hasbro's crowdfunded Mos Eisley Cantina playset</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Star Wars prop collectors will be happy to know that a new ForceFX Elite lightsaber based on the weapon used by Rebels' star Ezra Bridger is in the works. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sideshow's Star Wars Figures and Posters</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sideshow Collectibles' Star Wars Day 2025 Reveals - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not to be outdone,. Sideshow Collectibles had a wide lineup of figures, statues, and art prints to reveal. Undoubtedly the showpiece of their Star Wars Day lineup is <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbMOG?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Luke Skywalker: Red Five, Standing By Premium Format Figure</a>. This massive 1:4 scale, mixed media statue features Luke decked out in his X-Wing jumpsuit and climbing up the ladder to his trusty ship. What really makes this piece special (and especially expensive) is that Sideshow went to the trouble of actually sculpting a portion of the X-Wing so that it hangs in mid-air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sideshow is also continuing to release 1:6 scale figures alongside distributing Hot Toys' releases. Sideshow is focusing on its "Scum and Villainy" line, which highlights the many aliens and creatures that don't necessarily receive attention from Hot Toys. The second wave of Scum and Villainy figures is focused on characters from Jabba's Palace in Return of the Jedi, like Bib Fortuna, Klaatu, and Vizam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Sideshow showed off the latest 1:10 statue from Iron Studios, which happens to be <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK2Rg?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a shrunken-down version of their 1:4 scale Darth Vader statue</a>. This Empire Strikes Back-inspired piece still looks mighty cool in the new, smaller scale. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let us know in the comments below what your favorite Star Wars Day 2025 reveal was, and why it's Hot Toys Jar Jar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more Star Wars collecting fun, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-action-figure-buying-guide">our ultimate guide to Star Wars figures</a>, and check out <a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/star-wars-collection?srsltid=AfmBOoq2K47zHS8E-dixwmL2QU3V17lhK9-dv5HG8_tj5Haha876zuN-" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the many Star Wars Collectibles available on the IGN Store</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has been announced by The Coalition, which has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war">Gears of War</a> franchises is taking its first foray into being a multiplatform series. The game will be available from August 26th for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and PS5, making it the first time Gears of War has been made available on a PlayStation console.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gears of War Ultimate Edition - Opening Cinematic" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qODC-rxITUc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief, Gears of War: Reloaded is a complete remaster of the original game, with this version supporting 4K resolution, 120 FPS support, and it will have cross-play across all platforms through the game’s two-player co-op campaign and 8-player versus multiplayer. Interestingly, no Microsoft will be required for cross-play, though signing in will enable cross-progressions for Campaign and multiplayer.</p>
<p>The full list of upgrades is as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>While the game coming to PS5 is obviously the biggest shocker, this is still great news for Xbox and PC fans in general. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition launched early in the Xbox One era, and was never updated to support the Xbox One X, so the game has been trapped at 1080p where Gears 4 and later had better compatibility through to Xbox Series X – through backward compatibility it did get 60fps, though. On PC Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, the game has some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp1Rcvi01zo">major performance issues (per Digital Foundry)</a>, reportedly introduced through Windows 10 a few years ago. With this remaster, this brings the original game back into focus once more.</p>
<p>When Gears of War: Reloaded launches, all the DLC that has been available as part of the package including the bonus campaign the multiplayer maps, characters, and cosmetics. Those of you who bought <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a> before today, 5th May, will get a free upgrade for Gears of War: Reloaded. Otherwise it will cost $39.99, though the game will be available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>

<p>This isn’t the only Gears of War game in the works, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">Gears of War: E-Day</a> in development as a prequel to this original game with previous series collaborators <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/">People Can Fly co-developing</a>. The one thing that we can seemingly put to one side, though, is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/06/gears-of-war-collection-multiplayer/">the rumours of a Gears of War Collection remaster</a>, which was also rumoured for an August release.</p>

		<p><strong><em>Reminder: Remap meetup at PAX East this weekend! If you're there, we'll be drinking beers in the bar of the Westin hotel attached to the convention center on Saturday afternoon from 3 to 5 pm. Come hang!</em></strong></p><p>We attended PAX East as "Remap" for the first time last year, and while I'm excited to attend, hang out with folks, see my colleagues, etc., I am so glad it's happening under different circumstances this year lol. I flew directly from a week in Disneyland with my family, giving hugs and saying goodbye as they soaked in a final few hours at the pool, while I headed towards Boston. That trip took on this outsized importance because it felt like the culmination of something my wife and I had been building to the entire time we'd been together—a picture perfect trip with the family we'd wanted for the entire time we'd been together. And then I left them! I put my sunglasses on in the cab, while trying to hide my tears from the taxi driver. This year, thankfully, is full of less drama. I'm mostly upset that I cannot bring my PlayStation 5 with to play a few hours of <em>Clair Obscur</em> on the road.</p><p>-pk, who will be testing his PlayStation Portal playing remotely</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><a href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/remap-interview-davey-wreden-the-stanley-parable/"><em>Remap Interview (feat: Davey Wreden)</em></a> – This one is a delight!!! I have known Davey for a very long time, stretching back to my earliest days in San Francisco. Davey was a fan of <em>1UP</em>, which means he was following my work before I started following <em>his</em> work. We hadn't spoken in a moment, but in short time, it felt like catching up with an old friend, even if we touch on some sensitive topics. The hour flew by, so I hope you enjoy our conversation.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Hopshot! [Part 2]</em> – That fucking frog is going to hop the fuck up, friends. You'll want to be there when it happens, because I'm going to scream.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Civilization VII</em> – Rob and Cado are nearing the end of their Civilization arc—there are rumblings of playing co-op <em>Myth</em> and returning to motorsports in the near future—before we all descend on PAX East.</li></ul><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYIUfvalJnI?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Is Already a GOTY Candidate"></iframe></figure><ul><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – A string of complications and meetings pushed back our letter series, but you'll see it this week.

But if it’s bad now, just wait until May 30 when Destined Rivals is officially released.</p><p>Journey Together should have been the very exciting return of Trainer Pokémon to the card game but instead proved rather flat, failing to significantly shake up the format. But it seems this was just a tentative toe poked into the waters, because this month we’re getting Destined Rivals, which not only enormously elaborates on the range of Trainer Pokémon, but also reintroduces Team Rocket to the TCG for the first time in 25 years. And yes, that means there’s a Giovanni’s Mewtwo, and yes, it’s already at a colossal price in Japan.</p><p>The full official English-language line-up has yet to be revealed, but The Pokémon Company has shown a fair few, a bunch more have appeared in Spanish, and there are many more we know are coming from the Japanese set. So based on all of this, we’ve put together the most anticipated cards that’ll be included in Destined Rivals (not to be confused with the <em>Black &amp; White: Rival Destinies</em> anime).</p><p>It’s going to be tough to find them on sale, but it’s worth knowing that pre-release events take place  on May 17—definitely check to see if your local specialist store has tickets. Scalpers can’t abuse this, because to get your packs you need to open and play with them!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Supporter card Ariana is hardly groundbreaking (it allows you to draw cards until you have five in your hand, or eight if all your benched Pokémon are Team Rocket Pokémon), the art here really is.

There will also be a gold version of this card, and I’ll be curious to see if it generates interest.</p><p>It’s also a hell of a card, given you can use it to load up all your Ethan Pokémon with energy each turn, and  when in the Active Spot it’ll deal out a massive 160 damage, while healing <em>every single one</em> of your Pokémon in play by 50. I think there are going to be a lot of Ethan-based decks coming soon.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-recommend-id="image://3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-recommend-id="image://3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stick Typhlosion in that deck too, and you can deliver two very powerful attacks.

That seems likely to spike an awful lot higher come June, and given the mediocrity of it as an ex card in play, we can likely put this down to the rarity and the spectacular artwork.</p><p>A 100 damage attack for one energy is amazing, and 260 for two energy is bonkers (even if you do have to discard it all), but given this is a Stage 2 evolution, it’s not going to be super-easy to get into play.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-recommend-id="image://26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-recommend-id="image://26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>OK, this is the big one. It’s Giovanni, it’s Mewtwo, it’s sending everyone crazy. Prices are still climbing for the Japanese version out of The Glory of Team Rocket, at the time of writing sitting at $435.</p><p>Personally, I’m not a fan  of the art here. Neither the style nor the composition. But then, hey, when I pull it I won’t mind parting with it for the big cash! It’s hard to say how big Destined Rivals is going to be, but if it’s as daft as I’m suspecting, I wouldn’t be surprised to see this hitting $600.</p><p>It’s a tricky card to play, however, with a sort of reverse-ability. An inability, if you will. You need at least three other Team Rocket Pokémon in play to even be able to use its attacks, which means it’s only going to work in decks built around the troublesome gang, and then you’ll depend on the draw.</p><p>However, in return you get a heck of an attack for a Basic card. Mewtwo delivers 160 damage as a base, but that can go up to a whopping 280 if you also discard two energy cards from your benched Pokémon.</p><hr><p>There are a whole bunch of other spectacular pieces of art in our combination of the two Japanese sets (plus some other leftovers), and we’ll properly get into celebrating them once the set’s released and we’ve got all the cards in English.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <div>
                      
                      
          <p>Earlier this year, we took a look at how and why <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/why-anthropics-claude-still-hasnt-beaten-pokemon/">Anthropic's Claude large language model was struggling to beat <em>Pokémon Red</em></a> (a game, let's remember, designed for young children). But while Claude 3.7 is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon">still struggling to make consistent progress at the game</a> weeks later, a similar <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon">Twitch-streamed effort using Google's Gemini 2.5 model</a> managed to finally complete <em>Pokémon Blue</em> this weekend across over 106,000 in-game actions, earning accolades from followers, <a href="https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/1918455766542930004?t=8NLgn42y3kAqUbZVhg4zLw&amp;s=19">including Google CEO Sundar Pichai</a>.</p>
<p>Before you start using this achievement as a way to compare the relative performance of these two AI models—or even the advancement of LLM capabilities over time—there are some important caveats to keep in mind. As it happens, Gemini needed some fairly significant outside help on its path to eventual Pokémon victory.</p>
<h2>Strap in to the agent harness</h2>
<p>Gemini Plays Pokémon developer JoelZ (who's unaffiliated with Google) will be the first to tell you that Pokémon is ill-suited as a reliable benchmark for LLM models. As he <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon">writes on the project's Twitch FAQ</a>, "please don't consider this a benchmark for how well an LLM can play Pokémon. You can't really make direct comparisons—Gemini and Claude have different tools and receive different information. ... Claude's framework has many shortcomings so I wanted to see how far Gemini could get if it were given the right tools."</p>
<p>The difference between those "framework" tools in the Claude and Gemini gameplay experiments could go a long way in explaining the relative performance of the two Pokémon-playing models here. As LessWrong's Julian Bradshaw lays out <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7mqp8uRnnPdbBzJZE/is-gemini-now-better-than-claude-at-pokemon">in an excellent overview</a>, Gemini actually gets a bit more information about the game through its custom "agent harness." This harness is the scaffolding that provides an LLM with information about the state of the game (both specific and general), helps the model summarize and "remember" previous game actions in its context window, and offers basic tools for moving around and interacting with the game.</p>

<p>Since these gameplay harnesses were developed independently, they give slightly different levels of support to the different Pokémon-playing models. While both models use a generated overlay to help make sense of the game's tile-based map screens, for instance, Gemini's harness goes further by adding important information about which tiles are "passable" or "navigable."</p>
<p>That extra information could be crucial to helping Gemini overcome some key navigation challenges that Claude struggles with. "It’s pretty easy for me to understand that [an in-game] building is a building and that I can’t walk through a building, and that's [something] that's pretty challenging for Claude to understand," Claude Plays Pokémon creator David Hershey <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/why-anthropics-claude-still-hasnt-beaten-pokemon/">told Ars in March</a>. "It's funny because it's just kind of smart in different ways, you know?"</p>
<p>Gemini also gets help with navigation through a "textual representation" of a minimap, which the harness generates as Gemini explores the game. That kind of direct knowledge of the wider map context outside the current screen can be extremely helpful as Gemini tries to find its way around the Pokémon world. But in his FAQ, JoelZ says he doesn't consider this additional information to be "cheating" because "humans naturally build mental maps while playing games, something current LLMs can't do independently yet. The minimap feature compensates for that limitation."</p>
<p>The base Gemini model playing the game also occasionally needs some external help from secondary Gemini "agents" tailored for specific tasks. One of these agents reasons through a breadth-first-search algorithm to figure out paths through complex mazes. Another is dedicated to generating potential solutions for <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/Victory_Road">the Boulder Puzzle on Victory Road</a>.</p>

<p>While Gemini is using its own model and reasoning process for these tasks, it's telling that JoelZ had to specifically graft these specialized agents onto the base model to help it get through some of the game's toughest challenges. As JoelZ writes, "My interventions improve Gemini’s overall decision-making and reasoning abilities."</p>
<h2>What are we testing here?</h2>
<p>Don't get me wrong, massaging an LLM into a form that can beat a Pokémon game is definitely an achievement. However, the level of "intervention" needed to help Gemini with those things that "LLMs can't do independently yet" is crucial to keep in mind as we evaluate that success.</p>

<p>We already know that <a href="https://drubinstein.github.io/pokerl/">specially designed reinforcement learning tools can beat Pokémon quite efficiently</a> (and that even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/21yjqh/rng_plays_pokemon_beat_crystal_after_969_hours/">a random number generator can beat the game quite inefficiently</a>). The particular resonance of an "LLM plays Pokémon" test is in seeing if a generalized language model can reason out its own solution to a complicated game on its own. The more hand-holding we give the model—through external information, tools, or "harnesses"—the less useful the game is as that kind of test.</p>
<p>Anthropic <a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1894419011569344978">said in February</a> that Claude Plays Pokémon showed "glimmers of AI systems that tackle challenges with increasing competence, not just through training but with generalized reasoning." But as Bradshaw writes on LessWrong, "without a refined agent harness, [all models] have a hard time simply making it through the very first screen of the game, Red's bedroom!" Bradshaw's <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8aPyKyRrMAQatFSnG">subsequent gameplay tests</a> with harness-free LLMs further highlight how these models frequently wander aimlessly, backtrack pointlessly, or even hallucinate&nbsp;impossible game situations.</p>
<p>In other words, we're still a long way from the kind of envisioned future where an Artificial General Intelligence can figure out a way to beat Pokémon just because you asked it to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/bob-barker-mic-gameshow-sony-ecm-51-match-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you are 30 or 40 years old, or a strange younger person who watches old footage of game shows, you probably remember Bob Barker’s long ass microphone. This thin, telescoping rod a few feet long was a staple of game shows from the 70s. They haven’t made that microphone, or really any like it, for decades, but they should, not just because the parts are cheap, but for an entirely different reason: TikTok.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Match Game - Gene's Microphone" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3D2onJTja_c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Holding a tiny lav microphone with your hand became kinda a meme a while back among annoying TikTok interviewers. Though this feels like it’s designed in a lab to aggravate anybody with a film production background, I also see the point: lavalier mics–the tiny, wireless mics frequently pinned to the lapel of a shirt–got tremendously cheap in the last few years. What used to be a substantial investment (I have some Sennheiser eW100s gathering dust in a closet) has now gotten silly cheap with companies like Røde, DJI, and Hollyland all offering solid quality wireless options for online content creators. What’s more, the spectacle of using one incorrectly became a purposefully irritating meme unto itself. It also serves a practical purpose: it’s slightly less alarming or formal to a stranger on the street than a stick mic.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Match Game: The Day Gene's Mic Grew" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BkrlEIaQrkw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This was also the appeal of the Long Ass 70s mic. Bob Barker is the name most people associate with it, but Gene Rayburn from <em>Match Game</em> used one. As far as I can tell it is <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lukpac/28666027418/in/album-72157694426924062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Sony ECM-51</a>, an electret condenser mic set to the end of a telescoping pole. My understanding from a bunch of forum posts is that the capsule is based on the <a href="https://tapeop.com/reviews/gear/43/ecm-50-mic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony ECM-50</a> lav mic, a lineage that continues today with the <a href="https://pro.sony/ue_US/products/lavalier-and-headset-microphones/ecm-55b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony ECM-55B</a>, which is still in production although Sony has long since exited the Long Ass 70s Mic game. If they don’t decide to jump on it, someone else should.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bob Barker Has a Minor Mic Malfunction Before a Game of TEMPTATION - The Price is Right 1982" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wLgiNFaprM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Due to the ECM-51’s legacy and novelty as being <em>the</em> game show mic, a properly functioning unit goes for <a href="https://reverb.com/item/4073559-vintage-sony-ecm-51-bob-barker-telescoping-condenser-microphone-works-great-screen-battery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of money</a>. Sony and a handful of other companies also made similar but less noticeable mics, and other gooseneck style mics exist. But designing a replica using off the shelf lavaliers and parts should not be impossible. If smartly done, you could even potentially update it for wireless functionality.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Opening the package for my Sony ECM-51 microphone" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0IsGcAtqkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Here is my most Millennial-coded plea: the long ass game show mic deserves a second chance. It has a form factor that’s iconic and visually striking. It’s weird, it’s sleek, and it’s vaguely disarming in a memey way. It serves a distinct purpose that content creators have accidentally discovered via reverse engineering. I need someone to bring back the long ass 70s mic, because if they don’t, I’ll be forced to make one from scratch myself.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/soccer-mommy-stardew-valley"><h3>Soccer Mommy’s Guide To Stardew Valley, The Coziest Video Game Ever</h3></a><p>The open-hearted indie rocker plays the farming game for the romance</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To some, it’s all about the power creep; it’s about becoming stronger, more robust than your opponent, wielding the best weapons and armor in the game. But the struggle to attain that doesn’t matter to some—those who are more than happy to tinker with the very code operating behind the scenes of every successful quest.

We’ve also provided a breakdown below of which Tempered Monsters are connected to which material: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Hunter Symbol I:</strong> Balahara, Chatacabra, Congalala, Gypceros, Lala Barina, Nerscylla, Quematrice, Rathian, Rompopolo, Yian Kut-Ku</li><li><strong>Hunter Symbol II:</strong> Ajarakan, Blangonga, Doshaguma, Gravios, Guardian Doshaguma, Guardian Ebony Odogaron, Guardian Fulgur Anjanath, Hirabami, Rathalos, Xu Wu</li><li><strong>Hunter Symbol III:</strong> Arkveld, Gore Magala, Jin Dahaad, Nu Udra, Rey Dau, Uth Duna</li></ul><h2 id="h851943"><a id="farm"></a>How to farm Hunter Symbols</h2><figure id="" data-id="aa61384ead5c113d1a5770a5c6ac10b4" data-recommend-id="image://aa61384ead5c113d1a5770a5c6ac10b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The World Map screen, with the Save as Investigation option highlighted for a Tempered Lala Barina field survey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The World Map screen, with the Save as Investigation option highlighted for a Tempered Lala Barina field survey." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa61384ead5c113d1a5770a5c6ac10b4" data-recommend-id="image://aa61384ead5c113d1a5770a5c6ac10b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The World Map screen, with the Save as Investigation option highlighted for a Tempered Lala Barina field survey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tempered Monsters will spawn randomly across the different locations you’ve unlocked, same as as any other monster; this means you can just create Field Survey quests whenever you see them. Some beasts that reward you with Hunter Symbol I and Hunter Symbol II can also be hunted repeatedly by completing specific Optional Quests. Repeating these Optional Quests is arguably the best way to farm the two lower-level Hunter Symbol materials.</p><p>Your options decrease when it comes to gathering the highest rarity. There aren’t any pre-made quests for Hunter Symbol III-related monsters, so your only choice is to wait for them to appear and create a Field Survey quest. The good news is that we can still use this to our advantage. <strong>After creating a Field Survey quest for these difficult Tempered Monsters, make sure to select the Save as Investigation option.</strong> This will add it to Alma’s Investigations tab and lets you fight that specific monster three more times. It might cost you some Guild Points, but it’s certainly worth farming for Hunter Symbol III, as well as materials to craft Artian weapons.</p><p><strong>Another fantastic way to farm for Hunter Symbols is through SOS Flare Quests.</strong> Filter the monster you’re in the mood to hunt and help out a fellow player in need. There are always going to be some hunters in need of help with big monsters like Arkveld or Gore Magala, especially with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-crossplay-platform-multiplayer-1851769332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-crossplay-platform-multiplayer-1851769332">crossplay</a></span> set up, so you’re sure to get the materials you’re looking for.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026"><u>GTA 6 has a proper release date</u></a>, Devolver Digital has announced plans to release a mystery title on that same May 26 date. It’s a chaotic marketing strategy that Devolver Digital seems serious about following through on at least for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mystery game’s release date arrives after the company previously made the promise to launch a game of its own when Rockstar finally announced its long-awaited GTA 6 release date. We now know that date to be May 26 of next year, so naturally, Devolver Digital has a message: “You can’t escape us.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1918277581167907305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Devolver Digital has an extensive library of smaller-scale titles such as Hotline Miami, Enter the Gungeon, The Messenger, Katana Zero, Cult of the Lamb, and more. Whether the company plans to release a follow-up to an existing series or something new entirely remains to be seen. Upcoming entries in its catalog of games include Baby Steps and Stick It to the Stickman, two projects that are due out before 2025 comes to an end. There’s also Enter the Gungeon 2 and Human Fall Flat 2, which are both expected to arrive sometime in 2026, though developer No Brakes Games has already <a href="https://x.com/HumanFallFlat/status/1918321438450434355" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assured fans</a> that it has no intention of releasing the latter on May 26.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We can confirm that Human Fall Flat 2 will NOT be releasing on May 26, 2026 <a href="https://t.co/zl3GbjSmia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/zl3GbjSmia</a></p>— Human Fall Flat (@HumanFallFlat) <a href="https://twitter.com/HumanFallFlat/status/1918321438450434355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">More than a year out from launch, GTA 6 is already positioned to be a juggernaut video game. It’ll be Rockstar’s first numbered entry in its critically acclaimed sandbox series since 2013, with many doing everything they can to ensure they’ll be able to play on day one. Devolver Digital is doing its best to get a slice of that pie in a very Devolver Digital way, but we’ll have to wait to see exactly how it will do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history"><u>Rockstar’s history of delaying it big-budget releases</u></a>.

From legacy boxes to recent releases, many of these products are coming in over MSRP, which is why I want to let readers know that retailers putting pricing up isn't their only option during Pokémania 2025. TCG Player is a secondary marketplace that is widely used in the US for the gold standard on current Pokémon TCG values thanks to its value tracking across the secondary market. Let's get into it, regardless of ripping open booster packs or finding that dream chase card:</p><div id="218685" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Free to Play VR Sandbox Game: DigiGods on Meta Quest</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>DigiGods is a free-to-play, physics-based, VR game that allows players to create, play, and share in a sandbox environment.

Think "XCOM meets Hunt: Showdown with a dash of Cthulhu thrown in." Check out the announcement trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers describe the setup for Nightmare Frontier as follows: "The story of Nightmare Frontier unfolds in an alternate version of 19th-century America, shortly after a mysterious event that forever changed the world. The line between reality and an unknown horror has started to fade, and those who remain are left to uncover what truly happened that night – and what’s behind the titular Nightmare. The streets were overrun by monsters emerging from the dark abysses of the terror dimension – the survivors called these creatures Dreadweavers. These beings are the physical embodiment of people's deepest fears. Players will step into the shoes of the ringleader, who, despite overwhelming terror, finds a chance for survival in this new reality. Leading other scavengers, they venture deep into the city, risking everything they have left in search of loot."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nightmare Frontier - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightmare Frontier aims to mix turn-based "gun-n-slash" gameplay with gameplay-altering horror, an enticing risk-reward system, and alluring loot. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310950/Nightmare_Frontier/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a> Nightmare Frontier on Steam if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

<p dir="ltr">It's an impressive stat for a game that is not only a remaster of a nearly 20-year-old title but one that was also shadow dropped with essentially no marketing (aside from various leaks in the weeks leading up to its release). Oblivion Remastered's big sales numbers are also impressive considering it was released immediately on Xbox Game Pass for consoles and PC, where subscribers could play the game at no additional cost. Piscatella said Game Pass subscribers did not factor into the game's sales data.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is also available on PlayStation 5. More than a few of those sales came from those playing on PlayStation, with Oblivion Remastered, as well as two other Microsoft-published titles, claiming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">top three spots on the most-downloaded PSN games for April</a> in both North American and Europe.</p><p dir="ltr">Just a few days after release, Bethesda Game Studios announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/" data-ref-id="1100-6531155">Oblivion Remastered had been played by more than 4 million people</a> across all platforms.

However, that plate can be further away than you think, so if you see a Petank, before you even think of getting this show on the road, clear out every enemy wandering the immediate area. They’ll never put the plate outside of one of the cramped connective doors/spaces/hallways/corridors in the world, so you just need to clean up in proximity. You’ll likely discover the plate while wandering around, just keep its location in mind. </p><p>When the coast is clear, you’re not so much trying to chase the Petank onto the plate as herd it there. Petanks have a fixed route/grid they’ll run in, with specific stopping points. Your job is to simply run them down those lines towards the plate. Once they’re on there, get all healed up, and get ready for a fight.</p></div><h2 id="h1126943"><a id="battle"></a>The battle</h2><p><strong>When a battle starts with these guys, your first instinct might be to Free Aim at the big glowy weakspot in the center of the orb. That would be a waste of AP; it’s not a weakspo</strong>t. And you definitely don’t have AP to waste: With only two exceptions, you have three turns total to beat this thing, after which it’ll flee and <strong>you’ll need to either rest at a flag or reload a save to bring it back</strong>. </p><p><strong>Read MOre:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Gustave In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>In addition, each Petank you find has its own specific gimmick/strategy involved. And sure, you can go ahead and try and suss that out with some trial and error. Or, you can just go through this handy list we made for you right here because, idk, we love you or something.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Ancient Sanctuary Petank (Act I)</strong>: Starts shielded, gains 6 shields each turn, 9 on turn 3</li><li><strong>Esquie’s Nest Petank (Act I)</strong>: High defense; must be broken to do real damage</li><li><strong>Stone Wave Cliffs Petank (Act I)</strong>: Summons Nevrons each turn; only takes damage when no other enemies are on the field</li><li><strong>Forgotten Battlefield Petank (Act II)</strong>: Applies Exhaust (no AP gained)</li><li><strong>Sirene Petank (Act II)</strong>: Must be killed within 2 turns</li><li><strong>Monolith Petank (Act II)</strong>: Extremely slow, but extremely high defense, cannot Break.</li></ul><p>In addition, there’s a secret Chromatic Petank on the eastern part of the Overworld/Continent maps that you can only get to once Esquie learns how to fly. His gimmick is that he summons other Petanks, and if they’re allowed to escape, they heal the Chromatic one. That fight is rough, ngl.</p><p>Still, once you know the gimmick, it’s just a matter of doing the damage, which you have a lot of leeway to figure out with your current loadout. </p><div><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-tips-pictos-stains-stances-1851777496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-tips-pictos-stains-stances-1851777496">8 Things To Know Before Starting <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>The reward for all your hard work is typically a nice combo pack of Colours of Lumina or Chroma Catalysts, the stuff the Curator needs to upgrade your weaponry and give your team more Lumina points. Considering how tough it is to come by that stuff out in the world, especially at higher levels, yeah, this little detour is almost always worth it. </p></div><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/05/jackbox-party-pack-11s-first-revealed-game-is-suspectives<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Jackbox Party Pack 11 is coming at some vague point later this Fall, and up until today, its inclusions were also vague. Suspectives is the first game revealed for the new pack and you can check out the trailer for it below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YT3BXNBp-xE" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game takes inspiration from party games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">Mafia</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolves_Within">Werewolves Within</a> where one player is a secret criminal and the others must deduce who it is. This is done by players sharing personal anecdotes about themselves and then those details become part of the investigation process.</p>

<p>According to the press release for the new game, "Suspectives is a detective-themed social deduction game where players work together to uncover the secret criminal hiding among them. The only clues left behind? Facts that players share about themselves. Suspectives turns players’ quirky personal details into the key evidence for solving a crime. Players must put each other in the hot seat to determine if the evidence stacks up against them."</p>

<p>The game is designed for 4-8 players and rounds can be played in about 10-15 minutes. As mentioned previously, The Jackbox Party Pack 11 is coming later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-makes-its-playstation-debut-this-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We’ve seen more and more Xbox first-party franchises launching on PlayStation over the last year or so, and arguably Microsoft’s second-biggest exclusive franchise is next in line. Gears of War is finally making its debut on Sony platforms in the form of a remaster dubbed Gears of War: Reloaded.</p>

<p>Reloaded, which is also coming to Xbox, is billed as the definitive version of the original Gears of War, first released in 2006. It has been natively optimized for modern platforms, boasting a 4K resolution and support for 120 frames per second gameplay. Multiplayer includes cross-play across all platforms, and a Microsoft account is not required for online play (most relevant for PS players). The game also features cross-progression, letting you carry campaign and multiplayer progress across multiple platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Content-wise, Reloaded includes everything included in the previous remaster, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/gears_of_war_ultimate_edition/b/xboxone/archive/2015/08/26/restored-beauty.aspx">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a>. That includes all post-launch DLC, the bonus campaign act, all multiplayer maps/modes, and the complete roster of characters and cosmetics unlockable through progression.&nbsp;</p>
