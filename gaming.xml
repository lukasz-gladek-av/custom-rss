            <p>
Following its half-hearted, widely derided <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-dance-gran-turismo-feature-in-the-olympics-latest-stab-at-esports">stab at an esports event in 2023</a>, the International Olympic Committee has <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia">announced</a> the inaugural Olympic Esports Games in partnership with the Saudi Arabian Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee, to be held in Saudi Arabia next year.
</p>
<p>
Tethering its future esports success to a regime that's been widely criticised for its poor human rights record - which includes the criminalisation of homosexuality, fewer rights for women, and the use of the death penalty - is certainly a bold opening move for the IOC, but not unexpected given the Saudi government's heavy financial investment in esports over the last few years.
</p>
<p>
Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth Public Investment Fund is, for instance, financing this year's Esports World Cup, and its involvement has continued to cause controversy. Apex Legends fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-wont-censor-game-for-saudi-arabia-esports-tournament-respawn-says">expressed disappointment</a> when the game was confirmed to be part of the Esports World Cup earlier this year, for instance, with many noting the battle royale game's inclusive outlook was deeply at odds with the Saudi government's anti-LGBTQ+ stance.

<p>
The UK's national body for competitive video gaming, British eSports, was also compelled to release a statement defending its actions last year after announcing a partnership with the Saudi eSports Federation, insisting inclusivity was "fundamental" to the growth of esports.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that next year's inaugural Esports Olympic Games will undoubtedly come with its own fair share of controversy, but that hasn't stop the IOC's efforts, as unconvincing as they might be, to paint its new initiative in a positive light. "By partnering with the Saudi [National Olympic Committee]," it said, "we have also ensured that the Olympic values are respected, in particular, with regard to the game titles on the programme, the promotion of gender equality and engagement with the young audience, which is embracing esports."
</p>
<p>
"As a 'first' ever Esports Olympic Games, obviously there is still much to consider and plan with the IOC," Saudi Arabia's minister of sport and Olympic committee president Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal added, "but we are committed to hosting a special event that respects and celebrates the Olympic values while boldly seizing the momentum to drive esports forward with the international platform the sport and its athletes deserve."
</p>
<p>
The deal between the IOC and Saudi Arabia's Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee is set to run for 12 years, and the plan is to hold Esports Olympic Games "regularly" in that time. It's certainly a radical change of heart for the IOC, given the organisation was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/esport-killer-games-arent-right-for-olympics-yet-says-ioc">insisting</a> esport "killer games" were "contradictory to the Olympic values" just six years ago.
</p>
<p>
There's no word on when next year's Esports Olympic Games might be held, but it's a safe bet we'll be hearing plenty more about them before things get underway.
</p>

                <p>Xbox has announced major changes to its Game Pass subscription and truthfully, they're so muddled even I struggle with laying them all out. But let's try.</p><p>Starting in September, new members to the Xbox ecosystem will not longer be allowed to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass for console. However, those <em>currently</em> subscribed will be allowed to maintain their subscription, which will include the program's back catalog as well as day one game access, as long as they maintain their subscription. New Xbox Game Pass users, then, will get a choice of a few different subscription tiers, the first being Game Pass Standard. This tier will be priced at $15 a month and gives users access to a back catalog of games and Xbox Live Gold, which is now referred to as Game Pass Core. However, Standard will not include any day one releases or Xbox Cloud gaming.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's features will not be changed and will still include PC Game Pass, but is seeing a price hike and will now be $20 a month. Similarly, PC Game Pass remains the same but will now be $12 a month. For those looking solely for access to online multiplayer, Xbox Game Pass Core (formerly Xbox Live Gold) will now cost you $75 a month. And, just for good measure, Microsoft has also implemented a new rule in which existing users can only stack up to 13 months of Xbox Game Pass for console, though users who have currently stacked more than that will not be effected.</p><p>If that sounds like a lot, it's because it is.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4eRASQz_Eo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B4eRASQz_Eo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>From its console naming convention to its subscription service's pricing structure, Xbox has a habit of making things overly complicated. But the big question we have is: Is this going to come back to bite them? On this week's Spot On, Tam and Lucy go over the new pricing model and discuss if they think Xbox is making the right move. With thousands of layoffs and studio closures so closely behind them <em>and </em>a new Call of Duty and hot first party lineup ahead, is now the time for such a dramatic restructure and price hike?</p><p>Spot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest game news. Given the massive video game industry's highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle, there's always something to talk about.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-kirbys-brother-from-another-mother<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Forgotten Gems is a regular column about notable games that have moved out of the public eye and may not be easily accessible anymore. To see all the other games I've covered so far, be sure to check out the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/columns/forgotten-gems"><em>12 previous issues of Forgotten Gems</em></a><em> in our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/columns"><em>Columns</em></a><em> section.</em></p><p>In an alternate universe, HAL and Nintendo’s beloved Kirby series never made it out of Japan. As the pink puffball conquered one platform after the other with his adorable pals, the Kirby games slowly emerged as the more forgiving, kid-friendly alternatives to Mario. If Mario missed a jump, he was a goner. Kirby? Just pump the button to float and you’ll get another chance at redemption. Kids had no problems jumping into Kirby games and completing the main campaigns – but older players looking for a little more also found some surprisingly devious challenges on the path to 100% completion.</p><p>But in our timeline, Kirby’s Dream Land hit Game Boy in the US and Europe a mere months after Hoshi no Kirby debuted in Japan in 1992. While the original game was a huge sales success that subsequent releases couldn’t quite replicate, Nintendo stuck with Kirby. The faith it placed in the franchise designer Masahiro Sakurai (of Smash Bros. fame) built paid off. A full 30 years later, Kirby Star Allies and then Kirby and the Forgotten Land blew up on Switch, selling almost 12 million copies between them. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/densetsunostarfy-pic-1720812819500.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>The Legend of Starfy: The Diminished Chap</h2><p>Which brings us to The Legendary Starfy. The series shares more than a passing resemblance to Kirby's. Its cute, starfish-like hero looks like he’s ripped straight out of a Kirby or Mario game. The developer, Tose – like Kirby’s creators at HAL – appear to share rights to the character and games. And Starfy games are very easy to get into and easy to complete. But unlike Kirby, Starfy has been one of those Nintendo franchises mostly released and promoted in the Japanese market. </p><p>My first experience with Starfy goes back all the way to the year 2000. At Nintendo’s annual Space World expo, also known as Shoshinkai, the publisher showed a playable demo of a game named "Densetsu no Stafy" for Game Boy Color. I recall playing it briefly at the time, of course unaware that that game would never see the light of day. With the release of its next handheld hardware a mere year away, the developers retooled the game for release on GBA instead. </p><p>Developer Tose ("toh-seh"), headquartered in Kyoto not far away from Nintendo’s own HQ, has been around for more than 40 years. IGN’s database lists more than a hundred titles across a dozen platforms that Tose has worked on, from wrestling games to anime-licenses, to titles Nintendo fans will instantly recognize, like Game &amp; Watch Gallery and Super Princess Peach. Many publishers, such as Square, enlisted Tose’s help during the GBA and DS eras to help port their classics to the handhelds, including Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, Front Mission, and Dragon Quest. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Legendary Starfy: Complete Playlist</h3><p>Whether you know him as Starfy or as Stafy, here's Nintendo and Tose's cute platform game series from first to last game. </p></div><p>But the real tally of games Tose has worked on is likely much higher. Tose is one of a few Japanese development studios that have signed away their development credit on games it’s worked on – a practice that essentially obfuscates the real authors of games in favor of pushing the publisher brand. See also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sky-odyssey-the-indiana-jones-adventure-you-never-played">my piece on Sky Odyssey</a>, a game that was in greater parts made by phantom devs CAProduction and Future Creates. This sometimes leads to awkward gameography entries on their Japanese corporate pages, listing their past works as “action game for major publisher” or “game design for PlayStation 4 game”. </p><p>This is all to say, Tose may not be a household name, but it’s an experienced team with more than four decades of experience designing games or working on adapting and converting games. That experience shows in the Starfy games. They feel and look like Nintendo games – or, more accurately, a mixture of HAL games and Capcom’s SNES platformers. If you haven’t played one of them yet (which, you likely haven’t – this is Forgotten Gems, after all), you’ll notice how much Starfy looks like Kirby’s brother from another bubblegum mother.</p><h2>Yellow Submarine</h2><p>Instead of relying on the ability to float, Starfy’s adventures are mostly aquatic. You pump the A-button to swim faster underwater, use spins to destroy blocks, and you can of course dash upwards to catch some air and soar above the waves as well. What starts with simple block-pushing and platforming puzzle challenges eventually gets more complex, with Breakout-style mini-games, auto-scrolling stages, and even vehicles. You’d be hard-pressed to call the first Starfy game – Densetsu no Starfy (or Stafy, see sidebar), a top-tier platformer in Nintendo’s overall library, but it’s competently made and enjoyable.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Densetsu no Starfy Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Densetsu no Starfy was successful enough in Japan to get a sequel. And another one. And another one. Despite not seeing a release in the west, Starfy gained some appreciation from import gamers, with the third GBA game in particular turning heads and leading to questions why the series continued to be landlocked in Japan despite the popularity of platform games on Nintendo’s handhelds and consoles. With Densetsu no Starfy 3 in 2004, Tose had seemingly perfected its formula. Although developed in record time in just a year, Starfy 3 feels like something HAL would’ve made – from the clever puzzles and adorable characters (Starfy’s sister is playable in this one – and looks even more like Kirby!) to mini-game multiplayer challenges and even Wario appearing and giving Starfy quests. There’s no doubt that Starfy 3 would’ve released to positive reviews in the west, but Nintendo made us wait another four years for his stateside debut.</p><h2>Stafy Becomes Starfy</h2><p>Starfy – and the confirmation that, yes, there’s an “r” in his name – started his world tour in earnest in 2009 with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legendary-starfy">The Legendary Starfy</a> for Nintendo DS. Despite the title being a literal translation of the first game’s name, it is not a remake. First released in 2008 in Japan, The Legendary Starfy for DS is an all-new quest that uses the dual screen setup for tutorial and character interactions on the bottom screen as well as for expanded playfields during mini-games, but other than that, it’s vintage Starfy gameplay. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/09/the-legendary-starfy-review">Our reviewer loved it</a> when he first played it and said that it unified the “best elements from games like Kirby, Donkey Kong Country, Little Nemo, and Mario himself”. But there were already signs that Nintendo hadn’t forgotten about Starfy when the little yellow star made his debut as assist trophy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. </p><p>Despite the positive reviews, Starfy did not ascend to become a mainstream hit on Nintendo’s DS. In Japan, it sold fewer copies than its predecessors – perhaps a sign that interest in lesser-known, traditional platformers was waning in favor of new, touch-screen-centric experiments. Or perhaps the mascot platformer genre was just too crowded on Nintendo’s handhelds. Whatever the reason, instead of being the start of a beautiful friendship, the Legendary Starfy ended up becoming the last bow for the  series.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The surprise is that all three also got added to the US and European GBA collections on Nintendo Switch.&nbsp;</p></div><p>But don’t count a good platformer out. This week, Nintendo surprisingly added the first three GBA Starfy games to its Nintendo Online with Expansion Pack tier. The surprise isn’t that these games returned to the spotlight in Japan – after all, nostalgia is fueling an ongoing barrage of rereleases, remasters, and remakes the world over.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/ign-segmentation-2024-1720815148664.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>This slide, from IGN's biennial Segmentation Study that I frequently take on the road and share with IGN clients, shows player sentiment towards sequels and nostalgia for their childhood game experiences.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The surprise is that all three also got added to the US and European GBA collections on Nintendo Switch. </p><h2>Where can you play it now?</h2><p>As of July 11, 2024, Densetsu no Starfy is back in active distribution after more than two decades. Pour one out for game preservation, folks! Physical copies of the five existing Starfy games are not hard to find via auction services on eBay, but with the exception of the 2008 Nintendo DS release, you should know that they’re all in Japanese and do contain quite a bit of Japanese text. Now, the Nintendo Switch Online releases aren’t localized, either. Nintendo is expecting players to put up with quite a lot of expository text from NPCs in Japanese, but the core game is easy to grasp even if you don’t read kana. So this is definitely an instance of not looking at the proverbial gift horse’s teeth too closely. And if you’re looking to learn Japanese, know that the language used in the games is simple: you don’t need to learn kanji to be able to read what is being said. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/starfyonline-1720815475814.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Nintendo's Online interface is struggling to keep up with its strategy to add unlocalized games to the library.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Giving Starfy wider exposure is a wonderful thing to see. I wish it was a more concerted and serious effort – surely, localization of games without voice acting and cartridge space constraints isn’t all that expensive. Plus, dropping three very similar games at once isn’t exactly a carefully curated introduction to an unknown franchise. But as a lover of the obscure and forgotten, I’m excited to see Nintendo experimenting with its back catalog more and daring to bring back the stuff of even the tiniest legends. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/PeerIGN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peer Schneider</a><em> heads up IGN's Guides, Tools, and Map Genie teams and is excited about Nintendo's recent additions to Nintendo Online. Not every game's a gem, but preserving games, even by adding them to subscription services, is a welcome trend. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yet, while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-remaster-remake-capcom-teaser-frank-west-1851561484&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-remaster-remake-capcom-teaser-frank-west-1851561484"><em>Dead Rising</em></a></span> might not be as famous or beloved as <em>Resident Evil,</em> its quirky characters, oddball tone, endless hordes of zombies, and tension-building ticking clock made it feel unique and helped it develop its own fanbase. </p><p>It all started with <em>Dead Rising</em> in 2006, which was unlike any other zombie game released before that time. It let people live out the fantasy seen in George Romero’s iconic <em>Dawn of the Dead. </em>Finally, you could explore a zombie-infested mall and test your various strategies. Over time the franchise would evolve and change, in good and bad ways. After <em>Dead Rising 4</em> in 2016, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-sly-cooper-titanfall-splinter-cell-left-4-dead-1851506835/slides/20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-sly-cooper-titanfall-splinter-cell-left-4-dead-1851506835/slides/20">series went dormant for a bit</a></span>.<br></p><p>But good news: The franchise is returning later this year, though not with a new sequel.

So before people start hopping into this new spin on an Xbox 360 zombie classic, let’s dive into the entire franchise and figure out which games are good, meh, and bad.</p></div></div><div><p>While on paper this is meant to be a port of the original Xbox 360 game, in reality, it’s an awful, ugly, and barely playable version of <em>Dead Rising</em>. Remember how the big selling point of <em>Dead Rising </em>was the impressive number of zombies on screen? Well, that’s missing, as is most of what made the original game good.</p></div><div><p>Porting<em> Dead Rising</em> to the Wii was always going to require some cuts. But unlike the phone port, <em>Chop ‘Till You Drop</em> at least plays, looks, and sounds like <em>Dead Rising</em>. Sure, it’s basically just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/fgi8Rw-8BMc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/fgi8Rw-8BMc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom’s <em>RE4</em> Wii port re-skinned</a></span> as <em>Dead Rising</em>, but it mostly works, even if, like in the mobile version, the amount of zombies on screen is still pretty low.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b837dc81e4a01545c54b4d3a72224269" data-recommend-id="image://b837dc81e4a01545c54b4d3a72224269" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Frank and Chuck overlooking a facility in the desert.

Sure, it’s cool that Frank West (the protagonist of the first game) meets up with and helps Chuck Greene (the protagonist of <em>Dead Rising 2</em>). I also like the way this tiny standalone DLC moves the franchise’s narrative forward a bit. But beyond that, <em>Case West</em> is a pretty forgettable, but thankfully very short, experience.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1906794d262a7238205209dcab018e44" data-recommend-id="image://1906794d262a7238205209dcab018e44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Frank West as he appears in Dead Rising 4.

But sadly, this winter-themed sequel is mostly a flop, and it comes down to the fact that it doesn’t really feel like a <em>Dead Rising </em>game anymore. </p><p>What made the older entries great wasn’t just all the zombies. It was the way the worlds felt believable but weird, the photography mechanic, and the challenge of balancing a ticking clock with exploration. <em>Dead Rising 4 </em>strips away the clock, makes it easier to carry around weapons, and turns the wacky knob past 10 and breaks it off. This leads to an experience that feels disconnected from the best games in the series, even though I was happy that Frank could still take photos of giant zombie hordes using his phone.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c3f00396656dd24cee0b6fcbf6fb7799" data-recommend-id="image://c3f00396656dd24cee0b6fcbf6fb7799" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a large zombie horde as seen in Dead Rising 3.

Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoy this installment. Its gritty, open-world city is a perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse, its main character (Nick Ramos) is a likable guy, and the weapon and vehicle crafting (first introduced in <em>DR2</em>) isn’t too outrageous or game-breaking yet. So it’s a better game than <em>DR4</em>, but it also marks the beginning of the end for the franchise as it shows the series shifting focus to wacky weapons while downplaying the ticking clock that added so much tension to the older games.</p></div><div><p>Sure, it’s not as big as<em> Dead Rising 2 </em>or the original, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-case-zero-review-the-case-of-the-zombie-5623108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-case-zero-review-the-case-of-the-zombie-5623108"><em>Case Zero</em></a></span>—a standalone prequel to <em>DR2</em> released before the game’s launch—is a lot of fun. It was our first introduction to the new and improved mechanics of <em>Dead Rising 2.</em> It also was the first time the series stretched its legs, letting you explore a small western-themed town as you hunt for Zombrex—a medicine that stops an infected person from turning into a zombie—for your daughter. A solid entry in the series, even if most players finished it up in less than two hours.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="88f6a141bbb00c82f1e6ca86b9aa63ef" data-recommend-id="image://88f6a141bbb00c82f1e6ca86b9aa63ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows zombies in Dead Rising 2.

In <em>DR1</em> it was such a neat feature that as you survived the zombie invasion of the mall you could take photos of your adventure, both documenting your journey while also earning XP to level up. </p><p>Removing the in-game camera was a mistake, but hey, Capcom added co-op and the crafting system—letting you combine weapons to make better zombie-killing tools—in this entry. So in the end, <em>Dead Rising 2 </em>is mostly a win with just a <em>few </em>frustrating flaws.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e9e7dc3ee6a2a612876272973cd9d207" data-recommend-id="image://e9e7dc3ee6a2a612876272973cd9d207" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Frank West in front of a horde of zombies in Dead Rising.

And yet, <em>Dead Rising</em>’s oddball tone, as well as the way it uses the zombie horde and a ticking clock to always pressure you to take risks, is wonderful. Being able to pick up nearly anything in its large, highly detailed mall and use it as a weapon was incredibly fun and impressive at the time. Want to toss plates at a zombie? Go ahead. Wanna use a chair as a weapon? You can! </p><p>Sure, a lot of people complained that the ticking clock ruined the game, making it hard to just have fun. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-off-the-records-new-sandbox-mode-is-all-i-5834783&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-2-off-the-records-new-sandbox-mode-is-all-i-5834783"><em>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</em></a></span> would “fix” this by adding a sandbox mode with no clock.) But while I get the frustration of missing a mission because time ran out or you got trapped behind a giant horde with no good weapons, I think that’s part of the game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-timer-makes-dead-rising-2s-zombies-scary-1792225419&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-timer-makes-dead-rising-2s-zombies-scary-1792225419">It’s what makes it work</a></span>. Besides, you should restart <em>Dead Rising</em> at least once or twice, taking your experience and skills into a new playthrough. In a way, it’s almost a roguelike experience.</p></div></div><div><p>What an odd video game! <em>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</em> is a non-canonical retelling of the events of <em>Dead Rising 2</em>, but this time you play as Frank West. It’s strange to play a spin-off alt-reality sequel, but it works! That’s because <em>Off the Record</em> keeps all the stuff that was good in <em>DR2</em>—the setting, improved controls, more zombies, weapon crafting, etc.—but brings back Frank and his camera. </p><p>In a lot of ways <em>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</em> feels like Capcom let some <em>DR </em>fans mod the hell out of <em>Dead Rising 2</em> and then sold it to people as a new game and…I love it! And it’s easily the best game in the series. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/once-human-review-in-progress.926250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/once-human-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Once Human is surprising. It’s a free-to-play open-world survival crafting game, a word salad of flavor-of-the-month genres if ever there was one, and it takes those well-worn ideas and simplifies them into relatively basic forms. And yet, here we are a few days after launch and I find that I can’t put it down. It’s still early, but so far it’s so fun, and so <em>weird</em>. </p><p>There’s no shortage of post-apocalyptic survival games out there, whether you’re talking about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-76-review-2024">Fallout 76</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/24/rust-review">Rust</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review">7 Days to Die</a>, or the many, many other options. But Once Human makes its take on that setup feel unique and interesting by wrapping the end of the world around an alien infestation rather than your classic zombies or nuclear war scenarios. It’s a fun approach that, in hindsight, seems underused in the genre, and Once Human puts it to use in some really clever ways. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Once Human Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This alien organism has the ability to turn basically anything into a grotesque monster, living or otherwise. Sure, that shuffling and snarling person may seem like a zombie, but then it turns around and reveals it has a blinding stage light for a head. I’ve fought lightbulbs that have turned into giant spiders, evil trees, and even a bus that sprouted a really unfortunate number of giant legs and trotted up and down the road like the biggest, yellowest, and strangest centipede that has ever existed. I did not see those enemies coming, and that has kept Once Human full of surprises.</p><p>Your weaponry is fairly basic, consisting of simple melee weapons like blades and bars, as well as your general pistol, rifle, and shotgun small-arms options. They are pretty unremarkable, but it’s hard to be bored with a baseball bat when you are beating on a monster with a traffic cone for a head or trying to snipe at a massive shadow-beast boss that just as easily could have been fighting Kratos in God of War. Sure, most of the fights are resolved by flailing your melee weapon or running around in circles and shooting as you drain health bars, but the boss fights do a nice job of mixing in unique mechanics, like forcing you to kill monster spawners to make the boss vulnerable. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once Human makes forming pick-up parties for dungeons easy.</p></div><p>The creatures are the best looking things in Once Human, with organic and inorganic meeting in a strange, body horror aesthetic. That said, the rest of the world is pretty bland. Forests aren’t particularly lush and the same trees repeat a noticeable amount of the time. Urban areas are largely covered in drab concrete that shows signs of decay, but not to the degree that stands out in something like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review">Last of Us</a> series, which seems like a missed opportunity to lean even further into the alien infestation look. </p><p>The biggest monsters are reserved for instanced dungeons, similar to classic World of Warcraft design. These fights are geared towards groups of up to four players, and Once Human makes forming pick-up parties easy. A click of a button brings up a server-wide team finder where you can browse what sort of groups other people are looking for, or start your own. Just pick what activity you are doing and interested parties will apply to join you, and you can give them the thumbs up or down at your leisure. Even as a relatively shy gamer when it comes to queueing up with randoms (I typically bring my own group of friends), I’ve had a lot of success getting groups together, and the fact that no words or other back-and-forth is necessary makes it painless even for online introverts like myself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Outside of combat there’s a simple linear questline to follow that, so far, is a loop of going to different places and then activating things, finding things, and fighting things. Roughly 6 hours in, it seems mainly geared towards making me visit important landmarks and introducing me to Once Human’s fundamental mechanics, which is fine for now, though it will need to pick up the pace soon if it’s going to keep my interest. I do, however, appreciate how it leans into the strangeness of the world, like the time I was sent to hunt the monster that kept turning pregnant people into trees (seriously). </p><p>I haven’t uncovered the full map yet, but even in the early going it’s big enough that running from one end to the other can be a chore. Thankfully, there are a number of ways to speed that up. An early quest gave me a motorcycle that I can summon anytime, and it’s fun to zoom around on. There are also Transportation Towers to unlock, which act as fast travel points, and even a glider, which all help make the distances much more manageable. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The survival-crafting aspects benefit from being very simple.</p></div><p>The survival-crafting aspects have me very motivated to explore, too, as Once Human benefits from being very simple and straightforward here. At the start you have very few things you can craft, but as you accumulate XP and level up you get Memetic Cyphers, which let you unlock nodes on four upgrade trees. There aren’t any gaps, and as long as you have Memetic Cyphers and materials you can progress quickly to making quality food and equipment. It’s a less-is-more approach that makes it easy to get back to the action, which I appreciate. </p><p>Gathering materials is still done via the tried and true “run around and punch trees” method, but at least early on supplies are abundant enough that heading out for some mining doesn’t feel laborious. Resources seem to grow back quickly, and there are upgrades down the line that look like they can even automate some potential time sinks. Aspiring to things like that is so important in this genre, and although how well those more advanced options are executed remains to be seen, the early stage does a good job of requiring some effort to acquire materials without being tedious. </p><p>Right now my home base is pretty rudimentary, as you’d expect for someone just getting started. It’s a wooden foundation big enough for my bed and some crafting tables – it may not be fancy, but it was easy to put together with the simple point-and-drop building system.  But, since this is a shared-world crafting game, I’m able to browse other players' structures, which range from rundown shacks that make my place look like a palace, to two-story mid-century modern homes that would fit right in on HGTV. I haven’t yet channeled my inner Frank Lloyd Wright, largely because I haven’t invested the upgrade points that unlock the more interesting construction options, but I’m eager to give it a go soon. </p><p>So far I haven’t had any temptation to spend any real money on Once Human to speed that process up, either, as the monetization strategy mostly revolves around cosmetic items like weapon skins and home decorations. There is a battle pass with a premium and free track, but from what I can tell all the premium rewards are also cosmetic, while the free rewards contain some useful crafting components mixed in. Importantly, it doesn’t seem like there is much in the way of pay-to-win concerns, but I’ll be keeping an eye on that as I continue my playthrough. </p><p>Naturally I’m still well short of the endgame, both from a story and a survival crafting standpoint, but my initial impression of Once Human is surprisingly very positive. It’s simple and straightforward mechanically, which lets the absolutely bizarre world of this alien post-apocalypse shine. The creatures are horrifying in a fun way, and I’m thoroughly caught up in the loop of being ever so slightly able to craft better and better things. I don’t know where we will end up as I continue to play over the next week or so, but Once Human is off to a really solid start. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the ancient Chinese game of <em>Go</em>, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence has generally been able to defeat the best human players <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/google-ai-begins-battle-with-humanitys-best-go-player-tonight/">since at least 2016</a>. But in the last few years, researchers have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/new-go-playing-trick-defeats-world-class-go-ai-but-loses-to-human-amateurs/">discovered flaws in these top-level AI <em>Go</em> algorithms</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/man-beats-machine-at-go-in-human-victory-over-ai/">give humans a fighting chance</a>. By using unorthodox "cyclic" strategies—ones that even a beginning human player could detect and defeat—a crafty human can often exploit gaps in a top-level AI's strategy and fool the algorithm into a loss.
</p><p>Researchers at MIT and <a href="https://far.ai/">FAR AI</a> wanted to see if they could improve this "worst case" performance in otherwise "superhuman" AI Go algorithms, testing a trio of methods to harden the top-level <a href="https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo">KataGo algorithm</a>'s defenses against adversarial attacks. The results show that creating truly robust, unexploitable AIs may be difficult, even in areas as tightly controlled as board games.</p>
<h2>Three failed strategies</h2>
<p>In the pre-print paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12843">"Can <em>Go</em> AIs be adversarially robust?"</a>, the researchers aim to create a <em>Go</em> AI that is truly "robust" against any and all attacks. That means an algorithm that can't be fooled into "game-losing blunders that a human would not commit" but also one that would require any competing AI algorithm to spend significant computing resources to defeat it. Ideally, a robust algorithm should also be able to overcome potential exploits by using additional computing resources when confronted with unfamiliar situations.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cyclic.png" data-height="800" data-width="800" alt="An example of the original cyclic attack in action."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cyclic.png" data-height="800" data-width="800">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> An example of the original cyclic attack in action.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The researchers tried three methods to generate such a robust <em>Go</em> algorithm. In the first, they simply fine-tuned the KataGo model using more examples of the unorthodox cyclic strategies that previously defeated it, hoping that KataGo could learn to detect and defeat these patterns after seeing more of them.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>This strategy initially seemed promising, letting KataGo win 100 percent of games against a cyclic "attacker." But after the attacker itself was fine-tuned (a process that used much less computing power than KataGo's fine-tuning), that win rate fell back down to 9 percent against a slight variation on the original attack.</p>
<p>For its second defense attempt, the researchers iterated a multi-round "arms race" where new adversarial models discover novel exploits and new defensive models seek to plug up those newly discovered holes. After 10 rounds of such iterative training, the final defending algorithm still only won 19 percent of games against a final attacking algorithm that had discovered previously unseen variation on the exploit. This was true even as the updated algorithm maintained an edge against earlier attackers that it had been trained against in the past.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-109417607-scaled.jpg" data-height="1707" data-width="2560" alt="Even a child can beat a world-class <em>Go</em> AI if they know the right algorithm-exploiting strategy."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-109417607-scaled.jpg" data-height="1707" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Even a child can beat a world-class <em>Go</em> AI if they know the right algorithm-exploiting strategy.</p><p>Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In their final attempt, researchers tried a completely new type of training using <a href="https://medium.com/@hansahettiarachchi/unveiling-vision-transformers-revolutionizing-computer-vision-beyond-convolution-c410110ef061">vision transformers</a>, in an attempt to avoid what might be "bad inductive biases" found in the convolutional neural networks that initially trained KataGo. This method also failed, winning only 22 percent of the time against a variation on the cyclic attack that "can be replicated by a human expert," the researchers wrote.</p>
<h2>Will anything work?</h2>
<p>In all three defense attempts, the KataGo-beating adversaries didn't represent some new, previously unseen height in general <em>Go</em>-playing ability. Instead, these attacking algorithms were laser-focused on discovering exploitable weaknesses in an otherwise performant AI algorithm, even if those simple attack strategies would lose to most human players.</p>
<p>Those exploitable holes highlight the importance of evaluating "worst-case" performance in AI systems, even when the "average-case" performance can seem downright superhuman. On average, KataGo can dominate even high-level human players using traditional strategies. But in the worst case, otherwise "weak" adversaries can find holes in the system that make it fall apart.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>It's easy to extend this kind of thinking to other types of generative AI systems. LLMs that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/chatgpt-vs-google-bard-round-2-how-does-the-new-gemini-model-fare/">succeed at some complex creative and reference tasks</a> might still <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/chatgpt-math-problems">utterly fail when confronted with trivial math problems</a> (or even get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/ai-poisoning-could-turn-open-models-into-destructive-sleeper-agents-says-anthropic/">"poisoned" by malicious prompts</a>). Visual AI models that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/microsoft-unveils-kosmos-1-an-ai-language-model-with-visual-perception-abilities/">describe and analyze complex photos</a> may nonetheless <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/07/can-you-do-better-than-top-level-ai-models-on-these-basic-vision-tests/">fail horribly when presented with basic geometric shapes</a>.

But this new research shows that determined "adversaries" can often discover new holes in an AI algorithm's performance much more quickly and easily than that algorithm can evolve to fix those problems.
</p><p>And if that's true in <em>Go</em>—a monstrously complex game that nonetheless has tightly defined rules—it might be even more true in less controlled environments. "The key takeaway for AI is that these vulnerabilities will be difficult to eliminate,” FAR CEO Adam Gleave <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02218-7">told Nature</a>. "If we can’t solve the issue in a simple domain like <em>Go</em>, then in the near-term there seems little prospect of patching similar issues like jailbreaks in ChatGPT."</p>
<p>Still, the researchers aren't despairing. While none of their methods were able to "make [new] attacks impossible" in <em>Go</em>, their strategies were able to plug up unchanging "fixed" exploits that had been previously identified. That suggests "it may be possible to fully defend a <em>Go</em> AI by training against a large enough corpus of attacks," they write, with proposals for future research that could make this happen.</p>
<p>Regardless, this new research shows that making AI systems more robust against worst-case scenarios might be at least as valuable as chasing new, more human/superhuman capabilities.</p>

You can upgrade your house at the Carpenter's, increasing the size of the interior and adding important additions, like the kitchen. These upgrades are pretty expensive and resource intensive, but the benefits make it worth it. Here's everything you need to know about upgrading your house in Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Main House upgrades</h2><p>There are three main house upgrades that you can purchase. Each upgrade takes three days of in-game time to complete. In addition to the main new feature with each upgrade, there is also an increase in interior house space, which you can decorate however you see fit.</p><p dir="ltr">House Upgrade 1 requires 10,000G and 450 Wood, adding a kitchen to your house. The kitchen allows you to cook food, so long as you have learned the recipe for whatever item you are cooking.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4332701-houseupgradekitchen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332701" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4332701-houseupgradekitchen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332701"></a><figcaption>The first house upgrade adds a kitchen, which unlocks the cooking system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4332701-houseupgradekitchen.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">House Upgrade 2 requires 65,000G and 100 Hardwood, adding an empty room and a nursery. This allows you to have children and unlocks the renovations system.</p><p dir="ltr">House Upgrade 3 requires 100,000G, adding a cellar to your house. The cellar is for casks, which can age some artisan products like cheese and wine, improving their quality. The cellar comes with 33 casks and the recipe to craft more, with space in the cellar for over 100 casks.</p><h2 dir="ltr">House Renovations</h2><p dir="ltr">House renovations can add or take away small aspects of your farmhouse. These additions are completed instantly and can be refunded and removed at any time, assuming those rooms aren't actively occupied.</p><p dir="ltr">Every house renovation:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Remove Crib - Free</li><li dir="ltr">Open Bedroom - 10,000G</li><li dir="ltr">Add Southern Room - 30,000G</li><li dir="ltr">Add Corner Room - 20,000G</li><li dir="ltr">Expand Corner Room - 100,000G</li><li dir="ltr">Add Attic - 60,000G</li><li dir="ltr">Cubby - 10,000G</li><li dir="ltr">Dining Room - 150,000G</li><li dir="ltr">Open Dining Room - 10,000G</li></ul>

This question sets up the quests immediately following <em>Endwalker</em>’s climax to become an arc that perfectly acts as an epilogue to everything that came before, punctuated by an excellent character in the form of newcomer Zero. With a decade-long overarching narrative also having come to an end in <em>Endwalker</em>, the post-expansion “patch quests” serve as a great blueprint for the future of the game.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196055,196790" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>To get it out of the way, I know I’m late to the party. As I’ve documented already, I’ve recently been making my way through <em>FF14</em>’s many expansions and haven’t quite made it to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-players-thirsty-bakool-ja-ja-1851580847&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-players-thirsty-bakool-ja-ja-1851580847"><em>Dawntrail</em></a></span><em> </em>yet. Post-expansion patch quests are nothing new. As expansions typically have two to three years between them, the team at Square Enix doles out smaller story and content updates to tide players over. With past expansions, these patch quests have often worked in two parts. The first wraps up the story of the preceding expansion and the second sets up the next. For <em>Endwalker</em>’s<em> </em>patch quests, the team had a unique opportunity to buck that formula, since the expansion’s release served as its own finale and an ending to the overarching Hydaelyn-Zodiark saga of the MMO’s past ten years. That meant that the <em>Endwalker </em>patch quests could be their own contained story.</p><p>The new freedom turns the post-<em>Endwalker</em> quests into a mini-expansion of its own. They introduce new characters, locales, dungeons, and a big bad for Warriors of Light to deal with. But, so as not to start entirely from scratch, the story deals with the Void, a world engulfed by darkness that has come up from time to time in the past. It’s a setting that has always seemed prime for an expansion, and while this isn’t quite that, the smaller approach works to its benefit.</p><figure id="" data-id="0f188497243d3144b3435e6c1a75fcd3" data-recommend-id="image://0f188497243d3144b3435e6c1a75fcd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1215" data-height="683" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A floating castle sits within a purple void" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A floating castle sits within a purple void" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f188497243d3144b3435e6c1a75fcd3" data-recommend-id="image://0f188497243d3144b3435e6c1a75fcd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1215" data-height="683" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A floating castle sits within a purple void" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Void is a world lost. Now engulfed by darkness and ravaged by beasts corrupted by that power, it is effectively beyond saving. It’s a contrast to so much of what we have encountered in the past of <em>FF14</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-the-kotaku-review-1838105413&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-the-kotaku-review-1838105413"><em>Shadowbringers</em></a></span><em> </em>introduced us to a world called the First, which was engulfed by light and on the brink of death, but could be pulled back with our help. Here, however, we are confronted with a world that our endless heroics can not do much for. It is there that we encounter one of its denizens, Zero. Like the other inhabitants of the void she is cursed to a deathless existence. In the years since her world was lost she has shed many of her memories, and her humanity with it. When we first meet Zero she is a cold, uncaring person who has something in common with <em>Endwalker</em>’s antagonist; both see existence as an endless cycle of suffering with little to justify it. Yet because she cannot die, Zero can’t get the rest she yearns for.<br></p><p>The bulk of the post-<em>Endwalker</em> patch quests see us dragging Zero around as we try to rescue an ally from the Void while also managing recovery efforts after the nearly-avoided apocalypse on our own world. In contrast to the entire MMO’s story up to that point, the <em>Endwalker </em>patches relegate your hero, the Warrior of Light, to a supporting role. This is Zero’s story, and it’s a good one. After spending an entire expansion filled with existential dread and defeatism, helping someone who has given up hope for a better life is incredibly cathartic. It’s basically a story about learning the power of friendship, a cliché idea if ever there was one, but it does this with sharp writing and wonderful character moments for its leading lady, and let’s be real, <em>Final Fantasy</em> has never been subtle with its themes.</p><p>The story also parallels Zero’s journey with that of the people of your world. In life, Zero was a loner who believed she could not trust anyone and had to work to save the world on her own. It’s the same problem that the patch quests’ primary villain has, but it’s also one that everybody trying to get back to a normal life is going through. This is best exemplified when you visit the people of Garlemald, a now-fallen nation that long served as the MMO’s evil empire. Now, they’re under occupation from you and your allies, and while you have the best intentions, they’re not so willing to accept your aid. Both sides need to put aside their pride to move forward together, as it is the only way they can both rebuild. The situation has a profound effect on Zero, who reflects on her own choice to turn down the help of a pair of heroes hoping to stave off the end of their world before it became the Void.</p><figure id="" data-id="c0de45092ddf8fc0048cc6944a407cc1" data-recommend-id="image://c0de45092ddf8fc0048cc6944a407cc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1183" data-height="665" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zero stands in awe within a glowing blue cavern" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zero stands in awe within a glowing blue cavern" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0de45092ddf8fc0048cc6944a407cc1" data-recommend-id="image://c0de45092ddf8fc0048cc6944a407cc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1183" data-height="665" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zero stands in awe within a glowing blue cavern" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ultimately it’s revealed that the surviving member of the duo she encountered so long ago is the arc’s big villain, Golbez. It’s a poignant moment for Zero, in which she realizes how much her closed-off way of life has impacted those around her. She isn’t responsible for the Void entirely, but she does feel a new sense of guilt and missed opportunity. If only she could have reached out a hand back then. The patch quests don’t quite stick the landing in their predictable end to the conflict at play, but as a character study of Zero, it excels. When Zero is finally able to bring a spark of light to the Void, it’s a reflection of how we have brought a spark of hope into her life as well.</p><p>Though there’s only about half as many quests here, they convey a sense of narrative impact and adventure worthy of a full <em>Final Fantasy 14 </em>expansion. Following <em>Endwalker</em>,<em> </em>I almost hoped that smaller, more focused stories became the new norm for the MMO. Of course, that isn’t what happened, and right now thousands of players are exploring the grand new expansion, <em>Dawntrail</em>. But based on what I’ve been hearing about its structure, it may at times feel more like you’re playing a series of episodic mini-expansions, and to me, that sounds like a good thing. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the past 14 years, Perry has been having trouble finding relevance in a pop space where she was once dominant, and that could not be more clear after today, July 12, as she released her new single “Woman’s World.” The “anthemic” pop song is getting raked across the coals online.

When she released a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@katyperry/video/7381503148105501994?lang=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katyperry/video/7381503148105501994?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip of the song on June 17</a></span>, its lyrics were roasted for sounding like the kind of thing you sing to your dog when no one is home. It’s meant to be empowering, and it mostly just ends up being Perry saying a bunch of adjectives and platitudes. It’s a toothless, juvenile song that only got worse as the truth of its creation was revealed. When it came out that Dr. Luke, the same man who has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.as.com/entertainment/katy-perry-to-release-new-song-womans-world-lyrics-and-comments-about-dr-luke-collaboration-n/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.as.com/entertainment/katy-perry-to-release-new-song-womans-world-lyrics-and-comments-about-dr-luke-collaboration-n/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused of assaulting women like fellow pop star Kesha</a></span> and being misogynistic and predatory toward women in the industry, was a writer and producer for the song, the entire pro-woman anthem became a laughing stock of the internet. There are six writers on “Woman’s World” and four of them are men.</p><p>The music video that also launched today is pretty nonsensical. “Woman’s World” is the kind of shit you’ll hear on women’s razor commercials, but when it’s not cashing in on the most cliched and generic feminist imagery, it’s leaning into a strange, absurdism like Perry filling her ass with unleaded gas. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.themarysue.com/who-is-trisha-paytas/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.themarysue.com/who-is-trisha-paytas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Controversial YouTuber Trisha Paytas</a></span> is here, for some reason and drives Perry around in a monster truck, then the singer is airlifted out of a random girl’s backyard by a helicopter as the onlooker just screams “who are you” at her. Apt.</p><p>Perry told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a61572041/katy-perry-womans-world-lyrics-meaning/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a61572041/katy-perry-womans-world-lyrics-meaning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Elle</em></a></span><em> </em>that she knows a lot of people associate her music with empowering messages. In fairness, that’s true, if you look at songs like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Firework”</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Roar,”</a></span> but those songs were far more effective thanks to their specificity. “Firework” was a queer anthem in the 2010s because it spoke specifically to finding the light inside oneself despite hardship. “Roar” works when it’s speaking to how power dynamics in relationships can make us small and about reclaiming your space. “Woman’s World” essentially boils down to “women exist,” while also propping up one of the most prominent known abusers in the music industry.</p><p>But “Electric,” the 2021 <em>Pokémon</em> anthemic pop song, was all of those things.</p><p>I’m a total mark because while some might call the song cheesy, I get a little choked up listening to it and watching the music video with Perry and her partner Pikachu. The two time travel to an earlier point in their lives when Perry was younger and trying to make it in music, though her Pikachu was a Pichu at the time. The duo helps their younger selves get past a rut in their respective careers. It’s all very sweet, actually. It would’ve been great for a future version of her and Pikachu to have stopped the sequence of events that had her collaborating with a known abuser and putting out the most half-hearted swing at a feminist anthem as she attempts a comeback.<br></p><p>We reached out to Perry’s Pikachu for comment and she said, “Pika, piiiiiiikaaaa” with a bewildered expression.</p><p>But that disappointment is how I feel listening to most of Perry’s music. <em>Teenage Dream </em>is legitimately one of the most important pop records of the modern era and the falloff has been disastrous to watch unfold. Her next album, <em>143</em>, launches on September 20. Hopefully, there is something to redeem it after this shitshow.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia is expected to be launching its GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card this year, and rumors are starting to circulate about just how powerful these GPUs will be. And the latest involves the base clock speed of the flagship 5000 series GPU.</p>



<p>According to a known leaker on the Chiphell forums (h/t to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/rumor-geforce-rtx-5090-base-clock-nears-2-9-ghz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videocardz</a>), the RTX 5090 will have a base clock of nearly 2.9 GHz. That’s a 30% increase from the 2.23 GHz of the RTX 4090. It even beats out the RTX 4090’s boost speed of 2.52 GHz.</p>



<p>There was no mention of a potential boost clock for the GPU. </p>



<p>In addition to the base clock claims, the RTX 5090 is rumored to feature a 448-bit memory bus with a bandwidth of 1568 GB/s and 28GB of GDDR7 memory. </p>

<p>Nvidia has yet to confirm any of these rumors regarding the RTX 5090, and refuse to comment on any “rumor or speculation”. The RTX 5000 series is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2024/04/09/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-5080-expected-to-launch-late-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reportedly on tap</a> to start launching in late 2024.</p>
