<p>Recently, Snail Games USA revealed a new trailer for ARK: Aquatica, an all-new expansion coming to ARK: Survival Ascended. The chief developer behind the series, Studio Wildcard, distanced itself from the project on social media by directing fans to Snail Games, and it’s clear why.</p>



<p>The published trailer was little more than a gen-AI showcase, except for a few seconds of gameplay at the start of the video. It’s glaringly obvious and it has drawn blowback from fans online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-naturally">Naturally</h2>



<p>The one-minute trailer that announces ARK: Aquatica is studded with blatant gen-AI footage, and even the most uneducated eye can look at it and know something is wrong:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ARK: Aquatica Official Trailer GDC 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2eCWWaCzwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The entire contents of the trailer reveal <strong>nothing </strong>about the expansion. It’s just a visual reel that shows janky AI characters exploring some kind of water-themed underworld. In one sequence, a character fires a harpoon gun, and it’s so bizarre it’s a wonder this thing managed to pass muster at Snail Games.</p>



<p>What’s worse is it isn’t even <strong>good </strong>gen-AI content. I’ve seen better and more accurate renditions in Snapchat filters. From a cursory glance beneath the video, I failed to find a single positive comment about the trailer. When I checked, more than 1,000 comments were ripping the AI-generated content to shreds.</p>



<p>Per the description of the DLC, ARK: Aquatica will have players taking their ‘survival to the deep blue with new creatures, mechanics, and dangers lurking below.’</p>



<p>Recently, the team at Wildcard Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ark-next-major-expansion-set-scene-ark-2/">revealed ARK: Lost Colony</a>, the first major expansion for ARK: Survival Ascended that will help bridge the gap between ARK and ARK 2, which still doesn’t have a release date.</p>



<p>Are you miffed by the use of gen-AI in the trailer for ARK: Aquatica? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/x-men-dice-throne-is-a-board-game-that-makes-good-use-of-its-license<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel is everywhere these days, so it’s not surprising to see the deluge of heroes and villains represented throughout various media like the X-Men ‘97 show and Marvel Rivals video game. Even on the tabletop front, Marvel has seen its fair share of interesting crossovers with the likes of the team-based word game Codenames, and the long lasting trading card game Magic: The Gathering. Coming this Spring, there is yet another Marvel collab featuring the X-Men and the dice-rolling fighting game, Dice Throne. From what I’ve played so far, it’s very similar to past versions, but the new characters and unique abilities give this new X-Men run an interesting take for fans looking for a different kind of superhero tabletop experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new X-Men iteration of Dice Throne was initially on Kickstarter. So the Kickstarter version and the Battle Chest version that can be ordered on their website will have different contents than the retail versions that I was able to play with. These differences are mainly in the quality of the tokens and game pieces, in addition to better organizational improvements like storage trays for each hero. For the retail versions, there are two boxes to choose from showcasing four different X-Men each. One includes Cyclops, Gambit, Rogue, and Jean Grey while the other has Iceman, Psylocke, Storm, and Wolverine. So when deciding on which box to get into, you get a good blend of some fan favorites no matter what. Each character has a difficulty rank from one to six, which can be seen on the back of the box as well. The box with Wolverine and Storm is best for new players, since neither of the heroes have a difficulty over four. The Gambit and Jean Grey box, on the other hand, has both of these heroes in particular at difficulty six, so it’s best to consider your playgroup before choosing one or the other. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/dt-x-men-battle-chest-1742339226226.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Since this is ultimately Dice Throne, the gameplay is much the same, with each player rolling dice to determine what abilities their character will use on themself or their opponents or allies. Of the eight abilities on a character board, one of them is usually a defensive ability and another is a passive – alongside the other offensive abilities. On the center is the ultimate ability, which is of course very difficult to pull off being a game of chance. WIth each character board comes dice, a deck of cards specific to the character, dials for tracking resources, and associated character sheets with added information. It can take some time to understand a character’s abilities and the synergy between each one, but it all comes down to what you roll to decide what your turn will play out as. The deck of cards can assist you in manipulating your roll, but you can also alter your opponent’s roll if you decide to make an attack weaker or fizzle altogether. You’ll be taking turns rolling dice and bashing your opponents until they’re life hits zero. It’s pretty a straightforward goal, but how you get there is where the strategy comes in. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The more Wolverine is attacked, the stronger his attacks will be.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the basic gameplay is quite simple, the replayability really comes from the different characters you can pick from. Wolverine, for instance, has a fairly easy playstyle where he gains rage when taking damage. So the more Wolverine is attacked, the stronger his attacks will be. Then you have characters like Storm that can supercharge her abilities to have extra effects. She even has an ability to borrow dice from other players, so she has a better chance of rolling straights, like in poker, which are the cost of some offensive abilities. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel X-Men Dice Throne </h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking at the very difficult side of the character spectrum, there’s Jean Grey, who swaps back and forth between the Dark Phoenix, altering her passive abilities each turn. This means she’s drawing many cards and gaining resources one turn as Jean Grey, then skipping an entire phase but having higher offensive capabilities the next turn as Dark Phoenix. It can be difficult to balance depending on how your opponents affect your plays. Then there’s Gambit, another difficult character who kinetically charges cards with abilities to set up added effects on future turns. So keeping track of said charged cards and when to use them is another layer of strategy. Each character has their own flavor that matches their comic lore, so it’s just a matter of understanding their playstyle to make gameplay go smoothly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dice Throne can be played 1v1, but there are other options that the game suggests, like a free-for-all King of the Hill when there are an odd number of players, or even team matches. Since players take turns one at a time, games can last long if players aren’t quite comfortable enough yet, so playing 1v1 is a good way to get your feet wet before moving on to bigger parties. If you have experience with trading card games like Magic: The Gathering, Dice Throne will actually be pretty easy to pick up. Other than the dice rolls determining which abilities to use, the cards are used very similarly to other TCGs. For instance, there is a specific turn order like upkeep phase, income phase, main phase, and dice roll phases as well as the different timings for when cards can be used during either phase. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve seen Dice Throne before, but I’ve never really thought much of it whenever I find myself at the board game section of a store. Sure, dice-rolling games can be fun and interesting, but people will be drawn to whatever genres or game types they prefer. Being a fan of the Marvel universe and superheroes in general, this iteration of Dice Throne really brought me around to checking it out. If you enjoy Marvel characters and want a fun new board game to add to the library, X-Men Dice Throne really scratches that itch for board game nights – especially when your friends enjoy the characters and world as well. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Road to the Show is one of the most popular game modes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mlb-the-show-25/" data-ref-id="5000-660215">MLB The Show 25</a>. The mode allows you to create your own player and ascend the ranks of Major League Baseball to eventually reach the big leagues and make a true name for yourself. There are plenty of different factors that go into making it to the Show, and your player's batting stance can be one of them.</p><p>While it might not sound like a major factor, some players die on the hill that your batting stance can make a huge difference at the plate. Whether it's due to timing, the look of the swing, or the starting position of the bat, a particular batting stance can be considered "better" than others.</p><p>To help you narrow down your choices from the hundreds of batting stances in MLB The Show 25, we've listed our top seven stances and why you should use them. <strong>The list is in no particular order</strong>.</p><h2>Yordan Alvarez (current player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461472-img_6467.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461472" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461472-img_6467.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461472"></a><figcaption>Yordan Alvarez</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461472-img_6467.jpg"></figure><p>We're starting with one of the more famous batting stances from the past few years in MLB The Show. Yordan Alvarez of the Houston Astros has become one of the best hitters in baseball and many Road to the Show players have stood by his batting stance since he started to mash balls all over the league. Alvarez's stance puts the bat on your left shoulder and keeps your elbows fairly even. However, if you want to take the stance to the next level, you can customize the "Forward Foot Offset" to the following:</p><ul><li>Offset Z: 0</li><li>Offset X: 0</li></ul><p>These settings make your right foot extend way out away from your body, placing more weight on your back foot. While the stance might look a little funky, it delivers a huge leg kick and some true power behind each swing.</p><h2>Shawn Green (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461473-img_6466.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461473" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461473-img_6466.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461473"></a><figcaption>Shawn Green</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461473-img_6466.jpg"></figure><p>We can't take credit for this entry, as the stance and its settings <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MLBTheShow/comments/1e0eyhd/comment/lco7jhc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">come from a Redditor</a> on the MLB The Show subreddit. However, we felt it had to be included due to how many players have sung its praises over the years. The stance is for Shawn Green, foundational speaking, but it customizes a variety of settings to make it one-of-a-kind in Road to the Show.</p><p>Here are the custom stance settings you should use for Shawn Green:</p><ul><li>Hand Offset:  <ul><li>Offset X: 48</li><li>Offset Y: 70</li><li>Offset Z: 61</li></ul></li><li>Hand Rotation: 60</li><li>Hand Waggle Rotation: 80</li><li>Back Elbow Offset: 50</li><li>Front Elbow Offset: 50</li><li>Hips Offset:  <ul><li>Offset X: 77</li><li>Offset Y: 65</li><li>Offset Z: 48</li></ul></li><li>Front Foot Offset:  <ul><li>Offset Z: 48</li><li>Offset X: 33</li></ul></li></ul><p>Using these custom settings, you create a balanced stance that many Road to the Show players simply call "the one."</p><h2>Mark McGwire (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461474-img_6465.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461474" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461474-img_6465.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461474"></a><figcaption>Mark McGwire</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461474-img_6465.jpg"></figure><p>Mark McGwire, with or without the steroids, is one of the best hitters the MLB has ever seen. McGwire utilized a couple of abnormal batting stances during his career, but the first one he utilized is one of the best available in Road to the Show. You can also use a second McGwire stance (1987) that features hands tighter to the batter's face.</p><p>The base McGwire stance is simple, doesn't have a lot of movement, and has feet that are fairly far apart from one another. It delivers great timing and has a fluid swing that works for both lefties and righties.</p><h2>Chipper Jones 2008 (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461475-img_6464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461475" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461475-img_6464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461475"></a><figcaption>Chipper Jones</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461475-img_6464.jpg"></figure><p>Chipper Jones is the most successful switch hitter of all time in the MLB, and his 2008 batting stance is highly recommended for any Road to the Show player who takes up the switch-hitting mantle. Chipper's swing also looks better on taller players, as it's relaxed and makes you stand almost fully upright. The bat is close to resting on your shoulder with little movement, the elbows are even with each other around the chest area, and both feet are pretty close together.</p><p>If you're a switch hitter or want a fully relaxed batting stance, take a look at Chipper Jones' stance.</p><h2>Yoan Moncada (current player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461476-img_6463.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461476-img_6463.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461476"></a><figcaption>Yoan Moncada</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461476-img_6463.jpg"></figure><p>Yoan Moncada's MLB career hasn't worked out like many thought it would, but his stance is great for power hitters. It looks similar to Chipper Jones' stance, but features hands closer to your face and looks a little more focused towards the pitcher. Many Road to the Show players have suggested messing with the custom settings to make Moncada's feet farther apart, but the upright look works well for the stance, in our opinion.</p><h2>Ken Griffey Jr. (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461477-img_6462.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461477" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461477-img_6462.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461477"></a><figcaption>Ken Griffey Jr.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461477-img_6462.jpg"></figure><p>Ken Griffey Jr. is one of the most recognizable baseball players in history and he was known to have arguably the smoothest swing of all time. That holds up in MLB The Show 25, as Griffey's default stance is great for both contact and power hitters as well as both sides of the plate. The stance looks pretty normal but the swing drives through the middle of the plate and the bat ends up right behind the batter with one hand up in the air.</p><h2>Freddie Freeman (current player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461479-img_6461.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461479" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461479-img_6461.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461479"></a><figcaption>Freddie Freeman</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461479-img_6461.jpg"></figure><p>Rounding out the list is the current reigning World Series MVP, Freddie Freeman. Freeman has always had a smooth swing, but it's one that works best for lefties in MLB The Show 25. The stance is designed to pull the ball and pull-hitters usually hit from the left side of the plate.</p><p>It places the bat behind the batter's head with the back elbow up a little farther than the front one, which is close to the batter's face. The right knee is slightly bent to place a little more weight on the left leg so you can really drive the ball into right field. Even if you're a right-handed hitter, though, don't feel like you can't use Freeman's stance.</p><p>And that does it for our top batting stances in MLB The Show 25. Of course, these are just our suggestions, so you can try them to find your preference.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Two Point Museum: It’s Great]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-point-museum-it%E2%80%99s-great.1138464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Having bounced off the last two games in what's now a fairly long-running series--<em>Two Point Hospital</em> (2018) and <em>Two Point Campus</em> (2022)--I wasn't super pumped to be sitting down with <em>Two Point Museum</em>. A week later I can see that my indifference was <em>wildly </em>misplaced; it's one of the best, if not <em>the </em>best management games I have ever played.</p><p>My main problem with the first two games in the series wasn't necessarily with them as <em>games</em>, per se, but more their setting. I found them weirdly stressful: As the custodian of a hospital and then a school, there was a duty of care, a constant pressure to get people in, make them better (or smarter) then get them out. Fail and I could get people hurt, or even <em>killed</em>, a level of responsibility I absolutely do not want in a relaxing "click and watch some little guys move around" video game.</p><p>Not here. <em>Two Point Museum</em> just wants you to give a never-ending stream of guests and customers a good time. The general public are rarely in danger, are surprisingly patient as you repair stuff around them and are basically in your museum for the same reason you are: they want to have a coffee, learn some stuff and see some cool shit. This shift in focus changes the experience entirely; it's no longer a game about care, it's a game about being a fun guy.</p><p>And that's fun! Thanks to the vibe switch, <em>Two Point Museum</em> feels almost <em>Sims</em>-like at times, because there's less emphasis on the pinpoint optimisation of your museum (though you can do that if you like) and more of a focus on creative sandboxing, designing cool exhibits, then agonising over how you're going to decorate them.</p><p>This construction side of the game is so important here because your museum runs on "buzz". You generate buzz via the quality of your exhibits, which is partly down to stuff like their rarity, but mostly down to how you style them by adding stuff like plants, information displays, lighting and speakers. There aren't hard rules you need to stick to in order to upgrade your exhibits; the game assesses you more on the quantity of stuff you add, not the quality of its placement. You can spend hours dressing up your dinosaur bones exactly how you like, and if that's how you like it, the game will reward you for it.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXgVvAMUZ4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Beyond the positive vibes and very enjoyable sandbox/construction tools, this is also a <em>very </em>good management game. Its interface, combining on-screen alerts (like icons appearing over the heads of guests and staff) with a speedy set of menus, is almost frictionless; you're always alerted to the exact location and cause of a problem (or even a shortcoming) almost instantly, and solving those issues usually only takes a click or two. Not once during my entire week with this game did I ever feel lost, or wondered exactly what was causing an issue, or how I was supposed to make something better. While I know that sounds like the absolute basics of this genre, you'd be surprised--<em>Planet Coaster 2</em>, I'm looking at you--how many rivals can't get it right.</p><p>Well, no, I did get lost <em>once</em>, and that was when crimes were being committed. <em>Two Point Museum</em> is full of crime. It has a whole system attached to detecting and defeating it that would be more at home in a game about art heists or jewellery stores. Criminals are forever trying to break in and steal your stuff, and you have various ways of trying to stop them, from putting security guards near exhibits to building a network of cameras around the museum. But the act itself is strangely punitive; you sometimes get almost no time to react before you can lose a whole exhibit when a single thief drags an entire Stegosaurus skeleton down a toilet (don't ask) and escapes. Those things can take ages to build, so to lose them in an instant is weirdly at odds with the rest of the game's casual, fun-loving, build-whatever nature.</p><p>A game about running a modern museum and managing a diverse staff of skilled workers could also have been areas <em>Two Point Museum</em> tripped up, but I was pleasantly surprised by its handling of both. First, how they managed to make a whole game about museums work without once having to whistle awkwardly as we collected antiques or raided tombs is a miracle--you instead build collections based on dinosaur bones, fossils, fish, ghosts and space--which <em>sounds </em>weird, but once you start playing the game it really does make sense within <em>Two Point's </em>cartoonish universe.</p><p>And second, there aren't many games where the phrase "pay your workers" is more important. Everyone you hire can eventually be trained to be <em>elite</em>; as they learn more and get better at their jobs, they ask to get paid more, and you have to pay them a lot more. Unlike loads of other management games, you can't skimp here; if you don't pay them they get angry and walk, and losing your best workers can cripple your entire operation. So look after your people! Good lesson!</p><p><em>Two Point Museum</em> is out now on PC, Mac, Xbox and PlayStation.</p><figure><figcaption>My copy came with some bonus Sega stuff.

It's been four months since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a> was released, starting life as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">really great shooter that had more tech issues than you can shake a stick at</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> have kept themselves busy with some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-first-patch-is-coming-next-week-though-my-favourite-parts-are-still-the-imperfections">hefty patches</a>. The first one alone had almost 2000 fixes, with the second one following that up with more than 1700. As of today, patch 1.3 is here, this time bringing in over 1200 changes, fixes, and improvements. Obviously quite a bit less than the previous two main patches, but a sizable figure nonetheless, and hopefully a sign that the game is getting to a healthy point.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Over on Steam, GSC Game World highlighted a few of the more notable changes that come with the patch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/831582351143207687">Steam</a>, covering a broad range of aspects like AI, general balance, story bits, audio bits, and story progression. On the AI and combat front, mutants' movements during combat are smoother now, and NPCs will have an "improved" reaction to hearing the sound of footsteps.
</p>
<p>
Balance wise, A-life encounters will generally be a bit rarer now, and arch artifacts have had a rebalance themselves; weird water has decreased radiation protection, and weird flower has an increased smell masking effect now for example. There's also a bug that could let players "permanently stack the effect of unequipped artifacts" that has been fixed now too.
</p>
<p>
I really can't list out all of the other patch notes here as there's just too many, which continues to be impressive work from GSC Game World. You can check the <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-3">full patch notes</a> if you're that desperate to take in every single change. And in case you were wondering, this won't be the last update either, CSC Game World did also note that they have already started working on the next update.

          <p>It's been nearly two years now since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/phil-harrisons-successor-announced-at-sony-shuhei-yoshida/">game industry veteran</a> Phil Harrison <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/after-the-death-of-stadia-vp-phil-harrison-has-left-google/">left Google</a> following the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-stadia-officially-shuts-down-january-2023-will-refund-game-purchases/">implosion of the company's Stadia cloud gaming service</a>. But the passage of time hasn't stopped one company from taking advantage of this week's Game Developers Conference to poke fun at the erstwhile gaming executive for his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meet-the-stadia-developers-blindsided-by-googles-latest-product-shutdown/">alleged mistreatment of developers</a>.</p>
<p>VGC <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/has-a-harrison-fired-you-lately-savage-planet-devs-taunt-former-stadia-boss-phil-harrison-with-gdc-billboard/">spotted a conspicuous billboard</a> in San Francisco's Union Square Monday featuring the overinflated, completely bald head of <em>Gunther</em> Harrison, the fictional Alta Interglobal CEO who was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-will-serve-up-its-dish-in-may-2025/">recently revealed</a> as the blatantly satirical antagonist in the upcoming game <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>. A large message atop the billboard asks passersby—including the tens of thousands in town for GDC—"Has a Harrison fired <em>you</em> lately? You might be eligible for emotional support."</p>

<p>While Gunther Harrison probably hasn't fired any GDC attendees, the famously bald Phil Harrison was responsible for the firing of plenty of developers when he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/report-stadia-undershot-to-the-tune-of-hundreds-of-thousands-of-users/">shut down Google's short-lived Stadia Games &amp; Entertainment (SG&amp;E) publishing imprint</a> in early 2021. That shutdown <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/google-praised-stadia-studio-for-great-progress-one-week-before-killing-it/">surprised a lot of newly jobless game developers</a>, perhaps none moreso than those at Montreal-based Typhoon Games, which Google had <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/google-buys-triple-a-game-dev-typhoon-studio-to-beef-up-stadia/">acquired in late 2019</a> to make what Google's Jade Raymond said at the time would be "platform-defining exclusive content" for Stadia.</p>
<p>Yet on the very same day that <em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em> launched as a Stadia exclusive, the developers at Typhoon found themselves jobless, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/google-closes-stadias-dedicated-game-studios-after-less-than-2-years/">alongside the rest of SG&amp;E</a>. By the end of 2022, Google would shut down Stadia entirely, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meet-the-stadia-developers-blindsided-by-googles-latest-product-shutdown/">blindsiding even more game developers</a>.</p>
<h2>Don’t forgive, don’t forget</h2>
<p>After being let go by Google, Typhoon Games would reform as Raccoon Logic (thanks in large part to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/life-after-stadia-new-studio-raccoon-logic-picks-up-where-typhoon-studios-left-off">investment from Chinese publishing giant Tencent</a>) and reacquire the rights to the Savage Planet franchise. And now that the next game in that series is set to launch in May, it seems the developers still haven't fully gotten over how they were treated during Google's brief foray into game publishing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/silent-hill-2-remake-proves-that-remakes-aren-t-the-easy-option<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the era of remakes, developers have come under fire time and again for rehashing classic titles instead of pioneering new ideas. However, taking a beloved game from a different era and reimagining it for modern audiences is no small undertaking. Devs have to preserve everything that was amazing about the original story and gameplay, while polishing areas that might have been held back by the technology and capabilities of the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At GDC 2025, Anna Oporska-Szybisz, senior level designer at Bloober Team, gave us the inside look at what is required to take an already beloved game and catapult it to new heights, discussing the difficulties faced when building levels on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2 Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As a die-hard fan of the 2001 hit, the weight was heavy on her shoulders as she set out to rebuild a place treasured by horror fans around the world.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Managing fan expectations around classic games">Managing fan expectations around classic games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz started the breakdown with a surprising point: fan theories. One of the hardest things developers face when remaking games as popular as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the relationship players have built with the story. She stated that “remembering is caring,” admitting that developers do look at the theories players share online, taking those perceptions into account when restructuring the story.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-comedic-cheat-sheet-that-helped-build-tactical-breach-wizard" target="_self" data-discover="true">The comedic cheat sheet that helped build Tactical Breach Wizards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This sensitivity to the player isn’t a small undertaking, as everyone who played the original game took something unique away from James’ story. When building a new title, devs don’t juggle as many preconceived notions of what the narrative or mechanics will deliver. In a remake, however, every element is an equation, one part innovation, two parts nostalgia. If not balanced correctly, the remake’s story might be unrecognizable or fail to resonate with longtime fans of the series.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz specifically had to tackle this when redesigning the Labyrinth level of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2 Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The notoriously difficult maze of puzzles and boss battles stumped many players in 2001, including Oporska-Szybisz, and she wanted to make it better without losing the iconic and nostalgic elements of one of the game’s final challenges.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Don’t fix what isn’t broken">Don’t fix what isn’t broken</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz broke down the process of reimagining the Labyrinth, and laid out the three rules she uses to approach the rebuilding of a remake level. “Good Enough” describes elements of a game that don’t have issues. If it’s not broken, there isn’t any reason to scrap it and start over. She explained that they “try not to overdo things that only need small adjustments”.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-ufo-50-s-incredible-8-bit-journey" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside UFO 50's incredible 8-bit journey</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The “almost enough” bracket covers elements that almost hit the mark, but maybe didn’t have the polish they needed. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has several puzzles that were aggressive and innovative for the time, but lacked some of the quality-of-life mechanics that are available today. These puzzles, maps, perspectives, and visuals are perfect candidates for a bit of reworking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The “not enough” bracket encompasses mechanics that were held back or poorly balanced in the original. In this category, Oporska-Szybisz specifically calls out the cube puzzles in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that manipulates the perspective of a room with very few clues to help the player through the puzzle’s requirements. The goal was to fully reimagine this puzzle to make it intuitive and approachable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She mentioned one of the biggest hurdles in remaking games is that “it’s tempting to change a lot to make it 'better' but it’s often best to find a middle ground,” when reworking elements in remakes. The original game was loved for a reason, and too much of an overhaul can actually hurt the game, not bolster it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An iconic level remastered">An iconic level remastered</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using all the criteria she had broken down, Oporska-Szybisz then jumped into the painstaking process of what it takes to remake a well-known game level. The Labyrinth in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was an infuriating combination of difficult puzzles and impossible navigation. When I first played it, I became so turned around that I put the game down for months. James’ hand-drawn map was early-00s fog-of-war in the worst way. All the corridors looked the same, all the rooms were the same color, and it became a hazy blur to navigate.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz saw these problems in her playthrough and decided to go back to the foundations of what a Labyrinth can be. She looked to the classic Greek myths surrounding Theseus and his journey through the Labyrinth. She realized that the remake could rebuild this location with the same hints, using the setting to tell a story rather than just challenge the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team split the once one-note level into three areas: Rotten, Desolated, and Ruined. Each is distinctive in color, offered different enemies, and required different strategies to navigate. They were also a depiction of the stages of James’ grief, literally leading him through the maze inside his own head.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz's team took something that had once left controllers thrown on a sofa and turned it into a beautiful piece of symbolic storytelling. They also took care to preserve elements of nostalgia from the original Labyrinth, like Pyramid Head’s cameo and most of the well-known puzzle rooms.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Remakes aren’t easy">Remakes aren’t easy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oporska-Szybisz’s breakdown of the level-rebuilding process in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2 Remake</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> offers a unique look at the complexities of breathing new life into classic stories. If done correctly, long-time fans can enjoy a world that they loved with modern niceties, while new fans can join in on a world they might not otherwise have the chance to experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Remakes are often the key to accessing titles that have been lost thanks to lacking or poor-quality ports. Devs may have to scrap and rebuild a remake concept multiple times to balance that "good enough" space Oporska-Szybisz spoke of. “What is the right amount of symbolism without throwing it in your face?”, she asked as she explained the difficult process of injecting inspiration into level elements, how do you keep the “glimpses of the past” while offering something fresh and exciting?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s hard work, but the art of it is vital in preserving titles we love and passing them on to new generations of players.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Laura Gray, known as Ezra when not putting pen to paper, is a D&amp;D enthusiast with a love of all things written.

I was trying to create a digital version of a theater game/score I am really fascinated with. I think it's called Lane Work, from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/viewpointsbookpr0000boga">The Viewpoints Book</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where actors are restricted to only moving back and forth in their own lanes, at different speeds (and then allowed a single action and a single phrase). The couple of times I played or watched it had been really powerful, and so I thought that could be an interesting direction to make something out of preexisting games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, instead of having multiple games showing at the same time and inspired by this Increpare game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.increpare.com/2017/08/running_memories/">Running Memories</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I started playing around with crossfading them at different intervals. I was also very interested in modular synthesizers, so at this point I was changing the character’s moving speed (the controller analog input) based on knobs, as well as the rate the crossfading happened. The effect was really mesmerizing, and at this point I realized that I could try making the fade actually have something related to the actual movement rather than it being a thing that happened in time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, I spent a good amount of time figuring out good ways to make this happen, and instead of having the position of the characters in the games themselves dictate the crossfading, I made an invisible map where an invisible character would walk around, and in doing so would crossfade the games that were being displayed. From there, it was mostly technical issues and finding "samples" and placing them in the map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(This is what it looks like on the inside. You are that square walking around a big map. The three closest games to you get crossfaded)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main tools I used for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were the multi console emulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk">BizHawk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for playing, "sampling," and playing back video games from many sources (and which has a great API to do a lot of what we do). I also used Unity for compositing the games' visual output and the logic in which that happens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The latest version makes use of our awesome toolset </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/plunderludics/unity-hawk/tree/main">UnityHawk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which allows us to very seamlessly integrate BizHawk within Unity. UnityHawk is extremely handy and replaced my early-on convoluted patchwork stack of Python scripts sending and receiving OSC messages from Unity and BizHawk. I also used the modular synthesizer emulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV rack</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the prototyping phase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> weaves together many games from PSX and N64 into its exploration of memory, nostalgia, and movement in digital spaces. What challenges do you face in weaving these experiences from different consoles together into a single playable experience? How do you bring multiple games together, let alone ones from different systems?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the previous question answers this, but I can go into a bit more detail. Earlier on, I was using Unity to composite images from the BizHawk emulator using this library: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hecomi/uWindowCapture">uWindowCapture</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This allowed me to capture different emulator windows running in the background into textures in Unity. Then, there was a Python script bridging Unity and BizHawk through this protocol called OSC. With that, I could send messages to and from Unity and to and from BizHawk’s LUA scripting toolset.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was a huge mess, and starting it up was also very unstable. Gurn Group and our friend Dan over the next year put a lot of effort into simplifying all of this by creating UnityHawk, which allows us to basically communicate directly to BizHawk from Unity and not have all those extra layers of indirection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The multiple systems issue is solved by BizHawk, which is a godsend for us, allowing us to very seamlessly run games from a lot of different consoles. One friction point was that sometimes some games didn't take analog input, or the d-pad would affect the game differently, so I had to make sure each game had a correct input mapping so they all ran smoothly (if you look closely, you can see that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mega Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for some reason, only turns right. I never got that one).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Has mixing these games together resulted in any interesting unintended results? Created something useful that may have taken you by surprise?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am always really excited to see moments where players move beyond the places that I preselected for them. Sometimes this happened because I didn't know it was possible to get there without jumping, but most times it’s because they either die or hit a condition in which the game is expecting input other than moving (a cutscene or a dialogue). I think a lot of these moments create an exciting variation on the general infinite going forward of the game. I particularly love this one moment where you can get to a dialogue in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Majora's Mask</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> saying that you have a stupid horse while in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> you are stuck on a moving platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How does it feel to repurpose and reshape the works of others in such a way that they pull from their existing meanings while also creating whole new ones? What interests you about creating things in this way?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For me, the most exciting thing about "plundering," as we call it, is having a whole new view on playing any game. I notice how the characters move in all of them, how long it takes for the game to boot and actually get into gameplay, how long it takes to be free from a tutorial interrupting you, how the swimming animation looks, how there seem to be bridges pretty early on in every game, how some 3D games have animations when pushing against walls and some don't, the different colors of the grass, places in which you can't jump if your character is stuck (I call these jump prisons), and many many more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I hope that making playable things in this way will also make people imagine their own possibilities, and also make an intuitive understanding that games are what we make out of the tools we are given. Playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> because you want a snapshot of all the tigers is in the same level of playing it to get to see the entire story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I also appreciate the historical aspects of it. While I can't deny the nostalgia factor of this project, I think it's important to be able to look at old games and think of them as "good for their time," rather than simply good on their own. Video game development is not a linearly progressing form, and many, many interesting things have been lost for the sake of streamlining and maximizing engagement. A lot of these early games are really bad, but a lot of them also surprise me immensely (the semi tank movement in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for example, feels like something lost to the modern 3D platformer).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, I think it's also interesting in new games, as in new rules and objectives, rather than new content. We, as game developers, love mashing our loved references together to create new work anyway—Metroidvanias, Soulslikes, roguelikes etc.. We recreate these ideas from scratch over and over, without much examination on what that process is actually giving us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(Oops, I wrote a manifesto).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What appealed to you about creating an experience by connecting several other games together? Cross-fading them over one another and connecting them? How did crafting </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> in this way help enhance its themes?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was interested in the different ways it felt to move in the different 3D games, in the ways in which sometimes it feels like you were moving in one game but in a different game's scenery, and also in the dream-like narrative that arises out of the crossfading. The crossfading being driven by the movement of the player allowed me to make the feeling of actually moving between games—of it feeling like certain laces led to other laces.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I personally didn't have particular themes in mind as I was making it. I pretty much trusted the process and let the games guide some internal meaning that could arise out of the piece. I think </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> works pretty much as a conceptual plunderludics work—something to spark the possibility space of making games out of other games: "here's a very simple structure to combine together multiple games, in any amount. Now, imagine the possibilities of making it more intentional—of highly crafting the transitions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember once talking to Bennett Foddy about the dream of making a narrative/single player version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Multibowl</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a video game with its own arc/story that is made completely out of premade pieces from other games. I don't think </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> achieves this, but I hope it makes people imagine it as well, and maybe even live tiny, uncurated narrative moments for themselves while roaming around. I'm hoping to bring a new version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to GDC that will have an ever grander set of games, and an even more intentional placement of things in the map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Why did you include the games that you choose for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>? Why these specific titles?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a funny question. There's, again, not a lot of intention behind it, I wanted to have as many games as possible for the initial show where I was gonna display it, but I also didn't want to simply play games until the very first playable moment and then switch to the next game. This was, in a way, also a research project in 3D game movement. So, I was pretty much going down a list of games that sounded interesting, playing them for a bit, and "sampling" them in the meantime until I felt like moving on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sampling aspect itself is more interesting and curated. I had some samples beforehand that I was using for testing and stayed on the final project, like Link on top of a tree which I was using for this </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://plunderludics.github.io/works/linked%20jumps.html">earlier experiment</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. However, once I decided to not have the jump button in the games, I started looking for jump prisons, and created my own little game out of searching for save states (I like calling them samples): finding locations in which, if the character can't jump, you are stuck in a particular area. There's not many of those, but I am always excited when I find something like that. I particularly love the one in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where you walk on the moving platform. That’s probably my favorite sample.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, I also started sampling moments where characters were in similar states, like being on a bridge, or being in a green place, or swimming; things like that. I didn't end up using a lot of these since I didn't want the same game to repeat too much, but I hope to expand on the project with more things like this.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oh, and I have also been fascinated with Any Austin's youtube series Unremarkable and odd Places, and the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk10mVrUQvk">sample from </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk10mVrUQvk">Spyro</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was taken straight from that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What interested you about exploring movement and the possibilities in 3D space? What ideas went into crafting a play space that would get the player to think on it</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a great final question for me to segue into shamelessly using this moment to promote my own, more commercially viable, work. While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a work within my plunderludics practice, it is also a research project for me—looking at a variety of 3D platformers and seeing what works and what doesn't, what might've been forgotten in the past, and how we got to the kind of games we have today. Myself and my friends are working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2888670/pondlife_discone_a_videogame/">pondlife: discone (a videogame)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (Wishlist pls) which is the best 3D platformer game of all time (As in, it's already the best. We are simply still working on it to make it even better). Since we are developing a lot of our movement system from the ground up and reinventing the wheel in many ways, it’s great to be able to travel back to the time when the wheel was being invented and see what people were doing back then!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am very interested in movement in games—the general embodying you can achieve with different controls, as well as the feeling of mastery and weirdness of exploring a new body. I also like playing games in ways they are not intended to be played (mostly trying to climb things that were not made to be climbed), so I also like playing these games in search of such structures—unintentionally designed challenges that work regardless, or in fact, work because of, the way these games work. It’s fascinating to me.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love seeing people take these challenges even further, like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A">Mario 64</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A"> half A press challenge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, trying to beat </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIA4KYiHHlU">Dark Souls 3</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIA4KYiHHlU"> without walking</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ">playing 4 instances of </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ">Mega Man</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ"> at the same time</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJyg1nzbZPg">randomized </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJyg1nzbZPg">Zelda</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfTDu9lzgtFHVirg_tSbRsSG6g0zKSdz6">many more</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

            <p>
I like a good puzzle game, but to be honest I don't play them all that often. Not because I'm bad at them, thanks for assuming I'm a numpty, it's more just that I prefer games with a really good hook to them - think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Portal</a> as the prime example of such a game. Clean, knows exactly what it is, and uses its concept in increasingly interesting ways without overstaying its welcome. I have no idea if Chromatic Conundrum will manage that or not, but I've never seen a game use light as part of its puzzles in quite the same way before.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You can take a look at a snippet of gameplay below, but here's the lowdown: you need to move around boxes that emit different coloured lights to line-up with on sensors to open doors (think of Portal again and having to put boxes on buttons). Overlapping these boxes can create new colours, which you might need for certain sensors. Sometimes, you'll need to cast shadows so that certain sensors are left in the dark. It's one of those kinds of games that are so simple in concept, but it's the execution that really sells it to you.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
I'm a really big fan of how simple it all looks. There really is no denying Portal's influence on this game, add a few more textures in there and it could be an Aperture Science test chamber. The stark black and white really makes the colours pop though, really shows you how clean, simple design is sometimes the best way to go.
</p>
<p>
Of course, immediately it feels like this could be a problem for colour blind people, and there's no mention anywhere of any kind of accessibility features, but it still looks to be early enough days for the puzzle game, so hopefully that's something that gets added in.
</p>
<p>
Those of you as enamoured as I am by Chromatic Conundrum can wishlist the game on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3081690/Chromatic_Conundrum/">right here</a>.

So I have nothing bad to say about them.” </p><p>Fares further elaborated that in his view, the real problem isn’t with any one publisher, like EA or Ubisoft, but with capitalism itself and how it forces people to be greedy and always looking to make more and more. </p><p> “The problem with the whole capitalist idea is that you need to make more and more and more and more money,” explained Fares. “That doesn’t make sense, because at the end of the day, you will make stupid decisions. But I just hope, in the best of worlds, that you take less of these stupid decisions and focus on what you truly, truly want. And those are the games.”</p><p>“Because when you have a great game—we’re seeing it with [<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-success-metacritic-90-steam-players-ea-1851768495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-success-metacritic-90-steam-players-ea-1851768495"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span>], a game done only from passion, a game where you literally don’t have to buy two copies, a game that doesn’t have any microtransactions. And you see the success it does. I mean, it’s even a financial success, obviously, because people want to pay for something that feels great. So I just hope it inspires other publishers to do that.”</p><p>Fares also told the outlet that EA doesn’t interfere with Hazelight as the studio develops its games, letting it experiment and create whatever it wants. And while he admits EA isn’t perfect, saying that every publisher “fucks up now and then,” it seems at least EA is learning from its mistakes and supporting the creation of games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span>.

			<p>NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 572.83), which is optimized for a series of games that have just launched or are about to launch. The first is, of course, the Half-Life 2 RTX demo, which features the full extent of the NVIDIA RTX suite as analyzed <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. But it's also optimized for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-arch-2025-update-ultra-ray-tracing-dlss-3-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Control update</a> that enhanced Remedy's game with a new Ultra Ray Tracing preset featuring an increased number of rays per pixel, updated DLSS (to version 3.7, which can be overridden to DLSS 4's new transformer model through the NVIDIA app), texture quality improvements, faster texture streaming, support for a wider range of ultra-wide monitor aspect ratios up to 48:9, the addition of a Field of View slider, and High Dynamic Range (HDR) support.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the new driver is optimized for Assassin's Creed Shadows (which, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned in our article</a>, supports DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation via NVIDIA app override) and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. While not a new game, the cooperative first-person action title by Fatshark will be updated to natively support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation with an update scheduled to go live next week.</p>
<p>The driver should&nbsp;<span>also be installed for gamers looking to play inZOI. The life simulation title will debut in early access on Friday, March 28, featuring DLSS Super Resolution and NVIDIA ACE technology powering their '<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Zoi</a>' NPCs. The technology is based on a .5B billion parameter Mistral NeMo Minitron small language model, providing high-quality</span>&nbsp;outputs at low latency in a very compact footprint. The feature is only available on GeForce RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>Lastly, NVIDIA has also shared that The Last of Us Part II Remastered, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to launch on PC on April 3</a>, will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation within the game. Of course, DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex are also individually supported.</p>
<p>The Game Ready driver's release notes also reveal the following bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[GeForce RTX 5080/5090] Graphics cards may not run at full speeds on system reboot when overclocked [5088034]</li>
<li>[GeForce RTX 50 series] GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs crashes with black screen [5120886]</li>
<li>Some NVIDIA Control Panel / NVIDIA App settings changes immediately get reset or give error [5160516]</li>
<li>PC may bugcheck IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL 0xa during gameplay with HDR enabled [5091576]</li>
<li>[VRED 2026] Optix compile error with R570 branch drivers [5122360]</li>
<li>[Derivative TouchDesigner ] Application stability issues [4606316]</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/were-getting-a-full-size-portal-pinball-table-before-portal-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<h2>A bargain at twice the price</h2>
<p>The extensive <em>Portal</em> theming on the table seems to extend to the gameplay as well. As you might expect, launching a ball into a lit portal on one side of the playfield can lead to it (or a ball that looks a lot like it) immediately launching from another portal elsewhere. The speed of the ball as it enters one portal and exits the other seems like it might matter to the gameplay, too: A <a href="https://www.multimorphic.com/portal/">description</a> for an "aerial portal" table feature warns that players should "make sure to build enough momentum or else your ball will land in the pit!"</p>


<p>The table is full of other little nods to the <em>Portal</em> games, from a physical Weighted Companion Cube that can travel through a portal to lock balls in place for eventual multiball to an Aerial Faith Plate that physically flings the ball up to a higher level. There's also a turret-themed multiball, which GLaDOS reminds you is based around "the pale spherical things that are full of bullets. Oh wait, that's you in five seconds."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.multimorphic.com/store/p3-pinball-machine/p3-machine-with-the-portal-standard-game-kit/">purchase a full <em>Portal</em> pinball table</a> starting at $11,620 (plus shipping), which isn't unreasonable as far as brand-new pinball tables are concerned <a href="https://sternpinball.com/2024/10/16/stern-pinball-revisits-a-timeless-classic-with-metallica-remastered-available-now/">these days</a>. But if you already own <a href="https://www.multimorphic.com/p3-pinball-platform/">the base table for Multimorphic's P3 Pinball Platform</a>, you can purchase a "Game Kit" upgrade—with the requisite game software and physical playfield pieces to install on your table—starting at just $3,900.</p>
<p>Even players that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/one-week-with-the-valve-index-a-vr-game-changer-with-a-few-question-marks/">invested $1,000 or more in an Index VR headset</a> just to play <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/half-life-alyx-review-the-greatest-vr-adventure-game-yet-and-then-some/"><em>Half-Life Alyx</em></a> might balk at those kinds of prices for the closest thing we've got to a new, "official" <em>Portal</em> game. For true Valve obsessives, though, it might be a small price to pay for the ultimate company collector's item and conversation piece.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/monaco-2-pilfers-an-april-release-date-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Pocketwatch Games and publisher Humble Games have announced that their cooperative heisting sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monaco-2">Monaco 2</a> will release on 10th April for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monaco 2- Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rXsfJzrKRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monaco 2 invites you to play with heisting teams of up to four players – you can, of course, tackle missions solo as well – and picking from eight playable characters. You can switch mid-run if the obstacles before you don’t meet your character’s skill set, but you can preview a mission’s layout with the Blueprint Mode before you set foor in a stage.</p>
<p>Where the original Monaco was a linear adventure, in which you assembled a crew of misfits to pull off an audacious series of heists and capers, the sequel is taking a different tack. While there is a structured campaign, this is going down the path of a more freeform heist simulator, testing you and your co-op buddies through procedurally generated levels that have been cooked up by an AI mastermind.</p>
<p>After the minimalist top-down shenanigans of the original, Monaco 2 is much more fleshed out visually with an isometric view into 3D worlds and a painterly art style. It looks rather lovely.</p>

<p>A demo of Monaco 2 was released back in February for Steam Next Fest. The demo features around 2 hours of missions that present their own unique challenges, picking from the line up of five of the thieves from the full game. The demo also featured a mode called “Unreliable Narrator”, which scrambles up the missions in interesting ways.</p>

		<p>One month on from the last major update, GSC Game Worlds has dropped <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a> Patch 1.3, another huge update with over 1,200 fixes.</p>
<p>Patch 1.3 for STALKER 2 brings changes and fixes across the AI and A-Life system, game balance, story progression, game performance, locations, audio and more.</p>


<p>On a high level, Patch 1.3 has polished animations and behaviours for mutants in combat, rebalanced some arch-artifacts and damage from anomalies for different armours and suits. If combat does go a bit awry, there’s some new death screens that vary upon death.</p>
<p>It’s also brought fixes for dozens of mission and open world bugs, and there’s fixes for over 100 instances that trigger ‘EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION’ errors.</p>
<p>Looking back on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a>, Miguel said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>

<p>Here’s the full patch notes high level patch notes for STALKER 2 Patch 1.3 – <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-3">more detailed and granular patch notes are available here</a>.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-saw-more-players-this-year-than-its-release-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredible (and continued) success of Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-4-playable-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larian's surprising decision not to pursue a sequel</a>, fans have been left wondering what will happen to the franchise next. According to Hasbro Senior Vice President of Digital Games Dan Ayoub, though, it may not be long before some sort of news is shared. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a> at GDC 2025, Ayoub said:</p>
<p><em>A lot of people are very interested in Baldur's Gate. We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that.</em></p>
<p><em>It's somewhat of an unenviable position. I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that.</em></p>
<p>That doesn't necessarily mean this announcement would be related to a new mainline installment in the franchise. From Ayoub's statement, it sounds like that is further away from even being agreed upon. However, there could be other ways to keep the interest in Baldur's Gate high.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, what fans really want is a continuation of Baldur's Gate 3, especially with the incredibly interesting characters introduced in that game. In that regard, Hasbro's Dan Ayoub doesn't back down from the noticeable challenge of rising to that level of anticipation:</p>
<p><em>I'm never one to shy down from a challenge. I think anything that forces us to raise our creative bar - and developers love to have a high bar to go after, and I think we've actually seen the team push some really interesting ideas that they're like, 'Okay, we need to raise our bar. We need to go bigger on this.' And things like that. So, I think that's our hope, right? We would keep raising the bar and everyone just tries to go a little higher.</em></p>
<p>What would you like to see next in the revered fantasy RPG series?</p>

            <p>
There are two shooters that I imagine will never die, because they just seem to hang on despite being incredibly old and plenty of other games coming out in the mean-time: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike">Counter-Strike</a> (both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a> games, funnily enough - they've clearly got the Source (sorry)). <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which came out back in 2023, is the most played shooter of all time on Steam in fact, but even now the original game is still pretty popular. There's literally more than 16,000 people playing it right now. And though it might not be official, a group of modders have come together to remake the 1.6 version of the game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Titled CS: Legacy, the team behind it want you to know that this isn't just a fancy mod of the classic shooter, but a "from the ground up" remaking made with completely custom code and original assets. It should still have that same Valve feel to it, though, as the entire thing is being made in the developer's official 2013 Source Engine SDK, albeit with some tinkering with its renderer, shaders, and a few other systems.

<p>
According to the trailer (which you can have a gander at above), it'll be coming to Steam in early access some time this year. It being a standalone thing certainly might suggest that it has the all-clear from Valve, which wouldn't be that surprising given how chill the studio is with this kind of thing - I'll remind you of that OG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a> that came out… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-mesa-is-fully-launched-for-real">half a decade ago apparently</a>!
</p>
<p>
I'm not much of a shooty person, nor have I ever even played Counter-Strike, but I do love a good fan project like this, and judging from the comments on the trailer, fans of the original shooter seem pretty pumped about this one.

<p>EA Sports is set to pay players who appear in EA Sports College Football 26 a bit more money. According to an email sent out to NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) players (via <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6213494/2025/03/18/ea-sports-college-football-26-nil-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Athletic</a>), the company is increasing payment to $1,500 per player for their inclusion in the game.</p>



<p>That’s up from the $600 individual players received for College Football 25. </p>



<p>Players will also get a Deluxe Edition of the game, which is similar to what players from last year’s game received. Select athletes who are brand ambassadors for the game will get additional compensation.</p>



<p>The increase in player payments comes after College Football 25 became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">best-selling sports game</a> in US history, surpassing NBA 2K21. According to an EA representative, again via The Athletic, the increase was done as a way to “make sure athletes feel recognized for the success of the game.”</p>



<p>EA is expected to spend over $16 million on NIL rights for players to appear in the game before accounting for any extra payments for brand ambassadors as well as the cost of the game itself. </p>



<p>College Football 26 is expected to launch in July. After not being a part of last year’s game, it’s anticipated that real coaches will be added to the game this year after a <a href="https://x.com/bmarcello/status/1900019548520075267?s=46&amp;t=iGRZfb8A0Ak5amUsoqdLIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked cover</a> from a recent EA photoshoot made its way online. No other details about the game are currently known.</p>

A spokesperson told The Athletic that EA will double its payment to players to more than $16.5 million to help them feel recognized for the success of CFB 25.

This is a game for fans built by college fans ourselves, and we want it to be that type of relationship to understand what's important to them."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-magic-system-anime<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ll let y’all in on a little secret: I do not watch every seasonal anime. As someone who was once tasked with writing up <a href="https://kotaku.com/fall-anime-guide-2023-crunchyroll-netflix-hidive-hulu-1850871611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-ass slideshows</a> breaking down each anime, I no longer have time to watch every new show that crops up on the scene. I’m gonna die one day, so unless I come across a show that catches my eye or gets enough word-of-mouth recommendations from folks whose taste I trust, I’m not tuning in. This feeling is doubly true for new-age shonen anime.&nbsp;</p><p>Having served my time watching <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Bleach</em>, and <em>Naruto </em>when they were concurrently airing, I’ve no big desire to jump on new-age shonen like <em>Fire Force</em> and <em>Black Clover</em>, much less engage in sweaty online conversations about which shows will be the next <a href="https://otaku.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Three" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shonen big three</a>. While I’m of the mind that there will <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shonen-jump-big-three-future-2000501015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never be another shonen big three</a>, I’ve tapped on the enclosure of anime fans ramping up their debates over which series to christen as the forerunner of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industry’s best and brightest</a> as heavy hitters like <a href="https://aftermath.site/jujutsu-kaisen-magneto-xavier-gojo-geto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></a>,<em> My Hero Academia</em>, and <em>Demon Slayer</em> near their end.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Babe Ruth signaling a home run, Crunchyroll has given full-throated confidence points that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-anime-trailer-crunchyroll-release-date-2000575939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a> will be that series when it premieres in July. Having peeked at the manga before the release of its official trailer on multiple recommendations from friends, I think it will live up to that lofty claim of the merit of its magic system alone.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UkmWacjR7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before I recount <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s logline, I wanna give an anecdote that’ll tie into its unique magic system and why I think it’s got the juice to be shonen anime’s next big thing. Most of the cool-looking furniture in my apartment came from spontaneous dumpster dives and pawn shop finds. Key among my finds is a perfectly good <a href="https://business.walmart.com/ip/Kings-Brand-Furniture-Kitchen-Island-Storage-Cabinet-with-Marble-Finish-Top-White/3927260608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kitchen island with a marble top</a>, a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/BICIK-63-7-in-Black-Dimmable-Column-Floor-Lamp-with-Display-Shelves-Remote-Control-1-USB-and-1-Type-C-Ports-1-Power-Outlet-H-CJD04-US-MB/330426954?source=shoppingads&amp;locale=en-US&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqQ4vtFw0bLM_fmfCIGM-2X3ak4DLvkqAyCILzuUbxmwSYbQZvhkqA&amp;gQT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">column paper lantern floor lamp with built-in outlets and USB ports</a>, and a <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/support/product/lg-42LD520.AUS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">42” Logitech TV</a> that I found in the alley behind my current apartment with a sticky note saying it still worked. Whether they were thrown away during a move that couldn’t consolidate space or no longer matched their previous owners' ethos, they’ve come into my possession as pretty nifty mainstays in my apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>So imagine my surprise when my partner told me we should get rid of the dingy TV we swapped out of our bedroom for the better back alley Logitech one we’ve got. Sure, she’s got a point that owning three TVs is a bit much. Plus, since swapping it out in the bedroom, it's been politely sitting by our recycling bin as a reminder that it's overstayed its welcome. But I couldn’t get myself to part with it. Despite that shitty RCA TV having a considerable blue pixel blemish in its lower third, it's been with me longer than any other object in my house. That TV has been with me since my first year of college. It also gave me comfort during hard times when I was fighting off homelessness, living in the basement of a friend of a friend as I used FYE paychecks to slowly pay my way from Cheyenne, Wyoming, back home to Chicago. It was the only TV I ever needed in my first studio apartment when I got into games journalism. If anything, the blue blemish in its lower third was a battle scar, noting how far it has come in its country-wide journey from City National Pawn for the low price of $105.&nbsp;</p><p>To make a long story short, I didn’t get rid of the TV. It's found a new home atop a bookshelf (which I also dumpster-dived for) in my home office with my “work PS5” (which my partner’s rich coworker just gave away because they didn’t want it anymore). Finding a new purpose for my old TV made my heart grow three sizes on some real sentimental shit.&nbsp;</p><p>That feeling is quite literally at the heart of <em>Gachiakuta</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Gachiakuta</em>, created by Kei Urana, is a dystopian action manga. Its hero, Rudo, is a social outcast who spends his days repairing and finding new purposes for trash discarded by rich people. His life is as good as it could be living off the garbage of the rich until he's framed for the murder of his uncle and thrown from a luxurious floating city into the bottomless abyss of a landfill called The Pitt. His ultimate goal is to return to the floating city and exact revenge on the people who threw him away like trash. The only obstacles in his path are Pitt's toxic air, wasteland raiders, and giant kaiju constructed from living piles of junk. While the manga is poised to depict a generational crashout with Rudo, its magic system has me believing <em>Gachiakuta</em> might actually be the next big shonen series.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The power of friendship with inanimate objects. </figcaption></figure><p><em>Gachiakuta</em>‘s power system allows its heroes to transform sentimental objects into all-powerful weapons. These "vital instruments" can range from construction gloves to a walking cane to a dingy umbrella. While its cast of supporting characters only has one vital object, Rudo — being the main character — can turn any discarded object into a vital instrument. From the 20 chapters I've indulged in the manga ahead of its anime premiere, I've seen this ability used with the utmost emotional climax, repurposing childhood trinkets and weapons from his fallen allies. It's a simple concept, sure, but it's more intriguing than watching characters charge up and arbitrarily get stronger. Put that in the mix with the series’ worldbuilding of the rich dumping trash on the poor à la <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207027/alita-battle-angel-review-rosa-salazar-robert-rodriguez-christoph-waltz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Battle Angel Alita</em></a>, and you’ve got pretty interesting new-age shonen on your hands.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Gachiakuta </em>tapped into a part of my brain that few new-age shonen manga have since <em>Chainsaw Man</em> hit the scene with its demons powered by the fear of concepts like death and falling. It also doesn’t hurt that the series is being adapted by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2024-10-02/studio-bones-spins-off-production-department-as-new-company-bones-film/.216251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bones Film</a>, the spin-off production company behind hit anime like <em>My Hero Academia,</em> <em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</em>, and <em>Mob Psycho 100. </em>I’ll be watching to see if the series lives up to the hype on my RCA TV.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions"><h3>Two Point Museum: It’s Great</h3></a><p>No tombs were raided in the making of this video game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/monster-hunter-movie"><h3>That Live Action Monster Hunter Movie Kinda Rips</h3></a><p>Who would’ve thought Paul W.S.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest supersized title from Ubisoft in the flagship franchise. It’s enormous, like previous games, but just how big is the central map for this all-new title? Like the games that have been released since 2017, Assassin’s Creed Shadows boasts an enormous open-world environment for players to explore, and it can get pretty daunting.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in and determine how big the map is in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-map-size">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Map Size</h2>



<p>The map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is massive and split up into nine core regions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wakasa</li>



<li>Omi</li>



<li>Tamba</li>



<li>Yamashiro</li>



<li>Iga</li>



<li>Harima</li>



<li>Settsu</li>



<li>Yamato</li>



<li>Kii</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s one of the biggest maps released in the series thus far, and traversing it is often a chore because of mountainous terrain that can’t be overcome on foot. While you have a horse, Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t have a ‘path follow’ mechanic, which means you’re forced to make manual journeys quite often.</p>



<p>Additionally, the team at Ubisoft has advised that players use an immersive mode that removes map indicators and marked pathways, which means you’re relying on instincts and discovery to locate your objectives in this vast open world.</p>



<p>I’d say that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is just as big as – if not slightly bigger than – the core map in 2020’s Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-navigate-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">How to Navigate in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>The best way to navigate the massive map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is simply to explore. By using synchronisation viewpoints, you can get your bearings relatively easily, and you can use map markers to keep track of key locations you want to visit.</p>



<p>If you’re really stuck for navigation, you can employ Scouts that go out and determine the specific location of objectives for you. Alternatively, you can just use the guided mode to have map markers revealed in full, which makes the game a walk in the park.</p>



<p>It’s advised to stay out of the dense forests and mountainous regions of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows map, as moving through them can be laborious and, at times, impossible. You can’t climb every surface in this game as you could in previous titles.</p>



<p>It’s guaranteed to take you a <strong>very long time </strong>to uncover everything the Assassin’s Creed Shadows map has to offer, and there’s plenty of side content up for grabs. Be prepared to spend many hours exploring the beautiful environments found in this game.</p>
