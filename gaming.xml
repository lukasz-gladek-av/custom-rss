            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman</a> was Ubisoft’s first major commercial success, the company going public a year after its release in 1996. A PlayStation launch title, it was originally conceived for the unreleased Super Nintendo CD-ROM before being developed for Atari’s Jaguar. A fantasy platform game that pops with oil paint colour, its stages encompass themes like the musical Band Land and sugar-laden Candy Chateau.</p>
<p>Rayman, a limbless, affable character, seeks to save the land from Mr Dark, a nefarious sorcerer. To do this, you must free six caged Electoons on each of its 17 stages set across six different worlds. As you earn new powers of combat and scenery traversal, backtracking is necessary to find cages previously out of reach. It’s a simple platform game, but one graced with charm and affection.</p>
<p>Despite the number of Rayman games and spin-offs released, this collection focuses only on the initial game. It includes the PlayStation original, the Atari Jaguar release, those for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, and the MS-DOS PC version. The Sega Saturn release isn't present. While the PlayStation and Jaguar games are largely the same, the Jaguar lacks FMV, doesn’t look or sound as good, and nerfs the ice physics - but has an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/arkanoid">Arkanoid</a>-style minigame included. Originally, it benefited from no loading times over the PlayStation, but that’s moot here.</p>
<p>While Rayman still looks good, its platform collision needs learning and its impressive animation means it takes a couple of seconds to duck and perform other actions. There are also many leaps of faith involved. The Game Boy Color version is the only other game in the collection that’s totally original, and is surprisingly good despite shorter stages. The Game Boy Advance version is cropped in, but like the Game Boy Color is a little cleaner to navigate thanks to fewer animation frames. For some reason, this version suffers frame-rate issues, however.</p>
<p>The MS-DOS release and its add-ons are of most interest, featuring 24 additional stages designed for expert players, 40 stages designed by fans, and another 60 levels designed by Ubisoft. Elsewhere is a single-stage 1992 prototype of the Rayman’s original Super Nintendo build. There’s almost nothing to see or do and it's over in seconds, but it’s interesting to see the game’s origin.</p>
<p>The package includes screen filters, cheats for every game, save states, and a rewind function. Like all Digital Eclipse releases, the History section is superb, charting every beat of its development and featuring over an hour of documentary footage.</p>
<p>If you’re a super fan of the original game and want every possible version of it, the package totally delivers. But considering how many Rayman games there were, including its sequels and spin-offs, it would have been nice to at least have had Rayman 2 included. The elephant in the room, however, is the absence of the original soundtracks. They have been remixed or replaced across the board with a nice composition by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rayman_origins">Rayman Origins</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_legends_definitive_edition">Legends</a> composer Christophe Héral, likely due to Ubisoft not fully owning the rights to the original audio.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Exactly two weeks ago, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-could-be-merged-with-pc-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that sources inside <strong>Microsoft</strong> pointed to an early plan to potentially add more third-party services to <strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</strong>, in a bid to make it more appealing. After the <strong>shocking price increase to</strong> <strong>$30</strong> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went live on October 1, 2025</a>, many Xbox gamers feel it isn't worth it anymore, even with the inclusion of <strong>Fortnite Crew</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft+ Classics</strong>, hence why Microsoft might be looking to add value.</p>



<p>Interestingly, a new rumor comes from WindowsCentral's Jez Corden. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ROeswcSpCiQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a YouTube livestream</a>, he mentioned Warren's report while adding that he heard Microsoft is also considering the addition of first-party services, such as the <strong>World of Warcraft</strong>, <strong>Minecraft Realms</strong>, <strong>Fallout 1st</strong>, and <strong>Elder Scrolls Online Plus</strong> subscriptions.</p>



<p><em>I think there is an opportunity to make Game Pass Ultimate worth the money. There was a report recently from Tom Warren in his newsletter on The Verge; he said something along the lines of, Microsoft's looking at ways to add even more value to Game Pass. I think making it like there are more reasons to subscribe at $30 is probably a race against time for them right now, where they're like, "We need to make this work and make people feel like it's worthwhile". </em></p>



<p><em><strong>One thing I did hear, and I don't know if this would ever happen, but one thing I did hear</strong> - this is something I get asked a lot - <strong>is they were exploring putting the World of Warcraft and some of the other subscriptions they got, like Fallout 1st, Minecraft Realms...They were exploring putting that in Game Pass Ultimate</strong>. Now, if they did that, if they put World of Warcraft, Minecraft Realms, Fallout 1st, and the Elder Scrolls [Online Plus] subscription, if they put all that into Game Pass Ultimate, then oh boy, does it become worth it then for me at $30. </em></p>



<p>Then, answering a viewer's question on the same topic, he added:</p>



<p><em>I kind of just addressed that. It does seem like they're going to eventually integrate some of the subscription into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, but we'll see if it actually happens.</em></p>



<p>Using the subscriptions of first-party companies to add value to Game Pass Ultimate seems like a smart move, although Microsoft will definitely look carefully into the economics to see if it's feasible. Almost certainly, it wouldn't be possible to bundle all those into Game Pass Ultimate without touching up the individual services. Still, here's what each of them costs and offers right now:</p>

        <p><span>This week marks <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968">30 years</a> since </span><i><span>Pokémon Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green </span></i><span>were released in Japan. What started as two monster-taming RPGs on the Game Boy three decades ago has since become a multimedia empire of video games, anime, trading cards, apps, toys, and lifestyle merchandise.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>When something is as far-reaching and multifaceted as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, the series ends up meaning something a little different to everyone. There are widely shared touchstones like the experience of catching <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30-anniversary-art-logos-every-pokedex-serebii-2000672767">your favorite monster for the first time</a>, watching the anime after school as a kid, or taking a stroll while playing </span><i><span>Pokémon Go </span></i><span>back in 2016, but everyone has their own </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>story to tell.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As we approach the 30th anniversary, I asked people across the video game industry, whether they be&nbsp; a developer, a member of the media, or a content creator, to reach out and tell me a story about how </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>affected their life for the better. I tried to give everyone as few parameters as possible so they could interpret the question in a way that was distinctly them. Here are the responses I got:</span></p> <p><i><span>These submissions have been lightly edited for clarity, length, and style.</span></i></p> <h2><em>Pokemon</em> professionals</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000672826" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672826"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672826">© Derek Heemsbergen</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s woven itself through the fabric of my life at every stage, starting with the day I opened my mailbox to find a VHS tape of A Sneak Peek at </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. It connected me to friends throughout all stages of schooling and well into adulthood. In my 20s, I was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder. I’d come home from a miserable job and lie awake in bed, my heartbeat echoing in my ears. Unable to sleep, I’d make a blanket fort in my living room and pop in a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> DVD. Peering into that bucolic world through a woolen veil, a Nintendo DS in my hand, my body would loosen at last. </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was the subject of my first conversation with the man I’d marry. His first Pokémon tattoo was Nidoking. Mine was Pikachu. And in my 30s, against titanic odds, I’d land a job at The Pokémon Company International. Working there felt like a dream some days. More often than not, it just felt like a job. But my coworkers? My coworkers were nothing short of inspirational. Decades later, the themes of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> I’d idolized as a child—camaraderie, self-betterment, community—were reflected not in fantasy, but in a handful of profoundly powerful friendships. Though I’ve since moved on and away, those relationships endure. E, D, A, S, et al.—thank you for teaching me that the real Pokémon were the friends we made along the way.” — </span><b>Derek Heemsbergen</b><span>, senior editor at Marvelous and XSEED</span></p>

 <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was probably the first thing that I ever truly obsessed over. How did I catch ’em all? Was it true that the episodes that aired in America weren’t the same as the ones in Japan? Is it THAT tough to get a holographic Charizard card? Is Pikablu real? I could carve off whole days of my life and find that they were solely devoted to </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, from crying over the “Bye Bye Butterfree” episode when the show aired on syndication at 6:00 AM to grinding my Dragonite to level 100 in my dark bedroom that night when I was supposed to be sleeping. So when I wrote my first book</span><i><span> Monster Kids: How Pokémon Taught A Generation To Catch Them All</span></i><span>, I didn’t want to just recite </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> history, but capture what it was like to exist in the midst of “Pokémania.” I’ve never experienced anything quite like it to this day.” — </span><b>Daniel Dockery</b><span>, freelance writer and author of </span><i><span>Monster Kids: How Pokémon Taught A Generation To Catch Them All</span></i></p>

 <p><span>“The first-ever article I ever wrote was for my school paper and concerned the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> TV show. From there, I caught not only the journalism bug but a lifelong desire to write about the art and stories that have meaning to me. The article was centered around disproving the conceit that adults can’t enjoy </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>—something people were still arguing back in 2010, if you can believe it! I’m now a games journalist and have been for about five years now—how time flies.” — </span><b>Cat Bussell</b><span>, former senior gaming editor at </span><i><span>VideoGamer</span></i></p> <p><span>“My love of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> originally began as an escape. As a young child, I was frequently hospitalized because of my disability. I would regularly bring my Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and eventually Game Boy Advance SP with me to play everything from </span><i><span>Silver</span></i><span> to </span><i><span>FireRed</span></i><span>. I have over 50 completions of </span><i><span>Pokémon Silver</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>SoulSilver</span></i><span> because I would just replay them every time, allowing me to forget about the daily treatments and general pains of being stuck in the hospital. Even as an adult, I frequently go back to those games when I need some form of emotional comfort. Professionally, I can thank </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> for kickstarting my career. My first ever freelance piece in 2018 explored the </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/05/pokemon-lets-go-will-be-the-first-in-the-franchise-i-cant-play"><span>inaccessibility behind the </span><i><span>Let’s Go</span></i><span> games</span></a><span>. After </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> published it, people within the accessibility space began to follow me and interact with me on socials. A year later, when I joined </span><i><span>Can I Play That</span></i><span>, I had built a reputation for exploring accessibility when it was still within its infancy, and that is directly because of my first freelance story. </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, despite its ever-present flaws, will always be my comfort series. There will never be a day where I find myself not wanting to explore each region and catch my favorites.” — </span><b>Grant Stoner</b><span>, freelance writer</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000672833" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672833"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672833">© Megan Everett</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“Some of my fondest childhood memories are playing </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> with my sister. We’re 14 months apart, and grew up playing the opposite </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games so we could then trade the game-exclusive Pokémon. She was <em>Silver</em>, I was <em>Gold</em>. She was <em>Ruby</em>, I was <em>Sapphire</em>. To this day we still bond over </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. As a Community Director, I recognize the importance of making a game feel impactful and nostalgic. Providing players with meaningful stories and adventures with characters they’ve bonded with, and offering a space to share that excitement. </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> gave me a love for gaming, and that love translates to </span><i><span>Warframe</span></i><span> and the growing community.” — </span><b>Megan Everett</b><span>, community director at Digital Extremes</span></p> <p><span>“My mom isn’t a Gamer™ in any sense (she got me </span><i><span>Pokémon Silver </span></i><span>and my first Game Boy Color when I was six and regretted it for many years thereafter when “I’m in a battle!” became a common refrain in our house), but since around 2017, she’s found IRL community and friendship through </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> with like-minded local players, including coordinating gym takedowns in her neighborhood to ensure the maximum daily coins for everyone or scheduling her day around being online at 6 a.m. to do raids in Asia and Europe. Meanwhile she has none of the terminology or cultural knowledge that gaming audiences take for granted (she followed the </span><i><span>PoGo</span></i><span> meta for years before she knew what “the meta” meant). Industry executives and leads talk a big game about wanting to bring in more players/monetize consumers from all walks of life, but most have no idea how or where to engage with people who aren’t already in gaming spheres (even for mobile gaming!). My mom’s </span><i><span>PoGo</span></i><span> journey has informed so much of my approach to reaching the elusive “non-gamer” audience, especially re: onboarding and retention. It’s also put my career into perspective for my mom for the first time, now that she has a basis of understanding for things like player safety and influencer management. Honestly, as silly as it can get sometimes (she’s stopped random strangers holding their phones on the street to ask them if they’re playing </span><i><span>PoGo</span></i><span>), my sisters and I are relieved that she’s doing this instead of getting radicalized in some internet cesspool. I stopped following the franchise around </span><i><span>Sun and Moon</span></i><span>, but watching my mom have the time of her life in her own Trainer era has been great for my inner kid. And a little bit vindicating.” — </span><b>Livvy Hall</b><span>, community director, formerly Xbox Publishing</span></p> <p><span>“I would’ve beaten </span><i><span>Pokémon Emerald</span></i><span> around the time that I was 8 years old. And while I’d watched plenty of TV shows and movies, and developed a voracious appetite for reading in class, it always feels like the first adventure I embarked on. The first story I told myself. It’s definitely the first game I have ever beaten. The morning I finished </span><i><span>Pokémon Emerald</span></i><span> was a warm summer Saturday like any other, except I’d unknowingly tackled the game’s final mainline challenge: the Elite Four and their champion, Wallace.&nbsp; It was the greatest test of skill I’d ever been faced with in my relatively short life, and about halfway through my game-winning run against Wallace, my Game Boy blinked, signaling it would imminently die. I jumped out of my bed and moved faster than I’ve ever moved to lock my charger into place just outside my room and plug my device in. I’d salvaged things and continued my grueling slugfest with Hoenn’s champion until I, at last, came out on top.&nbsp; I’d never been the best at anything. I never won first place in my karate tournaments. Despite my efforts, I didn’t win that spelling bee I was coerced into competing in. I wasn’t even the best at whatever card games we played at lunch. But that Saturday morning, I was the better Pokémon trainer. I bested Hoenn’s elite and solidified myself among their upper echelon. I remember my body trembling as I sat slumped against the wall and let the realization set in. I felt invincible. Higher than the clouds in the sky. And though that feeling has dulled on subsequent adventures, victories, and completions, I have never been able to shake that first brush with accomplishment in the face of what seemed to me like impossible odds. I’m grateful for it all these years later and reckon I will be for the rest of my life.” — </span><b>Moises Taveras</b><span>, freelance writer</span></p>

 <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> as a franchise has had a monumental effect on my life. On a personal level, it played a pivotal role in my relationship with my lifelong best friend. As we grew up, both enthralled in everything </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> had to offer, we made sure to buy different versions of the game, helping each other complete the Pokédex, while at the same time forging our bond to one another and the franchise with each passing generation. That aspect of what </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> means to me cannot be understated. Whether it’s a renewed interest, my autism, or a weird millennial version of a midlife crisis, I started a personal project early last year to watch every episode of the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> anime in chronological order, including the films. It’s all been cataloged on a personal Google Sheet document, and it’s been fun to tackle it at my own pace. I’m coming up on 800 episodes as I finish the final season of Black &amp; White and head into the X &amp; Y era of the show.” —&nbsp;</span><b>Jerrad Wyche</b><span>, host of </span><i><span>Controlled Interests Gamecast</span></i></p> <p><span>“In The Before Times, pre-1998, my gaming mostly consisted of </span><i><span>World Series Baseball </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: The Movie </span></i><span>on Game Gear. Then, for Christmas in 1998, my brother and I each received a Game Boy Pocket and one of the two versions of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>—I got </span><i><span>Red</span></i><span>, he got </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>. We didn’t know about the games beforehand, so shoutout to my parents for figuring out that this was the hot gift because we were immediately obsessed. The fun part of this story comes from the fact that this was the first RPG I had ever played, and I really had no concept of how games like this worked—including RPG things like leveling up a party, choosing what skills to use…and an underrated little mechanic known as “saving the game.” So over the course of Christmas break, I played up to Pewter City or sometimes Mount Moon dozens of times, turned the Game Boy off when it was time to stop, and started a new game the next time I had a chance to play. This is probably also when we discovered the bottomless well of comedy that is naming your rival “Butt” through all the new games we started. It wasn’t until I got to school on the first day after break and saw that my friends were in parts of the game I’d never seen, with Pokémon levels in the 30’s, that I wondered how they were able to play so long without their parents making them stop or the batteries running out. They kindly pointed me to the big option in the menu that said “SAVE,” and the rest was history. Video games became my favorite hobby, and that love for gaming has endured to this day and directly led to me spending hours per week getting into the nitty-gritty of the games we play on my podcast. It all really started with </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>!” — </span><b>Dave Jackson</b><span>, host of </span><i><span>Tales from the Backlog</span></i></p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon</em> helped bridge the gap between them and others</h2> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon GO</span></i><span> launched the day before I found out my father died. I got the call while I was out hunting mons. He passed after an intense struggle with mental illness that left him agoraphobic and estranged from our family. I’m still unsure if his end didn’t do more good than bad. That summer, </span><i><span>PoGO</span></i><span> saved me. I could see the strains of brainsick that devastated his life within myself. But the antidote to that is sunlight and connection: the things that </span><i><span>GO</span></i><span> brought me in spades that summer.” — </span><b>Dan Manning</b><span>, producer at Whisper Forge</span></p> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> helped bridge the gap in my relationships with my family and other people. My family had this anti-gaming mindset as they prioritized education. However, when it came to </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, they welcomed it with open arms, to the point where they’d get me the new console and game for Christmas. It also helped me bond with my cousins as they introduced me to the franchise. This also expands to the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> TCG. My mum would find time after work or during weekly shopping trips to buy me </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> cards when I was a kid. Back then, I didn’t know how the game worked, so I just kept them for collecting purposes and made up my own rules with my brother. But I also lived in the Philippines, so there was a high chance that the cards were fake. But I didn’t care cuz I love </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. In 2018, my family revealed that we had a family connection working at Pokémon International in Seattle, so I got to visit the HQ, hug the giant Pikachu at reception, and see where the magic happened. It was great. If it wasn’t for </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, I wouldn’t be exposed to video games growing up due to my family’s strict nature, and I think the franchise somewhat inspired me to pursue entertainment and gaming journalism as it ignited my passion for the hobby and entertainment in general.” — </span><b>Erielle Sudario</b><span>, writer and podcast editor for Checkpoint Gaming</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000672836" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672836"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672836">© Grace Klich</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“I can’t say I have any one story on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>; </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> has just always been a staple in my life. I grew up in the peak of the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> hype of the late 90s/early 2000s–I remember playing </span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow </span></i><span>on the Game Boy I got for my birthday and not being able to get past the first rock-type gym using my electric-type Pikachu (I still stand by my belief that</span><i><span> Pokémon</span></i><span> is a pretty difficult game for kids lol). I remember my mom taking me to Books-A-Million to buy booster packs. I still remember how excited I was to pull a holographic Raichu from a Fossil pack; Raichu was my absolute favorite. By high school the nostalgia of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> made me want to seriously start collecting. Now, having been a serious collector since 2010, I have one of the most-well known vintage </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> collections online for my extremely curated items. I have been helping other collectors with my knowledge of items as well as sharing the archival work I have done for the community over the years.

 <p><span>While I have scaled back in collecting and in my community interactions due to the current demand of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, I will always love and cherish such a wonderful franchise that has been a part of me for my entire life.

Raichu serendipitously shares its number with my birth date and its generation number with my birth month! 1/26? Gen 1, #0026! Cinderace is the other absolute fav that ended up shaping my online brand with “Hopscorch” originating directly from what I nicknamed my first Scorbunny for the generation that helped me socially the most!” — </span><b>Hopscorch</b><span>, game developer</span></p> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> is the first in the many dominoes that led to my overall love of video games. I was very close with my cousins growing up, and </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> is a major reason why. When we were kids growing up in The Netherlands, We were so obsessed with the show that all of our parents pooled some money and got us a booster box of the Jungle expansion of the trading card game. We had no idea how to play, but we loved looking at the cards and trading them between each other. I still have some of those cards today.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>During the second generation of the games, Lays did a campaign where bags of chips would include Pogs (though we called them Flippos) with lenticular pictures of Pokémon that would move or evolve as you moved them. I’ve held on to our collection for decades now, because I cherish those memories of gathering around a bag of chips and being more excited by the Flippo than the chips themselves. While I didn’t own one of the games until </span><i><span>Pokémon Sapphire</span></i><span>, I would frequently watch my cousins and friends play, fascinated by the strange creatures and attack animations. At least one of my cousins credits the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games with helping him learn English at a very young age.</span></p>

 <p><span>That fascination led to wanting to play more games in general. My first proper game was </span><i><span>Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds</span></i><span> on PC, but I could never get </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> out of my head. In 2002, I would save up my allowance and do odd jobs and chores to save up to buy my very own GBA with </span><i><span>Pokémon Sapphire</span></i><span>. It would only continue blossoming from there. As I got older, I would become interested in games as a business and as an art form. I would read reviews and criticism and frequent gaming forums to learn more about them. When I got to university I started blogging about them in the community section of the </span><i><span>Screwattack </span></i><span>website. I made friends there that I still know to this day. I became a freelance games critic in 2021, and in 2023 I took over hosting a Nintendo-focused podcast named </span><i><span>N-Focus</span></i><span>. All this came from </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that I would be a fundamentally different person without it.” — </span><b>Hylke Langhout</b><span>, host at N-Focus</span></p> <p><span>“I’ve always used my immigrant mother’s pop culture awareness to gauge if something is really, really popular. For example, the fact that she knows who Princess Diana and Michael Jackson are means that they are some of the most famous figures in history. Also right up there on that list is a yellow mouse creature named Pikachu.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Like many people growing up in the late 90s and early 2000s, my first exposure to </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was through the trifecta of their video games, trading cards, and anime. It felt like it was everywhere. However, with the increasing costs of getting new consoles, handhelds, and games and the rise of free online Flash games, I stopped keeping up with the franchise after Generation III. Everything past that generation felt so foreign to me and I began to fall into the mentality of “</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> stopped being good after the generation that I stopped playing.” Outside of my short stint during the </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> Summer of 2016 where we almost achieved world peace, I never really thought much about the franchise afterwards. However, one random mobile app would eventually change that: </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In 2019 during my first year as a high school science teacher, I began using an ordinary sleep tracking app so I could develop better sleeping habits. I loved how it would specifically wake me up when I was in a light sleep stage so that I would feel less groggy in the mornings. Coincidentally during that same year, the CEO of the Pokémon Company announced a sleep tracking mobile app called </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span>. While many people online were commenting on the ridiculousness of it, I was excited by this news! You mean to tell me I could continue tracking my sleep, except now I can have the fun of catching Pokémon?! The next few years after that, there was an unfortunate radio silence about the game’s release. I thought it might have been cancelled but that didn’t stop me from checking online every now and then for any updates.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>My dedication was finally rewarded in Summer 2023 when it was finally available for download on the app store. At the time, I thought it would be a nice, little casual game experience for me. However, it soon became my game of the year for 2023 and my favorite game overall. While </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span> is still a sleep tracker at night, by day it’s like Tamogotchi and your Pokémon team finds food for Snorlax so it can grow bigger and stronger which will help attract more Pokémon for you to catch. As I got more into the game and started joining the </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep </span></i><span>subreddits and Discord servers, I was surprised by how complex the mechanics could be for a sleep tracker game. There’s whole communities dedicated to helping you learn what optimal stats and nature each Pokémon should have and they’ve even made tons of infographics, spreadsheets, and websites for all different types of game calculations.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Through </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span> and its community, I became interested in the franchise again and can confirm that it does stay good after Generation III! Because of </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span>, I’ve been getting into other </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games now and I even incorporate Pokémon-based lessons into my classroom. I love this game so much that my students say that I’m obsessed with it; one of them even drew me sleeping next to Snorlax in </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span> as a gift! Oh and yes, I did develop better sleep habits because of the game.” — </span><b>Mashfiq Ahmed</b><span>, teacher and Minecraft Club lead at John Dewey High School</span></p> <p>“I definitively missed the <em>Pokémon</em> craze.</p> <p>By the time <em>Red</em> and <em>Blue</em> landed in the US, I was 15, and seeing as how the first time I ever heard of <i><span>Pokémon</span></i> was when the news warned us all about a Japanese cartoon giving children seizures, <em>Pokémon</em> was clearly a kids thing. I paid it no attention as I focused on adult things like high school, the WWF Attitude Era, and my N64.</p> <p>Over my nearly 20 years of covering video games professionally, I’ve tried my best to get into <i><span>Pokémon</span></i>, but it never took. I roamed SF in 2016 for <em>Pokémon Go</em>, I beat <em>Let’s Go Eevee</em>, and I tinkered with <em>Sword</em>/<em>Shield</em> and <em>Scarlet</em>/<em>Violet</em>.

One morning, my wife put on the show she grew up with—<em>Pokémon</em>. Both Ben and I were engrossed.</p> <p>It was suddenly clear to me that I had played every game without reading the source material. From the jump, the show gave so much context to what was happening in this strange world where trainers capture pocket monsters that I couldn’t help but want to go back.</p> <p>I started a new <em>Violet</em> save that night, and I never looked back.</p> <p>Since then, Ben and I have beaten <em>Violet</em> and its DLC, gone back to <em>Arceus</em>, restarted <em>Shield</em>, recommitted to <em>Go</em>, reviewed <em>Z-A</em> for <em>Kinda Funny Games</em>, and even traveled to Pokémon Worlds.

I loved the show, the movies, collected all the cards—though foolishly I sold my collection of the first four sets before I went to college—and kept playing throughout the years. Some of my fondest memories were the sleepovers I had with two close friends where we did battle royales over </span><i><span>Red &amp; Blue, Yellow</span></i><span>, and then </span><i><span>Gold &amp; Silver</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Crystal</span></i><span> (my favorite).

Over the years I missed several releases, so especially as a completionist, it’s very satisfying to be able to say that I’ve played all the core games. Not to mention how great it is to engage with the broader <em>Pokémon</em> community (who even if they don’t share my affinity for my favorite Pokémon, Mewtwo and Octillery, do enjoy the tattoos I have of them).” — </span><b>Josh Fjelstad</b><span>, co-host of </span><i><span>EXP. Share</span></i></p> <h2>Forming community through&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em></h2> <p><span>“As a Day 1 </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> fan who vividly remembers trading base set cards on the playground and transferring my team from </span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow</span></i><span> into </span><i><span>Pokémon Stadium</span></i><span> to be able to play in glorious 3D, to say the series has had an impact on my life would be a massive understatement. Today, I’m a full time content creator who plays </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games for a living, and while I’ve been fortunate enough to witness the hype cycle of each new generation in real time with my audience, my </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> fandom roots definitely started with the card game. The year is 1999 and the hype for the then-upcoming Fossil set is reaching a fever pitch: my local community college is hosting an official all-ages tournament for the first time and the top prize is a pre-release holographic Aerodactyl from the new set.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As a fresh-faced nine year old with no prior competitive TCG experience, I naively begged my Dad to take me to compete and he happily obliged. With hope in my heart and my “Rain Dance” deck in hand (a water deck centered on the strong base set Blastoise card with the Rain Dance ability), I walked up to the check-in area and was immediately taken aback by all of the adults and teenagers that were prepared and ready to beat me down. At this time, the meta of the card game was new and shifting but a quick damage, easy-to-put-together deck called “Haymaker” was all the rage and this tournament was my first time ever seeing it in action. For the first round, I’m matched up against a 20-something with a “Haymaker” deck and I manage to win by the skin of my teeth. The next round begins, and I’m matched against ANOTHER fully-grown adult with, you guessed it, a variation of “Haymaker.” Once again, I managed to win and after about six more rounds of competitors with “Haymaker” decks, I’m starting to think that victory is within my grasp.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000672837" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672837"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672837">© Roger Diluigi</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As I enter the finals, I’m prepared to take down one more adult “Haymaker” user but I’m surprised to find that my opponent is a 30-something dad, similar in age to me today, competing for his son with what appears to be the “Rain Maker” deck that I managed to make it all the way here with. At this point, it’s important to note that my favorite Pokémon of all time is Lickitung and the Jungle expansion that released just prior to this tournament introduced a powerful, easy-to-use colorless Lickitung card that can do 10 damage and paralyze opponents with just a single energy and a coin flip. The card was common and widely seen as useful, but people hadn’t fully figured out how to use it to compliment their tried-and-true decks yet and this tournament was hardly the place that people were willing to experiment.</span></p> <p><span>As the final match started, my opponent and I played nearly identically and were slowly building up our “Rain Dance” Blastoises but I had a hidden weapon: LICKITUNG. For this final match, I opted to build up the Blastoise on my bench and instead use Lickitung to paralyze my opponent and keep them from doing anything. After 8 turns in a row of successful coin flips and PlusPower-boosted Tongue Wrap attacks, I managed to take down my opponent’s Blastoise and victory was mine. I have my original “Rain Dance” deck and Pre-Release Holographic Aerodactyl to this day, and Lickitung is still my favorite Pokémon!” — </span><b>Roger “RogersBase” DiLuigi</b><span>, content creator</span></p> <p><span>“One of the most interesting things about </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> after 30 years is learning someone’s favorite Pokémon. If you grew up with </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Blue</span></i><span>, your favorite could easily be Charizard or Gengar because that’s what you connected with when you first experienced the franchise. Whenever I meet someone my age, I’m never surprised if they pick a Kanto Pokémon as their favorite.</span></p>

 <p><span>1,000+ Pokémon later, there is something special about a newer Pokémon winning over a long-time fan. The question is: if someone loved Bulbasaur for 30 years, for example, could a newer Pokémon eventually become their new favorite? A couple of years ago, I was in Japan for a </span><i><span>Pokémon GO </span></i><span>event taking place in Sendai. I knew that if I played more aggressively than normal, I would finally hit the level cap of 50 that weekend. This was a big accomplishment I wanted to celebrate, so I livestreamed it. As I prepared to catch the last Pokémon I needed to reach my goal, something unexpected happened. An egg attached instead, and a Pawmi gave me the final XP push into level 50.</span></p> <p><span>When Pawmi was first revealed in</span><i><span> Pokémon Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pokémon Violet</span></i><span>, I didn’t think too much of it. But now, after grinding to reach level 50, I will always remember that Pawmi was the Pokémon to complete that journey with me. It might sound silly, but that day, Pawmi cemented a top spot as one of my favorite Pokémon. These moments of connection, of creating memories, with </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>—both new and old—can tell so much about a person. People’s favorites always reveal the most interesting stories.” — </span><b>Steve Sarumi</b><span>, host of </span><i><span>It’s Super Effective</span></i></p> <p><span>“I think it’s a common perspective among Americans to see </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> as this inevitable thing, that it would undoubtedly take over the world, because it came to the States prepackaged and ready to dominate after already doing so in Japan. But the original games were far from a sure thing. They were broken; low on funding; built by a small, troubled team for a console that was considered on the outs. But there were clearly some ingredients in the mix that captured the world’s attention. I’m always inspired to learn that something I love and aspire to was built under constraints that feel familiar to me.</span></p> <p><span>As a musician, I see the music of the first games as a microcosm of that narrative. Composer Junichi Masuda had four channels that could each play one note at a time—three for notes, one for white noise rhythmic sounds or textures—and he wrote a large suite of themes that people continue to adore and seek out today. And what’s truly great about that is, like the games themselves, the music has its flaws. The original </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Green</span></i><span> OST is an impressive body of lovely, diverse themes written with baroque-style polyphony, and composers wanting to learn how to fulfill all the musical needs of an RPG would be hard-pressed to find better examples than that soundtrack. But it’s far from perfect—which makes it all the more inspiring. It’s a scrappy yet clearly ingenious collection of work that has fueled the imaginations of music lovers and creators for decades. It’s something that seems miraculous on a first listen, then, upon closer inspection, shows its rough edges in a way that makes you think, ‘Maybe I can do that.’” — </span><b>Joe Palmer-DeClara</b><span>, composer and sound designer</span></p>

 <p><span>I was 10 years old when Pokémania hit. It felt like overnight I was issued a pack of trading cards, a new cartoon to watch, and a Game Boy with a red cartridge to rival my brother’s blue one. Adventuring through the world of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> while being steeped in gloriously green pixels unlocked a new part of my imagination, and I’ve since channeled that core experience into my career as a full-time pixel artist and game developer. As the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> franchise celebrates its 30-year anniversary (which also means I must be in my final evolution from that 10-year-old starter kid), there are two things I continue to hold true: (1) I adore that chunky little pixel world; and (2) I will, on occasion, use my frying pan as a “drying” pan. — </span><b>Brandon James Greer</b><span>, YouTuber, creative director at Nano Park Studios</span></p> <h2>Coming back to&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>later in life</h2> <p><span>“I think my story follows a common beginning that a lot of older </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> fans can relate to, but then takes an unusual turn. I’m 34, and </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon </span></i><span>will be celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. That is to say, I was the exact demographic that </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> was marketed to when it was first released. I was gifted a Game Boy and </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon Yellow</span></i><span> in elementary school, bought and traded the cards with my friends–treasuring my shiny Charizard and Blastoise– and looked forward to whatever mischief Ash, Misty, and Brock would get up to in the next </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon </span></i><span>episode.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But as I got older and my interests turned elsewhere, I slowly and then entirely fell away from </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span>.

Almost like a tradition that we were creating, my husband and I gifted her the newest </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> games, bought her the trading cards, plushies, and a multitude of other merch (there’s so much now!), and sat down to watch the show with her. In the last year specifically, as I watched her enjoy </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> arguably more than I ever did, I began to regain and cultivate a newfound appreciation for the series. Eventually we started playing</span><i><span> Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon GO</span></i><span> as a family, going to our local conventions and community events, and my eyes turned toward the newest </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> game,</span><i><span> Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000672830" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672830"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672830">© Jahara Jayde</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Where I think the twist begins is here, and it honestly feels like so many things fell into place at once!

I didn’t know anything about her, but she was depicted as this stunning dark-skinned black woman in the prettiest lilac lace dress, and I immediately decided I wanted to cosplay her. And once I began researching into her design, I also gained the desire to try out the new game. I’d long felt that I was no longer the target audience for </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span>, but Jacinthe fully changed my mind. So I did both. I crafted her cosplay from scratch and I posted videos and pictures of it online. They blew up. I started streaming </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> and posting clips of my gameplay online. People came to watch. I hadn’t had an audience for </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon </span></i><span>before, but both my streaming channels and all my socials started gaining fans rapidly, with people telling me how refreshing it was to see such a “new” and “positive” perspective from someone who still held nostalgia for the series, but hadn’t interacted with it directly since Gen 1 &amp; 2. People told me it was just FUN watching ME have so much FUN and whimsy for the game, and that I was bringing a sort of joy to the community that fans my own age said they felt they’d lost a little.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The response has been immense, and the community has been so welcoming.

Somehow, in all of that, I started making content about gaming, but I was still so drawn to showcasing </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. With shutdowns happening, I could no longer actively participate in my work overseas as an archaeologist excavating the ancient site I had been contributing to for several years, but my years of academic and practical experience were really what prepared me to start finding a way to make unique content specifically about </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. I began a series talking about how real-world archaeology/history and</span><i><span> Pokémon</span></i><span> intersect and it was my first moment of ‘success’ in content.</span></p> <p><span>I’ve been making content now for five years and I’ve gotten the opportunity to bring worlds that I love together in such a unique way while sharing the experience with other people who love </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>and even these other topics just as much as I do. I’ve gotten the chance to be invited to events and opportunities by Pokémon and Nintendo and I’ve met so many amazing people as I continue to make this my full time job. </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> is a beautiful franchise full of amazing and complex worldbuilding, experiences, characters and designs and I’m so glad that I get to catalogue my own experience with it every day while also helping others learn a little something more about things like history when they join me for the journey.” — </span><b>Mallory “archaeomal” Ray</b><span>, content creator, archaeologist, and historian</span></p> <p><span>“While </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has had a huge impact on my life and content creation in a multitude of ways, I think my strongest association with the franchise is linked to how it defines community and friendship for me. When I first got my copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow </span></i><span>(which I still have), I would just sit in the living room of my childhood home with a few other friends and just quietly hang out while playing together for hours on end.&nbsp; A tradition that came back around playing </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> in a Discord call with close friends as they traded Pokémon with me to help me complete the Pokédex so I could see the true ending of the game. Some of my fondest gaming memories are tied to my 30 years with this franchise and I look forward to making more every time there is a new game to play. “ — </span><b>Matt Storm</b><span>, co-host of “</span><i><span>Fun” &amp; Games Podcast</span></i></p> <p><span>“So true story, my wife and I played </span><i><span>Red</span></i><span> &amp; </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span> in college before we were even married.

I even read some books that were simple novelizations of some of the earlier episodes. One time when I was 4 or 5 I was talking to my mom about my ‘it-em-finder,’ mispronouncing ‘item’ in a way that totally confused her. I spelled it out and she helped me with the correct pronunciation so it’s safe to say I learned to read by playing and watching </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. There was an episode of the old show where it was only </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> talking to one another, but it had English subtitles. Apparently I would always read the subtitles out loud when that episode was on! Needless to say, </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was definitely part of my formative years!” — </span><b>Andrew Wilkening</b><span>, software engineer at Stern Pinball</span></p> <p><span>“My relationship with the franchise is like many millennials’ relationship with it, I imagine. Obsessed with it as a kid (I was exposed to </span><i><span>Red</span></i><span>/</span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span> via friends but </span><i><span>Yellow</span></i><span> was my first game; I got it and the special Pikachu/Togepi/Jigglypuff Game Boy Color for my ninth birthday—selling that Game Boy to a fellow enthusiast a couple years later remains one of my biggest regrets ever) and continue to be infected with it as a 35-year-old adult with a mortgage, wife and 2-year-old son who, literally this morning, picked out a Gengar T-shirt to wear on his own.</span></p> <p><span>One of the most vivid memories I have is from when I was 14. I’d saved some cash to buy </span><i><span>Emerald</span></i><span>, for which I was insanely excited. Up until the Switch games, </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span> was the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game I’d spent the most hours playing; clocked close to 300 in it. (Gen 3 rules.) I went to Walmart with my dad—an unsavory guy who, to this day, is still frequently in and out of jail for various offenses, usually drug related—and insisted on buying the game that day despite him urging me to use the money, my money, on anything else.</span></p> <p><span>I started tearing open the packaging as soon as we returned to his beat-up truck, waxing poetic about how cool it was gonna be. He looks at me and says, ‘When are you gonna grow out of this shit?’ and started going on again about how much of a waste of money it was. In that moment, I was fighting harder to hold back tears than I ever would fight in the Battle Frontier.</span></p> <p><span>It wasn’t the first or last time my dad would say or do something that hurt or deeply embedded itself into me, but I think about it the most because it’s the one that I think defines our relationship (or rather, lack thereof).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I wasn’t equipped at 14 to understand his point of view and why he might be acting so belligerently to his son about something he enjoyed, and I can’t say at 35 that I know why he was doing it. He could’ve been high as a kite, for all I know, and not even known how he was acting (this, sadly, is probably the most accurate take). But we never shared a single interest while I was growing up, in part because I don’t know that my dad, by the time I could really know who he was, had any interests outside of survival. In my youth he was a coal-truck driver and a mechanic, and most of his “hobbies” revolved around his labor related to those things. Other things that thrilled him—gambling, drinking beer—were things that wouldn’t captivate me nearly as much, and not for a very long time, obviously.</span></p> <p><span>I never grew out of what he called ‘shit.’ So much of what I loved as a 9-year-old kid and a 14-year-old teenager are the same things I love as a 35-year-old man. I love and think about them differently, but the thought of not having a relationship with </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Power Rangers</span></i><span> or comic books or any number of things my dad had zero interest in hearing me talk about is unfathomable.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And it’s unfathomable for me to think I would ever treat my own son’s interests like my dad treated mine. I have little doubt that our little guy will have a fondness for so many things that I don’t understand and perhaps detest, but I’m so fucking excited to help him explore whatever his passions are. I want him to know that, no matter what he’s into, as long as it isn’t hurting other people then it’s valid and something worth spending time with and (responsibly) spending money on.” — </span><b>Joshua Moore</b><span>,&nbsp; journalist</span></p> <h2><em>Pokémon</em> was a first step for some into their fields</h2> <p><span>“I owe my thanks to </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> for playing a big role in my childhood, but it has also influenced my adult life, and even helped kickstart my career.

Then in 2021, when I was out of art school and looking for a job in animation, a storyboard artist on the Disney TV Animation series </span><i><span>Big City Greens </span></i><span>asked me if I’d be interested in working on her show. She was being promoted to director at the time, which means there was now an open storyboard artist position.

It’s definitely one of the highlights of my career, and I’m forever grateful to the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> series for inspiring me to pursue my goals by doing what I love.” — </span><b>Gabi Rodea</b><span>, storyboard artist at Disney</span></p> <p><span>“I grew up in a home that was unsafe. Day to day you never knew what kind of mood our parents would be in. Would there be screaming echoing off the walls? Would the sound of slammed doors reverberate through my chest? Would I have a fist in my face threatening physical harm if I didn’t shut my mouth? This was what I experienced all the time from the time I was 8 until I was finally able to set out on my own at 18. While it was difficult to wake up unsure of what each day may bring, there was one form of comfort that remained constant. That was what </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>was for me.</span></p> <p><span>I received my first Game Boy Color (the see-through purple model which remains the best to this day) when I was 6 years old with a copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon Blue</span></i><span>. I remember first being presented with a question that would help define the remainder of my life. Which Pokémon do you choose? I went with Charmander for my first playthrough; however, I would ultimately settle on Bulbasaur being my favorite starter. As I continued to explore the world of Kanto, I found comfort in the variety of ‘mons I could find and how I could maximize my team to become the very best like no one ever was.</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> made the days bearable. Whenever life at home would pick up and become hostile, I would be able to escape under the covers with my Game Boy light and hang out with my Pokémon and take out the villains of Team Rocket. It showed me that there was good in the world. Up until now, I had assumed that everyone was dealing with what I was going through within the walls of my home. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>showed me that I could be a kid that took down those that were harming others, and I could do so partnered with my Pokémon team.</span></p> <p><span>This trend would continue as I grew up. I would save up as much money as I could to get </span><i><span>Pokémon Gold</span></i><span> when it launched. I was excited to explore a new region and find even more Pokémon that existed. I found myself continuing to play throughout the night due to the fear I experienced of being awoken by plates breaking or adults shouting. I ended up finding out there was a Pokémon that I could evolve at night time to get a special evolution. This Pokémon was Umbreon. Umbreon became my favorite Pokémon of the generation. I believed that with Umbreon by my side, I could defend myself from anything that happened to come my way once the sun set.</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> has always provided a sense of comfort. I am 34 now and whenever times get tough, I’ll open the latest </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game and get lost in the safe space I’ve been able to make for myself. I even celebrate the nights of protection and comfort that </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> provided me by hosting </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> Sleepovers on Twitch whenever a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>drops, where anyone can join to play along with the new game, catch new Pokémon, and have a space to safely escape throughout the night.</span></p> <p><span>I never see myself slowing down with</span><i><span> Pokémon</span></i><span>. In fact, I share my passion for it with “the youth” in my life any chance I get.

Courtney (or GlitchxCity online) planned a whole day where we went shopping. I got a new outfit together, and wore said outfit during our tour of the Tokyo Tower.

And after I completed the research in </span><i><span>Pokémon GO</span></i><span> we took a photo, which quickly turned to Courtney going down on one knee!

I would watch episodes of the anime on VHS on the little CRT I had in my closet growing up. Late at night, I had to sit about a foot from the screen so I could plug my headphones in and watch when I was most definitely supposed to be sleeping. My parents were super fond of the idea of me playing the games, though. On one miraculous morning in 2000, my mother decided to take my sister and I to Toys R Us. To this day I don’t know what came over her, but she bought us a Funtastic Fire Orange Nintendo 64 with copies of </span><i><span>Mario Kart 64</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Super Mario 64</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pokémon Stadium</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Pokémon Snap</span></i><span>. What a delight!&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Of course I enjoyed the </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>games, but</span><i><span> Pokémon</span></i><span> was what I really wanted. I played the hell out of</span><i><span> Stadium</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Snap</span></i><span>. Still, they weren’t the mainline games. A year later, I got the translucent Glacier Game Boy Advance with a copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon Crystal</span></i><span>. I was STOKED. Finally my very own </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game where I could actually train my own team! Against my parents’ advice, I took the GBA to school with me to show off to my 1st grade class. Now, I was 6 years old; I could hardly read. So a game like </span><i><span>Pokémon Crystal </span></i><span>wasn’t exactly the easiest thing for me to figure out. I needed some help figuring out what to do in the game, so I went up to some older kids at recess to ask for help.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>They had their Game Boys out, so I had high hopes! Unfortunately, I was met with jeers and laughs of “Stupid kid can’t read” and “Wow, what an idiot.” Little Nico was devastated. I immediately started crying and ran off, out into the school field. I only lived a few blocks from school, so I ran home, tears in my eyes, and finally collapsed on my driveway where my mom was doing some yard work. She asked me what was wrong, and I didn’t know how to properly share my feelings, so in a fit of rage, I threw the translucent Glacier Game Boy Advance onto the ground, and it shattered into pieces. My mom came over and consoled me, took care of the plastic bits on the driveway, and walked me back to school. So there it was. I had been bullied out of playing </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>at just 6 years old.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I avoided playing </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>my entire life after that experience. There was always a bit of jealousy in my heart for those that got to enjoy it. Two decades later, I started streaming on Twitch, and with the encouragement of my wonderful community, I decided to give my very first mainline </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game a go:</span><i><span> Pokémon Sword</span></i><span>. With Sobble by my side, and my first catch Nickit on the team, I trained up my little monsters and beat my very first game. It was an incredibly emotional moment for me. I remember summing up the whole experience with one phrase as I watched the credits: “I have been missing out on this my entire life?!” That moment helped me realize I could finally jump into the world of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> head-on. And I went hard! I started shiny hunting, and am now working towards a National Living Shiny Dex, meaning a shiny of every single Pokémon in the national dex at the same time, kept in </span><i><span>Pokémon Home</span></i><span>. I currently have 955/1025, putting me at a 93.17 percent completion!&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I really did a full 180 as far as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> goes, but truly I couldn’t be happier with where I stand with the franchise now. — </span><b>Nico “nicotendo64” Silvian</b><span>, streamer</span></p> <p><span>“The first </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game I played was </span><i><span>Gold</span></i><span> back when I was 7 at my cousin’s house. After just a few hours of exploring the Johto region, I left wanting nothing else but to be able to collect them all on my own. Unfortunately, due to my family’s financial struggles, this would never come to fruition, so I spent my whole childhood and teenage years playing every game I could on emulators, collecting and trading any card I could put my hands on, or just reading dedicated websites, anxiously absorbing every piece of information I could get about the series.</span></p> <p><span>Then, almost 14 years ago, when I was old enough to have a job and buy my first console (a black Nintendo 3DS), I hurried up to the closest store and bought my first official copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon White</span></i><span>.

One of my most cherished is attending the </span><i><span>Ruby</span></i><span> &amp; </span><i><span>Sapphire </span></i><span>Eon Ticket event in 2004 at my local Gamestation store to obtain a Latias. After making sure I met the prerequisites to obtain the ticket, I linked my console with the one being used by a representative of Nintendo.

We bought </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed</span></i><span> &amp;</span><i><span> LeafGreen</span></i><span> at launch together and tested the distance of the wireless adapter in the local shopping mall. We spent lots of time battling, trading, and bonding over our shared love of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. I am fortunate to know him, and will always look back fondly on that day.</span></p> <p><span>My appreciation for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>inspired me to create a newsletter in 2023 called </span><a href="https://www.johtotimes.com/issues"><i><span>Johto Times</span></i></a><span>, which aims to document and preserve the early history of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> and its fan communities by collecting interviews, opinion pieces, and memories like the one I’ve shared here.” — </span><b>Darren</b><span>, </span><i><span>Johto Times</span></i></p> <p><span>“I have so many stories, many of which I have shared ad nauseum, but as we’re approaching the 30th, I figured I’d go with a rather seldom-mentioned one; the pivotal moment of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>in my life I’m going to share isn’t one from my site or from meeting the community at a big event but rather one of the first moments that I felt true community while playing the game. Through my site I met many people but this was the first time that I met anyone through it. I had developed a small group of friends in </span><i><span>Serebii</span></i><span>’s mod team and one day in 2003 the four of us decided to head to London. We did lots of tourist stuff but the key moment was when we went to St. James Park in London and just sat on the grass. We had all brought our Game Boy Advance consoles and a copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon Ruby</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span> and we decided to play some Multi Battles. It was just such a good time, and while I can’t remember who won and I haven’t kept in the best contact with those friends, it is a memory that I will cherish forever.</span></p> <p><span>This was the first time that I felt a sense of community with </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>and truly saw how awesome the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> community could be, and since then it has snowballed and I see it at every event I attend. The </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> community is truly fantastic and that is a big part of why I still engage and do what I do.” — </span><b>Joe Merrick</b><span>, webmaster at Serebii</span></p> <p><span>“In my youth, while the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> anime was blowing up with my classmates, I was 100 percent a </span><i><span>Dragon Ball Z</span></i><span> kid. I thought </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was super lame and for babies. That was, until my cousin gave me his </span><i><span>Blue Version</span></i><span> cartridge. I didn’t even know there was a game before then. And I got hopelessly hooked. I read everything about it after that. I discovered my favorite Pokémon was Primeape, only to find out that tragically, you couldn’t get them in </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>. By then all my classmates had moved on to </span><i><span>Dragon Ball Z</span></i><span> and thought </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was a lame game for babies. So I was too embarrassed to admit I was still playing it and needed someone with a </span><i><span>Red</span></i><span> cartridge to trade with me.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Eventually I met someone from a different school who traded with me. I couldn’t name the Primeape since they were traded, but in my head I called them Goku. They were the first Pokémon I got to level 100. A very special one to me.</span></p> <p><span>I think what lingers most in my memory was just how much love I felt for those janky little pixels in my Game Boy. Choosing my own monsters, and training them up myself, made me deeply care about them in a way I hadn’t ever gotten from passing views of the anime. It taught me a lot about what makes games special.” — </span><b>Greg Lobanov</b><span>, director of </span><i><span>Beastieball</span></i></p> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was something that existed as a constant in my life. My older siblings had copies of </span><i><span>Gold</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Silver</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Ruby</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>, all while I was still too young to process it. My mom would use Pokémon cards as flash cards to help me learn to read, and by the time I had gotten my own GBA and copy of </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> it felt only natural. I bought every new entry, scrounging up pennies and birthday money, getting gifted </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-related items from relatives, battling and trading with my friends, and even using my hand-me-down GBAs from my siblings to trade with myself. There was never any replacement, no idea of the series faltering or any end in sight, and every year of my life was passively accompanied by something </span><i><span>Pokémon-</span></i><span>related.</span></p> <p><span>But it wasn’t the “online chat-room battling and trading” of the early 2010s that stood out, or even the way that I could memorize every Pokémon name, shiny, fun facts, and other information, but a realization I had in my early 20s that made the culmination of now two and a half decades of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> playing really hit home. </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> allowed me to have the confidence to try new things. It sounds silly when saying it aloud, but at every aspect of my life, the 12-year-old kid learning what it means to make a ROM hack and how exciting making a game can be, the 15-year-old kid battling strangers on my 3DS at PAX, overcoming his crippling social anxiety, the 18-year-old rediscovering pixel art and sprite edits he made on MS Paint, turning it into a full-time career, every single new stage in my life I had </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> to thank for being the reason I dived head first into a topic I would otherwise have been terrified to approach. </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> became so fundamental to my thinking that I never processed how from personal life, to hobbies, to career, it was the backbone of every decision, subtle in its influence. Even now, as I sit at my desk, surrounded by </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> merch, drawing pixel art of Pokémon as commissions, I always felt lucky that I had such a fun interest to use as a guiding light, but I never thought about how it gave me the comfort I needed, as a kid, a teen, and as an adult, to find familiarity in the unknown, or have the confidence to be the person who aimed so high, and ended up even higher.</span></p> <p><span>Without </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, I may not have had an interest in game-dev or pixel art, or maybe not as strongly, but I absolutely would not have had the confidence or strength to overcome all the challenges of becoming who I am today, and for that I am forever thankful to </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>.” — </span><b>JDZombi</b><span>, professional pixel artist</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000672834" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672834"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672834">© Nikky Armstrong</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow</span></i><span> was the first game I ever owned new. I borrowed it from a friend initially because we couldn’t afford for me to have my own copy, but when my parents saw how much I loved it, somehow, I ended up with enough pocket money. I still have the cartridge, with the box and the Trainer’s Guide (complete with my own notes about how to get past Brock with a Butterfree). It was also the only game I owned for a long time, so I played it constantly, immediately restarting it as soon as I finished. Growlithe was always my favorite Pokémon, and I worked out a strategy so that every playthrough I would get to Cinnabar Island as quickly as possible, catch my Growlithe, and play the rest of the game with him on my team. Growlithe is usually a version exclusive, so I always made sure to buy whichever version of the latest game included my Growlithe buddy.</span></p> <p><span>In my late 20s, after an awful relationship ended, I had the opportunity to get my first ever dog. He’s an orange German Spitz, who I of course called Growlithe. He is exactly what I imagined having a real Growlithe companion would be like for all those years I spent playing </span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow</span></i><span>. He has travelled with me across Australia, and in 2020, moved with me from Australia to England. I now make video games with him sitting on my lap, which is a lovely reminder of how far we’ve come.” — </span><b>Nikky Armstrong</b><span>, the lead programmer at Perfect Garbage on Grave Seasons.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-30-anniversary-go-anime-cosplay-stream-2000672824]]></content:encoded>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>2025's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was a big enough stumble to push Xbox-owned Activision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-receive-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-releases-as-latest-series-entry-fails-to-meet-expectations">reconsider its approach to yearly CoD entries</a> moving forward. Mind you, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/january-2026-us-consumer-spending-on-video-games-was-up">the game is still topping charts</a>, but after a poor critical reception and lukewarm player sentiment, things are being re-examined. Could a standalone, fully-fledged Zombies entry spice things up? Maybe, but it appears that's not on the table... yet.</p>
<p>At least that's what a rare comment posted through <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty">Call of Duty's official X/Twitter account</a> is suggesting (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-aint-it-activision-issues-rare-denial-of-standalone-call-of-duty-zombies-report">IGN</a>):</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The rumor factory working overtime. This ain't it.</p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Social media accounts are typically run by community managers and dedicated social teams, but needless to say, replies to rumours about new entries <em>should</em> have to go through a few approvals first even if they're in jest. That's what makes the quick comment significant. Traditionally, the teams would just ignore and move on when being hit with these claims.</p>
<p>If we're to believe the denial, however, it's not entirely clear what the comment is referring to. The original rumour, kickstarted by alleged insider <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope">TheGhostOfHope</a> and <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/standalone-cod-zombies-game-reportedly-planned-for-next-gen-consoles-3322963/">shared by Dexerto</a>, was actually saying two things: First, that a standalone Zombies title was in dev. Secondly, it claimed there were plans to release it alongside a mainline entry just in time for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-2027-launch-reportedly-best-case-scenario-following-amd-hint-that-microsoft-may-ship-new-hardware-next-year">Microsoft's next Xbox launch</a>, which could even skip 2027 according to recent reports. Perhaps that's the play here: Shutting down the whole conversation without really specifying what they're referring to.</p><p>In any case, I'm of the opinion a standalone Call of Duty Zombies game (perhaps released with a lower price tag on it) would make <em>a ton </em>of sense. It's not uncommon to see longtime fans say they're annoyed by the franchise's current state only to pick up the latest entry to get that Zombies fix only. And in many cases, it's safe to say diehards would happily grab two separate Call of Duty releases that offered different-enough experiences.</p>
<p>For now, however, we're stuck in the loop of wondering about the series' future following a subpar entry that's performing really well regardless. Is Modern Warfare 4 next in line? It's what everyone is assuming, especially after lead developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a> openly said "<a href="https://in.ign.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/249223/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4-infinity-ward-shuts-down-rumours-about-the-game-being-a-copy-of-mw2">see you in 2026</a>" back in December.</p>

<p>Yesterday, 23rd February, Embark Studios released the introduction to the Shrouded Sky update with an official post and an ominous trailer you can watch below. The short story is the game's generally chill setting (if we don't count the killer robots and treacherous raiders) is being hit with nasty weather, at least for a bit. Today, 24th February, the update has gone live.</p> <figure>

<p>The new Hurricane map condition affects visibility and movement, but new loot caches are being unearthed by the rains and winds, so of course the most daring raiders will be going topside in search of valuables. To make matters worse, two new Arc enemies will roam the Rust Belt moving forward: Fireflies are floating, flame-emitting terrors, and then you'll have to deal with the spherical Comets, which lock on to unsuspecting raiders before exploding. You can imagine why these two are especially scary when visibility is so bad.</p>
<p>The good news is a new free raider deck is available: the Surgeon. The new cosmetic drop comes alongside the ability to (finally) put facial hair on your toon, a feature that somehow wasn't there at launch. A stubble will be available from the get-go to all players, but the full beard is part of the Surgeon deck. Via the store, the stubble beard and thick moustache are available too. I dislike having to grind for proper facial hair, but some folks have it worse IRL, so I won't complain too much.</p>

<p>Other additions include updates to the Dam Battlegrounds map, a new expedition window, new cosmetic bundles, and the Weather Monitoring System project, which has, as usual, its own set of rewards. Also, you'll probably want to check out the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/es/news/shrouded-sky-patch-notes-1-17-0">full patch notes</a> to keep track of the latest balance pass, fixes, and tweaks before you go on a rant online about your guns feeling like pea shooters.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A little over five years ago, on the eve of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> launch, Phil Spencer might have been heralded as the console brand’s saviour, but as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/20/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-with-coreai-exec-asha-sharma-taking-over-as-microsoft-gaming-ceo/">he retires from the head of Microsoft’s gaming with almost immediate effect</a>, the picture of his time is distinctly less rosy.</p>
<p>The Xbox brand was in complete disarray in 2014. After gaining a foothold with the original Xbox and then stealing the early lead with the Xbox 360 (and paying the price with the Red Ring of Death debacle), Xbox began to shift its focus under Don Mattrick’s leadership. The Xbox 360 lineup felt played out by the end of the generation – each year inevitably leaned on a Halo or Gears of War game alongside a Forza – and a lot of emphasis was being placed on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kinect">Kinect,</a> to challenge the Wii for family gaming. And when the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/05/22/xbox-one-reveal-how-microsoft-is-getting-its-message-wrong/">Kinect was then bundled in with the Xbox One</a>, making it both more expensive and less powerful than the PS4? And announced with so much emphasis being put on TV connectivity and with a tone-deaf message about always online DRM? It practically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA">handed the upcoming generation to PlayStation</a>.</p>
<p>Having already filled in after Mattrick’s sudden departure, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/03/31/phil-spencer-fills-the-spot-of-head-of-xbox-at-microsoft/">Phil Spencer was promoted to lead all things Xbox in March 2014</a>, and his immediate actions were decisive. Kinect was cut out of the Xbox One box, the price was cut by $100, and being able to point to being a keen gamer himself, and not just another Microsoft suit, helped to build a little confidence in the platform’s future once more.</p>

<p>Through the rest of the Xbox One generation, Phil Spencer’s appearances at E3 were a mixture of pondering what game dev-branded tee he would be wearing under his jacket, expected sequels and ports, and some truly transformational announcements. In 2015 it was backward compatibility for select Xbox 360 and (eventually) Xbox games, which helped to preserve ties to gaming history, when the only similar option on PS4 was for a full-blown port and remaster. 2016 saw Xbox games coming to Windows at the same time, first with Quantum Break and Forza Horizon 3, and eventually broadening to day-and-date launches on Steam. The Xbox One X in 2017 was Microsoft setting the story straight on hardware design, delivering the undisputed most-powerful console of the generation, shifting back to a more optimal architecture and paving the way for the future. But it was Xbox Game Pass and flurries of game studio acquisitions that started to herald the future of Microsoft’s gaming business.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass also launched in 2017, right at the point that it felt like a Netflix-like model would be relatively positive for the all the media we consume. The deal got even better a year later, as first party games would now come to Game Pass day and date, it came to PC in 2019, and then Project xCloud meant that you could play many of these games wherever you were, and take your progress between platforms. It sounded like a gaming utopia, even if it maybe wasn’t quite as smooth as you’d hope.</p>

<p>Having relied far too heavily on their tried and true franchises (and with some notable game cancellations and studio closures) the Xbox exclusives cupboard was feeling pretty bare. 2018 was the swing back in the other direction, Microsoft acquiring Compulsion Games, Ninja Theory, Obsidian, Playground Games, Undead Labs and inXile, and founding The Initiative. Some were long-time partners, other were still working on cross-platform games when they were acquired, and with a new generation on the horizon, it bode well for what was to come, even if a lot of PlayStation gamers felt put out by the prospect of their games now being exclusives… but let’s come back to that.</p>
<p>With the reveal of the Xbox Series X, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/13/xbox-series-x-reveal-project-scarlett-design-horizontal-tower-next-gen-ps5-rival/">a black obelisk of a design</a> coming alongside the first embers of the broadened Xbox Game Studios promising stunning visuals in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hellblade-senuas-saga">Hellblade: Senua’s Saga</a>, not to mention the long-awaited <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a>, all backed by backward compatibility and Xbox Game Pass as a still tempting price point, there was cause to believe that Xbox could truly compete with Sony once again. OK, so the name wasn’t particularly great, following on from the Xbox One X, but on paper it looked good.</p>

<p>But the console name wasn’t the last befuddling thing for the Xbox Series X. For one thing, there was eventually the Xbox Series S, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/09/xbox-series-s-4-tflops-series-x-specs-more-powerful/">mystifyingly features less RAM than the Xbox One X</a>, meaning it couldn’t match the outgoing hardware and would soon become the butt of every game performance comparison video. Then there was the chopping and changing of the Optimized for Series X logo, Smart Delivery as a concept, and the commitment to cross-gen games from Microsoft studios that went out the window soon. Cross-gen support was pretty opaque over on PlayStation too, but this could have been a win for Microsoft, and it was fumbled.</p>
<p>That’s far from the only thing that now feels like a fumble. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/11/halo-infinite-delayed-to-2021-xbox-series-x-release-date/">Halo Infinite’s much-hated reveal seeing it delayed</a>, leaving just <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review-xbox-series-x-pc/">The Medium’s</a> split-screen horror and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/14/gears-5-hivebusters-dlc-you-should-play-it-needs-a-standalone-release/">Gears 5 Hivebusters DLC</a> to really act as launch window exclusives, it layered significance to the acquisition of Bethesda. Xbox needed something big to tip the tables, and Bethesda had seemingly been keen for a buyer. Oh sure, they still had to deliver timed exclusive games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/13/deathloop-review-ps5-pc/">Deathloop</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/21/ghostwire-tokyo-review-ps5/">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a> to PlayStation, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/starfield">Starfield</a> as an Xbox exclusive felt fairly natural given previous closeness.</p>

<p>But that didn’t help fill Xbox’s release schedule or make for huge hits. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/20/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-delayed-forge-mode-release-date-announcement-soon/">Halo Infinite had a troubled launch</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/25/forza-motorsport-is-now-only-coming-2023-seemingly-delayed-from-spring-release-window/">Forza Motorsport taking an age</a>, Redfall was a straight-up flop, Starfield drew a collective shrug. The main highlights (outside of the ever-reliable Forza Horizon 5) were the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/05/hi-fi-rush-review/">shadow-dropped Hi-Fi Rush</a> and the clutch of smaller projects that Obsidian was able to release.</p>
<p>Was it desperation that led Microsoft down the path to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-activision-what-does-acquisition-mean-for-gamers-playstation-xbox-game-pass-call-of-duty-exclusive/">acquire Activision Blizzard</a>? This eye-watering purchase is the real tipping point. Since closing the deal in 2023, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/22/microsoft-announces-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-for-july-august/">Xbox Series X|S has rapidly increased in price faster</a> than PlayStation 5, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-2025-price-increase-ubisoft-fortnite-crew/">Xbox Game Pass has ballooned both in cost and the bundled subscriptions</a> to justify this, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/xbox-game-pass-gets-price-increases-drops-day-one-games-on-standard-tier/">the rules on ‘day one’ games changed</a> since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/the-game-pass-app-has-confirmed-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-day-one/">Call of Duty’s addition to the service</a>. Not only that, but the whole reason for Xbox as a console manufacturer has been called into question as Microsoft has chosen to bring its games to PlayStation. It’s done so in the most consistently inconsistent fashion, as well. Some games are simultaneous launches, others are clearly defined timed exclusives, and others more nebulous.</p>
<div id="attachment_469180"><p id="caption-attachment-469180">The ‘This is an Xbox’ marketing campaign</p></div>
<p>But if you want to play all these games on day one? Well, you can always find them on Xbox. But what even is an Xbox anymore? The marketing over the last couple of years would want you to know that everything’s an Xbox. There’s your consoles, of course, but there’s also Windows PCs, that ROG Xbox Ally handheld now (which is a handheld PC more than an Xbox console), or just streaming to your TV or phone. So… you don’t need to buy an Xbox anymore. Is that the message? Given how dominant PlayStation 5 has been and the massively strong start for the Switch 2, that’s seemingly what the gaming populace has taken away from this all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Phil Spencer, that now feels like his true legacy for Xbox, the brand being continually diluted. He was once its saviour, convincing Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to stay the course through the Xbox One era, but when six years of rebuilding didn’t lead to early success in the following generation, cheques were signed to buy huge third-party publishers, shifting the expectations for what Xbox could deliver to Microsoft’s bottom line. It’s hard to say that Xbox is in a worse position now than when Spencer took over, when there’s more invested in it than ever and Microsoft’s studios have started to release great and varied games again, but the tone and what people expect from Xbox has changed. It now feels like less of a rival to PlayStation, and more like a publisher with consoles on the side.</p>

Let me slash the tendons of that strutting headline with some immediate caveats. Most obviously, you will not like Cicamadata” if you have an overpowering hatred of feisty punctuation in game titles. You will not like it if you're averse to abstract and ostentatiously computerised, 'product design' art direction that is somehow both bright and foggy, crisp and distorted.</p>
<p>You won’t like it if you really dislike artisanal glitches and general HUD palaver – cockroach text scuttling across the view; boxy white velocity lines; an oversized Doomguy-style character model to indicate health; damage and state changes that cause the screen to blink and reset, as though you’d jolted a cable.
</p>

<p>
You may be especially unkeen on Cicamadata” if you try to play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4257090/CICADAMATA_Demo_Disc/?curator_clanid=45851876">Steam demo</a> on a Latitude 5320 Dell i5-1145G7 with 16 GB of RAM and integrated graphics, like my work laptop. The demo crashed my laptop three times before I grudgingly shuffled over to my review PC, though it ran comfortably enough during the tutorials.
</p>
<p>
Now that the rhetorical ankle-slicing is over, let us bask in the glow of what is not only my favourite FPS demo of recent times but also, one of the few demos I’ve played that conjures the same urge to replay and squeeze out every last drop of blood that I once felt for magazine cover disc demos in the 1990s. 
</p>

<p>
Inasmuch as the writing spells anything out for sure, Cicamadata” casts you as a wayward soul stuffed into the carapace of a super-mobile bunny bot, equipped with what may be either a three-pellet, flip-to-reload shotgun or some kind of grieving, triumphant demigod – as the Steam page puts it, “i am joyeuse. i am not the weapon that failed. i have given everything to masters who forgot my name." 
</p><p>
You’re dropshipped into a bunch of maps that look like enormous, ethereal circuit boards, some floating in the sky, others half-underwater, some encased in ice, others covered in plastic vegetation. Your job is to gather a bunch of CORES and get to the EXIT. Red things are bad things that need to be shot, jumped on, or slammed into. You’ve got a triple-jump and a forward dash you can perform in the air - a dash that will carry you clean past the platform you’re aiming at, until you develop your rhythm. 
</p>
<p>
Save for one corridor affair that teaches you to attack certain foes in certain ways, the demo levels are airy, open-ended creations with secrets above and below. But when you are in full flight, picking off enemy crabs and gun turrets in a jumble of cybernetic squeals and chirping cooldowns, even the largest of these volumes shrinks to a snowglobe, yours to roll about as you please.</p>
<p>It’s good to be fast: Cicamadata” is a speedrunner’s game with omnipresent leaderboards, though you’re free to bounce and roar around the demo levels for as long as you wish. I had great fun discovering each demo map’s terrain conditions – the ice level is slippy, as you’d expect, and the underwater areas slow your shotgun blasts to shoals, obliging you to lead targets.
</p>
<p>
When I first covered Cicamadata” I compared it to the PS1’s Jumping Flash!, another game with exasperating title punctuation that represents a road not entirely taken for first-person platformers, made up of stratospheric playgrounds navigated by means of a big-footed robot shadow. I’m shocked to discover how much Cicamadata” pays homage to that game, even more so than <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1187870/FORZA_POLPO/">Forza Polpo</a> (which I also love). 
</p><p>
There’s the same basic language of waypoints, the same sense that each level is a compact paradise of things to find and jump on and burst into flecks. But Cicamadata” blends the PS1 game’s rabbity whimsy with a queer and insectile savagery. “Obligations no longer bind you,” promises your handler. “Tear flesh from bone.”
</p>
<p>
The demo is live on Steam from now until March 5th. Go on, hop in. See if you can beat my seventh place leaderboard finish in the ice level. The full game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3817250/CICADAMATA/">out later this year</a>.

<p>A new development reveals that the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Creative Director has been tasked with working on the live-action movie adaptation. </p>



<p>The last details we heard about the Kingdom Come: Deliverance franchise were KCD 2 coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-games-for-february-wave-2-features-witcher-3-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> in February 2026 and the previous title receiving an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-enhanced-update-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enhanced Update</a> for current-gen consoles. Now, we have been informed of a live-action movie that will be supervised by the game’s creative director. </p>







<h2 id="h-kcd2-director-daniel-vavra-moving-to-live-action-movie-won-t-work-on-new-warhorse-game">KCD2 Director Daniel Vávra Moving to Live-Action Movie Won’t Work on New Warhorse Game</h2>



<p>The latest update on the shift in focus for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s creative director comes from a new interview with the studio head on <a href="https://cc.cz/daniel-vavra-uz-nepracuje-pro-warhorse-studios-na-nove-hre-misto-toho-pripravuje-hrany-film-kingdom-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Czech Crunch</a>. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/warhorse-studios/" id="1409">Warhorse Studios</a> head Martin Frývaldský has stated that creative director Daniel Vávra has a “new role” in the “creation of the Kingdom Come movie”. Frývaldský added that the franchise has already expanded into other media, such as comics, concerts, and tourism; however, a movie has attracted them the most, and there is already a “draft script”. </p>



<p>Frývaldský added that Warhorse can already feel “interest from the film world” in the Kingdom Come: Deliverance movie, with “negotiations already underway”. The studio head added that they aren’t looking to sell the rights and want the film to be what the studio imagines it to be. </p>



<p>Martin Frývaldský added that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 creative director’s decision to move to the movie was his own. Vávra had already made three games that achieved global success, and he has been “wanting to try something different for a long time.” Getting Kingdom Come to the screen in the “next few years” is a milestone the studio wants to achieve, and that’s Daniel Vávra’s new responsibility. </p>



<p>Warhorse Studio’s head also explained that Daniel Vávra won’t be part of the daily work in the office, but he will still be part of the studio in a “broader sense”. Frývaldský elaborated that Vávra’s new position can be called “transmedia director.” Vávra is no longer involved in a new game from Warhorse Studios. </p>







<p>In other news, Kingdom Come: Deliverance’s director previously stated AI is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-is-here-and-not-going-kingdom-come-director-admits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here and it’s not going anywhere</a>“.

            <p>A new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a>'s head of parental advocacy Dr. Elizabeth Milovidov has touched on the subject of children's safety on the platform, as well how easy it is for children to be exposed to unregulated content. This, according to Milovidov, is a "challenge".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/roblox-kids-safety-head-of-parental-advocacy-interview.html?utm_medium=s1&amp;utm_campaign=vulture&amp;utm_source=bluesky">Speaking to Vulture</a>, Milovidov addressed previous reports of children being exposed to content or people that they shouldn't have access to, and stated that they've heard mixed reports from parents on the dangers of Roblox.</p>
<p>"That's kind of the interesting spot right now is that no matter how good my intentions are, sometimes it's hard to beat back against something negative that goes viral," Milovidov said. "A lot of the reports that have come out have been based on things that happened a few years ago, or where moderation teams caught it but, unfortunately, someone took a screenshot; it went out on Instagram and it's game over for us."</p>
<p>When Vulture asked if Milovidov was saying the problem wasn't real, she responded: "I would say that, in general, Roblox is a platform online. The internet is the internet, right? We have to realize that once we give a child any sort of Wi-Fi access, the world is an open place, right? I remember doing digital parenting sessions and telling parents, 'Look, I'm wearing my Apple Watch. Can you believe I can be bullied on my Apple Watch?' You can be bullied in Google Documents. It's not about banning these things. It's about balance and boundaries. Now that we've introduced them, they've seen the water; we can't just say, 'You're never going to go there.'</p><p>When asked if parents and Roblox and the parents of Roblox players had equal responsibility in protecting these children, Milovidov responded with: "Oh, 1,000 percent. Would I say equal? Oh, Nicole, I think you're going to get me in trouble. I would say the company has even more responsibility. But yes, parents are right in there. I think all the tech companies have a responsibility to ensure that they are doing their utmost to make sure the platform is safe. Do I think Roblox is doing that? Yes, I do. I wouldn't be here if I didn't. Do I think there's more to be done? Yes, I do."</p>
<p>Vulture also raised the issue of ease of access, specifically with how easy it was for children to make new accounts and access unregulated, potentially problematic content. To this, Milovidov said: "We're trying to balance the privacy concerns of users and families with trying to wall things down a little bit more. It's a challenge. When I was writing the parent's guide for Instagram, I was also telling parents about finsta -- fake Instagram accounts. I mean, these things exist in almost every setting. The idea, again, is to talk with your children and say, 'Listen, this is our family. These are our expectations on this. This is why I don't want you to do this.'</p>
<p>"I know parents are busy, and I don't want to put the onus on them, which is why I'm trying to make it as simple as possible. Let your child guide you. Ask them what they're doing on Roblox. Ask them, 'Has anything ever happened that made them feel a little icky?'"</p>
<p>In a 2022 UK report - the <a href="https://assets.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wpuploads/2022/09/cc-digital-childhoods-a-survey-of-children-and-parents.pdf">UK's Digital childhoods: a survey of children and parents report</a> -  the Children's commissioner for England found among other things that "50 percent of children who saw harmful content reported it, older children and girls are less likely to report harmful content. 40 percent of children who didn't report harmful content told us they didn't report because they felt there was no point in doing so, while only 15 percent felt that the content didn't need to be reported."</p><p>Roblox is currently being sued by a variety of entities on the grounds of children's safety. Only last week, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/los-angeles-county-sues-roblox-rcna259891">Los Angeles county sued Roblox</a>, alleging it made it easy for adults to target children. <a href="https://www.lawsuit-information-center.com/roblox-sex-abuse-lawsuit.html">Many families are also suing Roblox over similar grounds</a>, these include <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/roblox-class-action-lawsuit-sent-to-arbitration-in-kids-data-privacy-case/">class action lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://newschannel9.com/news/local/georgia-attorney-general-investigates-roblox-over-child-exploitation-concerns">a grooming lawsuit in Georgia</a>, and <a href="https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/2025/09/03/accused-assault-dickinson-county-girl-brings-lawsuit-towards-roblox/">one from Dickinson Country, Michigan</a> in which its alleged that an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted on the platform.</p>

<p>While the game has now been removed from all storefronts to prevent any new purchases, the King of Meat servers will be sticking around on all currently available platforms (Steam, Xbox Series and PS5) until <strong>9th April</strong>, so those with the game already downloaded still have a few weeks to make the most.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8vlykxu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Between now and the server's close date, all those who purchased the game are entitled to a full refund.</p>
<p>"Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to King of Meat, the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for," a new message on the <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us">King of Meat website</a> reads. "As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and King of Meat's servers will close on April 9, 2026. Players will be able to access and play all existing content until then, so we encourage you to enjoy your remaining time in the game with your fellow Contenders."</p>
<p>After clarifying refund availability, the message concludes with the following thank-you note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to sincerely thank every player who supported King of Meat and the wonderful community that formed around it. Your enthusiasm, imagination, and feedback have meant the world to us and to the team at Glowmade. We're grateful for Glowmade’ s partnership and passion throughout this journey and wish them continued success in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Live service closures have come thick and fast in recent years, but it's still a shame that we never got to see this one materialise on Switch, especially after it cropped up in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-march-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>. Here's hoping that Glowmade's next project has the legs to last a little longer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Website CzechCrunch has <a href="https://cc.cz/daniel-vavra-uz-nepracuje-pro-warhorse-studios-na-nove-hre-misto-toho-pripravuje-hrany-film-kingdom-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> creator <strong>Daniel Vávra</strong>, who co-founded <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> and served as the Game Director and Lead Writer for the franchise's two <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released installments</a>, will focus on bringing the IP to cinema or television rather than working on a third entry.</p>



<p>The news was shared by Warhorse CEO <strong>Martin Frývaldský</strong>, who explained:</p>



<p><em>Dan has a new role. That's the creation of the Kingdom Come movie. We have been moving the Kingdom Come brand away from video games for some time now. So far, we have been in comics, concerts, and tourism, but the film has attracted us the most. That is why Dan and I are working on getting it onto the screen or the big screen. There is also a draft script. We feel the interest from the film world, negotiations are already underway. We don't just want to sell the rights, we want the film to be what we imagine it to be. </em></p>



<p>However, Frývaldský also clarified that this isn't a breakup with Warhorse for Vávra:</p>



<p><em>I'm sure people will wonder if this is some kind of breakup with Warhorse. No, on the contrary, Dan himself wanted to move on. He made three games that were a global success, he has been wanting to try something different for a long time. Getting Kingdom Come to the screen or the screen in the next few years is another milestone that we want to achieve, and that is Dan's new role. You won't see him in the office every day anymore, but in a broader sense, he is still part of Warhorse.</em></p>



<p><em>We would have to be blind if we didn't realize how much our brand has grown. In fact, Dan Vávra's new position could be called transmedia director. In any case, we see the film as a complement to our game creation, which can be extremely successful in its own right.</em></p>



<p>In the interview, Frývaldský even revealed that Warhorse <strong>had already been approached about adapting Kingdom Come: Deliverance after the first game</strong>. However, the arrival of COVID meant discussions died down for a few years. Now, following the amazing success of the new game (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over five million units sold</a></strong>), the studio is more interested than ever in pursuing this venue.</p>



<p>It would be just the latest in an ever-growing list of game adaptations for cinema or TV. Historically, they haven't fared well, but that is slowly changing with the likes of <strong>The Last of Us</strong>, <strong>Super Mario</strong>, <strong>Fallout</strong>, and <strong>Sonic</strong>, to name a few.</p>



<p>As for Daniel Vávra, we're sure that even in his new position, he'll continue to make controversial comments on social media, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-director-criticized-the-outer-worlds-2-obsidian-hasnt-innovated-since-fallout-new-vegas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when he criticized <strong>Obsidian</strong> for not making an innovative game since <strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong></a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders neglects the ever-popular battle passes in favor of Raider Decks, which offer pages of rewards for you to claim, all in exchange for Cred. From usable items to cosmetics and currency, they’re quite popular amongst the player base, and Shrouded Sky has finally added a new one—the Surgeon Deck.</p>







<p>However, you’ll need to claim it before you can start unlocking the brand new rewards, but thankfully, it’s easier than ever. If you’re interested in the new Surgeon Raider Deck in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, here’s how to claim it, as well as every reward it has on offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-the-surgeon-deck-in-arc-raiders">How To Claim The Surgeon Deck In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Free as a bird. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To claim the Surgeon Deck in ARC Raiders, all you have to do is head on over to the Decks tab and purchase it for free. </strong></p>



<p>Despite the Decks showcasing Raider Tokens as the pricing, not a single one has released that isn’t free yet, with all three of them being readily available for all to claim. It’s a consumer-friendly approach by Embark Studios, and long may it continue. </p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>That being said, you’ll need Cred to unlock these rewards, but luckily for you, they’re easy to earn. The fastest way to earn them is by completing Feats, which are simple in-game tasks to complete during raids. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-from-the-surgeon-deck-in-arc-raiders">All Rewards From The Surgeon Deck In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Solid Outfit. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Overall, there are 25 rewards to claim from the Surgeon Deck in ARC Raiders, totalling 1,070 Cred. </strong></p>



<p>Based on the theme, you can expect a lot of medical supplies in the Surgeon Deck, although there is a healthy amount of Raider Tokens to claim, too. The star of the show, however, is easily the suite of cosmetics on offer, with the new Surgeon outfit getting a variety of colours.</p>

While the game has mostly remained dormant on Steam since its release 16 years ago, eagle-eyed fans spotted a flurry of updates behind the scenes via SteamDB, as well as a revealing datamine effort that has discovered a mysterious change to the game's credits that adds in remaster studio, Iron Galaxy, and a curious reference to Ubisoft Connect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all, though. "So one of the OG modders for the game data mined the recent update and has found a lot of interesting things," a fan explained on the game's subreddit. "For Prototype 1, they have added some test maps and quite a few new names in the credits. There might be some hope for a remaster after all."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't, of course, evidence that a remaster is <em>actually</em> happening — right now, we're purely going on vibes and crossed fingers — but New Radical must have been established to work on <em>something</em>, so keep those fingers crossed!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Calls for an official Simpsons: Hit and Run remake have similarly cropped up from time to time in the 20+ years since the original’s release, but it seems an unlikely project. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/matt-selman-simpsons-hit-and-run-remake"><u>In 2021 we spoke to Simpsons writer Matt Selman</u></a> who said that while he "would love to see a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/12/best-games-that-deserve-sequels"><u>remastered version of [Simpsons Hit &amp; Run]</u></a>", it would be "a complicated corporate octopus to try to make that happen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-worst-and-weirdest-simpsons-games"><u>find out exactly where we placed The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run in our rundown of the best, worst, and weirdest Simpsons games</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty publisher Activision has issued a rare, if brief, comment to seemingly deny a claim it planned to launch a standalone Zombies game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2025670143184101532" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGhostofHope</a> stated on social media that Activision was prepping two separate Call of Duty games for the launch of Microsoft's next-gen Xbox console (currently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-generation-xbox-could-launch-in-2027-hints-amd">expected to launch in 2027 at the earliest</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The claim described these two launches as "a traditional Call of Duty multiplayer and a standalone Zombies title presumably developed by Treyarch," and likened their release to when "Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered where [sic] both released together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That leak was then picked up by gaming blog Dexerto, to which Activision has now responded using its official Call of Duty social media account: "The rumor factory working overtime," Activision <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "This ain't it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision typically does not respond to rumors or speculation, making this intervention notable. That said, the vague nature of the denial makes it unclear exactly which parts of the original claim Activision is now saying are untrue, or whether some element of this claim was true until plans ultimately changed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On social media, Call of Duty's response comes specifically in reply to a thread of tweets discussing the standalone Zombies title, and the claim it was being prepped as a launch title for Microsoft's next console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original rumor suggested that Microsoft's shifting release plans for its next Xbox hardware had meant that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4, the franchise's most anticipated upcoming release, would no longer be a launch title for the next-gen Xbox, as apparently had been planned. While not yet officially confirmed, Modern Warfare 4 is expected by fans to be this year's Call of Duty entry — but there's absolutely no suggestion that Microsoft is planning to launch new consoles this year. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Call of Duty Campaigns</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some kind of shakeup to Call of Duty's forthcoming release schedule is expected, following Activision's recent pledge to make <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games"><u>significant changes</u></a> to the franchise following the underperformance of Black Ops 7. The publisher has said it will never release back to back games in the same sub-brand (Modern Warfare, Black Ops) again, meaning it will likely need to come up with other options if it continues with an annual release schedule.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Microsoft's plans for new consoles, the company has confirmed it has fresh hardware in the works on several occaisons. In 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console">former Xbox president Sarah Bond said</a> Microsoft was "moving full speed ahead on our next generation hardware, focused on delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation." A year later, the company publicly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-first-party-next-generation-xbox-consoles-announces-deal-with-amd-and-promises-full-backwards-compatibility-with-your-existing-xbox-library"><u>confirmed its partnership with AMD on its next-generation Xbox project</u></a>. But a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-2027-launch-reportedly-best-case-scenario-following-amd-hint-that-microsoft-may-ship-new-hardware-next-year">recent report suggested that 2027 was now a conservative estimate for the company's new hardware</a> — which instead could now arrive later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-considering-pushing-back-ps6-release-to-2028-or-even-2029-amid-ai-fueled-chip-crisis">Sony is also reportedly considering delaying the launch of PlayStation 6 to 2028, or potentially even later</a>, due to the ongoing AI-fueled chip crisis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The surprising appointment of Microsoft's CoreAI president Asha Sharma as head of Microsoft Gaming at the weekend - in conjunction with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer retiring and former Xbox president Sarah Bond suddenly departing</a> - may actually be a genuine attempt by the company to turn Xbox's fortunes around. This slightly different read on the events of the past few days comes from The Verge, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">a report compiled by long-time Microsoft reporter Tom Warren</a> who spoke to "multiple" sources it sounds like were inside the company itself.</p>
<p>The Verge heard that Spencer's retirement had been a long time coming and was largely expected by staff. But Bond's more surprising departure - for she had been the obvious replacement-in-waiting for Spencer - came about as the result of her big 'Xbox Anywhere' push not working out. Her idea was to move Xbox away from a single console and spread the brand across multiple devices including mobile. This divided focus led to continued drops in hardware revenue, and core parts of the vision - such as a promised Xbox mobile gaming store - still haven't appeared long after they were supposed to.</p>
<p>Internally this Xbox Anywhere plan apparently "offended many Xbox employees", The Verge reported, and Bond herself is described as "tough to work with". She's praised by employees for striking deals with companies - apparently she was "crucial" in completing the $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal - but she was also allegedly ruthless if you didn't stick to her vision. "You were out," The Verge wrote. "Most of the current and former Xbox employees I've spoken to in recent days are relieved that Bond is leaving Microsoft."</p>
<p>It's against that backdrop Asha Sharma was brought in, someone who seems ill-fitted to the role of CEO of Microsoft Gaming because she doesn't have gaming experience, either professionally or personally, and because of her worrying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-head-of-gaming-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai-following-concerns-about-the-proliferation-of-ai-slop-and-sharmas-tech-background">background in AI - a background she's already had to answer for</a>. But there might actually be a legitimate push here to reboot and refresh the Xbox division.</p><p>If Microsoft were only interested in making Xbox a game publisher going forwards, why not promote Xbox game overseer Matt Booty? And why would Sharma promise a "return of Xbox" and say things like "I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox" if looking only for empty platitudes while Xbox was sunsetted? Those are the kind of claims that will embarrass a person should they be proven insincere. "I get the impression from sources that Microsoft wants a turnaround and is worried about losing Xbox," The Verge wrote, "as it's one of its only remaining successful consumer brands."</p>
<p>Those who know Sharma reportedly say she's "enthusiastic" and "willing to learn" and "very capable of getting teams to execute on a clear vision", and that she's had good success with user acquisition at previous companies - something Xbox could sorely do with. Is this the start of a comeback fight for the Xbox console - a return to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-was-afraid-sony-was-going-to-own-the-living-room-the-big-xbox-360-interview">the "challenger brand" mindset Peter Moore instilled so aggressively for Xbox 360</a>? And if it is, what happens to that Xbox Anywhere vision?</p>
<p>Questions abound. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has been the vision holder for Xbox for a long time. He became president of Xbox in 2014 and then CEO of Microsoft Gaming in 2022, and helped drastically revitalise Xbox's image after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-one-developers-have-their-say-on-specs-self-publishing-and-tvtvtv">the disastrous Xbox One reveal</a> and launch. He was the face and figurehead of Xbox, even with Sarah Bond as president, and he instigated things like Xbox Game Pass, which Sharma will have to deal with now.</p>
<p>But there is an opportunity for Sharma to re-establish Xbox when launching new hardware, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gen-xbox-confirmed-in-development-following-rumours-microsoft-would-stop-making-consoles">Microsoft has said it's working on</a>, although we have no idea when it intends to release it. There are, however, strong economical challenges faced by hardware manufacturers today, notably those caused by a rush to gen-AI, which is pushing component prices sky high, as well as unpredictable tariffs and a general rise in living costs. As we've been told before, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them">the role of the console is changing</a>.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky update 1.17.0 is now live, and it introduces the new map condition, new ARC enemies, weapon buffs &amp; nerfs, and much more. </p>



<p>Some details of this update have been revealed ahead of its release, including the new map condition that introduces <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hurricane-map-condition-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hurricanes</a>. However, the update is much more comprehensive than that, adding new balancing changes for popular weapons, items, and crafting, bug fixes, and much more. Learn everything new in update 1.17.0 below.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-1-17-0">What’s New in ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Update 1.17.0</h2>



<p>Starting with the highlights, the ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Update 1.17.0 adds a new Hurricane Map condition, which was mentioned above. There’s a new ARC threat to look out for, with two new unique machines that players can face: the Firefly and the Comet. Additionally, there’s a new project to build a Weather Monitoring System, a Free Raider Deck: Surgeon, and a new area has been uncovered in Dam Battlegroud, the Controlled Access Zone. Lastly, the game has also added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-giving-arc-raiders-players-what-they-want/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facial hair</a> with this update. </p>



<h2 id="h-weapon-and-item-balancing-changes-in-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-1-17-0">Weapon and Item Balancing Changes in ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Update 1.17.0</h2>



<p>Regarding balancing, the developers have revealed that many players reported a “shadow buff” in update 1.13. The developers fixed it in 1.13.1, but it inadvertently impacted the game’s weapon input buffers. The developers want to fix that now while maintaining some middle ground between what already exists. The developers are also looking to balance between low-tier and high-tier weapons. The balancing changes have been made to the following weapons: Stitcher, Kettle, Venator, Jupiter, and Aphelion.</p>



<p>Additionally, there are changes to Item &amp; Crafting, tons of content &amp; bug fixes, and an update to Anti-Cheat that players can check out in the patch notes below: </p>

<h2>Anti-Cheat</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>When we shared our last update about tackling unfair play, we didn’t fully convey the complexity and scale of what goes into cheat detection. Our defenses operate on multiple levels: some checks are simple and definitive, while others are behavioral and data-driven and evolve over time. We also leverage broad gameplay telemetry and machine learning techniques to spot patterns that aren’t obvious at first glance. These methods take longer to develop, must adapt as game systems change, and don’t always offer instant certainty the way blunt software detections can.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve recently taken action against different exploits and we are further tightening our rules and stepping up enforcement. Serious infractions now carry stricter consequences. Strong detections will receive permanent bans right off the bat, while others will receive a temporary suspension and a single chance to correct the behavior. Recent updates to Family Sharing have strengthened our ability to curb misconduct and streamlined the removal of bad actors from the game. We are preparing to launch a systematic manual review of ban appeals. The game is young and the volume of telemetry is enormous, but this process ensures every case is handled with care as we continue to learn quickly and invest heavily in the precision of our enforcement tools.</p>

<p>The Shrouded Sky update for ARC Raiders is here, and there’s a lot to unpack. From the new Hurricane Map Condition to the two new ARC threats, there’s a heap of content to explore. However, one of the highlights is the brand new Project, the Weather Monitor System.</p>



<p>Shani needs you to help her build the system so Speranza isn’t caught off guard by weather anomalies like the Hurricanes in the future. Don’t worry, it’s not all done out of the kindness of your heart, as there are plenty of rewards on offer too. </p>







<p>If you want to know what items to look out for on your next raid, then you’re in the right place. Follow this guide to see every requirement and reward tied to the Weather Monitor System Project in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, along with how long you have to complete it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-arc-raiders-weather-monitor-system-project">How To Complete The ARC Raiders Weather Monitor System Project</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The first stage. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five stages to the Weather Monitor System Project in ARC Raiders, with each one having four requirements to fulfil.</strong></p>



<p>Frustratingly, you cannot cycle through the stages to see what you’ll need down the line, and since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shrouded Sky update</a> is so fresh, only the first stage will be viewable for many. However, some raiders are already making swift work of the Project, and they’ve shared the requirements for each stage—as well as the rewards.</p>



<p>As more stages are unveiled by the fanbase, Insider Gaming will be quick on the trigger to update the article.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Is it worth it? Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, there is no expiry date on the Weather Monitor Display Project in ARC Raiders.</strong></p>







<p>That means that, theoretically, you can take as long as you’d like to grind through the Project and earn the rewards.

            <p>Excitement around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a>'s launch next week seems to finally be a thing, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">this weekend's "server slam" aims to convince extraction shooter enjoyers</a> on the fence. Ahead of it, Bungie has outlined a frankly impressive effort regarding networking and security features that will be implemented from the get-go.</p>
<p>On 23rd February, the Sony-owned developer <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity">shared a meaty blog post</a> that dives deep into what players can expect from the game's many layers of security and key network features. Needless to say, all of them are crucial to ensuring a smooth and fair online experience, but it's often that shooters targeting a competitive crowd don't launch in a robust-enough state.</p>
<p>First, Bungie has made Marathon's dedicated servers "fully authoritative on key combat and looting actions," meaning any "correction" of suspicious behaviour won't impact other players and their experience. It's combined with "client-side prediction and rewind" to ensure actions feel immediate. Moreover, it's promised that servers "carefully track each bullet to its target even with high packet loss." Consistent hit registration at launch in an online shooter? Imagine that.</p>
<p>When it comes to wall hacks and other cheats that might reveal the position of key items and players, a Fog of War system limits the regions of a map that individual player clients have knowledge of. "It also helps keep your position hidden from other players' clients." This isn't enough to guarantee full protection from hacks alone, but it's part of the game's arsenal to combat cheaters. On top of that, the security stack was rebuilt "from the ground up" for this game, and that will work alongside the familiar BattlEye solution.</p><p>There's also the matter of one's Internet connection going down mid-run. Each online game handles such events differently. In the case of Marathon, "you can reconnect and continue playing the run" like in other match-based shooters. "If connection recovery fails due to an issue with Bungie's server or network infrastructure, we will attempt to return the starting gear to all impacted players."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bungie</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Perhaps the biggest shocker comes near the end of the list of features, where Bungie states "anyone found to be cheating will be permabanned from playing Marathon forever." Yeah, no second chances. So, make sure you're not running anything suspicious while playing it.</p>
<p>In any case, the veteran online shooter developer, admits that "product security is never fully solved" and says it'll continue to invest in systems and infrastructure for as long as the game stays alive.</p>
<p>As an extra, we now also have confirmation Xbox players will automatically get <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too">exclusive gun charms</a> when the game releases on 5th March:</p> <div>

            <p>Not long after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-new-vegas-van-buren-remake-mod-revelation-blues-has-a-new-name-and-a-second-demo-dropping-soon">changing their project's name</a> from Fallout: Revelation Blues to Fallout: The New West, the developers behind a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> mod remaking a cancelled Fallout game have settled on a release date for their second demo. The second publicly playable taste of this attempt to resurrect Van Buren - the version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> which was in development at Black Isle Studios before being cancelled in 2003 - is slated to arrive late next week.</p>

<p>This second demo will arrive on March 5th and, unlike the Burham Springs demo the New West team <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-new-vegas-mod-revelation-blues-demo-van-buren">put out last year,</a> it sets up an alternate New Vegas start which'll serve as the intro the the full mod. Interestingly, the modders look to have pulled that Burham Springs demo offline ahead of its follow-up releasing, with its <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/91191?tab=description">Nexus Mods page</a> noting that it's "currently not supported by the author(s) and/or has issue(s) they are unable to fix yet".</p>
<p>As for the upcoming demo, it'll drop you into Tibbets prison and likely task you with negotiating your release. I'm sure the robots and AI brains in change will conduct fair parole hearings.</p>
<p>"This experience offers players a new point of entry into the Mojave, beginning as a Prisoner under the observation of our watchful staff," developer Caveman6667 wrote in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/867445710622556230/867471933725212702/1475708718787199080">Discord announcement</a> of the demo date. "Within these walls messages are screened, rivalries simmer and order is absolute. Each block is designed with purpose and every decision shapes your record. Tibbets is one vignette within a much larger world currently in development. This demo represents the opening gate. Your participation, feedback, and continued vigilance assist in its refinement."</p><p>As noted on <a href="https://falloutthenewwest.com/faq">their website</a>, the modders plans once this Tibbets demo is out are to eventually release The New West's entire first act as a vertical slice. Once complete, the mod'll tell "the same broad story envisioned by Fallout: Van Buren, but restructured and expanded to form a cohesive, playable experience". Drawing on themes and story beats from design documents for the cancelled game which have since gone public, The New West's tale will take place in an "alternate continuity that predates and reinterprets the events of Fallout: New Vegas". Its creators are also hoping to mesh together the more modern experience of playing New Vegas with some classic Fallout-esque mechanics outlined in the docs.</p>
<p>If it achieves its goals, the project sounds like it'll form a nicely funky bridge between the original two Fallouts and spiritual successor New Vegas. Now, to look up ways to convince a Protectron guard to help me hop a very tall and possibly electrified fence in preparation for March 5th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 24, 2026, Quordle is the #1491 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games because it requires you to guess four words at once correctly, and you can do so on the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You are shown four equal lines reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 25.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>
