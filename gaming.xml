			<p>During a livestream for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeOWfNAuVUk">Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis</a>, of all things, a director on the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series at Square Enix, Tetsuya Nomura, provided a couple of small updates on Kingdom Hearts 4 and Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3. </p>



<p>Translated by <a href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1963954361362419884">Aitaikimochi on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Nomura doesn't go into any great detail, and is only able to comment on their development progress, with both games, according to Nomura, being "<em>on schedule</em>." He even goes on to say, per Aitaikimochi's translation, that Square Enix has a date picked for when they'll announce Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, asking fans to "<em>please wait for it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>So, regarding Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, you see, Toriyama supposedly said we will have news around the time of the second anniversary of Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis. We are making great progress on the game, and I can't say anything else...We are indeed making a lot of progress with the game. We already have decided when we will make the announcement as well, and we will stick to that time schedule. So don't worry, but please wait for it.</em>"</p>



<p>He offers the same update for Kingdom Hearts 4, but doesn't imply that Square Enix is close to any kind of reveal or that it has a date picked out for the next big drop of Kingdom Hearts 4 news.</p>



<p>"<em>On that same note, I'm seeing a lot of comments asking about Kingdom Hearts 4. We are making great strides and going according to schedule. So please wait for more information on that."</em></p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I translated Nomura’s quote from the FF7EC stream regarding FF7 Remake Part 3 and Kingdom Hearts 4.</p><p>Both games are making great progress. They have already decided on when they will make the big announcement for FF7R Part 3, so stay tuned!</p><p>Here are the subs for his comment! <a href="https://t.co/Immgd4FtW3">pic.twitter.com/Immgd4FtW3</a></p></div>— ☆オードリーAudrey☆ (@aitaikimochi) <a href="https://twitter.com/aitaikimochi/status/1963954361362419884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's been a little more than three years since Kingdom Hearts 4 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-ue5/">announced</a>, and you can add Tetsuya Nomura's words here to the list of very small updates we've gotten for the game in the time since, while we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-english-recording/">seen a few</a> more <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">significant updates</a> on how Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 is progressing. That said, hopefully, the fact that Square Enix has a reveal date picked out means that we can forget about last year's report that we'll have to <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-may-be-four-years-away/">wait until 2028 to close off this remake trilogy</a>. Unless the date it has picked is in 2027, of course.</p>

I fear and covet no videogame genre on this Earth like the bullet hell shoot 'em up. I find these scions of the arcades irresistibly beautiful. They look like how I imagine human nervous systems appear to thunder spirits. By the same token, I’m not sure they're actually designed to be processed by the human nervous system. They're the kind of game the androids will play, once they’ve hunted down and incinerated the last of our kind.

<p>
Within the shmup genre, the Touhou Project series stands as a diamond-hard constellation of electrochemical pizazz. Dating back to 1997, it spans 20 mainline games and 13 spin-offs, all created by Team Shanghai Alice, a studio that apparently consists of a single guy, Nagano, Japan-based Jun'ya Ōta. The series has spawned a vast cosmos of fanworks. Today sees the release of another fan game, Touhou Kouzougi ～ Flickerframe Shutter Festival from Brazillian game developer Ryann Thierry. 'Tengu paparazzo', you say? Seems worth a quick post. Here’s a trailer.
</p>

<p>
I’m writing about Flickerframe Shutter Festival partly because I really like that trailer soundtrack – the game's score is the work of Benji Tunez, and is apparently full of references to other Touhou productions – and partly, because this is my first exposure to the concept of a “photography bullet hell”. As in other shmups, the basic idea here is to survive on a screen that looks like a tornado full of stinging jellyfish. The twist is that rather than just shooting bullets back at the source of those projectiles, you’re trying for a Kodak moment. 
</p><p>
“Use your camera to take shots of the bosses, while also clearing the projectiles shot by them!” explains the blurb. “Acquire new skills given to you by your clients to aid you in your sessions! Try getting the craziest shots to overcome your highest scores!”
</p>
<p>
Photographing bosses to death – what a concept! I actually think I might be able to master this one, inasmuch as a lesser-known vidyagame gurnalist skill is taking screenshots during fights. For the professional hack, there is no shame greater than having to illustrate a breathless description of a nuclear haymaker with a picture of the protagonist looking at a table, or something. 
</p>
<p>
True, you can automate the taking of screengrabs nowadays, but I’ve always preferred the personal touch - and I’m sure that old school obstinacy will stand me in good stead as I try to beat Flickerframe Shutter Festival. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3829880/Touhou_Kouzougi__Flickerframe_Shutter_Festival/">Which you can find on Steam</a>.

              <p>Pokémon Poke-nade Monster Ball may sound like the world’s weirdest energy drink crossover, but it is in fact the translated name for Pokémon’s latest venture, a Tamagotchi-style interactive keychain pet, albeit far more complex than the Tamagotchis of old. Which of course raises two all-important questions: Can you let the Pokémon starve to death? And will it poop?</p> <p>This&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em> a Pokémon x Tamagotchi situation, it should be said. That has happened before, as a matter of fact: an official crossover with Bandai Namco’s pocket toys happened in 2019, with the retro devices selling out day one on the Pokémon Center. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1p92K06svQ">YouTuber UnlistedLeaf</a> once found himself trapped caring for a teeny pixel Eevee that incessantly demanded food, but instead of pooping would cough up furballs. And no, that one didn’t die if you failed to look after it, but instead ran away. Which is kind of horrifying in its own right.</p>  <p>This new venture (<a href="https://essential-japan.com/news/pokemon-is-getting-its-own-official-tamagotchi-style-virtual-pet/">spotted by <em>Essential Japan</em></a>), which is with Bandai rival Takara Tomy looks like a much more advanced toy. First of all, it’s in color, but also encased in a Poké ball shell, with a touch-sensitive screen. The latter is because a part of looking after your pocket-sized pocket monster is stroking it (that’s the “Poke-nade” part of the name, which is a portmanteau of Pokémon and “naderu,” to stroke).</p>

 <p>Apparently, poking at the screen will get the Pokémon to react in various cutesy ways. According to&nbsp;<em>Essential Japan</em>, “the Pokémon will react differently depending on the length and speed of the petting,” and you are fully able to make your own revolting jokes right here.</p> <p>The Monster Ball sounds pretty impressively in-depth compared to the Tamagotchi, which could only eat, sick up fur, and eventually evolve. This new toy will let you play with the Pokémon, and even take part in Pokémon battles. There’s also a diary feature that’ll remember all your previous interactions, and the device will apparently offer 157 different Pokémon to choose from. Some of them—Pikachu, Eevee, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly, Lucario and Sylveon—will even be voiced and come with more detailed animations.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000623448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623448">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>That inclusion of Sylveon on the list does suggest one peculiar aspect, however. If you can start with an Eevee or a Sylveon, it does indicate that the monsters might not be able to evolve. An odd choice if true, especially given the Paldean starter Pokémon included get far more entertaining as they grow.</p> <p>It looks like these will be a Japan-only release for now, but despite featuring a touch screen and far more complexity than a Tamagotchi, they’re surprisingly cheap. ¥7,480, which works out to just over $50. However, I’m absolutely certain they’ll sell out almost instantly, and go for far higher resale prices to the rest of the world.</p> <p>But can they die?! Do they poop?! We <em>don’t know</em>. It seems incredibly unlikely, given The Pokémon Company overrode the usual rules for Tamagotchi when it partnered with them, but it’ll be interesting to learn how the game responds to a bad owner. Or a messy one.</p>

                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive got into the publishing game with its IOI Partners program, and MindsEye--from former Rockstar developer Leslie Benzies' Build a Rocket Boy--was the company's first published game. The game struggled mightily out of the gate, with many criticizing its technical performance, among other things. Now, IO's CEO, Hakan Abrak, has reacted to the launch and discussed whether or not the company will continue to publish others' games.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Abrak told IGN</a> that when IO was first chatting with Build a Rocket Boy, the idea was to find a way to "support them," because IO believed in the company's "great ideas." IO was coming in to help Build a Rocket Boy--a brand-new game developer with no releases under its belt before MindsEye--distribute the game.</p><p>For whatever reason, MindsEye had issues, and Abrak addressed this frankly. "Well, that was definitely tough, right?" he said. "It was a tough reception. It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners."</p><p>Abrak went on to say that Build a Rocket Boy is now "working hard on turning that around" to help regain trust. He added that he believes the team has "tons of potential."</p><p>MindsEye just got its <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1963898695214039479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fourth major update this week</a>, and it's a big one, weighing in at as much as 15GB. It fixes bugs and makes performance improvements. A fifth major patch is coming next.</p><p>But will IO continue to publish games via its IOI Partners program? Abrak wasn't ready to confirm anything one way or another. He said IO will publish its own games, including the upcoming James Bond game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007 First Light</a>. But future partnerships? "That remains to be seen," Abrak said.</p><p>007 First Light was the focus of a special PlayStation State of Play broadcast this week, during which IO announced the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-release-date-confirmed-arrives-just-before-gta-6/1100-6534459/" data-ref-id="1100-6534459">release date</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-james-bond-game/2900-6978/" data-ref-id="2900-6978">showed off new gameplay</a>, and revealed a $300 collector's edition featuring a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-legacy-edition-preorder-bonuses-release-date-platforms/1100-6534460/" data-ref-id="1100-6534460">replica Golden Gun.</a></p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric Barone mentioned in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-getting-stardew-valley-to-a-good-place-with-update-1-6-eric-barone-is-now-fully-focused-on-his-next-game-im-committed-to-not-working-on-stardew-valley-until-im-done-with-haunted-chocolatier/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> that he might need to retreat to a cabin in the woods to focus on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier. That sentiment rings true now more than ever, as Barone juggles multiple projects--including the newly announced Stardew Valley 1.7 update and a surprise voice cameo in Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/stardew-valleys-eric-barone-is-in-the-hollow-knight-silksong-credits-for-voicing-a-mystery-character/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> caught Barone's name appearing in the credits of Silksong, listed alongside members of Team Cherry and even the family of lead designer William Pellen. Given the shared success of Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight, which launched within a year of each other and became landmark indie titles, it's no surprise their creators have formed connections within the indie development scene.</p><p>His role in Silksong involved providing non-verbal character sounds--for those familiar, Nintendo-style chirps and mutterings--for one of the game's new NPCs. While Barone hasn't revealed which character he voiced, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/771772/hollow-knight-silksong-stardew-valley-eric-barone-concernedape" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> confirmed it was indeed him. Fans are now left to guess which bug-like denizen of the kingdom of Parloom bears his signature tones.</p><p>Despite this side contribution, Barone remains fully focused on Haunted Chocolatier. Even though the 1.7 update for Stardew Valley may slow development slightly, Barone insists the impact will be minimal. As for his voice work in Silksong, it was a small and likely long-completed task and more a fun detour than a distraction.</p>

ConcernedApe, A.K.A the creator of a little game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>. As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/771772/hollow-knight-silksong-stardew-valley-eric-barone-concernedape">The Verge</a>, Barone's name can be seen in Silksong's credits under the 'Additional Character Voices' section.</p>
<p>However, while Cole Medeiros, head of operations and biz dev at ConcernedApe LLC, confirmed to The Verge that it is indeed the Eric Barone we're all thinking of, he refrained from confirming exactly which role the creator plays in Silksong in an effort to maintain some of the mystique. Fair play, really.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067iznqks&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2k-confirms-a-%E2%80%9Ccollege-basketball-experience%E2%80%9D-is-in-the-works-for-its-nba-2k-series.1289847/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After it was reported that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-game-no-more-ea-loses-to-2k-sports/">EA Sports had lost out to 2K Sports</a> in capitalizing on the chance to bring collegiate basketball back to videogames in the way that EA has done with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-2m-units-sold-in-us-ea-sports-college-football-tops-july-us-sales-charts/">College Football</a>, 2K took a victory lap and confirmed that it will be creating a "<em>college basketball experience</em>" for its NBA 2K games, some of which 2K implies we'll start to see in NBA 2K26, which is out today at the time of this writing, on September 5, 2025.</p>



<p>Yesterday, we learned through an internal memo first reported by Extra Points that EA Sports was walking away from trying to bring about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-return/">EA Sports College Basketball game it had teased in June</a>. Enough schools had instead chosen to take 2K's proposal of being included in the NBA 2K games, so EA took its ball and went home, rescinding the offers it had put out to various colleges and universities in the United States, leaving 2K's proposal the only one on the board.</p>



<p>Not too long after those reports hit the wire, 2K put out a statement on <a href="https://x.com/2K/status/1963775457876406534">X (formerly Twitter)</a> and confirmed that it is "<em>going back to school.</em>" It even took the chance to take a dig at EA by highlighting the fact that its proposal to schools was the "<em>quality</em>" choice.</p>



<p>"<em>Yes, it's true. We're working on a college basketball experience that will feature more than 100 programs from across the country, from powerhouses to Cinderella stories. Competition fuels quality at all levels, which is why our approach with college basketball ensures our partner schools, college athletes and our players all benefit.</em>"</p>



<p>The statement then goes on to indicate we'll start to see some air of what this full experience will be in this year's release, though it does clarify that players should expect the majority of what this will become starting in 2027, and expect it to grow from there. "<em>You won't have to wait long to start seeing your favorite colleges show up in game. We've got big plans for 2027 and beyond, and even a few surprises coming in early 2026."</em></p>



<p>"<em>We've proven the quality of the basketball experience we can deliver for years,"</em> the statement continues, "<em>and have</em> <em>every intention</em> <em>to bring that same level of quality to college hoops</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While there are surely some disappointed college basketball fans who might've wanted it to have a college basketball-dedicated game, depending on how far 2K takes the college mode its building, it might just be the best scenario to get your college and professional league basketball in one package, instead of having to buy two games, the way American football fans have to buy two football games.</p>



<p>It's also admittedly fun to see 2K and EA compete like this, and to see both seemingly fire small shots at the other, with more understandably coming from 2K at EA's expense, with them being the victor in this collegiate basketball game derby.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-hits-1m-sales.1289844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that sales of recent stealth remake&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>have reached a major milestone.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>has managed to surpass a million sales across both physical and digital versions (and, naturally, across all platforms). This, Konami says, "reflects the enduring popularity of the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-announced-at-state-of-play" rel="nofollow">faithfully-rendered remake</a> of the original 2004 stealth classic, complete with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater-remake-reveals-first-spectacular-gameplay-in-unreal" rel="nofollow">revamped visuals and gameplay</a>, as well as new quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-sales-guards.jpg?itok=o1GsH4Pn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-sales-guards.jpg?itok=JB58wSOC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>has hit a million sales worldwide.</figcaption></figure><p>While the structure of&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater</em>'s story, as well as its original voice acting and music (with the exception of a re-recorded version of the title song), remain intact, the remake has also changed a number of things in order to bring the game up to date.</p>

<p>Changes include a new over-the-shoulder camera mode, as well as the ability to switch between various camo presets on the fly, thus (I think) fixing one of the original game's most irksome problems.</p>

<p>The visuals have also been updated and reworked courtesy of the game's shift to Unreal Engine 5, making for some pretty breathtaking jungle vistas and some rather impressive character model work to boot.</p>

<p>If, however, you're expecting a completely transformative remake along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, you're going to be disappointed;&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>retains the skeleton of the original game, so it's really just the visuals and gameplay that have been tweaked and improved.</p>




<p>If you're playing on PC or PlayStation 5, you'll also find the classic Snake vs. Monkey mode included, and a new Fox Hunt multiplayer mode is also set to debut on all platforms later this year.</p>

<p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater.algolia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater/9pjln214rtkq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>
Not long before joining Rock Paper Shotgun, I wrote a feature for Edge magazine about the origins of the very silly term "AAA game". The overall conclusion I came to is that "AAA game" is possibly a boardroom-level borrowing from the credit rating industry and Hollywood, and that it has little meaning beyond "most expensive/biggest". 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's a bauble casually excreted by pinstriped cats wallowing in jacuzzis sometime in the mid-90s, for the benefit of the investor class. But in much the same way that any fleck of dust can become a pearl, or at least a larger clump of dust, so the term has attracted additional meanings and significance over the ensuing years, partly because game journalists like myself keep taking it seriously.</p>
<p>My interviewees talked about triple-A's association with the shift to polygonal 3D graphics, with certain genres such as the open world, with games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>, and with exclusive hiring practices that require "triple-A experience" and thus have an unavoidable bias, given that "triple-A" studios have often been staffed predominantly by people of a certain race, gender and background.
</p>
<p>
These more specific developments aside, triple-A has shed an A to produce the retrospectively beloved genre of "AA games", aka grainy noughties shooters with a gimmick, and also sprouted additional As. Concluding the Edge write-up, I touched briefly and humorously on Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-defends-skull-and-bones-70-price-despite-its-live-service-leanings-calls-it-quadruple-a/">coining of "AAAA game" </a>in a brazen attempt to mindfuck people complaining about the delayed release and pricing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>. 
</p><p>
As sure as the sparrows fly south for winter, another executive has now gazumped Guillemot. Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters">Ian Games</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/god-help-us-all-gta-6-may-be-a-aaaaa-game-says-devolver-co-founder-and-thats-why-the-entire-industry-is-taking-cover-from-it-like-its-a-nuclear-blast/">Percy Gamer</a> for spotting) about the dark art of competing with other publishers for release dates, Devolver co-founder Nigel Lowrie has described <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> as an "AAAAA game". Here's the complete sentence: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"I mean, there are AAA games and then there's AAAA games and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game, it's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Lowrie isn't the first to try this, admittedly. CD Projekt Red's investor relations VP Karolina Gnaś <a href="https://www.stockwatch.pl/czat-inwestorow-gieldowych/piotr-nielubowicz-chief-financial-officer-i-karolina-gnas-vp-ds-relacji-inwestorskich-cd-projekt-sa-start-29-marca-o-godz-1100,704">has already been there and bought the T-shirt</a>. But Gnaś was poking fun at Ubisoft's "AAAA game" claim at the time, whereas Lowrie seems to be in earnest. 
</p>
<p>
Moreover, he seems to think that "AAAA game" is everyday parlance now. I, for one, was not consulted about this, but I can see why The Industry might be in a hurry to leave AAAA behind. To my knowledge, the only card-carrying AAAA games besides the ailing Skull and Bones are Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, the current record-holder for longest-serving vapourware, and Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot, which was recently cancelled. If AAA means "most expensive/biggest", AAAA basically seems to mean "doomed".
</p><p>
The whole circus is worth following inasmuch as it's a crude illustration of the continuing drive to appease investors who are not content with the "maturation" of returns, and are always looking for the next Level Up. Still, I realise the advanced financial language may be confusing to ordinary humans, so I've put together this quick-and-dirty cheatsheet for both existing A-based videogame lifeforms and those likely to emerge the next time an executive joins an earnings call. Here you go:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
AAA - GTA 3
</p>
<p>
AAAA - Skull and Bones
</p>
<p>
AAAAA - GTA 6
</p>
<p>
AAAAAA - GTA 6 on max settings
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAA - GTA 6 + Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + GTA 3
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + Skull and Bones
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAAA - GTA 6: Ultimate Whale's Edition with fully operational Quantum Field simulation and digital rights management supplied by orbital self-guided "Blundershut &amp; Custard" Clockwork Plasma Cannon array
</p>
<p>
AAAAAAAAAAA - GTA 6 + gravitational implosion of known universe
</p>
<p>
A - In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Gabe, and the Word was Gabe. The same was in the beginning with Gabe. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>
<p>AA - [DESYNCHRONIZED]
</p>
<p>
AAA - GTA 3 again

</p></blockquote>
<p>PS. I've just noticed that Edge feature is on <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/aaa-developers-discuss-the-three-little-letters-that-have-shaped-an-industry-its-a-stupid-term-its-meaningless/">Gamesradar</a> now, if you fancy a read.</p>

BARB eventually switched to focus on MindsEye, but it has so-far failed to do the business for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Benzies told staff that the studio would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye, blaming its struggles on internal and external saboteurs, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post to the MindsEye community issued today, September 5, BARB said “we remain committed to refining MindsEye and enhancing the gameplay experience. Ongoing updates will continue to be shared.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Update 4 introduces a range of UX improvements, numerous performance enhancements, and tackles bugs. Update 4 is significant in terms of size, weighing in at 15GB on PC, 7.2GB on PS5, and 12.1GB on Xbox Series X and S. Update 5 will deliver a "major" performance, combat and enemy AI system improvement, BARB teased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, the CEO of MindsEye publisher IO Interactive, which is working on

If shrooms is victorious this time, it will add a brand-new psychadelic drug type for players to offer to their customer base.</p><p>Hirable drivers, the most functional of the new options, offers players the ability to hire drivers who can transport items between your various properties, businesses, and dealers. This new feature will also come with a quality of life update to the existing delivery system.</p><p>The last new option is a video game classic--a fishing minigame. If players vote to add fishing to Schedule 1, they'll be able to catch fish, with the potential to reel in other special items too. Fishing will act as an extra revenue stream for players who get into it, with the fish you catch able to be sold at Randy's Bait &amp; Tackle store for profit. The update will also add some new ingredients and effects to play with.</p><p>Voting is available to everyone who owns the game, and can be accessed in-game from the main menu.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hell is Us is very focused on its puzzles and exploration gameplay, but there's also a fair amount of combat to deal with. Progression blockers are mostly linked to puzzle solving, but there are a few points in the game where Rogue Factor gives you a combat challenge to move through to the next major story beat, and it's in those instances where you'll want to be prepared.</p>



<p>There are several elements that can go into your combat loadout in Hell is Us, but only a few of them really make a difference. This guide will give you a breakdown of one of the best loadouts possible in the game to give you a dominating presence among the creatures that stalk Hadea.</p>



<h2 id="h-hell-is-us-guide-best-loadout-to-dominate-combat">Hell is Us Guide - Best Loadout to Dominate Combat</h2>



<h3 id="h-combat-basics">Combat Basics</h3>



<figure><figcaption>If you break an enemies stance, you get the chance to watch a finishing move.</figcaption></figure>



<p>First, a few basics about combat in Hell is Us. You have a few different weapons you can choose from, but they're not all made equal for the combat situations Hell is Us throws at you. You're more often than not facing multiple enemies. It's less common that you'll have to deal with only one Hollow creature at a time, and that's due to an elevated variant of enemies that have something called a Haze with them.</p>



<p>Haze's are based on four core emotions that the narrative and lore in Hell is Us focuses on: Rage, Grief, Ecstasy, and Terror. They're color-coded, and there are different tiers of Haze enemies to face, though you won't know what tier you're facing until it appears.</p>



<p>Because of Hollow enemies with Haze, you'll constantly be fighting multiple enemies at once. You have to defeat the Haze before you can damage the Hollow, and each will move independently, so you can be focusing on the Haze, only to be attacked from behind by the Hollow. That's why you'll want to have weapons and abilities that help you crowd-control situations more than anything.</p>



<p>You can block attacks by holding the block button, but parrying is far more effective, and has the chance to break your enemies' stance and perform a killing blow. You have a stamina bar of your own along with your health bar, but part of the trick to Hell is Us is the fact that the less health you have, the less stamina you have available. Keeping both up is paramount to survival.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Haze's have their own attack patterns you'll have to learn in order to defend yourself against them. Image credit: Rogue Factor</figcaption></figure>



<p>Regarding your weapons, you have a few different weapons to choose from, each of which can be altered by one of the four core emotions. Altering the weapons based on the different emotions locks the weapon into only being able to use abilities tied to that specific emotion, and alters its visual appearance. So when you find a pair of Twin Axes, and you make them Terror Twin Axes, their appearance will change, and you'll only be able to attach Terror-based abilities to them.</p>



<p>The four different weapons you can choose from are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sword</li>



<li>Greatsword</li>



<li>Polearm</li>



<li>Twin Axes </li>
</ul>



<p>Each of them can be made into Rage, Grief, Ecstasy, and Terror variants. You can also use them in their neutral forms if you want to, though that's not exactly recommended.</p>



<h3 id="h-loadout-basics">Loadout Basics</h3>



<p>Your loadout in Hell is Us is comprised of five parts: your weapons, of which you can have two equipped at any time. Your defensive gear, which, to be entirely fair, has little impact on combat. Your relics, a passive and an active one, the abilities (called Glyphs) tied to your weapons, and your Drone's abilities (called Modules).</p>



<p>Those are all the parts you can modify, besides what items you can have equipped at any time. A lot of those item slots might be filled with key items for your investigation and exploration, so I won't be going into what items you should have equipped, except to say that it's a good idea to have Lymbic Batteries and Medkits on you for tricky situations.</p>



<p>Lymbic Batteries refill the gauge that lets you use your weapons' abilities, and Medkits heal you without having to use the Healing Pulse mechanic. There are other consumables that can be helpful, but none are more significant than the batteries and medkits.</p>



<p>You can equip one passive relic and one active relic at a time, and two defensive gear items at a time. Each weapon can have three abilities attached to it that are mapped to your D-pad, combined with a press of the left trigger, with the fourth space saved for your active relic, which will be available to you no matter what weapon you have equipped. You can also have four different abilities equipped to your Drone, which, like your abilities on the D-pad, are equipped to face buttons plus a press of your right trigger.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-loadout-to-dominate-combat">The Loadout to Dominate Combat</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Hell is Us loadout screen. </figcaption></figure>



<p>To clarify, this loadout won't exactly be available to you immediately from the beginning of Hell is Us, but you'll be able to build up to it, and there are elements of it you can build early on, like focusing on levelling up the Twin Axes you'll find early in the game.</p>



<p>All weapons are levelled up through a combination of experience points gained through use (or a consumable called a Tuning Stone to fast-track levelling), and increasing their Grade at the Blacksmith in Jova, which is the first major city you'll visit.</p>



<p>Here's everything you'll need for the loadout:</p>



<ul>
<li>Weapons: Twin Axes of Terror, Polearm of Rage
<ul>
<li>Twin Axes Abilities: Frightful Ambush, Feed on Fear, Recoil</li>



<li>Rage Polearm Abilities: Rage Spike, Berserk, Animosity</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Drone Abilities
<ul>
<li>Distract</li>



<li>Whirlwind</li>



<li>Surge Step</li>



<li>Death from Above</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Active Relic: Aster's Band of Domination</li>



<li>Passive Relic: Mark of the Betrayed</li>



<li>Defensive Gear: Bracers of Rage, Bracelet of Ecstasy</li>
</ul>



<p>Below are explanations of every element of it, and why they each make a significant part of the loadout that'll have you dominating combat in Hell is Us:</p>



<p><strong>Weapons</strong>: </p>



<ul>
<li>Polearm of Rage</li>



<li>Twin Axes of Terror</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Twin Axes of Terror in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Twin Axes are the fastest weapon in the game, making them ideal for parrying attacks. You'll find a pair of Twin Axes in the very first area of the game, and while they won't do as much damage per hit as the sword you start with, their speed outweighs that disadvantage, especially when you can increase their damage through levelling.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The Polearm of Rage in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Polearm, for anyone who has played Dark Souls or Elden Ring, is similar to a Halberd in that it can be used like a spear, but also gives you a wide horizontal range of attack, letting you damage multiple enemies in front of you at once. It has a faster parry timing than the Greatsword and more range than the standard Sword, while also still being capable of heavy attacks. All of this is what makes it a top choice, along with the Twin Axes. Between both weapons, you're covering your needs for crowd-control, agility, and strong attacks to deal huge damage in a single blow. You'll also find a Polearm early on, in the second area you visit in the game.</p>



<p><strong>Rage Polearm Abilities:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Rage Spike
<ul>
<li>This lets you fire a lance that shoots out of your Polearm at enemies, and is one of the few abilities that lets you attack from a range. The lance will also explode on impact for extra damage. You'll find the first level of this Glyph by closing the Timeloop in Acasa Marshes. You'll find the top-level 'Elite' version of it in the Marastan Vault of Forbidden Knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Berserk
<ul>
<li>This Glyph will put you in a state of rage that keeps you from being stunned, staggered, or knocked back for 40 seconds, and is a great way to keep the pressure on your enemies. You'll find the base version of it in Vitalis' secret office. You'll find its Elite variant by closing a Timeloop in Jeljin.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Animosity
<ul>
<li>This chain's enemies to you and pulls them in closer in melee range, while also stunning them in the process. You find the base level of this Glyph in the Sendra Forest Vault of Forbidden Knowledge. You'll find the Elite version of it by closing the Timeloop in Auriga Museum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Terror Twin Axes Abilities:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Frightful Ambush
<ul>
<li>Another area-of-affect ability, creating a pool of damage around you that damages your enemies and has the added bonus of stunning them. You'll find the base version of this Glyph by solving the Blood Queen’s Story Room mystery. You'll find the Elite version of it in the Marastan Vault of Forbidden Knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Feed on Fear
<ul>
<li>This links you to a targeted enemy and lets you drain their health to heal yourself from range, and is another one of the limited ranged attacks available in Hell is Us. You'll find the base version of this Glyph in the Senedra Forest Vault of Forbidden Knowledge. You'll find the Elite version of it by closing a Timeloop in Auriga Museum. </li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Recoil
<ul>
<li>Makes you jump backwards and stun enemies near you. Again, another solid crowd controlling method that keeps you in control of the flow of combat encounters. You'll find the base version of this Glyph in Vitalis' secret office. You'll find its Elite version by closing a Timeloop in Marastan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Active Relic:</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Aster's Band of Domination Active Relic in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Aster's Band of Domination
<ul>
<li>This stuns all nearby enemies for 10 seconds, and is one of the more useful active relics purely because it has the shortest cooldown of only 3 minutes, whereas most others take 9 minutes to recharge. You'll find this relic in the Vyssa Hills Vault of Forbidden Knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Passive Relic:</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Mark of the Betrayed Passive Relic in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Mark of the Betrayed
<ul>
<li>This is the key to the whole build, because it absolutely changes the way you'll play the whole game. With this in your loadout, you'll deal 200% damage for the next 10 seconds. If you can chain link successful parries, then you'll take almost everything down in three to four strikes. You'll find this Relic by closing a Timeloop in Acasa Marshes.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Alt: The Blood of the Phelange
<ul>
<li>I mention this because it is also effective, but the barrier to activating it is a bit more of a fence to hop over. You increase the damage dealt with each attack after every kill by 25% for 30 seconds, though, of course, it's easier to hit a successful parry and keep your damage output up than having to wait for a kill, especially when you will have the odd time where it's just one major enemy in front of you, making this passive ineffective. Consider it an alt, but Mark of the Betrayed is what you should use. You'll find this Relic by closing a Timeloop in Vyssa Hills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Drone Abilities:</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Distract Drone Module in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Distract
<ul>
<li>This is the first ability or 'Module' you'll get for your drone in Hell is Us, and it's effective the whole game. With crowd-control being such a big part of combat, being able to take at least one enemy off the board by distracting them and keeping them stunned until you attack that specific enemy. You get the base version of this Module almost immediately after you fight your first Hollow in the game. You'll find the Elite version of it by completing the Locked Computer mystery in the Research Department of the Auriga Museum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Whirlwind Drone Module in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Whirlwind
<ul>
<li>This ability spins you around really fast and lets you hold out your arms and attack enemies around you, which is a tactic that covers plenty of ground, either with the Twin Axes or the Polearm. You'll find the base version of this Module just ahead of the tunnel you enter to check out the ON convoy in Acasa Marshes. You'll find the Elite version of this it in the OMSIF training area's supply room in Auriga Museum. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Surge Step Drone Module in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Surge Step
<ul>
<li>This ability is like having an extended dash, as the drone will pick you up and almost throw you out of the way of an oncoming attack. You'll find the base version of this Module on a fallen ON agent in Jova, near the Blacksmith shop in the Acasa Marshes area. You'll find its Elite variant in the Drone workshop in the Auriga Museum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Death from Above Drone Module in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Death From Above
<ul>
<li>This one is another which is what it sounds like. It's a ground-pound for those who first learned about slamming attacks from platformers. The drone picks you up, and you do a strong attack slamming into the ground, dealing a large chunk of damage to enemies. You'll find the base version of this Module near Agatha's body in Vyssa Hills. You'll find the Elite variant of it in a OMSIF crate in Marastan in the backyard of a house on the path to the Deimos Division camp. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Defensive Gear:</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Bracers of Rage in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Bracers of Rage
<ul>
<li>This gives you some health back with each hit you deal against an enemy. You'll find them by completing the Aster’s Safehouse secret. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Bracelet of Ecstasy in Hell is Us.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Bracelet of Ecstasy
<ul>
<li>All of your attacks take less stamina to perform, a helpful trick to have up your sleeve, considering how stamina and health are tied. You get this by solving the Caddel's Brothers Treasure mystery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond swapping out the base versions of these Glyphs and Modules for the stronger ones, it should go without saying that to improve your damage output, you should be levelling up your weapons. But these are the bones of what gives you the best loadout in the game to help you absolutely dominate combat encounters in Hell is Us. Plenty of these pieces can be found in the game's early hours as well, so you'll have the full game to turn it into the powerhouse it evolves into by the end of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yet more industry layoffs have been announced, and this time, it's the turn of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Midnight Suns&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>developer Firaxis Games to let some of its staff members go.</p>

<p>Said layoffs were confirmed by Firaxis' parent company 2K to the folks at <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>. Of course, 2K describes the staff cuts as the studio "restructur[ing] and optimiz[ing] its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity".</p>

<p>Naturally, 2K stopped short of confirming just how many staff members were laid off, but Game Developer, citing "sources close to the situation", says that "dozens of people" have been let go in this layoff wave.</p>

Despite that, however, Zelnick expressed faith in the game, suggesting it had high "lifetime value".</p>

<p><em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>was released in February this year, and upon its debut, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">met with a mixed reception</a> from players, who cited a poor user interface and significant gameplay changes compared to previous franchise installments as their reasons for leaving negative reviews.</p>

<p>Firaxis subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">pledged to improve the game</a> and to implement updates based on player feedback, but despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-update-110-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">some significant patches</a> arriving since&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII</em>'s launch, it seems this wasn't enough to save these Firaxis employees from the chopping block.</p>

<p>These layoffs aren't even the first that 2K has put into effect this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I wrote that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">no one should buy</a> MSI and Intel’s original handheld gaming PC. I literally called it an embarrassment, and the company blacklisted me after that. MSI stopped pitching me news, and stopped answering my emails, even after the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170904/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-lunar-lake-battery-computex">began to write off its dud of a handheld</a>.</p><p>So you can imagine my surprise to find: MSI and Intel have gone from worst to nearly first. In many games, it’s <em>twice</em> as fast as the original Claw. And with new drivers that bump its performance up to 30 percent higher since launch — I tested — the newer $1,000 <a href="https://www.msi.com/Handheld/Claw-8-AI-Plus-A2VMX/Specification">MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> might just be the best Windows handheld you can buy.</p><p>The Claw 8 has become a fixture in my life as I carve and puzzle through the hauntingly beautiful painted worlds of <em>Clair Obscur:</em> <em>Expedition 33</em> and <em>Blue Prince</em>, respectively. I have a lot of other handheld review units floating around, but I rarely want to reach for a different one.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Let’s get this out of the way<strong>: </strong>it’s called the “AI Plus” because this “AI Engine” is supposed to automatically configure performance using Intel’s NPU. But it’s very dumb in practice and not a reason to buy.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Yes, it runs Windows, and if you’ve read any of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/704903/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-os-review-z2-go-z1-extreme">my handheld reviews</a> you’ll know how I feel about that. Windows 11 has become a bloated mess filled with annoying upsells and unwanted AI cruft, is annoying to navigate by controller alone, and often wakes up poorly from sleep. I can’t count the number of times I’ve sworn at Windows handhelds for popping awake in the middle of the night, or spontaneously deciding it was time to turn their remaining battery life into hot exhaust in the middle of my sealed backpack.</p><p>But the MSI Claw 8, with Intel’s Lunar Lake, isn’t as bad as the Windows norm. When you combine that with the newly improved performance, the longest battery life of any handheld in all but the most lightweight games, and an excellent 8-inch 120Hz VRR screen, it’s enough to knock <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the Asus ROG Ally X off its high perch</a> — at least until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">the Xbox version</a> arrives this October.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->999</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Best battery life in a handheld</li><li>Excellent performance after updates</li><li>Great variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Fewer Windows annoyances than usual</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>$1,000</li><li>Windows is bloated and can’t be trusted to sleep</li><li>Iffy rumble for games</li><li>AI tuning feature doesn’t work well</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The MSI Claw 8 AI Plus is the biggest mainstream handheld, at nearly a foot long, 5 inches tall, and an inch thick, and it’s the only current-gen handheld with an Intel chip. Last year, both size and Intel pedigree were liabilities — but thankfully every handheld maker is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24351383/handheld-pcs-challenge-switch-2-editorial#:~:text=Handheld%20ergonomics%20was%20one%20bright%20spot%20going%20into%202025.">paying more attention to ergonomics</a> this year, and Intel’s Lunar Lake is a big improvement.</p><p>Scalloped grips and balanced weight distribution make the Claw comfortable for me to hold, it no longer looks like a ROG Ally knockoff, and while it isn’t light at 1.75 pounds (795g), that’s only a quarter-pound heavier than the Ally X. That’s despite the Claw having an extra inch of diagonal screen real estate and the same 80 watt-hour battery capacity as Asus.</p><div id=":Rkbcmab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The MSI Claw is wider, taller, and roughly as grippy as the Asus ROG Ally X…</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>And it’s bigger and grippier than the Lenovo Legion Go S, which also has an 8-inch screen.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I honestly found it tough to go back to playing <em>Expedition 33</em> on the Asus ROG Ally X after using the Claw 8, partially because its 8-inch 120Hz 1920 x 1200 VRR IPS screen is more colorful and more spacious (with a far smaller bezel), and partially because the game ran smoother. (I beat the game, including the entire Endless Tower and four of the game’s toughest boss fights, on the Claw 8.)</p><p>But before all that, I had to tangle with Windows 11 — and was surprised how little detangling was needed.</p><p>The first time I fired up the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus, I couldn’t believe how fast Windows setup had become. Instead of the typical 45 minutes of annoying upsells and mandatory updates, I was able to get to the Windows desktop just seven minutes after I pressed the power button.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>MSI’s “Quick Settings” are now part of the Xbox Game Bar in Windows.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>That’s still slower than setting up a SteamOS handheld, but fast enough I thought there must be some mistake! (Did this really get past Microsoft certification?) Another curiosity: When I hit the button that pulls up the Claw’s quick settings menu to adjust brightness, volume, and my processor’s TDP (giving it more wattage/gas), it launched a new widget in the Xbox Game Bar with those handy controls instead of a dedicated MSI process! Did somebody accidentally slip me a preview <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">of Microsoft’s “best of Xbox and Windows together”</a> that’ll ship on the Xbox Ally later this year?</p><p>But I won’t lie and say the Windows experience was flawless after that. MSI’s Game Bar widget turned out to be incredibly sluggish and unreliable out of the box. It got better after I changed the Windows power mode from “Balanced” to “Best Performance,” but it still isn’t nearly as fast as Asus’ Armory Crate, which has gotten extremely responsive since the Ally first launched, or as reliable as SteamOS, which doesn’t require a separate utility at all.</p><div><h2>Here’s how much MSI has improved:</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>MSI Claw 8 AI Plus (Aug ’25)</h3></th><th><h3>MSI Claw 8 AI Plus (Jun ’25)</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 3-mo improvement</h3></th><th><h3>Claw battery drain (August)</h3></th><th><h3>Claw battery drain (June)</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 7 (Meteor Lake, Jun ’24)</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 Lunar Lake vs. Claw 7 Meteor Lake</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>49</td><td>34.69%</td><td>20.5W (~3.9h)</td><td>23W (~3.5h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>78</td><td>59</td><td>32.20%</td><td>25.5W (~3.1h)</td><td>29W (~2.8h)</td><td>33</td><td>136.36%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>84</td><td>69</td><td>21.74%</td><td>32W (~2.5h)</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>53</td><td>58.49%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>85</td><td>79</td><td>7.59%</td><td>38W (~2.1h)</td><td>39.5W (~2h)</td><td>54</td><td>57.41%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>86</td><td>83</td><td>3.61%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>54</td><td>59.26%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>51</td><td>48</td><td>6.25%</td><td>20W (~4h)</td><td>20.5W (~3.9h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>57</td><td>5.26%</td><td>25W (~3.2h)</td><td>26W (~3.1h)</td><td>32</td><td>87.50%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>71</td><td>65</td><td>9.23%</td><td>31.5W (~2.5h)</td><td>31.5W (~2.5h)</td><td>49</td><td>44.90%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>76</td><td>72</td><td>5.56%</td><td>37.5W (~2.1h)</td><td>37W (~2.2h)</td><td>41</td><td>85.37%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>77</td><td>79</td><td>-2.53%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>49</td><td>57.14%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>79</td><td>66</td><td>19.70%</td><td>22.5W (~3.6h)</td><td>21.5W (~3.6h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>93</td><td>81</td><td>14.81%</td><td>29.5W (~2.7h)</td><td>27W (~3h)</td><td>45</td><td>106.67%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>105</td><td>91</td><td>15.38%</td><td>31W (~2.6h)</td><td>32W (~2.5h)</td><td>49</td><td>114.29%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>114</td><td>100</td><td>14.00%</td><td>37W (~2.2h)</td><td>37W (~2.2h)</td><td>48</td><td>137.50%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>119</td><td>107</td><td>11.21%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>58</td><td>105.17%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>40</td><td>30</td><td>33.33%</td><td>20W (~4h)</td><td>22W (~3.6h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>48</td><td>36</td><td>33.33%</td><td>26.5W (~3h)</td><td>27W (~3h)</td><td>29</td><td>65.52%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>52</td><td>41</td><td>26.83%</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>32W (~2.5h)</td><td>38</td><td>36.84%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>54</td><td>43</td><td>25.58%</td><td>42.5W (~1.9h)</td><td>37.5W (~2.1h)</td><td>39</td><td>38.46%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>56</td><td>44</td><td>27.27%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>37</td><td>51.35%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>51</td><td>7.84%</td><td>21W (~3.8h)</td><td>23W (~3.5h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>60</td><td>10.00%</td><td>27W (~3h)</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>32</td><td>106.25%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>73</td><td>68</td><td>7.35%</td><td>35W (~2.3h)</td><td>35.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>38</td><td>92.11%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>81</td><td>74</td><td>9.46%</td><td>42W (~1.9h)</td><td>41W (~2h)</td><td>39</td><td>107.69%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>81</td><td>75</td><td>8.00%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>42</td><td>92.86%</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>31</td><td>31</td><td>0.00%</td><td>21.5W (~3.6h)</td><td>24.5W (~3.3h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>37</td><td>37</td><td>0.00%</td><td>28W (~2.9h)</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>Did not test</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>42</td><td>41</td><td>2.44%</td><td>34.5W (~2.3h)</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>Did not test</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>42</td><td>4.76%</td><td>40W (~2h)</td><td>39W (~2.1h)</td><td>Did not test</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>46</td><td>45</td><td>2.22%</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>Did not test</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average frame rates at 720p and low settings, save </em>Cyberpunk<em> at “Steam Deck” setting. </em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>And no, I can never, ever trust the Claw 8’s power button to keep it asleep. I always have to explicitly put the system into hibernation mode instead, which is thankfully the first option in that Game Bar widget. (Microsoft really needs to get out of its own way and let manufacturers set the power button to hibernate instead of Modern Standby.)</p><p>It’s also a little frustrating to go back to a world where I have to manually download the latest Intel graphics drivers because they never showed up in MSI Center’s updates tab. But once I installed those new graphics drivers and learned to avoid the power button, I was rewarded with some of the highest performance and the best battery life I’ve seen from a handheld yet. It’s just better at the whole turbo mode thing, with higher frame rates and higher TDP options than the Ally X with Windows, and it’s more power-efficient than the SteamOS Lenovo Legion Go S, even if Lenovo’s Steam handheld got higher frame rates in half my benchmarks.</p><div><h2>Claw 8 vs. Ally X vs. Legion Go S vs. Steam Deck performance</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 fps</h3></th><th><h3>ROG Ally X (Windows, Z1E) fps</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (SteamOS, Z1E) fps</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED fps</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 vs. Ally X</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 vs. Legion Go S</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 vs. Deck</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>52</td><td>66</td><td>57</td><td>26.92%</td><td>0.00%</td><td>15.79%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>78</td><td>71</td><td>84</td><td>N/A</td><td>9.86%</td><td>-7.14%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>84</td><td>80</td><td>92</td><td>N/A</td><td>5.00%</td><td>-8.70%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>85</td><td>89</td><td>96</td><td>N/A</td><td>-4.49%</td><td>-11.46%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>86</td><td>89</td><td>92</td><td>57</td><td>-3.37%</td><td>-6.52%</td><td>50.88%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>51</td><td>41</td><td>57</td><td>50</td><td>24.39%</td><td>-10.53%</td><td>2.00%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>59</td><td>73</td><td>N/A</td><td>1.69%</td><td>-17.81%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>71</td><td>65</td><td>79</td><td>N/A</td><td>9.23%</td><td>-10.13%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>76</td><td>71</td><td>82</td><td>N/A</td><td>7.04%</td><td>-7.32%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>77</td><td>71</td><td>86</td><td>50</td><td>8.45%</td><td>-10.47%</td><td>54.00%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>79</td><td>59</td><td>74</td><td>61</td><td>33.90%</td><td>6.76%</td><td>29.51%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>93</td><td>84</td><td>92</td><td>N/A</td><td>10.71%</td><td>1.09%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>105</td><td>91</td><td>99</td><td>N/A</td><td>15.38%</td><td>6.06%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>114</td><td>93</td><td>100</td><td>N/A</td><td>22.58%</td><td>14.00%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>119</td><td>93</td><td>102</td><td>61</td><td>27.96%</td><td>16.67%</td><td>95.08%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>40</td><td>31</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>29.03%</td><td>66.67%</td><td>60.00%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>48</td><td>40</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td><td>20.00%</td><td>60.00%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>52</td><td>43</td><td>32</td><td>N/A</td><td>20.93%</td><td>62.50%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>54</td><td>46</td><td>33</td><td>N/A</td><td>17.39%</td><td>63.64%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>56</td><td>46</td><td>34</td><td>25</td><td>21.74%</td><td>64.71%</td><td>124.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>52</td><td>62</td><td>57</td><td>5.77%</td><td>-11.29%</td><td>-3.51%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>65</td><td>83</td><td>N/A</td><td>1.54%</td><td>-20.48%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>73</td><td>70</td><td>89</td><td>N/A</td><td>4.29%</td><td>-17.98%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>81</td><td>76</td><td>93</td><td>N/A</td><td>6.58%</td><td>-12.90%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>81</td><td>76</td><td>96</td><td>57</td><td>6.58%</td><td>-15.63%</td><td>42.11%</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>31</td><td>28</td><td>37</td><td>33</td><td>10.71%</td><td>-16.22%</td><td>-6.06%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>37</td><td>30</td><td>47</td><td>N/A</td><td>23.33%</td><td>-21.28%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>42</td><td>28</td><td>50</td><td>N/A</td><td>50.00%</td><td>-16.00%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>34</td><td>52</td><td>N/A</td><td>29.41%</td><td>-15.38%</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>46</td><td>34</td><td>55</td><td>33</td><td>35.29%</td><td>-16.36%</td><td>39.39%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average frame rates at 720p and low settings, save </em>Cyberpunk<em> at “Steam Deck” setting.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>We’re not talking about a step change in performance here: this pricy $1,000 handheld still doesn’t have near the frame rate of a similarly priced gaming laptop. It’s just enough extra power to make games feel smooth on this handheld that were borderline choppy on its peers, like <em>Expedition 33</em> (even then, these handhelds need AI upscaling to get there).</p><p>But I <em>didn’t</em> have to sacrifice battery life to get that extra power. I often even push the Claw 8’s chip to 30 watts, a power mode that the Asus ROG Ally X doesn’t offer unless plugged in, for an extra frame rate advantage — while getting roughly the same battery life as the Ally X gets at its 25W unplugged maximum.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>MSI Claw 8 vs. Asus ROG Ally X ports and width.</em> <em>The Claw still has handy raised dots on each port to find them by feel.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>And though the Steam Deck has long reigned as the efficiency champ, I found the Claw 8 can even beat the Steam Deck on both performance <em>and</em> power use when set to the same 15-watt TDP, often draining its battery 2 or even 3 watts slower. When you combine that with its big 80-watt-hour pack, it handily beat competitors in my <em>Dirt Rally</em> drain test, lasting nearly 19 minutes longer than the Asus ROG Ally X with Bazzite, 28 minutes longer than the Steam Deck OLED, and 80 minutes longer than the Legion Go S with SteamOS and AMD’s Z1 Extreme chip.</p><p>Below, you can see how battery life might compare at each performance tier. For example: the Claw 8 and Legion Go S with SteamOS both offer the same 66 frames per second when you offer their chips 15 watts of electricity, but you’ll probably get 3.9 hours of battery from the Claw versus 2.3 hours from the Legion. That’s because MSI’s Intel chip is drawing less power from a larger battery.</p><div><h2>Battery life vs. performance</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Claw 8 fps</h3></th><th><h3>Claw battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>ROG Ally X (Windows, Z1E) fps</h3></th><th><h3>Ally X battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (SteamOS, Z1E) fps</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED fps</h3></th><th><h3>Deck battery drain</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>20.5W (~3.9h)</td><td>52</td><td>24W (~3.3h)</td><td>66</td><td>24W (~2.3h)</td><td>57</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>78</td><td>25.5W (~3.1h)</td><td>71</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>84</td><td>30.5W (~1.8h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>84</td><td>32W (~2.5h)</td><td>80</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>92</td><td>36W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>85</td><td>38W (~2.1h)</td><td>89</td><td>N/A</td><td>96</td><td>43.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>51</td><td>20W (~4h)</td><td>41</td><td>22W (~3.6h)</td><td>57</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>50</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>25W (~3.2h)</td><td>59</td><td>29W (~2.7h)</td><td>73</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>71</td><td>31.5W (~2.5h)</td><td>65</td><td>35W (~2.2h)</td><td>79</td><td>38W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>76</td><td>37.5W (~2.1h)</td><td>71</td><td>N/A</td><td>82</td><td>44.5W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>79</td><td>22.5W (~3.6h)</td><td>59</td><td>22W (~3.6h)</td><td>74</td><td>25.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>61</td><td>22W (~2.2h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>93</td><td>29.5W (~2.7h)</td><td>84</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>92</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>105</td><td>31W (~2.6h)</td><td>91</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>99</td><td>38.5W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>114</td><td>37W (~2.2h)</td><td>93</td><td>N/A</td><td>100</td><td>45W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>40</td><td>20W (~4h)</td><td>31</td><td>23W (~3.5h)</td><td>24</td><td>25.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>25</td><td>23W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>48</td><td>26.5W (~3h)</td><td>40</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>30</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>52</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>43</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>32</td><td>38.5W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>54</td><td>42.5W (~1.9h)</td><td>46</td><td>N/A</td><td>33</td><td>45.5W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>21W (~3.8h)</td><td>52</td><td>23W (~3.5h)</td><td>62</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>57</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>27W (~3h)</td><td>65</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>83</td><td>31.5W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>73</td><td>35W (~2.3h)</td><td>70</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>89</td><td>37.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>81</td><td>42W (~1.9h)</td><td>76</td><td>N/A</td><td>93</td><td>43.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>31</td><td>21.5W (~3.6h)</td><td>28</td><td>23W (~3.5h)</td><td>37</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>33</td><td>23W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>37</td><td>28W (~2.9h)</td><td>30</td><td>30W (~2.6h)</td><td>47</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>42</td><td>34.5W (~2.3h)</td><td>28</td><td>36W (~2.2h)</td><td>50</td><td>37.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>40W (~2h)</td><td>34</td><td>N/A</td><td>52</td><td>44W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average frame rates at 720p and low settings, save </em>Cyberpunk<em> at “Steam Deck” setting.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>All this said, you still can’t ease off the gas <em>quite</em> like with AMD chips, at least not out of the box. Officially, the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V is a 17W–37W chip, and while MSI lets you set the chip’s TDP as low as 8 watts, I still saw the Claw empty my battery at a rate of at least 11W in<em> Balatro</em>, the magic poker game I use as my best-case-scenario test. That means at minimum screen brightness, with wireless off, I’m getting around seven hours max — whereas the Steam Deck OLED can get nine hours and the Asus ROG Ally X can manage 10 in such lightweight games.</p><p>I have some quibbles with the Claw’s hardware. Though the speakers are above average, the rumble is annoying and weak. Hall effect joysticks and dedicated gyro modes are nice, but aiming felt sloppy out of the box, like MSI didn’t bother tuning either to a console controller standard, and I still haven’t quite nailed it with tweaks in either individual game settings or MSI Center. It’s also not the fastest handheld to charge or download games, despite its two Thunderbolt 4 ports and Wi-Fi 7, though not slow either.</p><div><p>But the real hurdles for the Claw 8 are that $1,000 price — and that MSI might only have one more whole month atop the Windows heap. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762116/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-compatibility">Microsoft and Asus’ Xbox Ally is coming October 16th</a>, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">a revamped OS</a>, and it could reshape the whole handheld market.</p></div><div><div><p id="handheld-power-explained"><h2><strong>Handheld power, explained</strong></h2></p></div><p>You might have noticed I write about two different kind of wattage measurements (W) in my handheld reviews: 1) the TDP of each handheld’s chip, which basically translates to how much power you’re letting it use, and 2) the handheld’s total battery drain.</p><p>That’s because of a sea change in how portable gaming works. Unlike traditional laptops, today’s handhelds let you <em>configure</em> their processor’s TDP at a moment’s notice, even while you’re in the middle of a game, to give you more oomph. But when you do that — or when a manufacturer sets a higher default TDP so their handheld seems faster out of the box — it’ll drain your battery faster.</p><p>How much faster? You can find the answers in my charts, along with estimates of how quickly your battery will go from 100 percent to zero if you choose that TDP in a given game. And make no mistake, some games won’t run well on a handheld unless you choose a high TDP.</p><p>But the battery drain wattage is <em>not</em> the same as TDP, because it doesn’t account for all the rest of the handheld’s systems, including its storage and screen, that each game might push differently. Frame rate per watt drained is what to look for if you care about battery.</p></div><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You can never have too much storage space. If you’re someone who works with huge files such as a photographer or video editor, you don’t have to be told twice. When a good external drive goes on sale, it’s hard to pass it up. Well, that’s exactly what this is. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3932/">The Samsung T7 Shield is available at Amazon with three different storage capacities — all off which are discounted by as much as $125</a>. Right now, the 1TB model is down 19% from $135 to just $110, the 2TB model is down 35% from $230 to $150, and the 4TB model is down from $405 to $280.</p>
<p>Creators were front of mind when Samsung developed this external solid state drive. It doesn’t matter if you are a photographer in need to backing up your pictures, a video editor managing a ton of projects and footage, or anyone else dealing with big files all day long — the T7 Shield can keep up with you. This SSD has fast read and write speeds. You’re getting up to 1,050 MB/s read speeds and up to 1,000 MB/s write speeds. That clocks in two times faster than the T5 from Samsung. It also happens to be nearly 10 times faster than an HDD would be. This means you’ll be able to move files between your work station and external drive quickly and easily.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3932/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>For the videographers out there, the Samsung T7 Shield is an especially useful tool for your toolkit. This model lets you record in 4K at 60fps directly onto the drive, using a camera, smartphone, or tablet. It’s even compatible with the iPhone 15 Pro. No need to anxiously delete stuff from your camera roll before you can get the shot.</p>
<p>You have a choice of three different colors with the T7 Shield—pick between either black, beige, or blue. What I love about this is if you need to get multiple, just grab them in different colors. This way at a glance, you’ll quickly be able to remember which one is for what.</p>



<h2>Ruggedly Reliable</h2>
<p>As the name states, this is the Shield model of Samsung’s T7 SSD. It’s designed with a strong, rubberized exterior wrapped around a solid aluminum body. It’s got an IP65 rating, making it both water and dust resistant and it can even withstand a fall of 9.8 feet. Your data is well protected.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3932/">Right now, Amazon has the 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB models of the Samsung T7 Shield on sale for as much as 35% off.</a> Grab one before they go back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3932/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-may-be-a-forced-choice-to-overcome-cartridge-limitations.1289775/</guid>

			<p>Releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> games on Game-Key Cards may be a forced choice for some developers due to raditional cartridges' technical limitations.</p>



<p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cubusaddendum.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, Ubisoft Snowdrop Engine audio architect Rob Bantin provided some interesting insight on why a developer may choose to release a game on a Game Key Card, revealing that the Switch 2 cartridges didn't give the performance needed at the quality target they were going for in the Star Wars Outlaws. The game is powered by the Snowdrop engine, which heavily relies on disk streaming for its open-world environments.</p>







<p>While this is a critical limitation, it shouldn't impact every Nintendo Switch 2 game moving forward. In a second message, the Snowdrop engine developer said that if a game is designed from the ground up for the system, the carts' performance limitations may not force a Game-Key card release, but as Star Wars Outlaws was built around the SSDs of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, there was no choice but to release the game in Game-Key card format.</p>







<p>Judging from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars Outlaws footage</a> released online so far, it seems like Ubisoft definitely made the right call, as even with some noticeable visual downgrades over the other versions of the game, the Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game is really solid, keeping a steady 30 FPS framerate even in open-world areas while also featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-early-footage-analysis-highlights-need-for-ray-reconstruction/">ray-traced effects</a>. Now that the console is out and its specs widely known, hopefully more developers will be able to work around some of the cartridges' technical limitations and release more proper retail releases, which Nintendo Switch 2 owners seem to love, looking at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/75-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical/">sales data of games like Cyberpunk 2077</a></p>

                <p>One Ubisoft developer has explained why Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 will rely on Game Key Cards instead of standard cartridges, citing technical limitations of the console’s physical media.</p><p>Responding to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dark1x.bsky.social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry's John Linneman</a> on BlueSky, audio architect for the Snowdrop Engine at Ubisoft Rob Bantin explained that the game "relies heavily on disk-streaming for its open-world environments" and that Switch 2 cartridges simply did not give the performance needed for the game to hit its quality target. "I think if we'd designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different. As it was, we'd build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case I think our leadership made the right call," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cubusaddendum.bsky.social/post/3lxzukm3glk2e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bantin wrote</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars Outlaws Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Game Key Cards have already stirred controversy among Nintendo fans, as they serve as a download-key holder rather than containing the full game on the cart. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">While they can be resold and aren’t console-locked</a>, critics have argued that they pose potential issues for long-term games preservation.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws looks like a respectable third-party game on the Switch 2, as gameplay footage of it so far has shown off a consistent 30fps performance. While it's naturally not as good-looking as the PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S versions, the fact that Ubisoft has managed to get the game running generally well on the Switch 2 bodes well for the system and potential upcoming releases from the company. In comparison, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/">Elden Ring's Switch 2 performance isn't great at all</a>, according to reports.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws launched for Switch 2 on September 4, a year after it was first released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. This version of the game includes both of its DLC expansions--Wild Card and A Pirate's Fortune--but the game might be a one-off considering that it wasn't a commercial hit for Ubisoft. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-brand-trouble-for-disappointing-outlaws-sales/1100-6533297/">Company CEO Yves Guillemot recently blamed the Star Wars brand</a> being in "choppy waters" as one of the reasons why the game didn't reach Ubisoft's sales expectations, although its worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/">reviewers and fans criticized the game</a> for its badly paced intro mission and various technical issues when it first launched.</p><p>Most of these issues have been addressed since then, and the post-launch expansions have been well-received.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a27af05310361/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>For those of you who managed to bag a Switch 2 on 5th June, you've had that big dock set up near the TV for exactly three months now. Are you tired of 'clacking' those Joy-Con into the system yet? Nope, us neither.</p>
<p>In that time, we've seen over 50 games come to the platform, large and small. While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/developers-reportedly-still-struggling-to-get-switch-2-dev-kits">some devs are still struggling</a> to get dev kits, other tiny outfits have managed to secure a Switch 2 release. Nintendo is keeping its hands tight on the eShop reins and being very particular in who it allows on the platform, it seems - presumably to prevent a deluge of titles that might distract from the platform holder's early offerings.</p>
<p>So, compared to its predecessor (which is still getting new games on a weekly basis, in amongst all the unspeakable slop), the rate of new releases is much slower. And the fact that many S2 games are reworked versions of old software or ports from other platforms means 100% new experiences have been thin on the ground. For multiplatform gamers who don't have a backlog to keep them busy, it's possible you'd look at the lineup of available Switch 2 games below and feel...disappointed.</p>

<p>Then again, it's hard to argue with the quality, old or otherwise! With several all-timers in there, there's plenty to play, and the long-awaited <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> definitely injects some much-needed 'brand new' into the library. (We're still working on our review, by the way - we'll have it with you as soon as we can.)</p>
<p>But what do you think of the Switch 2 library as it stands? Are there any gems in there which have flown under the radar and surprised you? Have all the big hitters landed for you? How would you rate the games in your collection so far?</p>
<p>Now that we've crossed the threshold of 50 games, we'll be publishing our reader-ranked list of the system's best games very soon, so take a look at the lineup below and feel free to rate any games you've played accordingly. (If you've rated any game previously, thank you! It will show up in red already, so no need to do so again - unless you wanted to revise your opinion, of course.)</p>

<p>And finally, let us know what you think of the overall software catalogue up to now by scoring the overall offering:</p>

<p>For our money? The library so far is an incredibly solid base to build on — and there are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/27-upcoming-nintendo-switch-2-games-were-excited-for-in-2025">some very exciting games coming</a>. With record-breaking console sales in a suboptimal economic environment, Switch 2 is doing very nicely after three months. There's work to do, but the future's bright in Nintendo Land, so here's to that!</p>
<p><em>Thanks for rating. Okay, back to Silksong with you.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/poll-three-months-in-how-would-you-rate-switch-2s-library-so-far]]></content:encoded>
