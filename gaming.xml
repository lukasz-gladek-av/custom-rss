            <p>It's fair to say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s anniversary update's earned some stick due to effect it had on PC mods, just like the RPG's next-gen update did before it. Lots of works needed updating, and while that happened <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-script-extender-has-already-gotten-its-anniversary-update-as-bethesda-battle-creation-issues">pretty quickly in a number of cases</a>, there was still disruption for some additions that generally feel a lot more necessary over on console.</p>
<p>Enter modding platform Nexus Mods, who've decided to follow-up the update by putting together their own "anniversary collection" of Fallout 4 mods from the works they host, with hopes it'll serve as a free alternative aimed at celebrating ten years of the RPG being modded.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Last week Fallout 4 turned ten," reads <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15406">the announcement</a> of this mod collection penned by Nexus Mods content team member ModularCocoon. "A whole decade since we stepped out into the Commonwealth for the first time and while Bethesda marked the occasion with an Anniversary Update, let’s be honest, it didn’t quite land with the impact many hoped for. So we've decided to mark the milestone our own way!"</p>
<p>Hence what's currently a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/fallout4/collections/lepwiy/mods">56-strong list of mods</a> designed to serve as "a fully curated, fully compatible, and completely free celebration of ten years of modding creativity". It's a mix of already popular stuff, including quest mods like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/75767?tab=description">America Rising 2 - Legacy of the Enclave</a> by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-best-enclave-quest-mod-creator-reveals-how-it-came-to-be">Otellino</a>, gear like the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/77496">anti-material rifle</a> by Nostoso, and world tweaks such as SabutaiKhan's mod which adds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/51945">Talon Company mercenaries</a> to The Commonwealth. There are also some settlement additions and a new location in the form of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84449">Boon Island</a> by Tenhats and Shreddah4, with the latter having recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-latest-modder-made-expansion-takes-you-to-some-misery-islands-with-a-history-of-corruption-decay-and-loneliness">gotten a sequel</a>.</p><p>"We’ll be maintaining this collection for the remainder of this year while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/maybe-hold-off-a-bit-longer-on-reinstalling-your-fallout-4-mods-as-bethesda-have-two-anniversary-update-patches-planned">things settle</a> surrounding the Fallout 4 Anniversary Update," Nexus Mods explained. "However, if you or anyone else you know would love to take over maintaining the collection, do reach out to any of us on the content or community teams."</p>
<p>The collection's curators have drawn a bit of ire in some comments on the mod list and its announcement from folks who reckon it doesn't include all the requirements needed for all of its works and some mods that may not work with the game's anniversary update version. A response from Nexus Mods content team member Modsetti says some instances of this are either being looked into or have been sorted already.</p>
<p>As ever with mods, it's worth checking each one you install yourself if you're keen to make sure you avoid any unexpected hiccups. It also feels like it might be physically impossible at this stage for anything with 'Fallout 4 anniversary' in the name to go off totally hitch-free.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-4-pack-of-govee-smart-light-bulbs-is-nearly-free-amazon-prices-them-like-regular-budget-bulbs-2000646086</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-4-pack-of-govee-smart-light-bulbs-is-nearly-free-amazon-prices-them-like-regular-budget-bulbs.1360567/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart lighting changes a room, and these bulbs yield that change in minutes. You screw them into any standard socket, open an app and you’ll suddenly be in full control of your home’s atmosphere. The Govee smart light bulbs are one of those extremely rare smart home products that actually lives up to the <em>“easy”</em> promise while genuinely changing your daily experience. And the good news is that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5776/">just dropped the 4-pack to an all-time low of $23 for Black Friday, down from the usual $39 price tag</a> (40% off).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5776/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See offer</a></p>

<h2>16 Million Colors Makes a Difference</h2>
<p>That color range here isn’t just some marketing number: these bulbs <strong>pack 16 million color options along with 54 preset scenes</strong> that cover everything from movie night to dinner party vibes. You can dial in the exact shade you want for any situation, whether that’s a warm amber for evening reading or a cool blue for focus work. The RGBWW setup means you get proper white light too, not some washed-out white that cheaper RGB bulbs produce. <strong>Each bulb pumps out 800 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which gives you plenty of brightness for standard rooms without needing multiple bulbs per fixture.</p>
<p>The music sync feature converts any space into a reactive environment. Your phone’s microphone picks up the audio, and the bulbs shift colors and brightness to match the beats. This works great for parties or just making your regular music listening more immersive. You do need to make sure no other app is using your microphone, but once that’s clear, the sync happens in real time with minimal lag.</p>



<p>Voice control via <strong>Alexa or Google Assistant</strong> means you can change lighting without having to touch your phone. Simple commands, such as <em>“dim the living room”</em> or <em>“set bedroom to warm white,”</em> work exactly as you’d expect. The Govee Home app gives you more granular control when you want it, letting you fine-tune brightness percentages, save custom scenes, and switch between modes. The app connects via both WiFi and Bluetooth, though you’ll want that WiFi connection for remote control when you’re away from home.</p>



<p>Group control makes it easier to operate several bulbs over different rooms: You create a scheme in the app, add whatever bulbs you want in that group, then control them all at the same time. This saves time when you’re setting up lighting for the whole house or just want to turn everything off at once. The bulbs require a stable 2.4GHz WiFi connection for this to function well, so bear in mind this if you have a dual-band router set to auto-switch frequencies.</p>
<p>Lighting seamlessly fits into your routines through the timer and scheduling functions. You can also make bulbs gradually brighten at the time your alarm goes off, simulating a natural sunrise that makes waking up less jarring. At night, sunset mode slowly dims your lights as bedtime approaches. These scheduled changes happen automatically once you set them up, and you can adjust the timing whenever your schedule shifts.</p>
<p>Installation takes roughly two minutes per bulb, as <strong>they fit standard A19 sockets</strong> and don’t require any special fixtures or complicated wiring. The bulbs draw their power from standard AC 120V outlets and connect to your network during an initial setup process. One limitation to know upfront is that these won’t work with smart switches, since the bulbs need constant power to maintain their connection and respond to commands.</p>
<p>This 4-pack at $23 gets you four rooms worth of smart lighting for less than some brands charge for a single premium bulb. Easy setup combines with generally reliable app control and genuine functionality to make this one of the better entry points into smart home lighting. You’re getting music sync, voice control, and millions of color <strong>options for about $6 per bulb</strong>, which is what basic LED bulbs cost just a few years ago.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytales-modding-strategy-makes-it-easier-for-players-to-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hytale%E2%80%99s-modding-strategy-makes-it-easier-for-players-to-access.1360564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The modding strategy for Hytale has been outlined by Hypixel Studios, and it will be easier for everyone to access servers with mods enabled.</p>



<p>Hytale is back on the agenda after being scrapped by Riot Games earlier this year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hypixel Studios’ original founders re-purchasing the rights to the game</a> and all development, and a playable experience is right around the corner, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date for early access set to be shared next week</a>.</p>



<p>Modding will be core to the Hytale experience, unsurprisingly given that Hypixel began as a Minecraft mod, and details have been shared that will make it easy for players to enjoy modded content.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-modding-will-be-server-side">Hytale Modding Will Be Server-Side</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to offer. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed blog post</a> about modding in Hytale, it was announced that all modding in the game is “based on the host of the server or host of the game,” and that players should be able to join any modded server “without downloading external mods or juggling client packs.”</p>



<p>Players will be able to download mods directly for customisation in single-player servers, and, crucially, Hytale is not planning to support any client mods, restricting the need for additional downloads further.</p>



<p>The modding ambitions for Hytale are huge and will be open access, with Blocks, Items, NPCs, World Generation, UIs, systems, and behaviors “all driven by data and code that you can influence.”</p>



<p>However, it’s also detailed that modders will experience limitations when early access goes live due to the current stage of development, and Hypixel Studios has made no secret of the fact it will be a long process for full release, and early access players and modders will encounter issues.</p>



<p>Modders have been told there will be “limitations due to missing editing capabilities,” that “certain aspects of client behaviour are not yet exposed,” and “moddering maturity is wildly uneven.” Additionally, some tools and systems are described as “rough, inconsistent, or painful to work with.”</p>



<p>Hypixel Studios will not hide valuable features from modders, however, and, “if something is useful,” they will “try to make it available and iterate it.” Modders and players throughout early access are urged to hold Hypixel Studios “responsible,” with a commitment to “being transparent and telling you the truth.”</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has stated generative AI has been integrated across the entire company, expressing his belief that generative AI is as big a "revolution" for video games as the shift from 2D to 3D.</p>
<p>Guillemot (<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results">via Game File</a>) spent a short but explosive minute near the start of a recent earnings call to speak on generative AI in particular, which appears to be taking a larger role in Ubisoft's works moving forward.</p>
<p>Guillemot stated: "We are making great strides in applying Gen AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams...It's as big [of] a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D. And we have everything to lead on this front."</p>

<p>Guillemot continued: "On the player experience side, we are continuing to make progress on groundbreaking player-facing generative AI applications, building on our neo NPC announcements in 2024. We have already advanced from prototyping to player reality, and we are looking forward to sharing more before the end of the year."</p><p>Finally, Guillemot stated Ubisoft's embrace of AI goes beyond dedicated AI projects, and that AI-use has already been integrated into every development team across all of Ubisoft's offices. He explained: "On the production side, we now have teams in all our studios and offices embracing this new technology and constantly exploring new use cases in programming, art and overall game quality."</p>
<p>So far the publicly shown results of Ubisoft's venture into the wild world of generative AI resulted in a prototype version of the aforementioned Neo NPCs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-unveils-generative-ai-neo-npcs-and-the-spirit-of-peter-molyneuxs-milo-lives-on">which Eurogamer's own Chris Tapsell experienced firsthand</a>.  He described the tech as "a tool that's been built first - on the notion that if we build it, someone clever will surely come along and make use of it. There's an argument to say that's somewhat back-to-front: the best tools are solutions to problems those clever people already have." Perhaps we'll see how this tech is actually used soon.</p>
<p>Guillemot previously stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-generative-ai-is-just-another-new-technology-to-be-tested">generative AI was "just another technology to be tested"</a>, but fast forward to this current era of AI bullishness, it appears he's gripped this AI tech with both hands. Even so, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-admits-ai-generated-loading-screen-slipped-through-into-final-build-of-anno-117-pax-romana">Ubisoft recently apologised to Anno 117: Pax Romana players for the "accidental" inclusion of an AI loading screen</a> in the release version of that game. Perhaps the AI-focused Ubisoft has some hurdles to overcome as it adopts this new technology.</p>
<p>This earnings call came shortly after the cessation of trading for Ubisoft, which sent the entire industry into mass speculation. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-116bn-tencent-investment-into-assassins-creed-maker-is-on-track-following-last-weeks-surprise-delay-to-financial-report">Ubisoft confirmed that this was due to an issue with new auditors</a>, despite broad speculation of a grander acquisition.</p>

            <p>
It's all go in the foggy world of Silent Hill. Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-brilliant-remake-surprise-launches-on-xbox-series-xs-with-a-massive-discount-ahead-of-tonights-showcase">yesterday's surprise Australian launch</a>, last year's stupendous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake is finally available on Xbox Series X/S worldwide - and Christophe Gans' upcoming movie adaptation has received a new trailer too.
</p>
<p>
Starting with that Xbox Series X/S release, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s Silent Hill 2 remake - which we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">gave five stars to</a> last year - is available now via the Xbox/Microsoft Store with a whopping 50 percent off, meaning you can currently <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/silent-hill-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV/0010">pick up the standard edition for £27.49 in the UK</a>, rather than the usual £54.98. The Deluxe Edition - which throws in a digital art book, digital soundtrack, and Pyramid Head mask - is similarly discounted to £34.99. This limited-time 50 percent discount should also be reflected across PlayStation and PC digital storefronts sometime today.

<p>
There're actually two additional purchase options launching today across all platforms: a Silent Hill 2 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> bundle is available in both standard and deluxe forms. This will supposedly be discounted by 20 percent starting on 25th November but it's not entirely clear how - or if - that'll stack with the current Silent Hill 2 discount. Silent Hill f, incidentally, is bloomin' marvellous, successfully managing to capture the essence of the long-running survival horror series despite some massive changes. It'll be discounted by 30 percent on PlayStation from today and everywhere else from 25th November - and you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-is-the-first-game-in-four-decades-to-convince-me-new-game-plus-is-worth-my-time">some of my thoughts on its brilliance elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of capturing the essence of Silent Hill, we now have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_oNLLln8aE">another trailer</a> for director Christophe Gans' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">"faithful"</a> upcoming movie adaptation of Silent Hill 2, Return to Silent Hill - and, well, I remain skeptical.

<p>
It's certainly plundering the series' familiar iconography - you've got your foggy streets, your wonky nurses, your Pyramid Head, and Akira Yamaoka's score - but the trailer's brash editing and in-your-face style is a million miles from the subdued melancholy of its source material. Hopefully, this is just the usual bums-on-seats marketing tactic, and the finished thing is closer to the good bits of Gans' atmospheric but wildly uneven original Silent Hill movie - but we'll know for sure when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/christophe-gans-faithful-silent-hill-2-movie-adaptation-gets-a-2026-release-date">hits cinemas on 23rd January 2026</a>. And honestly, I'm prepared to forgive everything - even Mary's apparently chopped "In my restless dreams..." line - if they've gone with the dog ending.

Because of course..!</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasaki-micro-bikini-ride-deleted-from-kirby-air-riders-machine-market-immediately-replaced-by-succubus-chef-kawasaki/">Automaton</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-starts-removing-player-made-bikini-chef-kirby-air-riders-designs-as-they-top-the-in-game-marketplace/">VGC</a>), player-created machines have been flooding the game's Machine Marketplace, which lets users purchase new vehicles in exchange for coins earned in races. The more popular a vehicle is, the more its price will increase.</p>
<p>Machines depicting Chef Kawasaki in a micro bikini appear to be based on a <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/79941849">meme</a> that circulated in 2020, with the first showing up just shortly after Air Riders' launch. It quickly shot up the ranks in the Marketplace, but Nintendo is seemingly not keen on its presence, with the design now completely unavailable for purchase.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adnxukgp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Now that players are aware of Nintendo's intentions to remove such depictions of Chef Kawasaki, similar designs are quickly gaining value in the marketplace, with players seemingly scared of their impending removals. The design below showcases the same micro bikini, but with matching wings, tail, and shoes.</p>

<p>VGC has since confirmed that this design, too, has been removed after it became the most expensive machine on the marketplace. However, a third is supposedly rising up the ranks rapidly, this time featuring bikini Kawasaki holding two pans.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how long this one will last.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-drops-airpods-max-to-new-all-time-low-on-amazon-rivals-sony-and-bose-are-freaking-out.1360540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The premium active noise canceling headphone market is filled to the brim with offerings from Sony, Bose, Sonos, and many more all vying for your attention. Apple is still Apple, however, and the AirPods Max is one of the best-selling products in the category despite the crowded competition and higher price tag.</p>
<p>This r<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/">ecord low of $429 at Amazon, down from the usual $549</a>, puts extreme pressure on every competitor in the space. A great sound, professional-level noise cancellation, and that Apple integration make for value that justifies the investment, especially at this Black Friday pricing which undercuts rivals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Noise Cancellation Silences the World</h2>
<p>Computational audio combined with advanced algorithms allows the <strong>active noise-cancellation system to block outside sound</strong> with phenomenal effectiveness. Each ear cup has three outward-facing microphones that detect ambient noise, while one inward-facing microphone monitors sound that reaches your ear. This audio is <strong>processed 200 times per second</strong> by the system to create anti-noise that cancels out unwanted sounds before they reach your ears.</p>
<p>The effectiveness goes beyond what most of the competition achieves and creates a level of isolation that allows for focused work or pure enjoyment of music anywhere. You immediately notice the difference it makes on flights, in busy offices, or while you’re walking down crowded streets where background noise simply disappears. The <strong>system continuously adjusts to your environment and head movements</strong>, and keeps consistent cancellation even as conditions change around you.</p>



<p><strong>Transparency mode opens external microphones</strong> to allow outside sound to pass through naturally when you need awareness of your surroundings. Because of the audio processing, it makes external sounds feel natural, not artificial or amplified, allowing you to hear conversations, traffic, or announcements while still wearing the headphones.</p>
<p>Personalized spatial audio provides a kind of theatre-like experience, and <strong>allows audio sources to appear in three-dimensional space around you</strong>. The system uses head tracking to keep sound anchored to your device even as you turn your head, maintaining the illusion that audio comes from fixed positions in space. It works best with movies and spatial audio music, where instruments and voices occupy distinct positions in the sound stage. The personalization uses the <em>TrueDepth</em> camera found in compatible iPhones to map your ear geometry and then adjusts the audio profile to fit your specific anatomy.</p>



<p>Computational audio and the <strong>Apple-designed H1 chip make for sound quality that is on par with a set of dedicated audiophile headphones</strong> that cost significantly more. Bass response stays tight and controlled, not bleeding into midrange frequencies. Vocals sound clear and forward with very good detail, showcasing subtle textures in recordings. High-frequency response extends smoothly without harshness, making these comfortable during extended listening sessions.</p>
<p><strong>This aluminum and stainless steel construction</strong> imbues these headphones with significant heft and a truly premium feel that few competitors can match. The mesh canopy and memory foam ear cushions spread weight out for comfortable wear, but the overall heft still makes its presence felt during long listening sessions. USB-C charging brings the AirPods Max in line with modern standards, making it more convenient to charge them using the same cables as you do your phones and laptops. <strong>Battery life reaches about 20 hours</strong> with active noise cancellation turned on, which should easily get you through several days of typical use.</p>
<p>With the H1 chip, seamless integration with Apple devices happens automatically: instant pairing, switching between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac is a breeze. It also allows for hands-free Siri activation through voice commands. Automatic switching detects which device you’re actively using and routes audio to it appropriately. These integrations work exclusively within the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>At $429, they’re $120 below standard pricing while offering audio quality and features comparable or better than competitors at similar or higher prices. Sony’s WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra sell around $500 so the AirPods Max are competitive on price while offering superior build quality and the advantages of being part of the Apple ecosystem.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/blueair-drops-black-friday-deal-on-air-purifier-now-selling-for-pocket-change-for-healthier-sleep-2000646110</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blueair-drops-black-friday-deal-on-air-purifier-now-selling-for-pocket-change-for-healthier-sleep.1360537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You spend roughly a third of your life sleeping so the air quality in your bedroom is crucial in terms of health and quality of rest. The same can be said for living rooms, home offices, and other places where you will be spending plenty of time. Good-quality air purifiers aren’t cheap with premium models from reputable brands coming in well above the $200 threshold. However, Blueair breaks that pattern this Black Friday by offering an all-time low on Amazon – <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5781/">dropping the Blue Pure 211i Max down to $199 from its usual $349 price (42% off)</a>. This is the <strong>best pricing ever seen</strong> on one of the most effective air purification systems on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5781/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>HEPASilent Technology Cleans Faster and Quieter</h2>
<p>The HEPASilent dual-filtration system combines mechanical and electrostatic filtration to achieve better performance than standard HEPA filters alone. This technology cleans the air up to 83% faster while generating 50% less noise than traditional HEPA systems. The <strong>purifier can process enough air to clean a 3,048 square foot</strong> space in one hour, a 1,524 square foot room in 30 minutes, or the typical 635 square foot bedroom in about 12 minutes on high speed.</p>
<p>The filtration captures <strong>99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.1 microns, going smaller than what standard HEPA filters catch</strong>. This means the system removes viruses, smoke particles, pet dander, pollen, mold spores, and dust with exceptional efficiency. Light household odors from cooking, pets, and smoke are handled by the layer in the carbon filter, but it does much better with fresher odors than deeply embedded ones.</p>



<p><em>Quiet Mark</em> certification confirms this is a <strong>purifier that runs at 23 to 53 decibels</strong> depending on the fan speed. The lowest setting is quieter than a whisper and thus can be applied in bedrooms during sleep with no disturbance. Even the highest speed remains below regular conversation levels, so you can easily run this device during the day without its interfering with your work calls or TV watching. Impressively, it keeps the noise level low, considering how much air this unit is actually capable of moving.</p>
<p>Smart app integration allows remote control of the purifier, programming operation times, and air quality monitoring from your phone. The Welcome Home geofencing feature automatically turns the purifier on when you approach home so the air is clean by the time you arrive. Clean Air ETA lets you know how much time until a room reaches your target level of air quality.</p>



<p>The onboard pollution sensor measures particles PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 in real time and displays results through a 5-color air quality index. If air quality changes-whether from cooking, opening windows, or other activities that introduce particles-you see immediate feedback. In auto mode, the fan speeds ramp up as pollution builds and ramp down as the air cleans up. This automation means you do not need to constantly adjust settings yourself.</p>
<p>The advanced functionalities are <strong>kept simple with the two-button design and LED display</strong>. You control fan speeds from 1 to 4, engage night mode for minimal noise and lighting, adjust the brightness of the display, and utilize child lock to avoid accidental changes. Alexa voice control provides another layer of convenience in the form of hands-free adjustments.</p>
<p>You’re getting the top-performing Blueair purifier for 43% off at $199 and brings premium air cleaning into budget territory. Meanwhile, combining fast cleaning speeds with quiet operation and smart features usually means paying $300 or more from competing brands.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The early access release date for Hytale will be announced by the end of next week, Hypixel Studios has revealed, with anticipation for the title continuing to rise.</p>



<p>Hytale was scrapped by Riot Games but has been revived by the original founders of the title, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchase announced earlier this month</a>, and it’s unlikely to be long until players get their hands on the game.</p>



<p>While the official 1.0 release is likely to be a ways off, early access could be right around the corner, and an official announcement on the release date is coming next week.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-early-access-announcement-next-week">Hytale Early Access Announcement Next Week</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big news imminent. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme continued a slew of news updates regarding Hytale by confirming that plans for the early access release date will be revealed before the end of next week.</p>



<p>It’s set to be a week full of info, as the post states that Hytale will be tested across different hardware “to determine the minimum specs,” with major crashes being fixed, launcher tests, and finishing up the legal work to prepare the game for early access.</p>



<p>The post states that a “precise release date” will be announced next week, with a follow up post confirming this is for the early access release, and not for the full version.</p>



<p>Anticipation for Hytale is high, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-coming-soonand-shows-off-16-minutes-of-minecraft-like-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">16-minute gameplay video</a> attracting over one million views in a matter of days, and the long wait for a playable version of the game to be available is coming to an end.</p>



<p>Development for Hytale began in 2015, with Riot Games purchasing Hypixel Studios five years later in 2020. However, Riot cancelled the title in June this year, but the game has been saved by the original developer, and players are set to be a major part of ongoing development.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Publisher says Tencent deal closure still "imminent."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has celebrated a fresh set of financial results that it says has been driven by a "strong performance" for its Assassin's Creed franchise. But while there's an update on sales figures for 2023's Mirage, there's no new figure for how this year's Shadows has sold. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The French publisher's latest earnings report, published this morning, covers the company's performance over the first half of the current year: April through September. Last week, Ubisoft delayed the publication of these results at the last minute, prompting speculation that something had gone wrong with the company's big Tencent deal — though there's no suggestion of that today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has framed the results in a positive light, with net bookings for the past quarter "above expectations" and up 39% year-on-year. "The outperformance was driven by stronger-than-expected partnerships," Ubisoft noted, "and was supported by a robust back-catalog, both highlighting the strength of the Group's brands."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One back catalogue game seemingly doing very well is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, the series' return to a smaller, city-based adventure that launched a couple of years ago. Today, Ubisoft announced a new 10 million sales milestone for the title, and said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirages-saudi-backed-valley-of-memory-expansion-looks-a-generous-free-side-quest-though-not-one-many-fans-would-have-asked-for">its recent Saudi Arabia-funded free update</a> had received "very positive" feedback from fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But on the sales performance of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the franchise's blockbuster feudal Japan entry launched in March, Ubisoft was less clear. Without providing a new sales total, Ubisoft simply said the game had "benefited" from the launch of its New Game+ mode and recent Claws of Awaji expansion, which seems obvious. The company then pointed to the game's upcoming Switch 2 launch as an oppurtunity for it to "reach a broader audience." Back in July, Ubisoft said Shadows had surpassed 5 million players, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-suffers-mixed-results-as-assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-while-rainbow-six-siege-x-struggles">that its performance had been in line with expectations</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Assassin's Creed, Ubisoft noted that Rainbow Six Siege's cheating issues were continuing to temporarily impact "activity and player spending versus expectations," following the game's previous move to an essentially free-to-play model.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft still expects to finalize its $1.16 billion deal with Chinese conglomerate Tencent in the near future, company boss Yves Guillemot said, noting that "all conditions precedent have been satisfied." The transaction will secure funding for Vantage Studios, Ubisoft's new self-contained subsidiary in charge of its biggest brands, including Assassin's Creed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Guillemot revealed that more of these companies, termed Creative Houses, will be detailed in January — a point at which the Tencent deal should presumably be sorted. After this, the future shape of the company should become clear, following years of internal turmoil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These Creative Houses will be autonomous, efficient, focused and accountable business units, each with its own leadership, creative vision and strategic roadmap," Guillemot concluded. "This Group-wide transformation reflects our ambition to renew how we create and operate in order to deliver great games for our players and lasting value for our partners and shareholders."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>If you are an ardent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blox-fruits/" data-ref-id="5000-632858">Blox Fruits</a> player, the ocean-faring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a> experience that has taken the world by storm, then you will want to keep a keen eye on the many stock options scattered around the Blox Fruits seas. Those titular fruits are the keys to success, but not only are some rarer than others, but vendors constantly change their wares, so we’re here to explain everything you need to know about the Blox Fruits stock as well as restock times.</p><h2 id="What_is_the_Blox_Fruits_Stock_System_">What is the Blox Fruits Stock System?</h2><p>The most important part of Blox Fruit is, unsurprisingly, those titular Blox Fruits. If you want to expand your collection, you will need to amass some money through regular gameplay and then head to a vendor to buy Blox Fruit.</p><p>Sadly, not all of the Blox Fruit are available at once, and their appearance is dictated by their rarity. So, you’re much more likely to see common Blox Fruit than you are rare ones. Anyone wanting to expand their abilities or collect all of the Blox Fruit will need to routinely visit the in-game vendors with the hopes of eventually finding and purchasing every Blox Fruit in the game. Regular vendors have at least three Blox Fruit, while the Advanced Fruit Dealer on Mirage Island holds five.</p><h2 id="How_often_do_Blox_Fruits_stocks_refresh_">How often do Blox Fruits stocks refresh?</h2><p>The regular Blox Fruit stocks offered by Normal dealers change every four hours. Meanwhile, the Advanced dealers change their stock every two hours instead.</p><h2 id="When_do_Blox_Fruits_stocks_refresh_">When do Blox Fruits stocks refresh?</h2><p>The Blox Fruits vendors' stock refreshes at a set time depending on your region. So, every four hours, or at one of the times listed below:</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Timezone</th><th scope="col">1st Restock</th><th scope="col">2nd Restock</th><th scope="col">3rd Restock</th><th scope="col">4th Restock</th><th scope="col">5th Restock</th><th scope="col">6th Restock</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pacific Time</td><td>12 AM</td><td>4 AM</td><td>8 AM</td><td>12 PM</td><td>4 PM</td><td>8 PM</td></tr><tr><td>Mountain Time</td><td>1 AM</td><td>5 AM</td><td>9 AM</td><td>1 PM</td><td>5 PM</td><td>9 PM</td></tr><tr><td>Central Time</td><td>2 AM</td><td>6 AM</td><td>10 AM</td><td>2 PM</td><td>6 PM</td><td>10 PM</td></tr><tr><td>Eastern Time</td><td>3 AM</td><td>7 AM</td><td>11 AM</td><td>3 PM</td><td>7 PM</td><td>11 PM</td></tr><tr><td>Atlantic Time</td><td>12 AM</td><td>4 AM</td><td>8 AM</td><td>12 PM</td><td>4 PM</td><td>8 PM</td></tr><tr><td>BST (UK TIME)</td><td>12 AM</td><td>4 AM</td><td>8 AM</td><td>12 PM</td><td>4 PM</td><td>8 PM</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="How_do_I_know_what_Blox_Fruits_will_be_stocked_">How do I know what Blox Fruits will be stocked?</h2><p>There is no way to find out ahead of time which Blox Fruits will be stocked by the Normal Dealer or the Advanced Dealer. However, you can use<a href="https://bloxhttps//blox-fruits.fandom.com/wiki/Blox_Fruits_%22Stock%22.-fruits.fandom.com/wiki/Blox_Fruits_%22Stock%22." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> third-party websites </a>and apps to see exactly which Blox Fruits are in stock at the current moment in time. </p><h2 id="How_to_check_Blox_Fruit_stock_in_game">How to check Blox Fruit stock in-game</h2><p>If you want to check the Roblox Blox Fruit stock, you will have to find and interact with any of the many dealers within the game. If you are looking for a particular fruit, or just want to make checking stock easier, you can save next to a dealer and then respawn next to them, to save yourself a journey.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is rapidly approaching a new season in Ranked, with Season 3 offering a fresh batch of rewards, including the long-awaited addition of another Mega Pokémon.</p>



<p>Ranked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A has proven to be a controversial mechanic, with some Mega Pokémon being locked behind reaching designated ranks in the mode, but tweaks have been made to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-to-lower-requirements-for-exclusive-mega-evolutions-in-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lower the requirements</a> and allow for more players to gain the exclusive rewards.</p>



<p>Season 3 is now right around the corner and Insider Gaming has all the details on when the season kicks off, along with the rewards available to earn.</p>











<figure><figcaption>More rewards. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 3 of Ranked in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A begins on November 27, following the conclusion of Season 2 Ranked.</strong></p>



<p>The end date has also been revealed, with Season 3 drawing to a close on December 18. Due to the dates covering the release period for the Mega Dimension DLC, it’s expected there will be some restrictions on useable Pokémon and any Pokémon caught in the DLC are unlikely to be able to be used.</p>



<p>However, Zygarde will be useable in Season 3 of Ranked for the first time.</p>







<p><strong>Start times for Season 3 have not been officially announced, but it’s expected to kick off at 6 AM UTC on November 27—the same time that previous seasons have begun.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows a breakdown of exactly when you can expect Season 3 of Ranked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A to begin in your time zone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Season 3 Ranked Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Nov. 26</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Nov. 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Nov. 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 27</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>











<p><strong>The biggest reward available in Season 3 Ranked in Legends: Z-A is Chesnaughtite, the item required to unlock Mega Chesnaught in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Chesnaughtite is the final Mega Stone locked behind ranked participation in the base game of Legends: Z-A, following Greninjite and Delphoxite, but we already know Mega Baxcalibur from the Mega Dimension DLC will be locked behind Ranked participation in a future season.</p>



<p>Additional rewards available during Season 3 of Ranked are expected to include Rare Candies, EXP. Candies, and Held Items for Pokémon.</p>

            <p>TiGames, the developer of rabbit-starring action game Zoopunk - one of the eye-catching trailers in Microsoft's Xbox Game Preview Event yesterday - has defended itself amid allegations of generative AI use.</p>
<p>Suspicions arose after people noticed <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-ace-autonomous-ai-companions-pubg-naraka-bladepoint/">Zoopunk being part of an Nvidia announcement about new NPC-related generative AI tech</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEZAYvHIAgw">An accompanying video to that announcement focused entirely on Zoopunk and the generative-AI technology it will use</a>, showing one of the game's developers talking to an NPC through a microphone and using voice commands to customise the appearance of a spaceship. "This innovative experience allows players to interact with NPCs and customise their own landing ship, showcasing the potential for player-driven generative AI in next-generation games," the video's description read.</p>
<p>But Chinese developer TiGames has said Zoopunk was built by human hard work. Generative AI exists within the game, it clarified, but only in relation to user-generated content.</p>

<p>"All our works are original creations and the culmination of our artists' hard work and dedication," the company said in a statement received by Eurogamer. "AI will only be used to assist players in producing user-generated content (UGC) at a lower cost, such as vehicle skins, clothing color schemes, and similar items. In other words, AI serves as a tool to support players in secondary creations and in maintaining the mod community."</p><p>Zoopunk is a fully 3D follow-up to TiGames' 2.5D Metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1330470/FIST_Forged_In_Shadow_Torch/">FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch</a> from 2021. The game will once again star Rayton the rabbit, and the footage last night showed Rayton tearing around a post-apocalyptic sci-fi world on a motorbike, dispatching creature-people with dual-wielded energy swords. Think: Rise of the Guardian's Easter Bunny but with a trench coat and proper weaponry.</p>
<p>"We spent a long time debating our next step. Deep down, we knew we wanted to continue expanding the world of Torch City. After countless moments of excitement, hesitation, and imagination, we finally made our decision - to breathe new life into the captivating universe of FIST," wrote TiGames in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1330470/view/598543807409029821">a Zoopunk announcement post on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>"Zoopunk is still in development, and far from perfect," the developer added. "That is precisely why we want to share our world with you early - to listen, to learn, and to grow this universe together with the players who care about it."</p>
<p>Zoopunk has no release date and is in development for PS5 as well as Xbox and PC.

		<p>Fictions and Counterplay Games, developer of Godfall, have announced a new game called Armatus, which is a third person roguelite set in the demon filled streets of Paris. The game was shown during the Xbox Partner Preview, but it has been confirmed for PC, PS5, and Switch 2. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Armatus | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZffamZajxQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Armatus puts players in the role of a mysterious warrior that has been summoned to defend a group of people who were left behind&nbsp; after the veil opened and those deemed worthy were claimed. Everyone else was left on Earth at the mercy of demons. The unnamed warrior will venture through Paris to fight the demons and learn more about what happened, dying again and again while doing so.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“With&nbsp;Armatus, we wanted our gameplay to be a blend of modern firearms and supernatural powers, plus a little melee for good measure,”</em> said Ming Zhang, Studio Head, Counterplay Games, <em>“By layering in&nbsp; dynamic build choices for each run, we’ve created the frenetic, hyperkinetic combat that really defines our gameplay.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“We’re so thrilled to be working with Ming and the talented team at Counterplay Games to help them bring&nbsp;Armatus&nbsp;to life,”</em> said Kelsey Hansen, Producer, Fictions. <em>“This is a game full of intense, fast-paced combat that truly feels incredible in your hands. We can’t wait for everyone to experience it in 2026.”</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">Armatus is due to be released in 2026.</p>

			<p>The remake of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is just a few months away from launching, according to a new rumor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published by Insider Gaming</a>. </p>



<p>As part of Ubisoft's quarterly and half-year financial results (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered here</a>), which were just released, the publisher confirmed an unannounced game in its lineup of titles due to be released before the end of the fiscal quarter (March 2026). According to Insider Gaming, this is indeed the remake of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, the 2013 game that first introduced sea-based combat and exploration to the franchise, which later inspired the ill-fated standalone game Skull &amp; Bones.</p>



<p>The first rumors about this project <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started emerging in June 2023</a>. About a year later, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Assassin's Creed fans could look forward to some remakes, but did not specify which of the games would get this kind of treatment. In June 2025, though, it was actor Matt Ryan (who voiced the protagonist, Edward Kenway) who <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-practically-confirmed-by-edward-kenways-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let slip</a> that fans might soon get to play as Edward all over again. Later, Ryan kind of regretted being this open because Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened him with a lawsuit</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, in September, French website Jeux Video Magazine <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> some actual details about the remake. According to their sources, the Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake will cut the modern-day sequences, which were among the weakest in the original, to replace them with more content featuring Edward Kenway. Moreover, it will be updated to incorporate the RPG mechanics that have been introduced with Assassin's Creed Origins and have since been featured in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and the most recent installment, Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reports that the game will launch 'the week of March 23', which falls just before the end of Ubisoft's fiscal year. If the launch is really this close, an official announcement at The Game Awards, due to air on December 11, 2025, appears to be inbound. There, we might also see new gameplay of the Prince of Persia remake, which is also scheduled to launch before the end of March 2026.</p>

<p>In speaking with <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/">WellPlayed</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa stated that "there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game". Of course, it's still very much up in the air who exactly he's referring to here, but we can at least narrow it down a teeny, tiny bit.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qrznyw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>"I would say that yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don’t over-expect or hype it. We can’t promise you anything about that, but the only thing I can say is that there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most likely candidates seem to be Leon and Claire Redfield from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resident Evil 2</a>, but since <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a>'s Alyssa Ashcroft is making an appearance, might we also see the likes of Kevin Ryman, David King, Yoko Suzuki, and more from the 2003 online entry?</p>
<p>Admittedly, we're doing exactly what Kumazawa-san said not to do – we're hyping ourselves up a bit too much. It's exciting stuff though!</p>
<p>The producer also gave some reasoning as to why Requiem will be taking players back to the ruins of Raccoon City. After portraying more rural environments in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, he believes that going back to where it all began is "best for the fans".</p>
<p>Capcom will be broadcasting a new Resident Evil Showcase in early 2026, and while it seems likely that we'll receive more answers there as to which characters might show up, we kinda hope the team keeps everything secret until the game's launch in February.</p>

Similar to Nic (RPS in peace), I am both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-nightmare-studios-reanimal-is-a-creepy-co-op-adventure-inspired-by-wind-waker-and-silent-hill-2">beguiled and maybe just a little riled</a> by how much Tarsier’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reanimals">Reanimal</a> looks like the studio’s previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> games. Once again, it’s a game about small children in sinister headgear travelling through a collapsed and raggedy storybook world of ogres and abductors. Still, Tarsier have a magnetic capacity for icky monster designs – shout out to Spider Sheep in the trailer there, who absolutely won’t be getting an eye-popping animated Marvel spin-off – and Reanimal <em>is</em> something of a departure once you peel back the layers of suppurating flesh. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It’s strongly co-optional, with a choice of Boy or Girl character inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>, and has a more open-ended, Zelda-ish world, with optional areas to visit by rowboat. As narrative director David Mervik explained to Nic at announcement: "What if we could get that sense of adventure - with a slightly diminished scope than Windwaker - with that thick claustrophobic dread that you feel in, like, Silent Hill 2." Ooh. Nic concluded that he was counting the days. Now we know how many of them to count: the game’s out on February 13th 2026.

The announcement accompanies the release of a demo on console. It turns out that demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4019420/REANIMAL_Demo/">has been on Steam this whole dang time</a>, and I missed it. Confound my evidently fading wits! Anyway, here’s what the demo involves, according to said Steam page: "players start at the very beginning, including the reunion of orphaned siblings trying to survive the most dire circumstances. The Boy and The Girl, our protagonists, then begin their desperate search for their missing friends together. Explore eerie environments such as the Mill and Trainyard, and uncover the first fragments of the dark mystery that binds this unsettling world."
</p><p>
You might prefer to hold off and experience the whole thing in one go. I strongly advise this, actually. Tarsier’s games don’t tend to be very long, and are none the worse for it. See you in February, Spider Sheep.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has published the H1 FY26 report that was delayed a few days back, revealing that the company is in a pretty good place after ‘better than expected’ results over the last few months. In the data, growth was recorded year-over-year in every category, from ‘player investment’ to back catalog sales.</p>



<p>The results detailed an exceeding of expectations, which isn’t what critics were holding out for following the recent closing down of trading around the time that the financial update was postponed.</p>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-is-actually-doing-really-well">Ubisoft is Actually Doing Really Well</h2>



<p>The financial report was pretty glowing for Ubisoft, and it was laced with positivity.</p>



<p>Year-over-year, Ubisoft’s net bookings in H1 FY increased 20%, soaring to €772 million. Digital revenues made up a huge chunk of that, with the vertical also seeing a +30% increase. The shining gem was ‘player recurring investment’, which soared by +52% in H1 FY26.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a statement, Ubisoft confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Outperformance driven by stronger-than-expected partnerships, demonstrating the power and attractiveness of the Group’s portfolio as well as meaningful contribution from live TV and animated series.</p>



<p>Excluding partnerships, back-catalog was robust and in line with expectations, but marked by contrasted dynamics.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was noted that Assassin’s Creed ‘overperformed’ this year, confirming ‘positive momentum’. This was likely because Assassin’s Creed Shadows was one of the best AC games the company had produced in a good few years, not counting Assassin’s Creed: Mirage.</p>



<p>Ubisoft also maintained 34 million Monthly Active Users across the portfolio, and in H1, 88 million Unique Active Users were logged.</p>



<p>There were nice things to be said about Tencent’s recent investment in Vantage Studios, and it was noted that ‘all conditions precedent have been satisfied’, which means nothing is stopping the closure of that deal ‘in the coming days.’</p>



<p>Is this level of positivity what you expected from Ubisoft’s financial update? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has stated its transaction with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> is "on track to close in the coming days", as the Chinese conglomerate acquires a minority stake in its new subsidiary Vantage Studios.</p>
<p>The new studio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">officially unveiled back in October</a>, will be the home of Ubisoft's biggest franchises: Far Cry, Rainbow Six Siege, and Assassin's Creed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">Charlie Guillemot, son of Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, will be co-CEO</a> alongside Christophe Derennes.</p>
<p>The news, arriving in Ubisoft's latest earnings report, follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-issues-a-rare-last-minute-delay-to-its-earnings-release-15-minutes-before-scheduled-call-with-investors">last-minute delay to the report last week</a> and a halt in share trading, sparking speculation of a larger acquisition. That now appears to be ill-founded - instead, the delay was due to an issue with new auditors and revenue reporting.</p>

<p>In a statement, Yves Guillemot called the joining with Tencent a "pivotal milestone in Ubisoft's transformation, significantly strengthening our financial position by bringing in €1.16bn of cash, enabling the Group to deleverage, as planned". He added: "It will also empower Vantage Studios to accelerate the growth of our three flagship IPs under a dedicated leadership team."</p><p>In January, Ubisoft will announce its new operating model built around Creative Houses. The first of these will be Vantage Studios and its three core franchises, with the guiding principles of "Autonomy, Focus, and Player Centricity". Ubisoft hopes to build these franchises into "annual billion-euro brand ecosystems".</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Ubisoft's net bookings are up 20 percent year on year for the first half of this financial year. That's partly due to "strong performance" of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a>, Shadows included, while Rainbow Six Siege remains popular, though its move to free access has caused "a temporary surge in cheating".</p>
<p>The company's last major release for 2025 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-sure-looks-like-assassins-creed-shadows-is-heading-to-switch-2">Assassin's Creed Shadows on Switch 2</a>, which arrives on 2nd December.</p>
<p>Last month, Assassin's Creed series lead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">Marc-Alexis Côté announced his departure from Ubisoft</a>. In an internal note, Dereness stated Côté had "his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios' creation and future". However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">Côté later clarified he was asked to "step aside" by Ubisoft</a>.</p>

<p>Or eighteen years, for many of us</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has debuted two new ads for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> ahead of its release on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>All things considered, there's not a great deal here that we haven't seen before, with one ad (above) focusing primarily on the Federation Troopers you'll be meeting on your journey (including the beloved Myles Mackenzie) while the other (below) showcases the mouse controls for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Still, the ads come as the eight-year wait since Prime 4's initial announcement nears its end. Hard to believe we're here, folks. As a reminder, the game was showcased at E3 (remember <em>that</em><em>?</em>) during the Switch's first year on the market, with Bandai Namco Studios rumoured to be at the helm. Development was then scrapped and restarted in 2019 under original developer Retro Studios after Nintendo concluded that the game's quality was not up to scratch.</p>
<p>For many of us, though, we've actually been waiting a whole eighteen years for Metroid Prime 4. 2007 saw the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>, and the only new entry to see the light of day since then was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Metroid Prime: Federation Force</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>So there's a lot riding on this then. No pressure, Retro.</p>

		<p><span><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/konami">Konami</a> has released a new<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-solid"> Metal Gear Solid</a> Fox Hunt update that includes various tweaks to the publisher’s new multiplayer game while adding a much requested feature.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - FOX HUNT Trailer | KONAMI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c46xM5-wScg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>The most significant change here is how matchmaking works. Previously, players would need to manually select their region which could prolong waiting times depending on your chosen region and the time of day. Now the game will detect if matchmaking is taking too long, widening the search to all regions.</span></p>
<p><span>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Fox Hunt patch 1.2.3 is available to download across all platforms and will need to be installed in order to access the game. Here’s a rundown of what changes have been made.</span></p>
<h3>Metal Gear Solid Fox Hunt Update 1.2.3 Patch Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Added ability to place enemy detection pings while aiming with a knife or gun.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>XP can now be earned in custom matches.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Players will now be matched with others from different regions when matchmaking on their current server takes too long.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Extended the duration of invincibility after respawning.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fixed an issue where invincibility after respawn was canceled by rolling or using Naked Sense.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Minor bug fixes and adjustments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Fox Hunt launched on October 30th as part of the Snake Eater remake. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/18/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-review/">In our review</a> we scored the multiplayer mode a strong 8/10, saying:</span></p>

<p><span>“Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt multiplayer mode rounds off one of the best remakes of 2025. It offers a surprisingly robust spin on existing battle royale and extraction shooter concepts, with smaller maps and match times working in its favour, successfully incorporating those stealth and strategy elements fans have come to expect.”</span></p>
<p><span>Despite our praise, we also noted the game’s lack of content at launch with two modes and a handful of maps. In some ways, this minimal offering works in Fox Hunt’s favour though the lack of a future roadmap is somewhat concerning. Hopefully we’ll hear more from Konami very soon.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, game publisher Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-delays-first-half-2025-26-fiscal-results-release-major-announcement-could-be-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed its financial results</a>, which prompted strong rumors that Tencent would acquire the company. The quarterly and half-year FY 2026 results <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/52w2Cas6xfQjegpCgP1SZC/b38c338a1bf6f365849a50d2f182d061/Ubisoft_FY26_H1_Earnings_PR_EN_vF.pdf?_gl=1*a069ru*_gcl_au*NzM3OTg5NDkzLjE3NjMxMDczNjM.*_ga*MTMwOTI1MjU0NS4xNzYzMTA3MzYz*_ga_C4N5020N2R*czE3NjM3MTc4NzQkbzIkZzAkdDE3NjM3MTc4NzQkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are now available</a>, and while Ubisoft did strike a deal with Tencent, it is not for a complete acquisition of the company. The Chinese corporation has instead provided a significant cash infusion to become a minority stakeholder of Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yves Guillemot said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>The closing of our strategic transaction with Tencent – which will see Tencent become a minority shareholder in our new subsidiary, Vantage Studios – is now imminent, as all conditions precedent have been satisfied. This marks a pivotal milestone in Ubisoft’s transformation, significantly strengthening our financial position by bringing in €1.16 billion of cash, enabling the Group to deleverage, as planned. It will also empower Vantage Studios to accelerate the growth of our three flagship IPs under a dedicated leadership team.</em></p>



<p>Vantage Studios was formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> on October 1. It's a new subsidiary focused entirely on the growth of Ubisoft's three biggest franchises: Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry. According to Guillemot, the 'design' of Vantage Studios is expected to be finalized by the end of 2025. The full details of the new operative model will be outlined in January 2026.</p>



<p>Overall, it was a solid quarter and half-year for the publisher, which reported net bookings of €491 million this quarter (+39% year-over-year) and €772 million for the semester (+20% year-over-year), exceeding guidance. Ubisoft attributes these results to 'stronger-than-expected partnerships', including a meaningful contribution from live TV and animated series. Speaking of the latter, Ubisoft noted that Netflix's Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Deathwatch debuted last month to critical acclaim, and its success also strengthens the position of the upcoming Splinter Cell remake.</p>



<p>Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-beat-assassins-creed-shadows-sales-on-ps5-in-three-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports that Assassin's Creed Shadows wasn't selling that great</a>, Ubisoft said the franchise as a whole overperformed in its Q2, largely thanks to Shadows, which saw a player boost from the Claws of Awaji expansion and the New Game+ update. Overall, in the year-to-date, Assassin's Creed has generated 211 million session days, roughly 35% higher than the average of the last two years.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six did not fare as well, and Ubisoft claims this is due to a temporary surge in cheating that impacted activity and player spending versus expectations. The publisher said the team now has additional resources and further hires planned to deal with cheating through a 'robust plan'.</p>



<p>Finally, The Division 2 continued to benefit from the momentum of the Battle for Brooklyn DLC release in May, as well as the regular content updates released by Massive. This combination has helped attract new players to the game. Alongside rising player numbers, engagement has increased, with a record Q2 in terms of 'Session Days' since FY2020-21. The game's performance this semester has already exceeded last year's annual net bookings. </p>



<p>On Massive's front, Ubisoft said Star Wars Outlaws was well received on the Nintendo Switch 2, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora posted a 'strong performance' this quarter in anticipation of the announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-expansion-december-release-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">From the Ashes expansion</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-new-game-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-person update</a> that will be released soon, just ahead of the new movie, Fire and Ash. </p>

            <p>Moreish roguelike bullet hell <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> is getting a cousin next year. It's called Vampire Crawlers, or as per its Steam page: Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors. It's a first-person roguelike deckbuilder in which you can fight Merdusas with spinach and it's set to hit PC in 2026.</p>

<p>Announced during last night's Xbox Partner Preview via the trailer above, which makes a commendable effort to match the zaniness of the game's full name, Poncle say it offers a fresh take on Survivors' established world. You step behind the controls of a returning Vampire Survivors character, with your choice in picking this "crawler" setting up what different abilities you'll have out of the gate.</p>
<p>Then, you explore dungeons to find treasure, using the deck of cards you build up to murder enemies by flinging barrages of flashes and numbers at them. "You can take your time and be tactical, or play cards as fast as you humanly can, because the game is built to always provide accurate logical outcomes, regardless of the visual chaos that your abilities might cause," Poncle founder Luca Galante said in a chat with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox Wire</a>. He adds that there's card customisation which can "dramatically alter the way you play your cards", but that you won't need to dig deep into if you don't fancy doing so.</p><p>Galante went on to call Crawlers "hopefully the first in a series of spin-offs". "The idea is to take some of the core pillars behind the development of VS and to apply them to existing genres," he explained. "I’m talking about accessibility, immediacy, affordability, replayability, and sparkly stuff. Tons of sparkly stuff! With regards to a sequel to Vampire Survivors, we’re working on something, but we’re not talking about that just yet."</p>
<p>Back when Survivors <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-review">left early access</a> back in 2022, former RPSer Matt Cox dubbed it "an unquestionably compulsive treat until you reach the endgame". Ah, bet there's a big, tough and scary thing waiting there.</p>
<blockquote>I was in it for the plinkety-plink rush of clattering into a huge pile of gems. I was in it for the five item chest boogie, the mindless yet mindful monster shepherding, the giant meteors and the rainbow scythes. Those are all still here, and you can push into further and deadlier territory than ever before, especially if you get far enough to unlock the endless mode, or the modifier that lets you keep upgrading weapons past their usual point. Vampire Survivors is a bigger, better playground now - albeit one with a bodyguard blocking the final set of swings.</blockquote>
<p>Yep, there you go. Former bossman Graham also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-is-a-pure-hit-of-dopamine">opined on the game</a>, at one point using "Pewboomswishpingpewboomswishpingpewboomswishping" as both a word and a sentence.</p>
<p>Vampire Crawlers is due out in 2026, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265700/Vampire_Crawlers_The_Turbo_Wildcard_from_Vampire_Survivors/">wishlist it on Steam</a> if you're so inclined.</p>

            <p>"And then one day you find ten years have got behind you - no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun," sing David Gilmour and Richard Wright in Pink Floyd's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl-Ms_ek-kE">"Time"</a>. I once thought that song was about mortality and the necessity of carpeing that diem, but it turns out Pink Floyd were stealthily pitching the core concept for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/erosion">Erosion</a>, an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> roguelike shooter from Plot Twist in which the world advances one decade when you die.</p>
<p>The core mechanics are all there in the song: running, gunning, time-shifting, the lack of explicit hand-holding expected of an open worldo. The pitch has evolved over the (argh) half-century since "Time", admittedly. Pink Floyd make no mention of the post-apocalyptic wild west in their lyrics, for example, nor do they pack in any high stakes poker games or the prospect of being eaten by sandworms.</p><!--more-->

<p>"Journey across time to save your daughter from a ruthless warlord, where failure means another chance, but at a devastating cost," explains the Erosion announcement blurb. "Explore a faction-divided wasteland to build your arsenal and reshape the fates of its eccentric inhabitants across shifting timelines.  Join a chicken cult, steal a slick new ride, race it to earn Cheddar, then gamble it all away in the Al Cashino. Descend into the mysterious Pillar to battle through chaotic, destructible dungeons, fighting to get one step closer to saving your daughter or losing her entirely to time itself."</p><p>Look forward to "100+ skills and modifiers to create absurd synergies", like deploying cat armies reinforced by orbital beam cannons. "The build possibilities are endless," the press bulletin promises, but alas, your time is not. Interactions with NPCs may reshape the landscape dramatically, with humble shopkeepers founding business empires, but I'm not clear on whether you'll need to die repeatedly to link your choices to those consequences.</p>
<p>Putting aside the prog rock, three videogame comparisons that spring to mind are: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/weird-west">Weird West</a>, the immersive sim from Wolfeye; <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rogue-legacy">Rogue Legacy</a>, in which you become your own child when you die; and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, in which respawns add wrinkles and grey hairs to your enduringly sprightly kung fu frame. I'm mixed on Erosion's '3D pixelart' visuals, which remind me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft-legends">Minecraft Legends</a>, but I like that it does the classique RPG villager thing of having characters bounce on the spot like they're road-testing their underpants elastic.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can read more about Erosion on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3211720/Erosion/">Steam</a>. It's out spring 2026 in early access. Oh, and if you need a pick-me-up after listening to "Time", may I recommend the subsequent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PMnJ_Luk_o">"Great Gig In The Sky"</a>. I can play the piano bit. I can't do the glass-shattering vocals though.</p>

<p>The Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake is one of the most talked-about games within the Ubisoft machine, but until now, it hasn’t been formally acknowledged by the company. However, Insider Gaming has covered the game extensively over the past 18 months and has now learned that it’s set to launch <strong>before March 31, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>This exclusive news comes as Ubisoft publishes the delayed financial update deck that was pushed back and went hand-in-hand with a halt on trading, fuelling speculation about the company’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-flag-remake-coming-very-soon">Black Flag Remake Coming Very Soon</h2>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the yet-unannounced Assassin’s Creed Remake is set to launch before March 31st, 2026.</p>



<p>The first official sign of the announcement came during today’s delayed Ubisoft earnings, where one ‘unannounced game’ is set to be released before the end of the company’s fiscal year, which ends March 31st. It’s the only game on the slate <strong>not </strong>uncovered and is flanked by the likes of Rainbow Six Mobile, The Division: Resurgence, and Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Insider Gaming understands that this blanked-out game is the yet-to-be announced Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake, which is scheduled to release the week of March 23rd. </p>



<p>There’s plenty of hype surrounding the Black Flag remake, which is often considered one of the best Assassin’s Creed games ever made.</p>



<p>As of yet, Ubisoft has yet to officially announce the Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag Remake, but Insider Gaming has covered the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release-date/">with a few exclusive reports</a> over the last year and a half. In the most recent Black Flag news, one leaker claimed that the Black Flag remake would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-new-details-claim/">more ‘RPG heavy</a>‘.</p>

The company says that its Q2 net bookings exceeded expectations and its deal with Tencent to invest $1.2 billion in Vantage Studios--a new subsidiary focused on its three main franchises--is expected to close within a few days.</p><p>Ubisoft says that its Q2 net bookings were up 39% year-on-year, driven by stronger-than-expected performance across its games catalogue and TV projects. The company had initially predicted that it would reach $520 million for its quarterly books, but this figure increased to $566.7 million.</p>

<p>"Our portfolio showed contrasting dynamics this quarter, with softer trends for Rainbow Six Siege, reflecting a phase of evolution for the game in an intense FPS environment, offset by strong performances across the rest of the catalog. The Assassin’s Creed franchise exceeded our expectations, confirming its positive momentum and ability to engage players over time. The Division 2 also continued to perform strongly, benefiting from the momentum of the Battle for Brooklyn DLC," Ubisoft Yves Guillemot said in a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/21/3192546/0/en/Ubisoft-reports-first-half-2025-26-earnings-figures.html" rel="nofollow ">press release</a>.</p><p>The formation of a new operating model built around "Creative Houses" is still on track, and Ubisoft says that these will foster "stronger creative vision, greater focus, efficiency, autonomy and accountability" as it aims to finalize these plans by the end of the year. A full reveal of the new operating model will be unveiled in January 2026.</p><p>Looking ahead, Ubisoft is expecting its net bookings to remain stable year-on-year and it has forecast third-quarter net bookings of $352 million. After the initial date for Ubisoft's financial report was delayed, it was speculated that the company might have found a private buyer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/">similar to how EA sold itself</a> to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake.</p><p>CFO Frederick Duguet told staff in an internal email that the reason for the delay was so that Ubisoft could take "extra time to finalize the closing of the semester" and limit such "unnecessary" speculation. Ubisoft has gone through a turbulent time as of late, as the company reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/">canceled a Civil War-inspired Assassin's Creed game</a> and Assassin's Creed creative lead Marc-Alexis Côté <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-two-decades/1100-6535413/">left Ubisoft in October</a>. In the earnings report <a href="https://80.lv/articles/while-ubisoft-celebrates-ac-shadows-hitting-5-million-players-their-revenues-continue-to-decline" rel="nofollow ">shared in July 2025</a>, the company noted that revenues had continued to decline at the time.</p>
