		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> has passed another round number milestone, as Sony has announced that they have shipped 80.3 million consoles.</p>
<p>The past quarter – ending on 30th June – saw Sony ship 2.5 million more PS5s, up from 2.4 million in the same quarter last year, which is good news for the continued appeal of the platform.&nbsp;Digging back through <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/18q2_supplement.pdf">Sony’s older financial statements</a>, the PS4 would have been at 79.6 million consoles sold by the same point in its lifetime, so the PS5 is sneaking ahead of the last generation at this point.</p>


<p>Even better, of course, is that people are still massively engaged with PlayStation gaming in general. There were 123 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network last quarter, up by seven million from the year before. Similarly, game sales for both PS5 and PS4 combined for 65.9 million games sold, up by 12.3 million from last year. Of that, 6.9 million were first party titles, and we’re now at the point where 83% of games sold are digital downloads.</p>
<p>All good stuff for Sony and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony’s CFO has stated that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> is expected to release by the end of March 2026, as Bungie’s independence from PlayStation Studios is now “getting lighter”</p>
<p>The statements came from CFO Lin Tao as part of a Q&amp;A following Sony’s latest financial statements, in which she said that launch is still expected within the current fiscal year, ending on 31st March 2026. However, as this was in response to a question over what would happen if Marathon was cancelled outright, she added, “this is not a commitment. No official announcement has been given yet.”</p>


<p>She also said, “We are now doing modifications in development and, based on the progress, in the autumn time frame we believe we can communicate when we can launch [Marathon], either from Bungie or PlayStation.”</p>
<p>For Bungie as a studio, there’s been plenty of speculation and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/bungies-independence-reportedly-under-threat-developers-suffering-low-morale/">reporting over their independence</a> and ability to operate separately from the rest of PlayStation Studios. Through 2024, the company went through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">a painful round of layoffs and game cancellations</a>, while some teams were branched off into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/sony-founds-new-studio-teamlfg-from-former-bungie-incubation-project/">separate studios</a>.</p>
<p>Tao explained Sony’s longterm plan for Bungie and that “at the time of acquisition we were offering a very independent environment, so that was one way of thinking. However, thereafter, we have gone through structural reform, as we announced last year, so this independence is getting lighter, and Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding.</p>

<p>“So in the long term, if you can see this as an ongoing process, the direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios.”</p>
<p>It’s definitely concerning times for Bungie, with the launch of Destiny 2’s latest expansion, The Edge of Fate, seeming to do poorly, both from the point of sales and reaction from the game’s fanbase. Marathon was intended to be the big shining hope for the company, but the extraction shooter revamp of the studio’s mid-90s FPS series has struggled to gain traction. Having been announced for release in September, closed testing drew strong criticism such that Bungie was forced to delay the game. There was also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/bungie-pins-marathon-art-plagiarism-on-former-employee-promises-to-do-right-by-original-artist/">a whole art plagiarism scandal</a>.</p>
<p>“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” the team wrote in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/marathon-has-been-delayed-as-bungie-commit-to-building-on-player-feedback/">a Marathon Development Update in June</a>. “We’ve taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion.”</p>
<p>It’s expected that Bungie will be able to make fresh announcements on the game this autumn.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-is-expected-to-release-by-march-2026-bungie-is-set-to-become-part-of-playstation-studios.1264224/</guid>

			<p>Bungie's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/">Marathon</a> will launch by March 2026, the end of the current fiscal year, although Sony has yet to commit to this release window.</p>



<p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A session which followed the company's latest financial report, where it was also revealed that Sony shipped <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/">80.3 million PlayStation 5 units</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-marathon-is-expected-to-release-before-march-and-bungies-independence-is-getting-lighter/">VGC</a>, Sony CFO Lin Tao confirmed that Marathon's sales were factored in the latest forecast, as the company expects the game to be out by March 2026. This, however, isn't a commitment to this release window, as the company believes it can announce a release date by this Fall, as previously confirmed. Though a release date hasn't been set, chances of Marathon being ultimately canceled are slim. The game's issues are being fixed, so the Sony CFO believes the game will indeed launch.</p>



<p>Besides commenting on the Marathon release date, the Sony CFO also commented on the current state of Bungie. Right after the acquisition, the Destiny 2 developer enjoyed a certain degree of independence, but this independence is getting lighter, and the developer is "shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios." Ultimately, the developer's direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">2024's restructuring</a> was one of the steps towards this direction.</p>



<p>Marathon was initially scheduled to release on September 23, but was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed</a> shortly after its reveal due to the game's bad reception and some controversies, including using <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">art assets from an artist without their permission</a>. With the additional development time, Bungie aims to up the survival game with more engaging AI encounters, more rewarding runs with new types of loot and dynamic events, increase visual fidelity, add more narrative and environmental storytelling elements, and improve the experience for solo and duo players. Hopefully, the additional development time will be enough to help Bungie give Marathon a distinct identity, which it didn't really show at reveal.</p>

            <p>A new joint investigation between the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud">Guardian</a>, Israeli-Palestinian publication <a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/">+972 Magazine</a>, and Hebrew-language outlet <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%9e%d7%99%d7%9c%d7%99%d7%95%d7%9f-%d7%a9%d7%99%d7%97%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%91%d7%a9%d7%a2%d7%94-%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%92%d7%a8-%d7%a9%d7%9c-8200-%d7%a2%d7%9c-%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%aa%d7%99-%d7%9e%d7%99/">Local Call</a> has claimed that Microsoft have worked with the Israeli military to store surveillance data on Palestinian civilians in Azure servers overseas, with some of that data allegedly being used to research and identify bombing targets. The report has led to renewed calls for game developers and players to join <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">the recently launched Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign</a> against Microsoft and Xbox gaming products and services - in particular, Minecraft, Call Of Duty, Candy Crush, and Game Pass. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report is based on interviews with 11 sources from Microsoft and the Israeli military, plus access to a cache of leaked Microsoft documents. In late 2021, the Guardian piece begins, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella met with Yossi Sariel, the commander of Israel's military surveillance agency Unit 8200, to discuss plans for storing intelligence data on Microsoft cloud servers. According to the report's sources, the inspiration for these proposals was that Israel's military did not have the storage space or computing power to handle the amount of data they wanted to collect and process.
</p>
<p>The alleged result of that conversation was a cloud-based system that became operational in 2022, and has been used to gather "indiscriminate" recordings of Palestinian phone calls in the West Bank and Gaza. According to the report, as of July this year around 11,500 terabytes of Israeli military data were being held in Microsoft Azure servers in the Netherlands, while a smaller proportion were stored in Ireland, though not all of this data may be from Unit 8200.
</p>
<p>"Thanks to the control it exerts over Palestinian telecommunications infrastructure, Israel has long intercepted phone calls in the occupied territories," the report notes. "But the indiscriminate new system allows intelligence officers to play back the content of cellular calls made by Palestinians, capturing the conversations of a much larger pool of ordinary civilians." One of the investigation's sources also explains how these phone recordings may have been used to plan airstrikes, commenting that intelligence officers would use the cloud-based system to examine calls made by people in the vicinity of an individual target.</p>
<p>Sariel ultimately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/head-of-israeli-spy-agency-unit-8200-resigns-over-7-october-failings">resigned his position in September 2024</a> in response to criticism for failing to anticipate the surprise Hamas-led attacks on Israeli civilians in October 2023, which left over a thousand dead with hundreds taken hostage. According to this week's Guardian report, he was accused of prioritising fancy new technology over older surveillance methods.</p>
<p>But the cloud-based system he allegedly developed with Microsoft's assistance is said to remain in use alongside AI-driven target recommendation tools, as the Israeli military continues a punitive and open-ended assault on Gaza that has killed over 60,000 people, the majority of them civilians, and left hundreds of thousands more homeless and starving.</p>
<p>The report argues that Microsoft had some awareness during development of the system that it was being used to collect phone calls and facilitate airstrikes. It cites internal records that show that during the initial 2021 meeting with Nadella, Sariel referred only to "sensitive workloads" of secret data, not the storage of Palestinian phone calls. But it adds that "documents suggest that Microsoft engineers understood the data stored in Azure would include raw intelligence, including audio files" and that Israel-based Microsoft staff, who allegedly include former members of Unit 8200, appear to have known about the project's overall objectives. </p>
<p>The report also references files that show that Microsoft executives anticipated hundreds in millions of dollars in revenue from the project, calling it "an incredibly powerful brand moment" for Azure.</p>
<p>Back in May, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">confirmed that they had supplied technology to the Israeli military for use in Gaza</a>. But they insisted that they had found "no evidence" that it was being used to target or harm Palestinians, citing an external review carried out by an unnamed third party.</p>
<p>They have also pushed back on this week's claims, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the Guardian that they have "no information" on the data being stored in the cloud by Unit 8200. "At no time during this engagement," the spokesperson added, "has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft's services, including through the external review it commissioned."</p>
<p>Asked about Nadella and Sariel's relationship, the spokesperson continued that the CEO "attended for 10 minutes at the end of the meeting" and there was "no discussion" of the exact content of the "sensitive workloads" above.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Microsoft's comments, this week's news has fuelled calls to join the BDS boycott, with some participants pointing out that this doesn't have to mean parting ways entirely with any and all Microsoft services. "BDS has a standing boycott target on Microsoft products which people can realistically drop from their lives, understanding that not everyone can change their operating system," wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kitsune-tails">Kitsune Tails</a> lead artist and gameplay designer Allison Shabet in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rally.luckyraven.cc/post/3lvr42n2vm22i">a Bluesky post yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/austinwalker.bsky.social/post/3lvr4m3lhi222">Bluesky thread</a>, game designer and writer Austin Walker added that "I've obviously been saying this a lot lately, but BDS does not expect anyone to drop everything made by Microsoft all at once. They pick very specific targets in order to get as wide a coalition as possible, and in the case of Xbox, even suggest different tiers of engagement."

              <p>Sony’s latest financial results are in, and the PS5 is doing better than anyone expected. Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-best-selling-forza-horizon-elder-scrolls-oblivion-1851787356">a woeful lack of new games</a> exclusive to the PlayStation console, people won’t stop buying the device, with another 2.5 million units bought between April and June 2025. That’s slightly better than it sold during the same period last year, and brings the lifetime total to 80.3 million. <a href="https://in.ign.com/xbox-series-x-1/238086/news/xbox-series-x-and-s-microsoft-has-reportedly-sold-less-than-30-million-consoles-this-generation">Recent rumors</a> have suggested that the Xbox Series may have sold only 30 million in the same time. Awks.</p> <p>Sony had some other big numbers to boast about. The PlayStation Network currently has 123 million “active users,” up seven million since the same time last year. Meanwhile, 65.9 million PS4 and PS5 games were sold in April to June’s Q1 up 12 million on 2024, although it’s notable that only 6.9 million of those were first party titles. Bear in mind that <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-sales-figures-2000614194">Nintendo sold six million copies of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a> alone in a single month, for a brand new console with no previously established user base, and you can see how Sony’s first party numbers look pretty shaky right now. Although given the success of PS Plus and the hefty cut taken for every software sale, it doesn’t seem like people will be too worried.</p> <p>This all means the PS5 is performing pretty much exactly as well as the PS4 and PS3 before it, all of which should make Sony delighted. Those machines sold during times of financial recovery, while the PlayStation 5 launched in the midst of global catastrophe. Covid was at its peak, while supply chain issues and chip shortages meant the machines couldn’t fill shelves until months after the official launch.</p>

 <p>Sony of course has multiple revenue sources, across music, movies and technology, with $17.8 billion in sales across all its divisions in Q1, again, slightly up on last year, movies alone reporting $2.3 billion. But gaming was responsible for over $6.3 billion, making the sector worth almost triple that of movies to the Japanese corporation. Imagine if the mainstream press noticed.</p> <p>These numbers clearly explain <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">Microsoft’s strategy</a> to start releasing its first-party games onto Sony’s console. A base of 80 million potential new customers is more than double its own, and taking advantage of this is <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-ps5-microsoft-xbox-1851786765">already proving extremely successful</a>. Of course Xbox games are going to launch day-one on PlayStation, when its tripling the possible audience.</p>

			<p>The wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong has been very long, but it definitely looks like it is almost over, as some lucky fans will be able to try out the game developed by Team Cherry in a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>As reported on the ResetERA forums, the highly anticipated second entry in the series will be playable at the Nintendo booth at this year's Gamescom, which takes place from August 20 to August 24 in Cologne, Germany. At the booth, players will also be able to try out <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-4k-60-fps-nintendo-switch-2/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-has-been-rated-by-the-esrb-suggesting-nintendo-switch-2-release-may-be-imminent/">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">Borderlands 4</a>, EA Sports FC 2026, and the already released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-hands-on/">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition.</a></p>



<p>With Hollow Knight: Silksong being playable for the first time to the public this month at both the Nintendo and the Xbox booths, and the game said to be available by the time the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds launch worldwide later this year, a release window which <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-out-this-year-team-cherry-confirms/">Team Cherry also&nbsp;confirmed</a>, there's no doubt a release date announcement is right around the corner. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-indie-world-direct-hollow-knight-silksong/">Yesterday</a>, it was suggested by creator Switchforce, who leaked the Nintendo Indie World Direct happening later today before its official announcement, that the game developed by Team Cherry won't be at the show, but there's still the chance the release date will be announced this month, as the Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase on August 19 would be the perfect stage for one of the most anticipated game announcements of the year.</p>

            <p>If you've tried to hop into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s open beta's early access period this morning and have ended up sitting a queue behind thousands of other folks in camo gear, then don't panic. Or at least that's what EA say, as their wrenches slam against the game's servers in an attempt to let more people in.</p>
<p>With players stuck <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mjubus/i_guess_im_not_playing_tonight/">twiddling</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mju39x/im_getting_trolled_by_the_servers/">their</a> <a href="https://x.com/Sephiroth_VM/status/1953395511010173366">thumbs</a> in lines that can stick you as far away as 240-something thousandth from the front, the developers have been jolted into action. After all, you don't want to anger the sorts of folks who're up for shooting some blokes on an otherwise chill Thursday morning.</p>

<p>"The team is now working on a substantial increase in server capacity, which will reduce your time in the queue," the official Battlefield comms account tweeted amid the cries. "Thank you for your continued patience as we work to get as many of you into the game as soon as possible."</p>
<p>As of a few minutes ago, it appears that works begun to see the lines go down. "We are now seeing signs of queue numbers returning to suitable levels and times," reads a follow-up tweet, "Thank you for your patience as we worked to mitigate the issue. We'll continue to keep an eye on queues and server capacity, and will follow up where needed!"</p> <div>

<p>So, hopefully if you've had to wait for your dose of early FPS access this morning, you should now be facing less time spent staring at a number. Maybe you've been smart and decided to give up on the line until this afternoon, in which case it sounds like you should end up getting in pretty rapidly if you're lucky.</p>
<p>If you've yet to double-check which modes, maps and changes from previous Battlefield Labs testing you'll be in for if you do jump into the open beta from today, August 7th, (early access) or August 9th (general), then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback">read this</a>. You'll also need to turn on secure boot on your PC to get into the beta, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">instructions as to how to do so here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped]]></content:encoded>

We don’t have concurrent player figures from Sony or Microsoft, so the open beta’s true concurrent figure will be much higher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But not all those players are actually playing. Those with early access were met with huge queues (we've seen 250,000 in screenshots posted to social media) as the servers hit max capacity. In response, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953383562289299732" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DICE issued a statement</a> to say it was working to improve matters:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team is now working on a substantial increase in server capacity, which will reduce your time in the queue,” DICE said. “Thank you for your continued patience as we work to get as many of you into the game as soon as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're looking forward to seeing you experience Battlefield 6, and we appreciate your patience!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That statement followed <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953364983057662181" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a message</a> in which DICE explained why it was using queues in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will use queues to protect the player experience but expect this impact to be minimal,” DICE insisted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You may encounter this during high peak moments, such as the start of servers going live. The team is working constantly to reduce any queue that takes place.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Holy sh*t 🤣<br>More than 270.000 players are waiting in server queue!</p><p>If you manage to join the Open Beta, you better don't leave game. <a href="https://t.co/x9lGfpyRAd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/x9lGfpyRAd</a></p></div>— Battlefield Bulletin (@BFBulletin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BFBulletin/status/1953377379180593285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here is that the open beta is peaking now as the early access kicks off, but the queues will ease. Given the open beta has gone live in early access form ahead of the U.S. waking up, it seems likely the player count will grow in the coming hours, and again when the open beta goes live for all this weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Battlefield 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-forces-pc-gamers-to-mess-about-with-their-bios-to-enable-secure-boot-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-next">how it requires PC gamers to enable Secure Boot</a>, how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-producer-admits-2042-was-missing-the-excellence-of-predecessor-battlefield-bad-company-2">it was inspired by the much-loved Battlefield: Bad Company 2</a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Some dataminers digging into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s files following the arrival of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-delayed-due-to-tsunami-warning">Duos update</a> claim to have uncovered some details about an endless mode.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/">PC Gamer</a>, said new mode is allegedly called 'Deep of Night', and will see you grouped with similarly skiller nighfarers to fight your way up through the ranks of a new rating system that players reckon could work similarly to Armored Core 6's rankings.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As of writing, the main sources of info about this endless mode are a Reddit thread penned by a user with the handle Adminisitrator and a video from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkLAD97-hCA">Scavinjx</a>. Having delved through a number of Reddit threads on the subject, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mgb1gf/comment/n6ncwnh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it appears</a> the original discovery of the files might have been by a user named <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/3286774?spm_id_from=333.1369.opus.module_author_name.click">Supuritto</a>, who <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/opus/1096362317248987138">shared their findings</a> on Chinese social media site BiliBili.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adminisitrator/comments/1mh908l/elden_ring_nightreign_new_mode_deep_of_night/">Adminisitrator's thread</a>, the in-game description of the mode reads as follows: "The Deep of Night is is a battlefield of endless Night. Victory will increase your rating, burnishing your depth. The darkness extends unto infinity." So, a long series of fights with the lights turned off, getting deeper and harder as you go, if you'll forgive the inherent Kenneth Williams 'ooh, Matron' nature of that last bit.</p>
<p>The dataminers claim you'll be working your way through five depths, with each having 999 rating levels to work your way up through, aside from depth five, which is for those elite boss battlers who reach rating 6000 or more. If you lose a fight, you'll slide back down the ratings and depths, but it looks like once you're through depth one, you can't be sent back beyond depth two. I assume that last bit might be a measure to limit cheeky low-level grinding by hardened vets.</p>
<p>As for new rewards, the post shows off screenshots of "depth relics" which it says you'll be able to equip in three new slots just for Deep of Night runs. These come with two buffs, plus one pesky debuff. New weapons work along the same lines, such as a great omenkiller cleaver that boosts your health restoration and damage negation, but increases the damage dealt to by by the encroaching night. Some enemies and bosses also look to be getting "magmafied" variants, which as you might expect see them turned a bit more orange, and I assume able to dish out some toasty damage.</p>
<p>As ever with leaks and datamines, it's worth taking all of this with a grain of salt unless FromSoftware announce that we are all going into the Deep of Night. The mode certainly looks like it could be an interesting alternative to the current weekly boss rotation that arguably leaves a bit to be desired, though I'll likely end up doing a Sum 41 and be in too deep fairly quickly.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-is-getting-an-endless-mode-with-special-relics-and-magmafied-bosses-claim-dataminers]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-is-still-scheduled-to-release-by-march-2026-sony-confirms.1264170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony has confirmed that Bungie’s Marathon will still release by the end of its current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, 2026.</p>



<p>The news came following Sony’s latest earnings report during its Q&amp;A section, where one investor asked for an update on the game and its management, as well as if the game could be canceled entirely.</p>



<p>Sony’s Chief Financial Officer, Lin Tao, responded to say that Bungie’s Marathon is still slated to release this current financial year. The statement comes just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-fy25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two months after a previous statement</a> saying the same thing.</p>



<p>“We are now fixing the problems. So we believe this launch will happen. And if this launch is canceled, we need to do a revision of the valuation. However, as of now, this is not expected,” Tao said.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon was delayed following a lukewarm reception to its reveal and playtests, with additional issues stemming from a huge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/artist-accuses-bungie-of-plagiarizing-work-for-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism accusation from a concept artist</a>, to which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie responded</a>.</p>



<p>On its delay, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie said</a> that the community’s messages have been “strong and clear”.</p>



<p>“The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling—survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining FPS combat,” the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post reads</a>. “We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like&nbsp;Marathon&nbsp;is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unlikely that Marathon will do well if it releases this fiscal year, or to be honest, ever. Nonetheless, Bungie seems determined to get the game out of the door and in at least some kind of playable and engaging fashion.</p>



<p>Do you think Marathon will succeed if released by March 2026? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re trying to play the Battlefield 6 Open Beta on PC, you might have run into a problem: ‘Secure Boot is not enabled.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are not alone. PC gamers hoping to play DICE’s latest now open beta early access is live have no choice but to enable Secure Boot on their PC. And a cursory glance at social media, subreddits and IGN’s own comments suggest some are having trouble with it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/screenshot-2025-08-06-214819-1754555745386.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 forces players to enable Secure Boot on PC.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA has published a user guide for how to enable Secure Boot on PC</a>, and promoted that guide across social media. It’s a guide I myself had to use to boot the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. But it certainly requires a degree of confidence, as it involves tinkering with a part of a computer not all PC gamers will be instantly familiar with: the BIOS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are things like TPM 2.0 (which must be turned on) to deal with, and you need to make sure your Windows disk is GPT and not MBR (not everyone will know what these are). All this before you can even enable Secure Boot — and then you may not be able to enable it anyway, which then means you need to refer to your manufacturer for guidance (gulp!).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, this won’t be a problem for more experienced PC gamers, but it will be an intimidating process for many others. And if you think this is something isolated to Battlefield 6, you’d be wrong. Just yesterday, Activision announced the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will require the exact same thing: Secure Boot enabled.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s all this in aid of? Strengthening game security using built-in Windows PC features. It’s no secret that cheating in competitive multiplayer games is a huge problem for publishers. Activision has spent millions trying to reverse the narrative for Call of Duty. EA will be mindful of Battlefield 6 getting overrun at launch. It seems TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are the new reality for PC gamers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Activision's explanation, from a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> published yesterday:</p><blockquote>TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) is an industry-standard, hardware-based security feature built onto CPUs or motherboards that verifies the PC’s boot process has not been tampered with. Secure Boot makes sure a PC can only load trusted software when Windows starts. </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">When Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 releases later this year, TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot will be required to play on PC. "These hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and we’re asking all players to get compliant now," Activision warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to Battlefield 6, and the open beta Secure Boot process has certainly caused some people to panic, and others to find themselves with additional problems they didn’t have before. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-huge-queue-to-get-in-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-before-its-even-out">Early indications suggest there’s huge interest in the Battlefield 6 open beta</a>, so it will be interesting to see how this one develops over the course of the weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> currently has close to 250,000 players waiting in queue for access, ahead of the today's early access beta period.</p>
<p>The game, which is set to release on the 10th October, is giving folks a chance to hop in starting later today, as well as this weekend and the next. Everyone who requested access to Battlefield 6's Labs tests has been given access to these weekend tests, which - it turns out - is a lot of people.</p>
<p>On Steam alone, the game has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">reached a player count of 296,500 as of writing</a>. That's almost 300,000 people sat in a queue.</p>

<p>Eurogamer's very own Ian Higton was in the queue around the 195,000 mark, but backed out to test how large the queue actually was. The result, a newfound spot at 227,240. Ouch. This does indicate there's no disconnection protection for the queue, so be sure you don't lose your internet connection while you wait, or you could find yourself in for an even longer queueing experience.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 has been a hotly anticipated game for a good while now, but ever since the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFGEMfyAQtI&amp;rco=1">Multiplayer reveal late last month</a> folks have been especially eager to hop in and try it out. The game will feature all the military FPS goodies you'd expect like large tank battles and squad-based combat, as well as the environmental destruction the series is known for.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">In our own preview of Battlefield 6's multiplayer</a>, we came away especially optimistic, writing:</p>
<blockquote>"I think the building blocks for a truly fantastic Battlefield game are here with Battlefield 6 - perhaps even an all-time great - but I need to see a little more, need to play a little more. I need to see where the dice fall, whether the gamble of bold gameplay changes land well - where the hivemind of Battlefield's playerbase find new strategies beyond the this-beats-that approach of old, say - or whether they simply muddy an otherwise potentially brilliant experience."</blockquote>
<p>If you're still keen to trial the Battlefield 6 beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-battlefield-6-multiplayer-early-access-code">you may be lucky enough to get a code via some avenues that are still open</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vinebound-tangled-together-review-%E2%80%93-cute-colourful-co-op.1264146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Sometimes, a great art style is all you need to capture players. That’s even clearer on a game show floor. This year’s Digital Dragons in Krakow, Poland, showcased a wide variety of upcoming games, and the most attractive amongst them was Vinebound: Tangled Together. In fact, its artstyle dragged me across the showroom floor to the booth, exactly like you and your co-op partner will be, as you fight off wave after wave of plant-based badniks in a Bullet Heaven style, while being tethered together. When I got home, I had to check it out again, and given that it’s priced at an ultra-budget level, there was very little reason not to.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vinebound: Tangled Together - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mKOVnWfdvFE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Vinebound is cute. You take control of a flowery little guy or gal, each of which offers its own stat benefits such as higher critical rates. As you progress, you unlock new characters, some of whom might have higher health but lower damage, and you can find the right chap for the job, and for forming the foundation of your build as you tackle each run.</p>


<p>Vinebound is best played co-operatively, though you can play alone if you must, taking control of each character simultaneously via the left and right analogue sticks. The subtitle is Tangled Together, and that should give you a good idea of how the two characters interact. A vine passes between the two of them, and you can move a certain distance apart or come closer together, before the vine springs back into shape. It means you have to work together as you move around the arena, especially as the resulting spring from an overstretched vine can send you careering into one of the many, many enemies.</p>
<p>As you move about, a flower travels along the vine, and each time it reaches your character, they fire their weapon. That means you need to be closer together to maximise firepower, but that’s not always possible, with copious bad guys spawning in, or hazards appearing to slow you down.</p>


<p>There’s then various weapons to equip, from a straightforward bow and arrow that fires in a straight line, to homing carrots that head to the nearest enemy. As you fell bad guys, they drop juice, and as you collect it, you each get to choose from three levelling-up cards. These boost your stats in some way, and you can begin to tailor your characters’ build until they’re a monstrous, carrot-firing menace.</p>
<p>The further you get, the more enemies there are, and the more weapons you can add to your twosome, but the harder it is to collect the juice. There’s plenty of risk and reward here, and if things are going your way you can find the upgrades popping up every twenty seconds, giving you just a little more chance of staying alive.</p>

<p>It all feels great. Playing through the game with my nine-year-old son, we were able to work together, taking out enemies, reviving each other, and dodging the bad guys and their bullets, even as the screen became more and more congested. It’s pure, focused and undeniably fun, and when our run came to its end, I just wanted to start again.</p>
<p>Luckily, you can do just that, pouring the currency you’ve unlocked into unlocking and upgrading your armoury, giving you a better starting point for your next run, and giving you more chance at finally making it all the way through a level, defeating the big boss that lies in wait at the end.</p>

<p>While the artwork for Vinebound: Tethered Together is going to be its initial selling point, it’s the frantic co-op gameplay that’ll keep you coming back for more. While we played on PlayStation, it especially feels like a perfect Nintendo Switch title, and since it’s launched across every platform for a very reasonable price of just a few quid, it’s well worth checking out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony has announced in its latest quarterly financial report that the PS5 has sold 80.3m units since its release in November 2020.</p>
<p>The report, <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf">which can be read here</a>, covers the full scope of Sony as a business. On page 12 details on the PlayStation 5's performance - as well as software and peripherals on the platform - are revealed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/playstation-5">PS5</a> sold 2.5m units in Q1 2025, a slight rise from the Q1 2024 figure of 2.4m. Software sales across PS5 and PS4 is up significantly however, with 65.9m copies sold compared to 53.6m at the same time last year.</p>

<p>Monthly active users of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus</a> are also up. 123m were recorded in Q1 2025, compared to 116m in Q1 2024. Add-on content (DLC) also saw a slight increase, bringing in 292,609m yen in Q1 2025 compared to 290,846 in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>Okay, so that's a lot of numbers, but what does it mean? Well, it means there's continued growth across pretty much all aspects of the PS5 business. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation">PlayStation</a> revenue from games, game DLC, and hardware is up. Plus, there are more people playing online on the PS5 than before.</p>
<p>The console passing 80.3m units sold throughout its life so far also puts it around about the same pace in terms of sales as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/playstation-4">PS4</a>, give or take a million or so. Given the rougher economic climate we're in right now, and the fact that there were serious supply issues at the start of the PS5's release, that's not too bad.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-5-has-sold-803-million-units-as-it-closes-on-in-on-fifth-anniversary]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/07/guitar-hero-veterans-form-new-studio-as-redoctane-returns/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guitar-hero-veterans-form-new-studio-as-redoctane-returns.1264137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A team of veteran game developers, who have previously worked on the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/guitar-hero">Guitar Hero</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dj-hero">DJ Hero</a> series, have established a new studio. That studio, which falls under the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/embracer">Embracer</a> Freemode umbrella, will revive the RedOctane name long after the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/activision">Activision</a> subsidiary was shuttered in 2010.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the focus of this newly (re)formed studio is “advancing the rhythm game genre, combining the past with the future” with RedOctane expected to announce its first game later this year – at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/gamescom">Gamescom</a> perhaps?</p>


<div id="attachment_462574"><p id="caption-attachment-462574">2023’s Fortnite Festival – developed by Harmonix – is the spiritual successor to Rock Band.</p></div>
<p>At its helm is Simon Ebejer, who worked as production director across numerous Guitar Hero games at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/neversoft">Neversoft</a> before becoming the studio head at Vicarious Visions, going on to hold the title of vice president of operations at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/blizzard">Blizzard</a>.</p>
<p>Ebejer will be flanked by fellow creators “who helped create and scale Guitar Hero and DJ Hero nearly two decades ago, as well as proven emerging development talent and community leaders from across today’s rhythm gaming space.” That talent includes the original founders of RedOctane, Charles and Kai Huang, who will join the revived studio in an advisory capacity.</p>

<p>Exactly what RedOctane is working on remains a mystery for now though hopefully an announcement is just around the corner. For a long time now, fans of Guitar Hero and Rock Band have been pining for a comeback, ready to trawl lofts and garages to retrieve their long-abandoned plastic instruments.</p>
<p>A straight-up successor to these genre-defining rhythm games seems like a no-brainer, but it’s far from being an open goal. Since 2023, rival developer Harmonix has been honing its Rock Band-like Fortnite Festival mode, plugging into the mass popularity of Epic’s battle royale shooter and its A-list celebrity crossovers.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there isn’t room for competition – a Guitar Hero game that weaves in elements from other genres, maybe? To truly evolve the concept, RedOctane will need to do more than simply dress up the old formula with modern graphics and a modern playlist of songs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Guitar Hero Live - Official Reveal Trailer | PS4, PS3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pc7QDU1aaB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One thing we’re particularly keen to know more about is the potential for a new guitar controller. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/20/guitar-hero-live-review/">Guitar Hero Live</a> was unfairly viewed as the final nail in the coffin for Activision’s series though it introduced some bold changes, namely the advanced six-button controller design we still swear by today.</p>
<p>Whatever RedOctane is working on, we can’t wait for this new phase of rhythm games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly financial results for Q1 2025</a>, we learned that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 console</a> has now shipped 80.3 million units, breaking the milestone of 80 million. That was thanks to 2.5 million units shipped this quarter, a slight increase compared to the 2.4 million units shipped in Q1 2024.</p>



<p>Overall, it was another excellent quarter for the PlayStation 5, with most indicators trending upward. Full game software sales increased from last year's 53.6 million units to 65.9 million units in the quarter, with a 23% increase. Even first-party game sales went up from 6 million units to 6.9 million units (+15%). The ratio of digital versus physical game sales skewed even more toward digital, which is more great news for Sony, reaching a historic 83%, up from 80% in Q1 2024.</p>



<p>The number of monthly active users (MAUs) on the PlayStation Network also increased, at least compared to Q1 2024, which registered 116 million MAUs, whereas this latest quarter saw 123 million monthly users on the PSN, a 6% increment. Of course, Q3 2024 and Q4 2024 registered higher MAUs (129 and 124 million, respectively), but that is always the case in those quarters.</p>



<p>Overall, sales for the Game and Network Services segment increased by 8% on a year-over-year basis. Sure, the PlayStation 5 is still lagging behind its predecessor, the PlayStation 4, when considering time aligned sales. In June 2018, that console had already shipped 82.3 million units, 2.1 million more than the PS5. </p>



<p>However, the PS5 had other issues to contend with, such as COVID-19, the global chip shortage that lasted from 2020 and 2023, and now increased prices due to the economic environment. All things considered, Sony is probably still happy with how it's going, even if it's selling a little less than the PlayStation 4.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-fastest-io-interactive-game-500k-wishlists-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-is-the-fastest-io-interactive-game-to-break-500k-wishlists-on-steam.1264125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>IO Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1953139116930986023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that 007 First Light has already surpassed 500K wishlists on Steam. It is the studio's fastest game to do so, beating their previous HITMAN games, though that's not very surprising when factoring in the power of the 007 IP.</p>



<p>As a reward to the community, IO Interactive revealed that the equippable Savanna Bloom skin will be available at release, and a series of animated wallpapers will be shared shortly. Furthermore, there are other 'missions' to complete if even more fans add the game to their wishlists ahead of the release:</p>



<ul>
<li>Milestone 2: Add flair to your fieldwork with a custom gadget skin, and stream like an agent with a bespoke overlay.</li>



<li>Milestone 3: Go in style with a Deluxe agent skin, plus unlock a developer AMA.</li>



<li>Milestone 4: Confidential. The contents of this final reward are top secret, for now…</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//4246066/5768ab8d3f75964ec4c2707eebe79afe53e81d04.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The title was <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-007-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in late 2020 as Project 007. In late 2024, IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> it aims to create a 007 gaming franchise, specifically a 'big trilogy'. 007 First Light was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-cinematic-trailer-revealed-will-launch-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> during Sony's June 2025 State of Play, showing off a cinematic trailer.</p>



<p>Players will step into the shoes of a young, reckless, but already resourceful James Bond as he goes through MI6's training program. After a particularly heroic act, the young naval air crewman is offered a spot in the newly revived Double-O program. However, when a mission to stop a rogue agent goes tragically wrong, Bond must team up with his reluctant mentor, Greenway, to expose a deep conspiracy and prevent an impending coup at the heart of the British state.</p>



<p>In short, it is an origin story that includes the events that transformed an audacious young hero into the best MI6 agent. Players will go on missions in breathtaking locations, drive iconic vehicles, and dive into a cinematic adventure in pursuit of a rogue agent who’s always one step ahead.</p>



<p>Owing to IO Interactive's sandbox approach already seen with HITMAN, players will be able to choose their approach: go silent or go loud. They can fight with fists or firepower, use gadgets to infiltrate, or bluff their way past guards. Moreover, 007 First Light will allow them to replay the missions with additional modifiers.</p>



<p>The game is slated to launch in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/guntouchables/" data-ref-id="5000-614232">Guntouchables</a>, a co-op roguelike doomsday shooter, has just launched into 1.0 on Steam with a hefty discount. How hefty? Well, it's 100% off! Now, that does come with the catch that you have to pick it up within the first 24 hours of launch, which started at 12 AM PT / 3 AM PT / 8 AM BST / 9 AM CEST, so you'll have to figure out how many hours you've got left yourself. Once you've claimed the game, it's yours for life, but if you miss out after the 24 hours are up, it'll revert to the still-pretty-affordable price of $5.</p><p dir="ltr">For those that haven't heard of Guntouchables before, it's a roguelike where the "entire world has fallen and the surface has been overrun by a hostile and aggressively evolving horde of mutants. Well, not entirely." That last part is in reference to a group of preppers, i.e. the characters you play as, who are tasked with defending their doomsday residence from the mutants. You can either play solo, or with up to three of your friends.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544011-guntouchables-screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544011" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544011-guntouchables-screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544011"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544011-guntouchables-screenshot.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544005-guntouchables_screenshot_10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544004-guntouchables_screenshot_9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544003-guntouchables_screenshot_8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544002-guntouchables_screenshot_7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544001-guntouchables_screenshot_6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544000-guntouchables_screenshot_5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543999-guntouchables_screenshot_4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543998-guntouchables_screenshot_3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543997-guntouchables_screenshot_2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543996-guntouchables_screenshot_1large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4544005,1300-4544004,1300-4544003,1300-4544002,1300-4544001,1300-4544000,1300-4543999,1300-4543998,1300-4543997,1300-4543996" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544005-guntouchables_screenshot_10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544004-guntouchables_screenshot_9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544003-guntouchables_screenshot_8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544002-guntouchables_screenshot_7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544001-guntouchables_screenshot_6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4544000-guntouchables_screenshot_5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4543999-guntouchables_screenshot_4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4543998-guntouchables_screenshot_3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4543997-guntouchables_screenshot_2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1713/17133350/4543996-guntouchables_screenshot_1large.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>       <figcaption>Guntouchables.</figcaption> <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544005-guntouchables_screenshot_10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544004-guntouchables_screenshot_9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544003-guntouchables_screenshot_8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544002-guntouchables_screenshot_7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544001-guntouchables_screenshot_6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4544000-guntouchables_screenshot_5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543999-guntouchables_screenshot_4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543998-guntouchables_screenshot_3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543997-guntouchables_screenshot_2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1713/17133350/4543996-guntouchables_screenshot_1large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game is mission based, and between missions you and the group you're playing with vote on a random selection of mutations the mutants can develop, making them harder to deal with--on the flipside, you also get some bonuses that also differ depending on your choice.

The turn-based RPG places players at the center of a decaying world ravaged by war, as those that survive must pick up the pieces and forge a new life to move forward.</p>

<p>The game's protagonist and her witty AI companion are at the forefront, protecting them from the threats that remain in this post-apocalyptic world. Along their journey, they will encounter challenging enemies and bosses, colourful characters, and uncover the secrets of their "future utopian world" that is packed with plenty of heart and personality.</p>

<h2><em>Artis Impact</em> Review: Built From Scratch, Pixel By Pixel</h2>

<p><em>Artis Impact</em> is a turn-based RPG developed by a single developer, Mas, a game cited as a "labour of love" by the developer, which took four years to complete. The game follows a charming female wanderer named Akane and her witty companion, an AI bot named Bot, as this oddball pairing delves into the remains of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-delayed-may" rel="nofollow">post-apocalyptic</a> world ravaged by a war between humans and AI.</p>

(Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Mas)</figcaption></figure><p>While much of the game will be spent exploring multiple areas as they accept missions from their commander, Akane embarks on a deeply personal quest while uncovering her mysterious past. There are plenty of secrets about Akane and this post-apocalyptic world for players to discover while sharpening their combat skills through training and implementing strategies to confront the various corrupted enemies and bosses that Akane and Bot will encounter.</p>

<p>The post-apocalyptic world of <em>Artis Impact</em> is beautifully designed by hand, blending 2D pixel art and "retro comic aesthetics," giving it that distinctive cozy charm in this dark and despondent world. Not everything in-game is all "doom and gloom," as the warm and lighthearted dialogue and moments shared between Akane, Bot, and the many NPCs that populate every area throughout this decaying world add plenty of personality and provide much comfort and hope for their futures.</p>

<h2><em>Artis Impact </em>Review: At The World's Apocalyptic End</h2>

<p>The end of the world has occurred as humanity bands together to try and find a future in this ravaged new world, and at the heart of this game's story is our protagonist, Akane, and her companion, Bot. The game begins with Akane and Bot inside her home at the Junkyard in Sunnyside, where they'll encounter their first AI enemy inside the subway before heading to the Lith Club.</p>

<p>This locale is the home of the aforementioned Lith Club, where Akane and her colleagues assemble to take on various assignments to combat the rogue AI enemies and bosses that are still in operation. It's here that, after completing a few main story quests, Akane will gain access to the Workshop, where she can train against dummies to improve her skills or access the Artificial World and face digitized enemies without much consequences, like death.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10598.jpg?itok=SK1ep5s5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10598.jpg?itok=Rgid_4r4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Death is everywhere in Artis Impact, except when facing enemies and bosses inside the Artificial World. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Mas)</figcaption></figure><p>The game's turn-based combat is very streamlined and easy to learn, where aside from her usual attacks, Akane can use various Arts to deal more damage, use Guard to block incoming attacks, and consumable items to replenish her HP and MP meters. Much later on, different food and drink items can grant Akane various buffs that will enhance her HP, MP, attack percentage, defense, and other stats that can turn any combative situation in her favor.</p>

<p>Let's not forget about Bot, who can equip various skills and items to assist Akane during battle. Akane can also equip similar items, such as jewelry pieces, to enhance her stats, as these items can be purchased from vendors or dropped from completing dungeons, areas, and defeating hidden bosses.</p>

<p>Another gameplay aspect of <em>Artis Impact </em>that I thoroughly enjoy is that Akane can take on various jobs throughout the world to earn an income. From working in a supermarket to being a pizza delivery person, a housekeeper, and more, some of these part-time jobs will require her to complete their adjacent side quests, which she could acquire ownership of these businesses and continue earning a passive income.</p>

<p>Akane can also earn money from completing quests, earning interest on funds in her bank account, and acquiring property, which these funds can help her make purchases and upgrade her weapons, Bot's equipment, and her Combat Rank. There's also a Respect mechanic, which functions similarly to a reputation system, allowing her to increase her Respect value by completing specific tasks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10816.jpg?itok=chB0VQ-k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10816.jpg?itok=3qqlzuXu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Akane can pick up full-time and part-time jobs in multiple areas where she can earn an income. (Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Mas)</figcaption></figure><p>By lending her services to defeat the area enemies and bosses, helping put NPCs in escort missions, and more, this increases her Respect, and if she reaches a specific Respect value, it will unlock a hidden ending for <em>Artis Impact</em>. Do keep in mind that certain actions and player choices can influence her Respect value and the overall story development, as certain narrative paths will lead to "relationship and emotional dynamics" with various NPCs.</p>

<h2><em>Artis Impact </em>Review: Unforeseen Technicalities</h2>

<p>While I was deeply impressed with the game's art style, combat system, and character development, there were a few things that didn't resonate with me during my hands-on experience with <em>Artis Impact</em>. Once Akane accepts a mission to Sandy Bay to investigate AI-related activities, certain areas begin to lag, especially the cave system at the Mosswood Foothills, making exploration and, subsequently, engaging in combat, rather tedious and frustrating at times.</p>

<p>Key bindings become delayed or unresponsive at times, which can result in selecting the wrong action to perform when in combat, which the enemy or boss can take advantage of. While the game's narrative is well-written and it does take a while for the story to get rolling, another issue of concern I had with the game is that certain character dialogue, more specifically with the male NPCs, was quite concerning when Akane interacted with them, as the language was rather problematic.</p>

<p>Akane's male colleague, Billy, is one such character who frequently expresses his viewpoints on women early in the game, stating that he wasn't interested in a woman's opinion and that their place in the world "should be at home." As the game does inform players that treating others with respect is a widely accepted norm, not just in-game but also in real life, Billy is just one of many characters that displays this kind of behavior towards the female characters through language until a pivotal moment; however, it's unclear if this decision is intentional to reflect discordance amongst society given the world's setting.</p>

<h2><em>Artis Impact</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10673.jpg?itok=e7MNWYl5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/artis-impact-screenshot-10673.jpg?itok=UZ_SJvC0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The game's turn-based combat is simple in its design but extremely engaging once Akane unleashes powerful attacks to defeat them.(Picture: Ashleigh Klein / Mas)</figcaption></figure><p>Following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review-birds-of-feathering" rel="nofollow"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a>, <em>Artis Impact</em> was a much-needed game to play in the short break, especially given how <em>Wuchang</em> can be pretty frustrating at times (those boss battles were tough as nails after all). Despite the rather bleak and hopeless post-apocalyptic world in which the game is set, the charming characters and the hilarious, lighthearted dialogue exchanged between Akane, her companion, and various NPCs do bring warmth and a cozy vibe during these dark times.</p>

<p>Akane's personality perfectly complements Bot's, the latter of whom can be rather direct or confrontational towards her and the other characters at times, but they do share plenty of heartwarming moments that are memorable to experience. There were some lagging issues experienced in certain areas, which did take me out of my gameplay experience, mainly due to them being tied to the main story, and I had no choice but to trudge through them as they were essential for advancing the quests.</p>

<p>The pixel and retro comic book art design, along with the enchanting music, further enhanced the game's cozy post-apocalyptic aesthetics; however, the fluid turn-based combat is an absolute favorite, and I enjoyed engaging in battle each time an enemy or boss was encountered. Some dungeon and hidden bosses can be challenging to face, as each has unique tactics that will make these match-ups quite hard to counter, for which players will need to spend some time upgrading Akane and Bot's weapons and equipment to turn the tables in their favor.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sony-sales-figures-reveal-growth-80-million-ps5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-sales-figures-reveal-growth-as-80-million-ps5s-are-sold.1264104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Group has published a financial update for Q1 FY25, the period ending June 30, 2025. In the report, the company reported substantial growth in the PlayStation space, with digital sales, customer retention, monthly active users, and hardware sales showing strong trends.</p>



<p>It was noted that, thanks to 2.5 million PS5 units being sold in the financial quarter, the total count has now exceeded <strong>80 million units </strong>so far in the PlayStation 5’s lifecycle, which commenced in 2020.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-strong-momentum">‘Strong Momentum’</h2>



<p>The report filed <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_sonypre.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Sony Group</a> tells a positive story for the tech titan, especially where the PlayStation arm of the corporation is concerned. In a line pulled from the report, it was revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>User engagement continued its<strong> strong momentum</strong>, with Monthly Active Users in June and total gameplay hours across PlayStation during Q1 FY25 both increasing 6% year-on-year.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This has been enough for Sony to ‘upwardly revise’ its operating income forecast.</p>



<p>It was remarked that a strong window for new titles helped fuel the performance of the PlayStation platform in Q1 FY25. In the period, 72 million games were sold across PlayStation’s ecosystem, 83% of which were purchased digitally.</p>



<p>The only core negative to take away from the report referenced an incoming impact from ‘a delay in the launch timing of a first-party title’, which wasn’t named but is assumed to be Bungie’s Marathon, the plagued extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Player counts were also up over the last period, with 123 million active users logging in during Q1 FY25, up 8 million from the number recorded in the previous period. Again, the slate of games launched in the window (Oblivion Remastered, Clair Obscur, Death Stranding 2, Forza Horizon 5) contributed to that greatly.</p>



<p>Recently, the PlayStation brand was in the news when Sony Group’s CEO stressed that the future of the platform, with the PlayStation 6 at the heart of it, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-is-top-of-sonys-priorities-right-now-says-sony-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s top priority</a>.</p>

For a new season, Fortnite typically goes offline for four hours at a minimum, and often longer. Sometimes <em>much </em>longer--Fortnite was offline for 18 hours ahead of the start of Chapter 5 Season 2 last year. If all goes well, you can expect Fortnite to come back online, at the earliest, <strong>around 3 AM PT / 6 AM ET</strong>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock 'N Awesome | Hybrid Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>When Fortnite's servers do return to action, the new bug-squishing season teased in trailers will kick off. With collabs that include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-a-free-halo-skin-in-fortnite/1100-6533721/" data-ref-id="1100-6533721">Halo</a> and Power Rangers--along with whatever other secrets Epic has in store--this season will have a very late '90s, early aughts feel to it. The bug takeover will begin immediately when servers come back up. There will be a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6856/" data-ref-id="2900-6856">battle pass</a> full of several new skins, plenty of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-chapter-6-season-4-all-guns-and-loot/2900-6855/" data-ref-id="2900-6855">new weapons</a>, several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-map-changes-in-chapter-6-season-4-shock-n-awesome/2900-6854/" data-ref-id="2900-6854">map changes</a>, and likely a few new movement items, which are reliably some of the best parts of every season. My Fortnite crew is routinely annoyed at how few actual guns I carry because I want to have all the stylish movement items instead. </p><p>Whether you're like me or you prefer to go guns-blazin', Fortnite's Shock 'N Awesome Chapter 6 Season 4 arrives early on the morning of August 7. See you on the island!</p>

<p>In your sights</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>One of the many new features of the Switch 2 is the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode ability. It's already been showcased within the launch window with new and old titles, and later this year, it will be available in Samus' first-person adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>If you are eager to warm up your FPS skills beforehand, it's been confirmed the new Switch 2 upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> this week has added mouse controls. Gyro controls are also apparently supported. Some players have already shared their thoughts about these control options – with <a href="https://x.com/TheEpicManWorld/status/1952956457181139286">some individuals pointing out</a> how you can swap between these controls on the fly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TheEpicMan: "What impressed me is that you can change from normal controls to mouse mode instantaneously! No need to go to the menu to turn it on or off!" (via social media)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from this, Apex Legends seems to have been well-received so far, although you'll need to make some space if you want to play it, as the title is over 78 GB on the Switch 2, according to the official eShop listing.</p>
<p>You can download Apex Legends for free on the Switch 2 (and Switch) and try out mouse mode right now. We've also got a Nintendo Life review for this game on the way, so be on the lookout for that. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> was also recently added to the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' service, and it also includes mouse support.</p>

<p>For all of the completionists out there, here is everything you need to know about getting every trophy and achievement in Madden 26.</p>



<p>Earning achievements and trophies in sports games is much different than single-player narrative titles. Usually, they spoil story elements or give away secret easter eggs. But with&nbsp;Madden 26, for example, all you need to do is progress in different game modes and pull off miraculous performances on the field.</p>



<p>So without any further ado, let’s jump right into what you should expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-madden-26-achievement-amp-trophy">How to Get Every Madden 26 Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Playing as Josh Allen will make achievements easier. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although there aren’t many trophies in Madden 26, it will still be a challenge for players looking to complete 100% of the game. Regardless of what game mode you prefer, getting every achievement and trophy requires you to master every phase of the game.</p>



<p>With that in mind, here is everything you need to know about earning every achievement and trophy—credit to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/game/Madden-NFL-26/trophies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueTrophies</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-secret-trophies">All Secret Trophies </h2>



<p>There is only one secret achievement in Madden 26, and it is earned by forcing a fumble using the strip ball mechanic. </p>



<p>To use the strip button defense, it is R1 on PlayStation and RB on Xbox. For the best results, you should use this button when you are near the ball carrier and have an opportunity to knock the ball out of their hands. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-madden-26">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies in Madden 26?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 28 regular trophies and achievements in Madden 26 and one secret achievement. </strong></p>



<p>Most of the achievements should be easy to complete because there aren’t any restrictions on what difficulty you have to earn the trophy on, meaning you can adjust the settings to the easiest options and breeze through some of the challenges, such as finishing a game with at least 300 yards passing and no interceptions.</p>



<p>That being said, reaching max level with every Superstar position will take time and dedication. Additionally, it will be challenging to break the single-season passing and rushing records, regardless of how good you are at Madden. </p>

<p>In case you missed it, there's apparently going to be a "playable" public demo of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a>. It will be available next week at the <a href="https://worlds.pokemon.com/en-us">Pokémon World Championships 2025</a> – taking place in Anaheim, California between <strong>15th - 17th August, 2025</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fqrnlpu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Additionally, the same demo will be available to play at Gamescom a week later – between <strong>20th - 24th August 2025</strong>. We don't know the specifics about this demo just yet, or if there's any chance of a demo being made available on the eShop in the future, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>Again, if there are interesting details or findings within this demo, we'll let you know. And if there are other demo locations announced, we'll give you the heads up. This follows the release of a new trailer for Pokémon Legends Z-A during the July Pokémon Presents, which gave fans a look at Mega Dragonite and much more.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also released kiosks alongside the Switch 2 that feature <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-demo-spotted-in-the-wild">playable demos of games</a> like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
