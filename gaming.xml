<p>Announced via Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial briefing</a>, the company states that the "cumulative number of<br>
visitors surpassed half a million as of the end of September", and that it will continue to implement randomly selected drawings going forward. This is simply due to the large number of numbers, and Nintendo has apologised for any inconvenience this might cause.</p>
<p>It notes that it opened a new art gallery on 3rd September 2025 showcasing development materials and original character art, while reiterating its plan to host limited-time light displays from December 2025.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, visitors will also be treated to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-museum-introduces-limited-time-mario-bros-40th-anniversary-ticket">limited Super Mario Bros. 40th anniversary ticket design</a>. Available for "approximately one year", its introduction coincides with "a special installation featuring the Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary logo" that visitors can take photos with during their stay.</p>
<p>Nintendo has offered up a whole bunch of announcements for Mario's 40th birthday, including the debut trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, plus the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</a> for the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games and Google have announced they have reached a settlement on their longstanding legal feud, which began in August 2020 and was filed at the same time as Epic's lawsuit against Apple.</p>



<p>The Fortnite and Unreal Engine maker challenged both mobile giants for their monopolistic practices and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-wins-landmark-anticompetitive-lawsuit-against-google-with-unanimous-verdict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scored a complete victory against Google in December 2023</a>, which was subsequently upheld in appeals. Earlier this month, Google even appealed to the Supreme Court, but with no avail. </p>



<p>A few hours ago, Google's President of the Android ecosystem, Sameer Samat, <a href="https://x.com/ssamat/status/1985920218602918343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a> that a proposed set of changes, devised in collaboration with Epic, would increase developers' choice and flexibility, reduce fees, and encourage greater competition, all while ensuring user safety.</p>



<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney expressed his joy <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1985920786545123613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the following tweet response</a>:</p>



<p><em>Google has made an awesome proposal, subject to court approval, to open up Android in the US Epic v Google case and settle our disputes. It genuinely doubles down on Android's original vision as an open platform to streamline competing store installs globally, reduce service fees for developers on Google Play, and enable third-party in-app and web payments. This is a comprehensive solution, which stands in contrast to Apple's model of blocking all competing stores and leaving payments as the only vector for competition.</em></p>



<p>In practice, Google has agreed to lower its fees to 20% for in-app purchases that include accessing a gameplay advantage and 9% for those that do not. Alternative payment options will be displayed side by side with Google Play Billing in apps like <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Epic Games Store</a>. Moreover, a key point is that starting with a version of the next major Android release through June 30, 2032, Google will modify future versions of the Android operating system to allow users to install a Registered App Store from a website by clicking on a single store install screen using neutral language. </p>



<p>Since these changes would apply globally instead of just in the United States, Epic reckons this is a better option than the previous changes mandated by Judge Donato. Google and Epic are now scheduled to discuss these proposed changes with the Judge tomorrow. If approved, this would also conclude the lawsuit between the two companies.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s imminent release has been a long time coming – <strong>almost a decade</strong>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="d3744b6137770"><a title="Nintendo Store 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3744b6137770/nintendo-store-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has launched a storefront app – simply titled <strong>Nintendo Store</strong> – for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znej">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988">iOS</a>, letting you browse everything including eShop titles, accessories, amiibo, apparel, and more.</p>
<p>Originally available exclusively in Japan as the 'My Nintendo' app, this has now been updated and reworked for worldwide use. It's not quite a dedicated experience, mind you, since clicking on any given product will take you through to the relevant page in your default browser.</p>
<p>That said, it's a good way to quickly see what's new and on offer, particularly if you enable notifications for new sales. You can also review your play activity for the Switch, Switch 2, 3DS, and Wii U. For the latter two systems, you'll need to ensure you link your Nintendo Network ID with your Nintendo Account, with play activity available prior to February 2020.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8PPa7JzGiQE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957ywkpmt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Interestingly, play activity for every game is broken down further than ever. Previously, either via console or the Nintendo Switch App, you could see how many total hours you'd sunk into any given game.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Store app, however, it literally breaks this down into play activity each day. So you can see exactly how much time you've sunk into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, for example, every day since its launch back in October (though if you boot something up very briefly, it'll log the play activity as "a little while" rather than an exact time).</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features directly from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Shop on My Nintendo Store</strong> – You can use this app to browse Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch systems and accessories, physical and digital games, and other Nintendo products and merchandise—and then jump directly to My Nintendo Store to make purchases. (Note: Physical products are not available in all countries / regions.)</p>
<p><strong>- Get the Latest Info on Games</strong> – You can stay up-to-date with the latest news on Nintendo games, events, and more!</p>
<p>- <strong>Receive Notifications About Sales</strong> – You can turn on push notifications for when items on your Wish List go on sale.</p>
<p>- <strong>Review Your Play Activity</strong> – You can sign in with your Nintendo Account to see your Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch play activity. If you had a Nintendo 3DS or Wii U system, you can see your play activity logged prior to February 2020. (Note: To view your Nintendo 3DS and Wii U play activity, you’ll need to link your Nintendo Network ID (NNID) to your Nintendo Account.)</p>
<p>-<strong>Check in at Events</strong> – You can use the app to check in at official Nintendo stores and events and earn related rewards! Your check-in activity will also be accessible within the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The addition of the storefront app comes as Nintendo updates its financials for Q2 2026, confirming that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">Switch 2 has already sold over 10 million units worldwide</a>. It's also increased its forecast for the remainder of the financial year from 15 million units to 19 million units.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-deck-feature-screen-off-downloads/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-deck-has-just-been-given-a-feature-users-have-wanted-for-years.1344082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve has officially rolled out a new feature for the Steam Deck that allows users to download games and updates while the screen is <strong>switched off</strong>, improving battery life, reducing screen burn, and boosting convenience. The ‘Display-Off Low-Power Mode’ means that users no longer have to keep their device powered on and live while installing things.</p>



<p>This marks the delivery of one of the most asked-for features since the Steam Deck was first released in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-valve-releases-display-off-low-power-mode-for-the-steam-deck">Valve Releases Display-Off Low-Power Mode for the Steam Deck</h2>



<p>The new Display-Off Low-Power Mode enables the Steam Deck to continue downloading content even when the screen is turned off. Once downloads are complete, the device will enter a sleep mode <strong>automatically</strong>, which is similar to how modern consoles like the PlayStation 5 operate.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a further evolution, it was confirmed that a status screen is accessible by pressing a button or moving one of the joysticks, allowing users to check on their download progress without fully waking their Steam Deck. The Deck will revert to full sleep mode if the battery drops below 20% (unless you’ve got it plugged in or docked).</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-enable-display-off-low-power-mode">How to Enable Display-Off Low-Power Mode</h3>



<p>The feature Valve has added is available in the Beta and Preview channels. To activate it, you’ll need to follow these steps to switch it on:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel</li>



<li>Opt into the Beta or Preview Channel</li>



<li>Navigate to Settings &gt; Power to configure display-off downloads</li>
</ol>



<p>You can then further tweak the setting to choose whether downloads continue when the device is reliant on battery power.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to comment positively on social media when Valve posted the news, which marks a great step forward for the Steam Deck as plenty of other handheld devices swarm.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-devs-introduce-arcadia-beg-to-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-devs-introduce-%E2%80%98arcadia%E2%80%99-alongside-a-song-begging-people-to-play-the-game.1344079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest episode of Build a Rocket Boy and MindsEye, the team has made several changes to the base game and introduced ARCADIA, an integration that allows players to access a repository of missions, races, and challenges. It’s the UGC platform at the heart of MindsEye, and it appears to be a rebranding of the ‘Everywhere’ product marketed by BARB.</p>



<p>While deploying the update that revealed the ARCADIA brand, BARB removed free roam mechanics from MindsEye and added some new movement abilities, like dodge rolls.</p>



<h2 id="h-they-could-have-picked-a-better-song">They Could Have Picked a Better Song</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Build a Rocket Boy published a short trailer introducing ARCADIA, an ‘ever-expanding world of missions, races, puzzles, and challenges.’</p>



<p>MindsEye is now subtitled as being <strong>powered by ARCADIA</strong>.</p>



<p>However, fans with sharp ears were able to listen to the song that backed the ARCADIA trailer, picking out the most questionable lyrics imaginable. The closing line of the song goes, ‘<em>Play my game is all I’m asking</em>.’</p>



<p>In the six days since the trailer was uploaded on the MindsEye channel, it has picked up just 9,000 views, which is indicative of the complete lack of interest in BARB’s debut title.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Mere weeks ago, past and present MindsEye developers were accusing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/past-and-present-mindseye-developers-accuse-build-a-rocket-boy-of-mistreatment/">Build a Rocket Boy of mistreatment</a> during the development process of the game. More than 100 developers came forward with accusations. </p>



<p>In July, not too long after the game’s launch, it was announced that MindsEye would be ‘relaunched’ after internal struggles and issues with the game were fixed, and that might be what the introduction of ARCADIA is approaching.</p>



<p>It was also the same time that Leslie Benzies, CEO of BARB and former Rockstar North president, suggested that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-relaunch-as-ceo-blames-saboteurs/">‘saboteurs’ had impacted</a> MindsEye’s disastrous launch.</p>



<p>Do you think MindsEye should just fade out of existence, or did you actually enjoy the game? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The organization failed to make waves in VALORANT since joining the space five years ago, coming in first place in a handful of minor events, and never managed to gain too much traction.</p>

<p>In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/TSM/status/1985407024457531667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TSM wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In 2020, TSM joined VALORANT esports with an entertaining and competitive roster that is fondly remembered to this day. We pushed for co-streaming permissions for Myth to watch party our team before it became a staple of VALORANT as it is today. We signed a main team, a high-level academy team, and were one of the first organizations to sign a Game Changers roster – all with the goal of developing teams and talent from the ground up.</p>



<p>Throughout the last three years, we have continuously navigated the Challengers circuit in the hopes of finally reaching Tier 1. We improved gradually, year over year, culminating in an Ascension Grand Finals berth in 2025.</p>



<p>Now, after half a decade in VALORANT, we plan on exiting the space with no immediate return in sight.</p>



<p>We would like to thank Riot for their coninued attempts to restructure the Tier 2 ecosystem for the better, and for creating a game we all love. We extend our deepest appreciation to all our players over these past five years who have made our history within this esport possible.</p>



<p>Thank you to the fans of the black-and-white who followed us on our journey through VALORANT. Through all the ups and downs, and the barriers placed before us, we always tried to make you proud.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>TSM was one of the first organizations to invest in VALORANT, but it never amounted to much.</p>



<p>This exit follows other strategic shifts the company has made recently. The brand’s LCS spot was sold recently, and it tried to break into emergent games like The Finals, from Embark Studios.</p>



<p>While TSM remains active in the overall industry, the withdrawal from VALORANT marks a broader recalibration for the team.</p>



<p>Are you shocked that TSM pulled out of VALORANT? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When you think about North Korea, the last thing on your mind is probably <strong>esports games</strong>. From a dictator-led regime to a fiercely censored way of life, North Korea has long remained a mysterious territory that few people see the reality of.</p>



<p>One social media user traveled to Pyongyang, North Korea, and managed to dispel some of that mystery, stumbling upon a gaming café packed with talented esports players enjoying games like Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<p>It goes against everything we’ve been led to believe about North Korea.</p>



<h2 id="h-north-korea-s-gaming-cafes-look-fantastic">North Korea’s Gaming Cafés Look Fantastic</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, a user named Sally Yin uploaded images of a high-tech gaming café in North Korea, specifically in the region of Pyongyang. It’s a far cry from the drab, miserable images we’re used to seeing in the West, which have long been named ‘propaganda’ by those supportive of North Korea.</p>



<p>Sally went on to explain that the café she found was only opened back in April, and at the start, it was restricted <strong>only </strong>to North Korean locals. Since then, the center has opened up to tourists and foreigners residing in the country.</p>



<p>Back in April, Kim Jong Un, the North Korean Supreme Leader, visited the ‘game house’ and approved of the site and the potential it would bring to young people in the area.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Reportedly, more than 70 games could be selected from the PCs available in the gaming café, which can be used on a pay-as-you-go or a membership basis. The list included top esports titles like Counter-Strike 2, Rainbow Six Siege, and Dota 2.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, the café also featured games like Call of Duty and Far Cry, which often portray themes of overthrowing dictators or oppressors, which might be considered ironic for a North Korean business. It was noted that accessing the internet is prohibited in the café and that applications like Steam can’t be accessed.</p>



<p>Are you surprised to learn that North Korea has high-tech gaming cafés? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FaZe Clan’s run at IEM Chengdu 2025 ended in heartbreak as expectations were shattered – and <strong>not in a good way</strong>. The Counter-Strike 2 powerhouse of a squad (or <em>former powerhouse</em>) bowed out in last place following an early loss against Virtus.pro, marking a new all-time low for the roster. It has been an inconsistent year for FaZe Clan, to say the least, but the Chengdu loss is a fresh concern for fans.</p>



<p>What happened to FaZe Clan in IEM Chengdu?</p>



<h2 id="h-sudden-collapse">Sudden Collapse</h2>



<p>FaZe opened the series with promise, securing a map win over Virtus.pro on Overpass, which was ironically their opponent’s pick. It was a dominant opener that had the roster feeling confident, but Virtus turned things around, flipping the script and forcing a decider on Inferno.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan faltered, Virtus.pro became methodical, and the series fell apart. For FaZe Clan, it was a quick ticket home with a 0 -2 win-loss record at IEM Chengdu.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that IEM Chengdu wasn’t an isolated stumble, but the latest in a string of underwhelming results for FaZe Clan through 2025. They’ve had a rocky 12 months in tournament placements, failing to secure a truly major victory since <strong>last year’s </strong>IEM Chengdu in April 2024.</p>



<p>It was argued after the eviction from IEM Chengdu that recent roster changes weren’t necessarily to blame, but systemic concerns within the organization are playing a bigger part in the wider picture.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan’s elimination from IEM Chengdu is more than just another loss—it’s a <strong>wake-up call</strong>. The organization, which was once one of the winningest and most dominant brands in Counter-Strike, faces something of an identity crisis. Ahead of the 2026 season, fans are concerned that not enough bold decisions will be made to change the woeful flow.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s a deeper issue at FaZe Clan? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa touched on the ways Nintendo builds relationships with its consumers. As part of this, he revealed some updated data about the player numbers within the company's ecosystem as of 30th September 2025.</p>
<p>There are currently <strong>400 million</strong> Nintendo Accounts, and in terms of active Switch Online memberships, there are <strong>34 million users</strong>. Nintendo mentions how there are also <strong>128 million</strong> "annual playing users", further noting:</p>
<p>"The number of annual playing users refers to the number of Nintendo Accounts, out of all Nintendo Accounts registered to a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 system, that used Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 software one or more times during the 12-month data aggregation period. The count does not include use of services such as Nintendo eShop. Past usage data is collected when hardware is connected to the internet, so the results are revised retroactively."</p>

<p>Nintendo says it will continue to bring its entertainment to an "ever-wider audience". In the same briefing, the president noted how the company is extending beyond dedicated video game platforms with movies and videos, character merchandise, mobile apps, and real-world experiences such as the Nintendo Museum, theme parks and annual Live events.</p>
<p>There were no specific updates attached to this data about future plans for Switch Online content or the Nintendo Classics library going forward, but the company has been regularly updating this subscription service with retro games, extra bonuses and even special apps. Next year, it will bolster the service with the Virtual Boy library.</p>
<p>Nintendo Accounts and the Switch Online service also give users access to online play and other features such as GameChat. You can see all of this in action in the video above.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-878-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-wednesday-november-5.1344037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You’ve made it (so far) to the middle of the week, but whatever tribulations you’ve been through, you still need to overcome today’s challenge. The NYT Connections puzzle for today is a tricky one, but that’s where I come in. Below, I’ve shared the best NYT Connections hints you need to wrap your puzzle up nicely and quickly.</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections solutions you need for today.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #878:</p>



<ul>
<li>KNIGHT</li>



<li>COAT</li>



<li>BUTCHER</li>



<li>BAKER</li>



<li>FLACK</li>



<li>KNIFE</li>



<li>CANDLESTICK</li>



<li>MAKER</li>



<li>FRANKLIN</li>



<li>FOREST</li>



<li>BOW</li>



<li>BLOW</li>



<li>SPOIL</li>



<li>WRENCH</li>



<li>BOTCH</li>



<li>ROPE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of verbs that describe messing something up—whether it’s a recipe, a plan, or a performance.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are the classic implements you’d find in a whodunit board game. Colonel Mustard would know.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Last names only—each belongs to a legendary artist whose vocals defined a genre and an era.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word completes the phrase “rain_____” to form something familiar, poetic, or practical.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 5.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-5-878">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 5 (#878)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BLOW, BOTCH, BUTCHER, SPOIL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CANDLESTICK, KNIFE, ROPE, WRENCH</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BAKER, FLACK, FRANKLIN, KNIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BOW, COAT, FOREST, MAKER</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Nintendo's movie business is already booming following the release of the Mario Movie in 2023, which was a global box office hit.</p>
<p>Since then, it's announced a live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a> film, and more recently lifted the lid on <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> (a follow up to the first animated Mario Movie). It's also got Nintendo Pictures and Nintendo Stars helping out with the expansion of video and movie content, and Shigeru Miyamoto has been working closely with the current movie projects.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what the plan is beyond this, the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial briefing</a> has now teased there's even more on the way with a simple graphic. The aim is to build a framework for a "consistent release cadence":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Following up on the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023, we have The Super Mario Galaxy Movie scheduled for release in 2026, and the live-action movie of The Legend of Zelda planned for 2027.</p>
<p>We are continuing to prepare for the ongoing release of movies in the future."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted in the graphic above, the next movie is The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, due out in April 2026. This will be followed by The Legend of Zelda movie, which is scheduled for 2027. The main characters for the Zelda movie have been cast, but we don't know much else about it at this stage.</p>

It's even led to the Japanese firm decreasing its overall sales forecast for this particular system.</p>
<p>If you are wondering how long the original family of Switch systems will be supported for, ultimately, it comes down to certain market factors. And even though it's selling less overall, sales are still maintaining a steady pace even after the Switch 2's launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mzqvhp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's what Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa had to say about <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">the company's support of the original Switch</a> going forward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While our business focus will shift to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch has maintained a steady sales pace even after the June launch of its successor. While taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration, we will continue sales of Nintendo Switch hardware."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there's no end-of-life date or anything similar (<em>at least for now</em>), and the original hybrid system will still be available to purchase in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously confirmed future support of the system with upcoming releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> (both due out in 2026), and even a major update scheduled for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, there's still more than enough time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">for the Switch to topple the DS</a> as Nintendo's best-selling system of all time. The only console ahead of it at that point would be Sony's PlayStation 2, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/sorry-nintendo-but-it-doesnt-look-like-switch-will-overtake-ps2-as-the-best-selling-console-of-all-time?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">but the two devices are currently about six million sales apart</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo isn’t planning on stopping movie adaptations of its games. Even more so, according to a new sales report, it’s going to be a more common thing.</p>



<p>For the longest time, video game adaptations were a curse on Hollywood. It never seemed to work out, no matter what form it took, from animated (like Final Fantasy) to live-action (like Max Payne). However, the 2020s proved to show it off in style, having massive successes like Sonic the Hedgehog, Fallout, Arcane, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-tv-show-receives-high-praise-from-critics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a>. One of those hits was Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which raked in more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-movie-record-breaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one billion dollars</a> at the box office. With a sequel and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action Zelda film</a>, it’s on one heck of a hot streak. Fortunately, it doesn’t seem like it wants to slow down at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-involved-in-multiple-movies-based-on-company-ip-in-development">Nintendo Involved in Multiple Movies Based on Company IP in Development</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Universal</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a sales report from Nintendo Japan</a>, the company talked about its success with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its plans for the future. One big part of its strategy is multimedia, with a big push for films. Nintendo states that it’s currently involved in multiple projects on its IP in various stages. No specifics were given as to what franchises those are, but they’ll be releasing after The Legend of Zelda in 2027.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Nintendo plans to be heavily involved in all of the films, from production to financing. Given how well the collaboration worked with Mario, having the creators on the team always leads to a better adaptation. It’ll be interesting to see what the future for Nintendo’s films will look like, whether it be in-house, like it teased with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75JEwjP_GD8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Close to You</a>, or licensed. Either way, we may see series like Metroid or Animal Crossing make it onto the silver screen soon.</p>



<p>What do you think about Nintendo’s push for IP-based films? Which Nintendo franchise do you want to see as a movie? Metroid? Animal Crossing? F-Zero? Star Fox?

<p>Nintendo's systems haven't always had the best third-party support, but the Switch 2 has got off to an incredibly strong start with developers and publishers you might not have even expected to see once upon a time now bringing major IP to this new hardware.</p>
<p>The firm has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/nintendo-highlights-strong-third-party-relationships-ahead-of-switch-2-reveal">acknowledged this strong support</a> once again in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial results briefing</a>, with Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa mentioning how the Switch 2 officially has the "largest third-party software lineup" ever for new Nintendo hardware.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Not only have we already seen multiple hit first-party titles, but we have also had many software publishers on board from the very beginning, resulting in the most extensive launch-year lineup out of any of our dedicated video game platforms."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although it's early days in the system's life, Furukawa further notes how software publishers have already released a "rich lineup of titles" catering to both "gamers and families". Attached to his comments is a graphic, highlighting the many third-party games that have been released and announced for the Switch 2 so far. This also includes some indie hits.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are games such as CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and some upcoming games Switch 2 players can look forward to next year include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza 3 Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> from SEGA, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> from Capcom, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> from Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>As we've already highlighted, Nintendo's first-party library for the Switch 2 has also got off to a strong start with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> shifting 9.57 million units, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has hit 3.49 million units. There's also plenty of other upcoming first-party titles to look forward to for the remainder of 2025 including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which is out this week, and then there's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> in November and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> in December.</p>

<p>The new hybrid system has now sold over 10 million units</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="22701cbb0c10d"><a title="Nintendo Switch Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/22701cbb0c10d/nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As we've now seen, Switch 2 sales have seemingly exceeded Nintendo's expectations, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">after shifting 10.36 million units</a> (as of 30th September 2025) and becoming the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware to date". This has also reportedly resulted in a slump in Switch sales, with Nintendo cutting back its forecast of the original hybrid system.</p>
<p>Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">has now revealed</a> how 84% of Nintendo Switch 2 players transitioned across from the original Switch systems. This was not only "early adopters" of the original Switch hardware, but also consumers who began playing the Switch at "various points of its lifecycle".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mzqvhp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Consumers who purchased Nintendo Switch between its launch in 2017 and the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 have been uniformly migrating to Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see in the slide below, 16% of Switch 2 players are completely "new players". Below this is a breakdown of Switch 2 owners and the time frame when they purchased the original Switch, according to Nintendo's internal data.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7e14691bdbb61"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e14691bdbb61/switch-2.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's original Switch system <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">has now sold more than 154 million units</a>, which shows there are still plenty of players out there who have not yet made the shift across to the Switch 2, but likely will at some stage during the new unit's lifecycle.</p>
<p>Furukawa also notes how this data illustrates how existing Switch players are "smoothly transitioning to the Nintendo Switch 2", and allowing Nintendo to maintain relationships with players "across platform generations". Admittedly, it should probably come as no surprise that many of Switch 2's early adopters are existing Switch players, but it's still interesting to see the exact percentage.</p>

              <p>It doesn’t matter if you get your workouts in running the road, climbing at a rock gym, or just lifting weights. Fitness buffs of all kinds have a good reason to use a fitness tracker. It can provide you with useful metrics, help establish healthy habits and keep you motivated to stay active.</p>
<p>Fitness trackers can vary a lot in price, but you can often find some of the good ones at steep discounts. Right now, Amazon happens to have the Fitbit Charge 6 on sale for 38% off: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/">band normally goes for $59, but the ongoing sale brings it down to an even $99</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Built-in GPS</h2>
<p>One of the most important features in a good fitness tracker, particularly for runners, is <strong>GPS</strong>. You can track mileage and pace right on your wrist instead of carrying your smartphone around, recording it there. The Fitbit Charge 6 is equipped <strong>with over 40 different exercise modes</strong> to take advantage of. Activities range from running to kayaking to cycling and more.</p>
<p>You can monitor your heart rate all throughout your day to get an idea of where you resting heart rate is at, then measure the intensity of your workouts based on how much it’s going up. Use this data to get a handle on your effort levels so you can adjust accordingly to meet your goals. Heart rate monitoring using the ECG app and sensor can also be used to detect irregular heart rhythm, which may be caused by atrial fibrillation (AFib). It can also provide<strong> insight regarding blood oxygen levels, skin temperature, and more</strong>.</p>



<p>You can even use your Fitbit Charge 6 for stress management purposes: The fitness tracker can breakdown for you a stress management score, calculated by analyzing your heart rate along with some other factors. The tracker can walk your through guided breathing sessions which can help build healthier habits in handling stress.</p>
<p>The fitness tracker isn’t just for when your active, but inactive too. The watch can measure how productive your sleep is each night in recharging you and allowing you to take on the day. The Fitbit Charge 6 assigns you a sleep score by tracking your light, deep, and REM sleep in unison with your sleeping heart rate, nailing down how consistent your night’s rest is. You can even set an alarm window for waking up, in which the tracker can vibrate to wake you up when you are in the optimal sleep stage for feeling refreshed when it’s time to get up in the morning.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/segway-offloads-its-safe-ninebot-electric-scooter-now-selling-for-the-price-of-a-basic-budget-model-2000641237</link>

              <p>The kids’ electric scooter market is blowing up with super cheap options from unknown brands that skimp on safety certifications and build quality. You see them everywhere online, they tempt you with super low prices but without the testing or engineering that prevents accidents.</p>
<p><strong>Segway Ninebot built a reputation on safe, reliable personal transportation</strong>&nbsp;and the <em>eKickScooter C2 Pro</em> brings that same commitment to kids aged 6 to 14. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5343/">has dropped the price from $279 down to $229, hitting an all-time low</a> for a scooter that parents can trust and kids will actually enjoy riding.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Safety Features to Give Parents Peace of Mind</h2>
<p>The kick-to-start system avoids the most common cause of kids’ scooter accidents: sudden, unexpected acceleration. The<strong> throttle doesn’t kick in until your child gets the scooter up to 3 mph</strong>, and removes the possibility of the motor engaging while they are still getting on or adjusting their position. This alone turns the scooter from a potentially very hazardous toy into something kids can safely control from the first ride.</p>
<p>The UL-2272 certification covers the battery system, charging components and electrical circuits, all ensuring that <strong>the scooter will not overheat, catch fire, or have electrical failures</strong> common in uncertified models. TUV Rheinland’s testing process includes drop tests, water resistance evaluation and sustained load testing that goes far beyond what discount brands bother with.</p>
<p>The scooter features<strong> three riding modes that let you match its performance to your child’s skill level</strong> and the riding environment. Safe Mode limits speed and acceleration for beginners still learning balance and control. Standard Mode opens up more speed while maintaining manageable acceleration curves. Sport Mode unleashes the full 12.4 mph top speed for experienced riders tackling longer distances or slight inclines. The <strong>150W motor delivers enough torque to handle hills</strong> that would stop weaker scooters, supporting up to 132-pound riders.</p>



<p>The adjustable handlebar extends to<strong> three different heights to fit kids</strong> from elementary school through middle school. After all, a 6-year-old and a 14-year-old have much different heights and arm lengths, and this scooter adjusts to fit both in and out of the box. Proper handlebar height is important for both control and safety-too low, and kids have to hunch over uncomfortably; too high, and steering precision suffers.</p>



<p>On one charge,<strong> it provides 9.3 miles of range</strong>&nbsp;which easily equates to several days of neighborhood rides or trips down to your friend’s house. Charging time is 4 hours, so if your kid plugs it in after getting home from school, then it’s ready to go for the next day’s adventures. Range will vary based on rider weight, terrain, and riding mode, but even conservative real-world use yields 7 to 8 miles, enough for most kids’ typical journeys.</p>
<p>The integrated Bluetooth speaker adds the dimension of entertainment that kids will be seriously appreciative of. Pair the scooter with a smartphone and ride while streaming music, with LED lights pulsating and changing colors in time with the beat. Voice assistant compatibility lets kids control music playback hands-free, keeping both hands on the handlebars where they belong.</p>
<p>At $229, you’re getting a scooter backed by Segway’s engineering expertise and actual safety certifications, not just marketing claims.</p>

                <p>There has been no shortage of unique games this year, but one of the strangest has definitely been Hotel Barcelona, the latest project from Suda51 and Swery, which puts a new spin on "grindhouse" horror. The 2.5D side-scrolling roguelike tasks players with surviving in a hotel full of serial killers inspired by '80s slasher flicks. It's a wild premise befitting the legacies of its creators, and fans who want to experience it for themselves can pick it up now on PC and console--including a $30 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FJYKWL9Z,B0FJYHWPPB&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">physical version</a> available for PS5 and Xbox Series X. However, there's also an upcoming $120 Collector's Edition launching on April 17, 2026 that's packed with tons of collectibles and other extras. Preorders for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FYD63MKC,B0FYD3QGRY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hotel Barcelona: Collector's Edition</a> are now live at Amazon. There's no preorder bonus, it's probably wise to secure your copy soon if you plan to add this one to your collection, as collector's editions tend to sell out quickly.</p><div title="6535842 -- Hotel Barcelona Collector's Edition" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4857" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535842 -- Hotel Barcelona Collector's Edition" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FYD63MKC,B0FYD3QGRY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FYD63MKC,B0FYD3QGRY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FYD63MKC,B0FYD3QGRY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Hotel Barcelona: Collector's Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FYD63MKC,B0FYD3QGRY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FYD63MKC,B0FYD3QGRY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FYD63MKC,B0FYD3QGRY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$120 | Releases April 17, 2026</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Hotel Barcelona: Collector's Edition comes with a physical edition of the game, as well as several physical extras, including a vintage-styled horror poster, a concept art book, and a "bloody ear" souvenir that is thankfully not real.

That's a common trend with games developed by Suda51 and Swery; however, their titles tend to become cult classics thanks to their memorable characters and unique spins on familiar gameplay genres. While critics have noted that Hotel Barcelona can be a frustrating roguelike, others have complimented it for its slasher-movie vibes, tight combat, and bizarre setting.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller On Sale For Lowest Price This Year</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-best-official-playstation-figures-plush-collectors-box/1100-6535705/">Adorable New Astro Bot Collectibles Are Waiting To Be Rescued By You</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The premium headphone market overflows with active noise cancellation options from Sony, Apple, Sennheiser, and countless others, but <strong>Bose is still the brand that essentially invented consumer ANC</strong> and continues to push the technology forward. The <em>QuietComfort Ultra</em> is the top of the line from Bose and marries its most advanced noise cancellation with class-leading spatial audio capabilities that few competitors can match. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/">has dropped the price from $429 down to $329, the all-time low for Bose’s best headphones</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Modes That Adapt to Your Environment</h2>
<p>Bose QuietComfort Ultra has three different listening modes that redefine the way you interact with the world around you: <strong>Quiet Mode</strong> with full noise cancellation, puts you in a personal bubble of quiet that rejects airplane engines, traffic noise and chatty coworkers. All of this occurs via a series of outward-facing microphones that detect ambient noise and inward-facing processing that generates inverse sound waves to nullify noise. <strong>Aware Mode</strong> turns the tables, piping environmental sound back in through the headphones so you can hear announcements, conversations, or oncoming traffic without ever having to take your headphones off. <strong>Immersion Mode</strong> melds maximum noise cancelation with Bose Immersive Audio-their spatial audio technology that envelops your head with three-dimensional space.</p>
<p><em>CustomTune</em> technology tailors the sound profile to your ears: When you first don the headphones, they play a brief tone and measure how sound reflects off of your unique ear shape. It then <strong>adjusts frequency response to compensate for how your ears naturally emphasize</strong> or diminish certain frequencies. Two people listening to the same headphones will hear slightly different tuning optimized for their individual anatomy, ensuring that you get the most accurate sound reproduction possible.</p>



<p>The microphone system stands out for good reason: in practice, it really does deliver clear phone calls. It’s<strong> powered by six microphones that collaborate to lock in your voice and filter out background noise</strong>, wind and more. You can take calls from a busy street or a windy park and the person on the other end hears you clearly without competing noise.</p>



<p>Comfort is essential when you are wearing headphones for hours on end: The <strong>ear cushions employ soft, conforming foam</strong> that doesn’t develop pressure points, and the headband evenly distributes weight around your head. Materials feel high-quality with a refined finish; professional enough to use in work settings. The<strong> 254-gram weight puts these headphones right in the middle of premium over-ear headphones</strong>, light enough to comfortably wear but substantial enough to feel well-built.</p>
<p>With noise cancellation on, you can get up to <strong>24 hours of battery life</strong> which means multiple days of use between charges. Toggling on Immersion Mode with spatial audio reduces that to 18 hours, still likely more than enough for a week’s listenings for most people. A 15-minute charge gets you 2.5 hours of playback, which is enough to top off at lunchtime and make it through the afternoon.</p>
<p>For $329, you’ll get tech worth upwards of $400, backed by decades of expertise from Bose itself.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-backs-this-anker-macbook-pro-charger-and-its-5-times-cheaper-on-amazon-than-its-official-site-2000641232</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-backs-this-anker-macbook-pro-charger-and-it%E2%80%99s-5-times-cheaper-on-amazon-than-its-official-site.1343950/</guid>

              <p>Buying a charger directly from Apple is like paying a luxury price for basic functionality. A 70W USB-C power adapter from Apple’s official store costs $59 and if you want a USB-C cable to go along with it, you’re adding another $19 to $29 depending on the length. That’s close to $90 before tax for slower charging speeds than what this Anker charger delivers.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5341/">Anker option packs 100W of power and includes a 5-foot cable, all for just $21 during this limited-time deal</a>, down from the usual $27. This isn’t some sketchy third-party accessory either: it’s from Anker, a brand that’s become synonymous with reliable charging gear and officially available in Apple Stores too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5341/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Matches Your MacBook’s Appetite</h2>
<p>The 100W output on this charger means you’re getting enough juice to fast-charge even the most power-hungry MacBooks. Apple’s 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max chip reaches 100% battery in just 1 hour and 20 minutes with this charger and matches the performance of Apple’s 140W charger in most charging scenarios. The difference comes down to the power delivery protocols: both chargers support USB Power Delivery 3.0, which intelligently negotiates the right amount of power for your device.</p>
<p>When you plug in a device, Anker’s PowerIQ 3.0 technology automatically detects what that is and adjusts the power output accordingly. Plug in your iPhone, and it will pass on the appropriate 20W for fast charging. Swap for a Samsung Galaxy S25 and it will push full power the phone can handle. Connect a Dell XPS or HP Spectre laptop, and it will negotiate the optimal charging speed. That makes this single charger compatible with a wide array of devices, replacing multiple other chargers and helping to cut down on the cable mess in your bag. It<strong> comes with a 5-foot USB-C-to-USB-C cable which supports a full 100W power transfer</strong>, meaning you do not need to buy a separate high-wattage-compatible cable.</p>



<p>Standard chargers jut out awkwardly in bags and catch on clothes and scratching other items. This Anker charger folds flat, creating a smooth profile that slides easily into laptop sleeves or even jacket pockets. The compact size measures roughly 2.5 inches on each side and about an inch thick, <strong>taking up less space than Apple’s 96W brick and significantly smaller than their 140W charger</strong>.</p>



<p>ActiveShield technology runs 24/7 and <strong>performs more than 3 million temperature checks daily</strong> on the charger. The moment it starts running hot from extended use or environmental elements, it automatically adjusts power output to cool things down. That prevents overheating damage to both the charger and your devices, with a considerable extension of their life span. The system is completed by protection against overcharging, short circuits, and power surges for increased peace of mind when leaving devices plugged in overnight or during long work sessions.</p>
<p>Apple wants $59 for a slower 70W charger that doesn’t include any cable. Their 96W charger will set you back $79 without cable as well. This Anker setup gives you more power than either one, throws in a quality cable, and costs $21. You could get backups for home and office at this price and still come out spending less than one Apple charger.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-thinkpad-with-ryzen-7-chip-priced-like-a-mid-range-laptop-and-it%E2%80%99s-not-a-refurb.1343941/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ThinkPad has been the go-to business laptop for decades and for good reason: from CEOs to engineers, pros swear by them. You need a machine that can handle back-to-back video calls, crunch spreadsheets without lag, run multiple applications at once and still have juice for the commute home. The <strong>Lenovo ThinkPad E16 G2</strong> delivers all of that and more and packs premium specs into a proven design.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5340/">has dropped the price from $1,299 down to just $899, which marks an all-time low for this powerhouse laptop</a>. This isn’t some refurbished unit or stripped-down configuration: you’re getting a brand-new machine <strong>with 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a Ryzen 7 processor</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5340/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Business-Grade Performance</h2>
<p>At the heart of this laptop is an <strong>AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS processor which boasts 8 cores and 16 threads</strong> to tackle your everyday tasks with much ease. With a base clock of 3.2GHz that boosts up to 4.75GHz when needed, this chip doesn’t break a sweat with demanding workloads. Run AutoCAD while streaming a training video and responding to Slack messages? No problem. The processor includes 4MB of L2 cache and 16MB of L3 cache which means frequently accessed data stays close to the CPU for faster retrieval.</p>
<p>The 32GB of DDR5 RAM gives you enough headroom to keep dozens of browser tabs open, work across multiple documents and run virtual machines if your job requires it. <strong>DDR5 is the latest memory standard</strong>&nbsp;and offers faster data transfer rates than DDR4 and better power efficiency. Match this with a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, and you have storage that’s fast enough to <strong>boot Windows 11 Pro in seconds</strong> and load large files almost instantly. The terabyte lets you store years of documents, presentations, and project files at your fingertips without being forced to resort to external drives or constant cloud uploads.</p>



<p>The <strong>16-inch display uses a WUXGA resolution of 1920×1200</strong>, which, in turn, provides more vertical space than the standard Full HD screens. The extra height you get when reviewing a long document or working with spreadsheets amounts to fewer scrolls, which in turn means better productivity. The IPS panel displays consistent colors from a variety of viewing angles, while the 300 nits of brightness make it possible to work well even in bright office environments or near windows. Integrated AMD Radeon 680M graphics handle everyday visual tasks and can even manage light gaming or basic video editing if you need a break.</p>



<p>Security features run deep on this ThinkPad: The fingerprint reader built into the power button uses biometric authentication for quick login while keeping unauthorized users out. The TPM 2.0 chip encrypts sensitive data and prevents the system from booting if anyone tampers with the hardware. A physical privacy shutter covers the 1080p webcam when you’re not using it, eliminating concerns about unauthorized viewing.</p>
<p>Connectivity covers all the bases with a <strong>mix of USB-A and USB-C ports supporting up to 10Gbps</strong>. Two USB-C ports support Power Delivery 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.4, so you can charge the laptop and connect an external monitor via the same port. The HDMI 2.1 port supports 4K display at 60Hz, perfect for presentations or doing a dual-monitor setup at your desk.</p>
<p>At $899 for early Black Friday, you’re getting a laptop that would normally cost over $1,200.</p>

              <p>You don’t have to stick to basic, boring white bulbs anymore and you definitely don’t need to change the entire wiring in your home to add smarter lighting. <em>Govee</em> makes the upgrade easy with its wide range of smart bulbs, and we just spotted a solid pair going for less on Amazon.</p>
<p>Currently, you can grab a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/">2 pack of Govee LED Smart Light Bulbs for just $19, which is a little over $9 per bulb</a>. The only thing to note is that this deal is currently <strong>exclusive to Prime members</strong>. If you already have Prime, you’re good to go. If not, you might want to consider signing up, especially with the holiday season coming up.</p>
<p>Amazon usually rolls out some of its biggest discounts for Prime users during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The retailer also offers a 7-day free trial, which gives you access to the deal (and free shipping) without any immediate commitment. After the trial, it’s going to run you around $15 a month, but you’re likely going to make that money back quickly through exclusive discounts and free shipping if you order often!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>For less than $20, you’re getting a pair of smart light bulbs that are easy to install and can be controlled remotely via Govee Home App or smart assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. Each bulb offers a <strong>brightness of up to 1000 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which is equivalent to a traditional 75W bulb. You can adjust the brightness from 1 to 100%, plus choose from over 16 million colors. These are also tunable between warm white and cool daylight (2700K to 6500K), so you can shift the vibe of your space from focused to relaxed within seconds.</p>



<p>The Govee Home app gives you access to up to 54 scene modes for your Wi-Fi light bulbs, and you can even create a fun lighting schedule for your day. Maybe go for a brighter setting during the day, and slowly wind down with a cozy, warm light; the options are endless.</p>
<p>There’s also a music sync feature that lets the bulbs change colors based on sound detected by your phone’s microphone. Just keep in mind that you’ll need a stable 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection to get started, and these are not compatible with smart switches.</p>
<p>Want more bulbs? The 4-pack and 8-pack bundles are also on sale for $39 and $79.</p>

                <p>There are a lot of questions about the future of Xbox as a brand, when games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a> and even its signature shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-700149">Halo</a>, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">coming to PlayStation 5</a>. Microsoft is reportedly working on the next generation of Xbox, but the outlook doesn't look promising. However, Xbox's perceived decline doesn't mean that consoles are dead, according a prominent video game analyst.</p><p>Rhys Elliott's <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/octobers-top-playstation-games-by" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Alinea Insight newsletter</a> has shared the estimated sales for PlayStation 5 games in October 2025, and the two big winners were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>, with 3.2 million, 3 million, and 2.7 million in sales, respectively. The trio's nearly combined 9 million in sales led Elliott to remark, "AAA games, live services, and single-player alike, are still thriving on console. The 'CoNsOlE iS DeAd' narrative is getting annoying. Xbox as a console is dying, yes. But let's not extrapolate that too far, eh?"</p><p>Publishing Xbox games on PlayStation 5 has already paid dividends for Microsoft. Several of Microsoft's formerly exclusive titles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6827">dominated the PlayStation sales charts</a> earlier this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> both placed in the top 10, at fourth and seventh, respectively. That's thanks in part to a continuous flow of new content via Minecraft expansions and GTA Online. Additionally, EA Sports took three of the top 10 slots between FC 26, FC 25, and Madden NFL 26. Take-Two's NBA 2K26 took the fifth slot with 564,000 copies sold for the month.</p><p>Alinea Insight's top 10 best-selling PS5 games for October 2025 and their estimated sales are reproduced below.</p><ol><li>Battlefield 6 - 3.2 million</li><li>EA Sports FC 26 - 3.0 million</li><li>Ghost of Yotei - 2.7 million</li><li>Minecraft - 635,000</li><li>NBA 2K26 - 564,000</li><li>EA FC 25 - 350,000</li><li>Grand Theft Auto 5 - 338,000</li><li>EA Madden NFL 26 - 261,000</li><li>Little Nightmares 3 - 245,000</li><li>Digimon Story: Time Stranger - 241,000</li></ol>

              <p>Sure, you can use your trackpad or a basic office mouse to get through most of your day, but if you’re looking for solid speeds and better accuracy, a responsive mouse can make a lot of difference. And thankfully, you don’t need to spend a fortune to upgrade.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4265/">Logitech G305 Lightspeed wireless gaming mouse on sale for $29, which is 40% off its regular $49 price</a>. The deal applies to all color options, including black, blue, lilac, mint, and white. The retailer hasn’t specified when the deal will end, but it likely won’t stick around for long. If you’ve had your eye on it, now’s a good time to grab one before the price shoots back up or the stock expires!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4265/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Responsiveness for Fast-Paced Games</h2>
<p>There’s nothing too flashy about the design, which is a good thing. Having multiple options to choose from means you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best. Prefer a clean, basic look? Go for the black one. Want to add a pop of color to your gaming setup? Lilac should look stunning! It’s also quite lightweight, so you won’t feel like you’re dragging a brick across.</p>

A lag-free gaming experience is made possible with the Lightspeed wireless technology, which delivers a 1ms report rate. Expect ultra-fast responsiveness that helps you react quickly in fast-paced games where every second counts. The Hero mouse sensor offers tracking speeds up to 400 IPS and sensitivity up to 12,000 DPI, meaning this thing can keep up with tasks that need extra precision or fast flicks.</p>
<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 250 hours of continuous use on a single AA battery. There are programmable buttons on the mouse, and customization can be done either directly through those buttons or via on-screen software using Logitech’s G Hub. Tweak settings according to what you’re going to use the mouse for!</p>
<p>It works well with a range of devices, and there are no complicated setup procedures to take care of. All-in-all, this deal offers an easy way to upgrade your gaming or creative setup without paying the full $50 for this ultra-fast mouse. The discount applies to all the color options, and you can customize the settings according to what you prefer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-clears-out-its-color-floor-lamp-now-cheaper-than-a-budget-lamp-on-amazon-2000641217</link>

              <p>There’s just something magical about how the right lighting can completely turn a room around – turn a cold corner into a cozy reading nook or make your living space seem like it’s pulled from a design magazine. Good lighting doesn’t just brighten things up: it sets the mood, creates atmosphere and, honestly, just makes you want to spend more time in your own home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">Usually $99, Amazon has slashed the price of the Govee RGBIC floor lamp to just $69</a>, which happens to be an all-time low for this <strong>#1 bestselling floor lamp</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Make Your Home Smarter</h2>
<p>The Govee floor lamp packs some seriously impressive tech into its sleek black design: W<strong>ith 1000 lumens of brightness</strong>, this lamp delivers enough light to properly illuminate a bedroom or living room without needing multiple fixtures. That’s <strong>roughly equivalent to a 75-watt incandescent bulb</strong> but with infinitely more flexibility. The RGBIC technology is where things get interesting: unlike basic RGB lamps that display one color at a time, <strong>RGBIC allows multiple colors to appear simultaneously across different sections of the lamp</strong>.</p>
<p>The lamp is integrated perfectly with Alexa for complete voice control. Forgot to turn off the lamp while getting into bed? Just ask Alexa to do that. Want to dim the lights for movie night without getting up from the couch? Voice commands, of course! The Govee Home app <strong>gives you access to more than 16 million color combinations</strong> which sounds kind of excessive until you realize just how regularly you’ll actually adjust the settings to suit different occasions. Dinner party? Warm amber tones.</p>



<p>Another feature that makes this more than just a simple lamp is the music sync: It <strong>pulses in real time to whatever you’re listening to</strong>, changing colors to go with the beat. Throw on some upbeat music, and it’s an instant dance party. This works via the app’s microphone detection, so nothing too complicated in terms of setup-just turn on music sync mode and let it do its thing. It’s great for entertaining small groups or just adding an element of fun to your solo dance sessions.</p>
<p>Attention should also be turned to the design itself: This is a<strong> corner lamp which means it’s specifically shaped to tuck into those awkward spaces</strong> that most furniture can’t fill properly. The tall and slender profile takes up very little floor space while maximizing vertical lighting coverage. <strong>About 62 inches tall</strong>, it reaches high enough to cast light across an entire room rather than just illuminating a small radius around its base.</p>



<p>Setup takes minutes, not hours: Plug it in, download the Govee Home app, connect it to your WiFi and you’re ready to start customizing. The app contains dozens of <strong>preset scenes</strong> designed by Govee’s team—things like “Ocean,” “Sunset,” and “Aurora”—so you don’t have to spend time creating custom scenes if you’d rather just pick something that works. But if you do want to get creative,<strong> DIY mode lets you tap into specific colors</strong> for different segments of the lamp and save your creations for later use.</p>
<p>At $69, you’re getting smart home integration, music reactivity, millions of color options, and enough brightness to actually function as primary lighting – all for $30 less than usual.</p>

Joining the Dungeon Dudes' team on this project is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> designer, Mike Underwood. This is to ensure this adaptation is built from the ground up to retain the excitement and intensity of the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-of-drakkenheim-now-available-on-dd-beyond" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em></a> experience. Said experience is a sandbox-style campaign designed for characters at levels 1-10.</p>

<p>For enterprising GMs, the <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> campaign will include official mechanics for the game's contaminations, mutations, and anomalies. This is because the titular Drakkenheim setting is a wasteland ravaged by an eldritch storm of otherworldly magic. These can be used as intended in this campaign, or can be adapted into your own home game of <em>Daggerheart</em>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>One of these mechanics is the new Contaminated Domain cards. As your characters' contamination rises, they lose equal levels of Hope, a vital resource in <em>Daggerheart</em>. The trade-off is access to new card abilities, which you must give the GM Fear to use. Fear a GM can use to make the next challenge more harrowing.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Digital for $30:</strong> A PDF of the campaign guide, character sheets, and a set of miniature STLs</li>
	<li><strong>Core Book for $60:</strong> Everything in the Digital tier, a physical campaign book, a poster set, and a set of resin miniatures</li>
	<li><strong>Digital Deluxe for $70:</strong> Everything from the Digital tier, digital card deck, digital GM cheat sheets, and VTT access on Demiplane and Roll20</li>
	<li><strong>Core Set for $170:</strong> Everything from the Core Book and Digital Deluxe tier, a physical GM Screen, a set of resin dice, a card deck, and an STL file for a Fear Tracker</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Set for $295:</strong> Everything from the Core Set tier, a physical Special Edition campaign book, a premium dice tray, and a unique set of gemstone dice</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim: Daggerheart</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$123,612, more than six times its initial funding goal. The campaign ends on November 28..</span></span></p>

As part of an update that’s currently on the Steam Deck’s Beta and Preview channels, the handheld can “complete all active downloads in a new display-off low-power mode before going to sleep,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1675200%2Fview%2F771930569635267984" rel="sponsored">Valve says</a>.</p><p>I’m glad this change is in the works; I download a lot of games and updates on my Steam Deck and I have often wished that I didn’t have to leave the display on while doing so. <em>The Verge</em> asked Valve about this two years ago when the Steam Deck OLED launched, and the company seemed to think Deck was good enough without it.</p><p>“We burn a substantial amount of power when you’re downloading,” hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said at the time, suggesting to us that players might not want to accidentally leave a hot Steam Deck in their bag if they mistakenly think it’s asleep. Valve’s solution announced today seems to solve some of those concerns.</p><p>With the update installed, when you press the power button while your Deck is downloading something, you’ll see a new dialog that asks if you want to keep downloading but have the screen off. If you choose Continue, your Deck will enter the low-power mode. “While in this mode, if you press a button or move Steam Deck, a new status screen will be shown with download progress,” Valve says. “From here you can fully wake Steam Deck or let it continue downloading with the screen off.”</p><p>The feature is on by default when your Steam Deck is plugged in. You can also choose to enable it while running on battery in settings, though if your Steam Deck falls below 20 percent battery, your device will go into full sleep mode.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/813864/valve-steam-deck-screen-download-games-low-power-screen-off]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Star Wars fans, it’s a great time to bring some important pieces of the galaxy far, far away into your own space. LEGO introduced its 25th Anniversary Star Wars collection to celebrate some of the most iconic ships in the saga, and if you’ve ever wanted your very own Millennium Falcon model, now is a great time to grab one at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>Amazon has dropped the price <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">of LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon to $67, which is 20% off its regular $84 price</a>. It’s part of the brand’s special anniversary lineup, and the level of detail here is impressive. Such exclusive sets don’t really stay on sale for long, so it’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Your Own Starship Collection</h2>
<p>This collectible build-and-display model lets you build a mid-scale brick recreation of one of the most iconic ships, and comes with 921 pieces in total. It hits that sweet spot; not too massive, but not so simple that you’re done before you’ve even settled in. LEGO packs it with details like the cockpit, satellite dish, and dual cannons. Even better, there’s a buildable stand to place the ship on. It includes a nameplate and a special 25th Anniversary LEGO Star Wars brick. You can even position the Falcon at a dynamic angle for a more realistic, mid-flight look.</p>



<p>The set also fits nicely into the Starship collection by LEGO, so you can always add more ships down the line if you’re planning to build out a full display. Putting it together won’t be too complicated, as it comes with a handy instruction book that takes you step by step through the entire build. The instruction book is quite detailed on its own, but if you need extra help, you can also use the LEGO Builder app.</p>
<p>Once completed, the Millennium Falcon measures just over 5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide. Place it on your bookshelf or your desk – it’s sure to impress anyone who sees it.</p>
<p>Just note that there’s no telling how long the discount will last, so it’s best to get your orders in soon.</p>
