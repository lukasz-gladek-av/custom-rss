With nothing but your wits, limited resources, and the tools at your disposal, you must carve out an existence in one of the most hostile environments imaginable.</p><p>For the first time, the <em>Surviving Mars</em> universe has been brought to virtual reality, delivering a fully immersive survival experience where every decision matters. Establish an autonomous mining operation, carefully managing oxygen, nutrition, and power to keep yourself alive. Construct and expand your base with hands-on building mechanics, optimizing power grids and resource extraction to stay one step ahead of disaster. Before venturing into the unknown, ensure you’re in optimal condition—every decision must be carefully weighed, as survival depends on preparation as much as action. Take on contracts to mine, refine, and export valuable resources, unlocking advanced blueprints, vehicles, and technology that could mean the difference between thriving and barely scraping by. Shape your survival strategy through smart economic decisions, investing in the tools and infrastructure needed to secure your foothold on the planet.</p><p>Beyond your outpost, an entire planet awaits. Strap on your jetpack and traverse towering cliffs, navigate treacherous dust storms, and uncover the hidden mysteries buried beneath the Martian soil. Every choice shapes your survival—because out here, there are no second chances.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

		<p>Hitman: World of Assassination is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> on 27th March, IO Interactive has confirmed, bringing a freshly enhanced VR version of the hit assassination trilogy to Sony’s latest headset. You can see snippets from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hitman-2">Hitman 2</a> level, The Finish Line, played in VR in the latest trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="HITMAN World of Assassination - PS VR2 - VR Games Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPfdRYXgjNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PSVR 2 version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/03/hitman-3-will-become-world-of-assassination-with-free-upgrade-to-include-hitman-1-2/">Hitman World of Assassination</a> will feature all 22 locations featured through the Hitman trilogy, adding new VR-specific mechanics, designed around the headset and its independent Sense controllers. That grants you dual-wielding, full ambidexterity, and room-scale play, as well as generally improved controls and gameplay mechanics, when compared to the original PSVR release. New interactions mean that you’ll have active reloading, on-body weapon holstering, sniper scope aiming, and manual motions to take on disguises. You even see how you can throw two items at the same time to knock out guards.</p>
<p>Pricing for this release has also now been confirmed. Players who own Hitman: World of Assassination on PS5 can get a VR Access upgrade for $9.99 / €9.99 / £8.99. Alternatively, newcomers to the game can buy Hitman WOA Part One – VR2 Edition, which includes the Hitman 1 campaign and locations with PSVR 2 support for $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99. You can then upgrade to the full version with Hitman 2 and Hitman 3 levels… I’m assuming. The number of variants and options for Hitman are needlessly confusing on the PS Store, I’ll be honest. The whole rebrand to World of Assassination was meant to fix that, but then IOI created new sub-bundles and versions along the way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/moon-studios-is-now-self-publishing-no-rest-for-the-wicked-after-split-with-take-two/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Moon Studios has secured the publishing rights <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a>, their action RPG which is currently in Steam Early Access, cutting ties with Take-Two following the closure of original publishing label Private Division.</p>
<p>Characterising the change as making them “fully independent”, the studio states “We have secured the publishing rights for No Rest for the Wicked, allowing us to execute our vision without restrictions.”</p>
<p><iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked - Official Game Overview of The Breach | Wicked Inside Showcase 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzAtYaSYZms?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Further to this, the team revealed the next big update for the game, The Breach, which will arrive on 30th April, confirmed that co-op is coming after that, and that Ori series composer Gareth Coker is returning to contribute new music to the game.</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is the first game from Moon Studios after their fruitful partnership with Microsoft for Ori and the Blind Forest and its sequel. The studio signed on with Take-Two’s indie-oriented publishing label Private Division, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/no-rest-for-the-wicked-is-the-next-game-from-ori-developer-moon-studios/">announcing</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">releasing the game into Early Access</a> in early 2024.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/take-two-sells-private-division-label-to-a-secret-new-owner/">Take-Two decided to sell off Private Division</a> late last year, confirming the closure of multiple studios in the process, but with the sole exception to the sale being that they would retain publishing of No Rest for the Wicked. An odd situation, and while we’re obviously not privy to the behind-the-scenes negotiations since then, it’s clear that Moon Studios felt that they and their game would be best served by self-publishing.</p>
<p>To mark the shift to self-publishing, the studio has launched a 30% off independence sale. This is leading through to The Breach next month, which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Story &amp; Areas</strong> – Players will continue their journey, exploring <em>Lowland Meadows</em> and <em>Marin Woods</em>, encountering fresh threats like the Harvesters and the Balak Taw.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Combat &amp; Builds</strong> – New weapon archetypes (Gauntlets &amp; Wands), new enemies, and an updated loot system for more build variety.</li>
<li><strong>Replayability Enhancements</strong> – Dynamic world changes with the ‘Alive’ System, where factions and enemies dynamically reshape the game worldt<br>
The Plague System unleashes powerful new plagued enemies and bosses. Pestilence outbreaks now occur all over Sacra, and the player can cleanse these regions to gain potent new plagued resources.</li>
<li><strong>Revamped Systems</strong> – Ability to teleport directly to their house, Improved item stacking, new fast travel options, refined enchantments, and major quality-of-life improvements, including improvements to timers and an entirely overhauled storage system.</li>
<li><strong>Hardcore Mode</strong> – A new option for the most dedicated players.</li>
<li><strong>Visual &amp; Performance Upgrades</strong> – Enhanced lighting, improved DLSS implementation, and optimizations for smoother gameplay.</li>
</ul>
<p>We looked at the game with its early access release, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">our preview</a>, “No Rest For The Wicked is a beautiful dark fantasy epic, and here at the outset of it’s journey through Early Access there’s very few reasons for you not to experience its dangerous charms.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wanderstop Review - More than Managing Tea]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/wanderstop-review-more-than-managing-tea</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wanderstop-review-more-than-managing-tea.1131450/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/wanderstop-review-more-than-managing-tea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wanderstop</em> is the first title from Ivy Road, a studio formed by industry vets in 2021. Trailers showcased the title as a tea shop manager, but it’s so much more, and less, than that. Presenting a complex story and taking care of customers’ tea orders is only the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Serving Up Tea in <em>Wanderstop</em></h2>

<p>You play as Alta, a fighter known for being the best. After having her win streak of three years broken, she enters the woods to find the one person who can train her back to perfection. Weakened from consistent running, you pass out and awaken in a clearing.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-boro-dialogue.jpg?itok=snXRUB4e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-boro-dialogue.jpg?itok=45d_NI06 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is where the 10-15 hours of gameplay begins. You start by exploring the clearing and the tea shop known as Wanderstop. Managed by Boro, you’re stuck helping him make tea until you’re able to lift your sword and leave the woods. I found that having your own cup to savor at this moment can really heighten the experience. I chose a nice herbal blend to sip while serving my first customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tea making process involves multiple steps, but once you have it down, it’s fairly easy. You grow specific fruits to gather, collect and dry tea leaves, then brew the drink inside the shop. All ingredients needed are found in the clearing, and there are no time limits on how long someone will wait for their beverage. If you make it incorrectly, they’ll even let you try again with no penalty to their dialogue.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-ren-tea-order.jpg?itok=uCUfjaJt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-ren-tea-order.jpg?itok=WkvQtENr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>My biggest issue with <em>Wanderstop</em> is the missing challenge. Aside from a handful of specific client asks, most of the tea making you do is extremely straightforward. From growing the plants, finding the correct ingredients, and making the tea, it’s quite lacking in variety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most challenging part is playing the title with a mouse and keyboard, then trying to quickly select one of the items from your inventory. It’s not super difficult, but getting what item you want and where you want it can take some finesse. A controller is far superior when it comes to inventory scrolling and using the shears.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-large-hybrid.jpg?itok=K6Ks9HPi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-large-hybrid.jpg?itok=ibKsNxy_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While tea creation may have been the premise that drew people in, it’s not the main focus of the title. What <em>Wanderstop</em> lacks in management complexity, it gains in narrative focus. The story is the highlight of the title, evoking emotions I wasn't prepared to experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without delving too much into the story and ruining all the surprises, you go through Alta’s history and attempt to discover how to fix her current situation. It does pull at the heartstrings and could make you ponder your own views as you work through the different stages of the game. The characters are endearing, many of them with distinct personalities and conversational mannerisms.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-extradimensional-character.jpg?itok=BhK_0iWr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-extradimensional-character.jpg?itok=jBpKkxmX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you progress, you’re confronted with moments that alter what the clearing looks like. These changes bring new color schemes, new plants, and new customers. It also ends prior interactions with customers, cutting some side stories preemptively. This is irksome, but you do get chances to learn more about those characters as the game progresses.</p>

<h2><em>Wanderstop </em>Review <em>|&nbsp;</em>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Wanderstop</em> is less a tea shop management game and more a visual novel guiding players through a difficult, emotional narrative. It can be a tear-jerking experience, especially towards the end of the game. However, once played, I doubt I’ll personally dive back into the world now that I know the full story. It’s perfect for those wanting less of a commitment, with short windows of game time, or who need breaks between storytelling moments.&nbsp;<br>

It's not even been two months since the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ender-magnolia">Ender Magnolia: Bloom In The Mist</a>, and co-developers Adglobe and Live Wire are already back with a pretty solid update. The major addition is a New Game+ mode, which allows you to start the "evil-purging adventure anew, this time armed with gear and relics from previous playthroughs”, and face “harrowing hordes of smarter, stronger enemies with new attack patterns." 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you've never even heard of the game before, here's a quick rundown: Ender Magnolia sees you playing as Lilac, an "Attuner" whose goal is to save the Homunculi. Working with them, you search for your lost memories, as you accrue a whole bunch of different unique abilities that you can net from turning bosses into your allies. It's cool stuff! And looked well worth jumping into even before this latest update.</p>

<p>
New Game+ aside, Ender Magnolia: Bloom In The Mist's 1.1.0 update adds the ability to rechallenge bosses you've already taken down, with the press release explaining that "allies become enemies once again as Lilac gains the ability to revisit momentous battles of the past." You can replay these battles at rest points to gain additional Fragments for unlocking collectibles.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new Boss Rush mode, for people who enjoy those battles but can't be bothered with all the intervening metroidvania, with time-based completion bonuses for speedrunners. The update is available right now.

But will that be enough to save her?</p><p>Sophie is trapped. A blind girl lost in the depths of a decaying mansion, she has only one lifeline—her teddy bear. In <em>Out of Sight VR</em>, you don’t just control Sophie; you see through Teddy’s eyes, guiding her through a world of shifting shadows, unseen threats, and long-buried secrets.</p><p>This groundbreaking second-person virtual reality experience challenges everything you know about immersion, flipping the traditional first-person perspective on its head. As Teddy, you are both within the world and separate from it, an ever-present protector who must navigate danger without directly controlling Sophie’s fate. Position yourself strategically, reveal hidden pathways, and ensure she avoids the sinister captors stalking her every move.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Every step unravels a deeper mystery. Perspective-shifting chase sequences blur the line between fear and urgency as Sophie is carried through the mansion, forced to flee from forces she cannot see. Dual-perspective puzzle-solving demands both careful planning and quick thinking, forcing you to place yourself in key locations to guide her to safety. And as you explore, remnants of the past whisper their warnings—traces of those who came before, their fates unknown.  </p><p>Drenched in atmosphere and rich with emotional depth, <em>Out of Sight VR</em> delivers a uniquely harrowing experience—one that goes beyond fear and into responsibility. Every choice you make as Teddy is an act of care, every successful escape a moment of relief. You are her eyes. You are her guardian. But is that enough to bring her to safety?</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Out of Sight VR -  Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDSPkAIvevA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Ricochet Blades will now do 100 damage to enable one-hit kills, and to compensate we are lowering the fire rate and projectile speed.

            <p>
I confess, I'm writing up the 1.0 release date for grubby open world game Vivat Slovakia less because I'm tantalised by the carboot sale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> aesthetic, than because the latest trailer ends with main character Trotter squatting weirdly on a coffee table. He perches there with track-suited elbows akimbo, smiling faintly. Mockingly.

<p>
Trotter aside, the table sustains various piles of money and a bottle of what could be Jack Daniels. The room containing Trotter and the table also contains two high-collared chairs, an expansive, dimpled sofa, and some well-fitted bookcases. There is a dog in one of the chairs, while the sofa is being used to prop up some guns. Sunlight streams through the conservatory windows behind, lending the whole scene the quality of an angelic visitation.
</p>
<p>
What to make of this? Why is Trotter squatting on a table? His amused rictus contains no answer. Nor is there any catharsis to be found on the Steam page, which characterises him as an undercover cop and taxi driver, making his way through a 10 km² city map based on post-Communist 1990s Slovakia. I feel the need to workshop this bizarre spectacle before I can say anything further about the game. There's nothing for it - I'm going to have to write a quick listicle.
</p>
<h3>Seven reasons Trotter is squatting on that coffee table</h3>
<p>
1. Trotter is squatting on the table simply to free up a chair for his dog. He is doing this because he loves his dog like a child, and considers it a crime against Very Good Boys to ask the beast to sleep on the floor. Still, that doesn't explain the other, apparently vacant chair and the sofa.
</p>
<p>
2. The dog is Trotter's landlord, who has cruelly forbidden Trotter from sitting on people furniture. What more dastardly an archnemesis for "a city that reflects the tumult of an era caught between communism and capitalism"? You can't quite see it in the video, but the dog is definitely smoking a cigar.
</p>
<p>
3. Trotter has just been standing on the coffee table to change a light bulb. We catch him at the precise moment of his triumph, settling back on his haunches in the blissful knowledge that he and his dog will be able to comfortably read all the books they please, when the sun goes down. Not for them the terrifying oblivion of Night.
</p>
<p>
4. Trotter fears you are plotting to take his money. Like a mother hen, he has flown screeching to the table and planted himself defensively atop his riches, ready to claw and peck your eyes out. In a few seconds he is going to seal the deal by urinating explosively.  
</p>
<p>
5. Trotter thinks the floor is lava.</p>
<p>
6. Tables are in danger of growing stale, and Trotter is taking them to strange new places. We are witnessing the birth of <em>tablepunk</em>. 
</p>
<p>
7. Due to a fluke mixture of personal deprivation and Walmart's hijacking of global timber supplies, this is literally the first time Trotter has ever encountered a coffee table, and the sheer audacity of the concept has scrambled his brain. He's absolutely tripping balls over here. His entire cognitive framework is rebooting before our eyes. His soul is molting like caterpillar.
</p>
<p>
It's been a long day, in case you couldn't tell, and I'm too exhausted by these intrigues to say anything further about Vivat Slovakia, which launches out of early access on 17th April. Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-no-longer-care-about-grand-theft-auto-6-for-i-have-the-open-world-of-vivat-slovakia">did a write-up last year</a> and was ambivalent, though he liked the radio stations.

<p>Blizzard has announced that Blizzcon 2025 won’t be happening. Instead, the event will make its return after a two-year hiatus in September 2026.</p>



<p>“We’ve come a long way since our first event in 2005,” Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24178650/blizzcon-returns-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in its statement</a>. “Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It’s important that we put on an event worthy of our community.”</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Future Of Call of Duty—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>That event will take place from September 12-13 in Anaheim, California. Blizzard says that plans for next year are already in motion with events like the opening ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, and hands-on gameplay.</p>



<p>Blizzard says that the goal is to create an “unforgettable experience” for everyone who takes part in it, and they are working to “meaningfully elevate” the convention.</p>



<p>“We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure,” they said.</p>



<p>Since 202, Blizzcon has only been held twice: an online-only version in 2021 and a return to an in-person event in 2023. Blizzcon 2024 was cancelled in April 2024, with no official reason given. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzcon-2024-canceled-by-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s statement</a> at the time said that the decision was “not made lightly” and they planned on bringing it back in the future.</p>



<p>What do you think of Blizzcon 2025 not happening and having to wait another year for the events return in 2026?

<p>ZA/UM Studio, the developers behind Disco Elysium, have announced their new game. Currently known as Project C4, this new game is an RPG that features a “mind-warping story of espionage and team-building in an original yet achingly familiar setting.”</p>



<p>A press release announcing the new game gives players more details on what to expect:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The world of [C4] is rife with shadowy characters who help move the pieces for competing geopolitical powers in a game of concealed conflict. The player sets out to complete a desperate assignment which will put them at risk of losing their life, or much worse – being exposed for what they really are.</p>



<p>As an Operant serving a questionable global power, the player finds themselves locked in a vicious, clandestine struggle for truth and influence. Yet it is the mind that takes centre stage in Project [C4]. More vulnerable and more powerful than the physical world, it can be erased, changed, reordered, and of course significantly altered through regular use of psychoactive substances amongst other means. Players must steel themselves with whatever comfort they can in order to survive the violent canvas of the real.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You can check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9apwrMKi8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">short teaser trailer</a> for yourself below. More information on the game will be revealed at a later date.</p>

"During the pandemic, I was casting for DS2," Kojima said. "Neil would be an important role that replaces Cliff from DS1. The fans would not be satisfied unless the casting would surpass Mads."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima first learned of Marinelli through his role in the Italian film They Call Me Jeeg, and a correspondence sprung up around the Japanese distribution of the film Martin Eden.

Back in 2020, Kojima talked about how Marinelli had caught his attention, adding: "I think if he donned a bandanna, he'd be a spitting image of Solid Snake!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's unlikely Neil is some multiversal Snake, the imagery certainly brings to mind Kojima's legacy with the Metal Gear franchise.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-t-1000-packs-3-terminator-2-references-into-one-fatality<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1 developer NetherRealm has revealed a detailed look at T-1000 gameplay, and a look at a new Fatality packed with references to Terminator 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the video, below, we see the T-1000 use various liquid metal abilities to move about the screen, absorb hits, and poke at his enemies. Even shapeshifting sorcerer Shang Tsung praises the T-1000’s abilities during one pre-match trash talk cutscene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The highlight of the video is the look at one of the T-1000’s Fatalities, which includes three references to Terminator 2. The first is the iconic finger point through the eyeball, the second the arm blade through the mouth, then the elevator door parting, except through the T-1000’s foe’s torso. Its animality sees the T-1000 transform into a K-9 German Shepherd, another reference to Terminator 2. In the film, John Connor's foster parents owned a German Shepherd named Max. The Terminator calls the dog Wolfie to trick the T-1000.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The T-1000 in Mortal Kombat 1 is of course based on the liquid metal-based cybernetic assassin from the 1991 blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgment Day film, and features the voice and likeness of actor Robert Patrick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on the T-1000 from NetherRealm: </p><blockquote>Battling for the supremacy of machines, the T-1000 is a state-of-the-art infiltration Terminator designed by artificial general superintelligence system Skynet. Comprised of mimetic polyalloy (a.k.a. liquid metal), the virtually indestructible advanced prototype can shapeshift into objects or people it comes in contact with, mimicking their appearance, behavior, and voice, making it an extremely difficult opponent to detect and defeat. With its superior intelligence and metamorphic capabilities, the T-1000 is an efficient fighter that embodies the ultimate evolution of assassination technology.</blockquote><blockquote>The T-1000’s sophisticated moveset is on full display in the new trailer, including the ability to organically form stabbing weapons, such as spears and hooks, and liquify for high-tech maneuvering and concealment. The video also reveals a new Fatality for the T-1000 and teases the character’s Animality, the brutal finishing move that morphs the machine into a K-9 German Shepherd to annihilate defeated opponents. The fan favorite Animalities are available now as a content update for all Mortal Kombat 1 owners at no additional cost.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The T-1000 Terminator joins the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on March 18 as part of the early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on March 25.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/11/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-kenshi-1741701745569.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mortal Kombat 1's T-1000 is packed with Terminator 2 references. Image credit: Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, we get another look at the upcoming Kameo character Madame Bo. In the trailer we see her Fatal Blow, a move in which she batters her enemy’s face with her slipper. Madam Bo will be available as a content update for all Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns owners at no additional cost or via standalone purchase on March 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 is the final DLC character set to be added to the 5 million-selling Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Mortal Kombat development chief <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>Ed Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
