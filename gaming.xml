<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you go onto any anime streaming site, chances are you’ve seen anime with wacky titles like <em>Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon</em> or <em>Do You Love Your Mom and Her Two-Hit Multi-Target Attacks?</em> While the titles make them sound like April Fool’s jokes, these are real anime and are part of a popular subgenre known as <strong>isekai</strong>. </p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">In isekai, protagonists are transported or reincarnated into another world vastly different than their own. Seeing the protagonist develop confidence, gain strength, and grow into the shoes of a hero makes isekai anime very appealing to fans of all ages.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">While I couldn’t tell you why so many isekai have odd titles that reveal the majority of the plot, I <em>can</em> tell you what the 10 best isekai anime of all time are.</p>
 <h2 id="h-10-the-devil-is-a-part-timer" data-injectable="false">10. <em>The Devil is a Part-Timer!</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GR75Z5KKY/the-devil-is-a-part-timer">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-maou-chiho.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Maou and chiho the devil is a part timer" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-maou-chiho.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-maou-chiho.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-maou-chiho.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-maou-chiho.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="513" data-current-count="840" data-injectable="true">A light-hearted comedy and reverse isekai, where Satan was forced to retreat through a portal that transported him to modern-day Tokyo. Due to Earth’s lack of magic, Satan and his demon generals lose their powers and are transformed into humans. Satan takes up the name, “Sadao Maou,” and gets a job at MgRonalds (a parody of McDonald’s). Instead of waging war, Sadao and the generals face the struggles of life at minimum wage, while spending their time off figuring out how to return to their world.</p>
 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false"><em>The Devil Is A Part-Timer! </em>Is an entertaining take on the isekai genre that provides a unique answer to the question, “What if the overpowered characters were transported to our world instead?”&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">9. <em>The Saga of Tanya the Evil</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GR9P57W96/saga-of-tanya-the-evil">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/saga-of-tanya-the-evil-sunshine.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="tanya the evil sunshine clouds" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/saga-of-tanya-the-evil-sunshine.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/saga-of-tanya-the-evil-sunshine.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/saga-of-tanya-the-evil-sunshine.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/saga-of-tanya-the-evil-sunshine.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">After an unfortunate death and encounter with a mysterious character known as Being X, a Japanese salaryman is reincarnated into a new, war-torn world as a young girl named Tanya. Hoping to eventually live a life of luxury, Tanya enlists in the military with the expectation that the knowledge from her past life could jump-start her career.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true">As Tanya proves herself to the Empire and rises in the ranks, she strays further from her original goal of living a life of luxury, as being an overachiever gets her assigned into increasingly dangerous combat roles. Tanya’s power is frequently put on display in large-scale, explosive fight scenes with some of the best action animations to date.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">8. <em>.hack/Sign</em></h2> <p data-characters="24" data-current-count="24" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://tv.apple.com/ca/show/hacksign/umc.cmc.8kfw99ey3sbva6lif5ub40lq">Apple TV</a></p> <figure data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hack-sign-cast.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt=".hack//Sign cast" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hack-sign-cast.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hack-sign-cast.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hack-sign-cast.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hack-sign-cast.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Bee Train</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">Arguably considered the anime that pioneered the MMORPG setting, <em>.hack/Sign</em> was one of the first anime to explore the psychological and sociological subjects surrounding video games.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">After Tsukasa wakes up in an MMORPG known simply as The World, he struggles to remember who he was and how he got into the game. After realizing that he can’t log out of the game, he begins his search for answers. Eventually, he meets the Crimson Knights and their leader Subaru, who—along with several other players—decide to join his investigation, since Tsukasa’s very existence seems to be the key to The World.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false"><em>.hack/Sign</em> paved the way for many popular isekai series, like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-start-watching-sword-art-online-sao-watch-order/"><em>Sword Art Online</em></a> and <em>Log Horizon</em>. While the psychological and slow-burning aspect of <em>.hack/Sign</em> may not appeal to everybody, its role in expanding the isekai subgenre and merging the world of video games and anime has secured its spot as one of the best isekai anime of all time.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">7. <em>Gate</em></h2> <p data-characters="20" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/gate-ce311a68-cf4d-417c-902d-a188af25a6b0">Hulu</a></p> <figure data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gate-elf-with-rpg.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="gate elf with rpg" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gate-elf-with-rpg.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gate-elf-with-rpg.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gate-elf-with-rpg.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gate-elf-with-rpg.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Hulu</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true"><em>Gate</em> is a balanced blend of both a regular isekai and reverse isekai. Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) officer Youji Itami travels through a mysterious gate into a fantasy world ripe with supernatural creatures and medieval warriors after said beings invaded Tokyo. Youji and his team work to create an alliance with the empire on the other side of the gate and add a diverse cast of fantasy characters to their group along the way.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">The humor is, at times, on the mature end of the spectrum, with silly depictions of war between warriors clad in iron armor against attack helicopters, mortar teams, and modern-day assault rifles. But despite its violence, <em>Gate</em> is an appealing isekai that explores a difficult path to coexistence between different worlds.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">6. <em>Overlord</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G69PZ5PDY/overlord">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="overlord ainz and albedo" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/overlord-ainz-albedo.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">If you’ve ever wondered what it’d be like to be the last player character in a world filled with NPCs (non-player characters), <em>Overlord</em> is the anime for you. But while every world needs heroes to save it, they also need villains to be saved from. Ainz Ooal Gown, an overpowered elder lich, sets out to conquer the world alongside his loyal cast of followers.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">After experiencing all the world has to offer, his final quest is to put his power to the test and see just how OP he has become. <em>Overlord</em> is packed with non-stop entertainment, with lovable characters and some of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/top-anime-with-op-main-characters/">most ridiculous displays of power in all of anime</a>.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">5. <em>KonoSuba: God’s Blessing on This Wonderful World!</em>&nbsp;</h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GYE5K3GQR/konosuba--gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/konosuba-kazuma-aqua-megumin.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="konosuba kazuma aqua and megumin" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/konosuba-kazuma-aqua-megumin.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/konosuba-kazuma-aqua-megumin.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/konosuba-kazuma-aqua-megumin.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/konosuba-kazuma-aqua-megumin.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true">By far one of the funniest isekai and anime in general, <em>KonoSuba: God’s Blessing on This Wonderful World</em> follows ordinary protagonist Kazuma Sato as he finds himself stumbling into increasingly dangerous yet hilarious situations. While his party members include a goddess, an un-killable knight, and a famous magician, their contrasting personalities end up being the fuel for most of the series’ conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">Despite having the Adventurer job (class) and being much lower level than his companions, Kazuma ends up being the glue that holds everything together. How he does so is what makes <em>KonoSuba</em> one of the most hilarious isekai anime out there.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">4. <em>Eminence in Shadow</em></h2> <p data-characters="20" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/the-eminence-in-shadow-66f37cf4-dba5-4511-ae26-e4092df1668b">Hulu</a></p> <figure data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eminence-in-shadow-cid.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="eminence in shadow cid" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eminence-in-shadow-cid.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eminence-in-shadow-cid.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eminence-in-shadow-cid.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eminence-in-shadow-cid.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Nexus</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false">Minoru has always wanted to rule from the shadows. After being reincarnated into another world, Minoru takes advantage of his new life as Cid Kagenou and becomes the mysterious Shadow, leader of Shadow Garden.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Cid amasses followers and tasks them with looking into the rise of a fake group known as the Cult of Diabolos, an imaginary enemy that sounds fitting for Shadow Garden. Unbeknownst to Cid, his imagination influences the development of the world around him. The conspiracies and intrigue actually become real.</p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">Cid’s grandiose lines, and the lengths he goes to be the most dramatic character he can be, makes <em>Eminence in Shadow</em> stand out amongst the typical isekai anime of recent years.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">3.<em> Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRGG9798R/rezero--starting-life-in-another-world-">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Re:Zero subaru and emilia holding hands" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rezero-subaru-emilia-holding-hands.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">While its cast of bright-haired twin maids and cute creatures make it seem like another cutesy isekai, <em>Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World</em> is quickly filled with death and conflict for protagonist, Subaru Natsuki.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">After being transported to a fantasy world, Subaru is cursed with a power that, at first, doesn’t sound too bad: “Return by Death.” Much like an autosave feature from video games, Subaru’s power becomes a cycle of failure and death, as he learns that this world is anything <em>but</em> a game. Subaru has to learn to make the most out of each resurrection, in order to save the people around him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false"><em>Re:Zero</em> is an isekai that punches above its weight and can hold its own when compared to the most popular anime. While it checks off all of the boxes for what makes a satisfying isekai, it boasts character development and emotional appeal that isn’t always expected from the isekai genre.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">2. <em>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</em></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GYZJ43JMR/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime">Crunchyroll</a></p> <figure data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="That time i got reincarnated as a slime rimuru" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime-rimuru.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">Satoru Mikami ends up being reincarnated as a slime after losing his life. While slimes are typically considered a bottom-tier monster in any fantasy world, Mikami is granted a few unique abilities based on his final thoughts before his death. With his built-in AI-like Great Sage assistant, and the Predator ability that makes him a slime version of Kirby, Mikami—now known as Rimuru Tempest—seeks to be a Demon Lord, the pinnacle of all monsters.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">With his newly acquired powers, Rimuru focuses on building a nation of monsters that allows his fellow monsters and followers to have a peaceful place in the world. <em>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime’s</em> Rimuru ends up becoming one of the wisest and most inspirational isekai protagonists of all time.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">1. <em>Inuyasha</em></h2> <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to watch</strong>: <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70204995">Netflix</a></p> <figure data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="inuyasha and kagome clouds" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inuyasha-kagome-clouds.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Viz Media</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">Since its anime debut in 2000,<em> Inuyasha</em> can be found in nearly every conversation or online debate over what is considered the greatest anime of all time.&nbsp;High school student Kagome Higurashi is sent back in time to the Sengoku period in Japan to help a half-demon, Inuyasha, recover the shards of a powerful jewel. While at first the two are hesitant to trust each other, Inuyasha and Kagome form a slow-building romance that influences their fates.</p>
 <p data-characters="597" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="false">Whether you’re looking to get into anime for the first time or you’ve been transported into the past and want to experience the classics, <em>Inuyasha</em> is the isekai anime for you. It’s difficult to pin one genre to <em>Inuyasha</em>, since it does everything so well that you’ll often forget that it was an isekai. The animation, though over 20 years old, still holds up wonderfully. The romance between Inuyasha and Kagome rivals that of many other love stories in romance anime, all while treating fans to a decade-long adventure that contains something that every type of anime fan can appreciate.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Our natural fear of the unknown immediately makes us keen on blending Science Fiction with Horror, but the combination isn’t all that easy to pull off. For every <em>Alien,</em> you get ten movies like <em>The Happening</em>, and, well, the <em>Alien</em> sequels. </p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">Here are ten movies that did the formula justice, some of which even pushed the genre forward by adding surprisingly effective, fresh new elements.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloverfield.webp?resize=640%2C360" alt="The statue of liberty's severed head in Cloverfield" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloverfield.webp?resize=640%2C360?w=800 800w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloverfield.webp?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloverfield.webp?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Bad Robot</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Cloverfield (Matt Reeves, 2008)</h2> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">Movies about big monsters ravaging through a city rarely fail to entertain, no other did it better than Cloverfield, the only film courageous enough to ask people to experience all the fear and devastation in first person perspective.</p> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">The found footage genre can go from scarily horrifying to incredibly good at putting you to sleep. After <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, <em>Cloverfield </em>is likely the most interesting attempt at this genre — and one of the best Kaiju films ever made.<br></p>

Instead of a bunch of people who get more than they bargained for by venturing where they shouldn’t, <em>The Myst</em> tells the story of a family just going about their business when their town gets engulfed by a mysterious mist that, you guessed it, is hiding scary things within. </p>
 <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false">There’s no lack of cool jumpscares and monster designs here, but <em>The Myst</em> never stops being about family, a family that ends up having to face making a decision that you’ll never forget.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Jeff Goldblum before the accident" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1600 1600w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-fly.png?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via FOX</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">The Fly (David Cronenberg, 1986)</h2> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><em>The Fly</em> references in <a href="https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/The_Fly">more popular media</a> are so prevalent that younger audiences might attribute the accidental mix between a person and an insect to a surprisingly popular trope, not a specific film. Still, David Cronenberg’s <em>The Fly</em> is much more than the imagining of one of humanity’s (apparent) greatest fears. </p> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">Though we tend to remember the scene of the accident and the very gory climax of the film, the entire deterioration of Jeff Goldblum’s character is more than worthy of everyone’s time.<br></p>

Yes, even though it features spooky monsters and scientific concepts are thrown around, those take the backseat to a surprisingly great love story between a regular guy and a mysterious Italian woman. <em>Spring</em> would’ve been an interesting experiment even if it had failed in the daunting task it set out to achieve, but it doesn’t.</p>
 <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="113" data-injectable="false"> It’s heartbreaking that not many people know about this one, and there’s only one way to fix that.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="Empty London" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/28-days-later.jpg?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Google Play</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2003)</h2> <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">While it’s only natural to think of George A. Romero’s movies or <em>Resident Evil</em> when you think about Zombies, it’s hard to deny how much <em>28 Days Later</em> revitalized the genre.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Running infected were some of the most divisive movie monsters when we first saw them, but now we can all admit they’re much scarier than the classic zombie type. Also, <em>28 Days Later</em> doesn’t just rest upon this update, as it weaves a personal and at some points even heartwarming tale of survival in an outbreak-ravaged England that you’ll never forget.<br></p>

Instead, it masterfully shows the slow descent into madness of a ship’s crew that accidentally strayed off course and has to come to terms with the possibility of never reaching the destination.</p>
 <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">While <em>Aniara</em> doesn’t feature jumpscares, it’s hard to ignore all the existential dread it fills viewers with by constantly giving them new hope and squashing it in front of their eyes.</p> <figure data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="One of the Cube's &quot;contestants&quot;" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1600 1600w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cube.jpg?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Cube (Vincenzo Natali, 2000)</h2> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="208" data-injectable="false">As far as low-budget sci-fi horror goes, I doubt you can do better than <em>Cube</em> — In fact, some of its darkest aspects are so well-conceived that you’ll have a hard time noticing it was even low-budget. </p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><em>Cube</em> invites viewers to experience a reality where a bunch of people are seemingly put at random into a megastructure composed of cubes that lead into other cubes, some of which feature deadly traps. The movie offers no answers, which helps the incredible violence of <em>Cube</em> feel extremely alien — or something late-stage capitalist humans would totally come up with.<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Alien (1979) - Trailer HD 1080p" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4v4Kn0J6E-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979)</h2> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">Ever since the release of <em>Aliens</em>, fans have been arguing over which is the best between the two original <em>Alien </em>films. <em>Aliens</em> fits more neatly in the sci-fi action category, and, as for the main reason why it’s not featured on this list, well, I just don’t think it measures up to the original.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">The original <em>Alien </em>from 1979 set an incredibly high bar for Sci-Fi horror by introducing us to a story equal parts Sci-Fi and Gothic Horror. Unlike <em>Aliens</em>, <em>Alien</em> revels in its buildup, and the moments we spend trying to understand what’s happening and watching the Xenomorph grow are as enthralling as the moments we spend being afraid once this perfect killing machine reaches maturity.<br></p> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The Predator" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1600 1600w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/predator.png?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via FOX</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Predator (John McTiernan,1987)</h2> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">If you like the action of <em>Die Hard</em>, <em>Terminator</em>, or even <em>Commando</em>, <em>Predator </em>has that for you, but what sets it apart is a brilliant genre subversion. <em>Predator</em> follows a group of soldiers led by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who are naturally the biggest and baddest dudes in the world — but not in the Universe.</p> <p data-characters="665" data-current-count="970" data-injectable="true">After a mission in which Arnie’s squad kills an entire battalion like it was a video game tutorial, they start dropping one by one in a gruesome fashion. Out of nowhere, what you thought would be another celebration of testosterone, turns into a slasher where the hopeless victims are all badasses you’d think each could’ve carried their own horror movies. On top of all the beautifully well-realized Sci-Fi and Horror crossover, <em>Predator</em> cements <em>Arnie</em> as the greatest action hero of them all by showing how the man isn’t afraid of getting slapped around by something bigger and stronger that forces him to use his wits to come out on top.<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The Thing's artwork" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=1920 1920w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-thing.png?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Universal</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-thing-john-carpenter-1982" data-injectable="false">The Thing (John Carpenter, 1982)</h2> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">What makes <em>The Thing</em> special isn’t the evil shapeshifting alien that hunts down the members of a likable crew one by one — though it features the best practical effects ever seen in cinema history. It’s the sense of dread you cannot shake by having to constantly wonder who’s the monster and who’s just an equally dangerous human on the verge of losing it.</p>
 <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">John Carpenter’s loose remake of Howard Hawks’s <em>The Thing</em> <em>From Another World</em> was a critical and commercial flop upon release, with Roger Ebert <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-thing-1982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeing it</a> as little more than ”&nbsp;a gross-out movie in which teenagers can dare one another to watch the screen”. Still, I believe there’s no better possible laurel for a sci-fi work than coming out ahead of its time, and <em>The Thing</em> was quick to get a cultural reappraisal that propelled it into the podium of sci-fi horror, which it hasn’t left since.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's when to grab a Nintendo Switch on sale this year.</h2></div><section><p>The Nintendo Switch is one of the most popular consoles of all time, with over 140M units sold to date. With an extensive library of exclusive titles available, you can spend hundreds of hours exploring the library without ever getting bored. With so many games to play, a Nintendo Switch is a must-own console if you wish to play some of the most popular games each year. 2024 is set to bring a remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, a remaster of Luigi's Mansion 2, and many more <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">upcoming Switch games</a> we've yet to discover.</p><p>Like all hardware, the Nintendo Switch tends to go on sale at specific points throughout the year. If you are interested in picking up Nintendo's portable system, you can snag a Switch on sale if you buy at the right time. We've compiled together the best times to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-switch-consoles">buy a Nintendo Switch</a> below, complete with every sale you might see a deal at. </p><h2>Best Times to Buy a Nintendo Switch</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/11/07/switch-blogroll-1656326807534-1656337488233-1660451221826-1667834141044.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h3><p>Like most video game consoles, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday are the best times of the year to buy a Nintendo Switch. Each year, Nintendo has released the same console bundle for Black Friday: a Red/Blue Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundled in for free. While this deal is priced at $299 every year, it is possible Nintendo will discount it further as the Switch approaches the end of its lifetime. </p><p>We've also seen Black Friday deals on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-lite">Nintendo Switch Lite</a>, where a free game and discount are bundled together. It is anyone's guess as to what Nintendo will have to offer for Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2024, but we would count on the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle returning for another go around.</p><p>2024 will likely see some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Switch deals</a> ever considering the Switch 2 will be releasing sometime in 2025.</p><h3>Holiday Weekends</h3><p>Another great time to pick up a Nintendo Switch is one of the major holiday weekends in the United States. This includes Memorial Day Weekend, Independence Day, President's Day, and Labor Day. More often than not, retailers like Walmart and Best Buy will host exclusive three day sales, which sometimes can include deals on Nintendo Switch hardware. These discounts usually are locked behind memberships like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-walmart-plus">Walmart +</a> and My Best Buy Plus/Total, so do keep this in mind if you are aiming for the best deals.</p><h3>Amazon Prime Day</h3><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024">Prime Day</a> is always one of the most popular sales events of the year, and naturally, you can usually find a good Nintendo Switch deal here. In addition to hardware, dozens of games and Switch accessories are always on sale. This makes Prime Day one of the best times to buy a Nintendo Switch, as you can save money on both the console and accessories alongside it. </p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day">Prime Day 2</a>, which takes place in October, also acts as the beginning of the Black Friday deals season. This event usually takes place sometime in October based on past years. So, any major Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals are likely to be available during this sales event as well.</p><h3>Clearance Sales</h3><p>Recently, retailers like Woot have listed Nintendo Switch models for prices we've rarely seen before, sometimes up to $75 off. These deals happen spontaneously, mostly when the retailer is clearing inventory out. To catch these deals as they happen, we recommend following the <a href="https://twitter.com/IGNDeals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Deals account</a> to get notified immediately.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that these same retailers offer open-box and refurbished units at an even lower price, so if you are okay with open-box purchases, consider this as an option.

Since console generations tend to last around seven to eight years at the very most, we do expect Nintendo to release a Switch successor sometime within the next nine months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">According to recent reports</a>, Nintendo Switch 2 is likely to feature magnetic Joy-Con, a 1080p screen, and more.</p><p>Since a release date is on the horizon, the price of Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-oled-model">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> are all likely to drop significantly as we head closer to Switch 2. If you are comfortable waiting to purchase a Switch, you can likely score the console at an all-time low towards winter 2024.</p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

<p data-characters="252" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Knowing which are the best gacha games to dive into is a must before choosing what to play, as picking the wrong title can translate to investing your time and hard-earned money on a journey that might either underwhelm or only last a couple of years. </p> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">In case you are currently facing that decision and need a guiding light, don’t worry. Here are the best gacha games to play in 2024 and what each of them brings to the table. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">10. Solo Leveling: ARISE (PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solo-Leveling-Arise-Key-Art-Sung-Jinwoo.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solo-Leveling-Arise-Key-Art-Sung-Jinwoo.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solo-Leveling-Arise-Key-Art-Sung-Jinwoo.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solo-Leveling-Arise-Key-Art-Sung-Jinwoo.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solo-Leveling-Arise-Key-Art-Sung-Jinwoo.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Netmarble</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="155" data-current-count="155" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/solo-leveling-arise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solo Leveling: ARISE</a></em> puts players in the shoes of both Its protagonist Sung Jinwoo, and a wide array of other hunters as they face the threat of the Gates.</p> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">Although featuring impressive visuals and a unique progression system, the main star of <em>Arise</em> is its fast-paced combat. The latter revolves around precise inputs and incentivizes the use of creative character builds. Players will also find a comprehensive story mode here, which holds tightly to its source material. The mode is the core of the experience and must be played to unlock key mechanics and features. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">9. Honkai Impact 3rd (PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Impact-3rd-Part-2-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Impact-3rd-Part-2-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Impact-3rd-Part-2-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Impact-3rd-Part-2-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Impact-3rd-Part-2-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/honkai-impact-3rd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em></a> is HoYoverse’s golden child and allows players to take control of more than 70 battlesuits as they fight for all that’s beautiful in the world. Even if still dated for some, its combat can also be seen as the branch upon which <em>Genshin Impact</em> grew. In it, you can switch among up to three characters while performing groundbreaking attacks and being light on your feet. </p>
 <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">The debut of its Part 2 in February 2024 also made the game more approachable than ever. Part 2 brought to <em>HI3</em> a visual upgrade and a new storyline featuring both a fully explorable map and a new main cast </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">8. Reverse: 1999 (PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reverse-1999-1-5-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reverse-1999-1-5-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reverse-1999-1-5-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reverse-1999-1-5-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reverse-1999-1-5-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Bluepoch.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">A sleeping hit for many, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/reverse-1999/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reverse: 1999</a></em> puts players in the role of the Timekeeper Vertin in her quest to stop the destruction caused by the Storm. During the story, she will then travel through multiple time periods. Each stop will present you with additions to the main cast and distinct settings. </p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">The game also has in its combat system a huge plus by featuring a mix of card and turn-based mechanics. Its noir feel and intricate character models also help differentiate <em>R1999 </em>from its peers and make it a worthy pick for all. </p>
 <h2 id="h-7-goddess-of-victory-nikke-pc-mobile" data-injectable="false">7. Goddess of Victory: Nikke (PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nikke-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nikke-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nikke-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nikke-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nikke-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Shift Up Corporation</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="760" data-injectable="true">If you accept the game for what it is aesthetic-wise, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/goddess-of-victory-nikke/"><em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke</em> </a>is one of the most approachable gacha games in the market. A courtesy of its above-average pull rates and generous rewards in the early/mid-game. <em>Nikke </em>also sets itself apart by being a shooter and allows you to take squads of up to five characters to the field. Although the game features many idle mechanics, you will need to be present for the best results in certain battles. </p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">The title’s narrative also manages to score big hits when it counts and excels, given its production value. As an extra, <em>Nikke</em> is<em> </em>known for receiving crossovers with many popular franchises. The latest brought <em>Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World’s</em> Ram, Rem, and Emilia to the game. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">6. Arknights (PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arknights-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Hypergryph</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true"><em>Arknights</em> is a highly technical tower defense game where character placement and an understanding of the terrain and enemies can make or break you. Thankfully, the game allows players to apply a multitude of different strategies by picking among its hundreds of Operators. Its narrative is another plus, as it feels engaging and succeeds in doing justice by its cast and making you feel like a part of it. </p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">Like <em>Nikke</em>, <em>Arknights</em> can be considered F2P friendly. That can be seen in how select 4-star Operators like Myrtle can perform on par with premium and featured units. You can also clear late-game stages while using only low-star characters. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">5. Punishing: Gray Raven ( PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Punishing-Gray-Raven-Alpha.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false"><em>Punishing: Gray Raven</em> puts players in the shoes of the Commandant of the Gray Raven squad, as they and the constructs under their command fight in the war against the Corrupted. The game is considered a standard, given its polished visuals and fast-paced combat style. The latter of which is focused on performing perfect dodges and well-timed combos. </p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true">Its overall style and the quality of its narrative also cause<em> PGR</em> to be constantly compared to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/nier-automata/">Nier: Automata</a></em>. So if you are a fan of PlatinumGames’ epic and are looking for an engaging narrative, you will feel right at home. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. AFK Journey ( PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AFK-Journey-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Lilith Games and Farlight Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="716" data-injectable="true">A spin-off of the hugely popular <em>AFK Arena</em>, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/afk-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AFK Journey</a> </em>allows players to assemble squads of up to five heroes to take part in many modes. The latter is also where the game shines, as you can find options for fans of open-world exploration, standard PVP, and even roguelikes. As most modes do not demand many inputs, <em>AFK Journey </em>can also be seen as the ideal pick for all looking for a game to run in the background.</p>
 <p data-characters="128" data-current-count="128" data-injectable="false"><em>AFK Journey </em>is the most F2P-friendly name in our list by a large margin given its generous rewards and daily mode availability. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">3. Fate/Grand Order (Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fate-Grand-Order-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Lasengle</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">Royalty in the genre, <em>Fate/Grand Order</em> continues to be a solid pick almost a decade after its release. As a branch of the Fate series, the game allows players to control more than 450 Servants as they take part in highly tactical turn-based battles. Players can also deepen their connection with each servant and unlock special interactions and quests by completing various activities. </p> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">Diving into <em>FGO </em>will demand a lot of catching up. Fortunately, the game’s community is known for being extremely receptive and it’s sure to offer a home to all, newcomers or seasoned masters alike.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">2. Genshin Impact (PS5 / PS4 / PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">The title responsible for shaking up the market,<em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact </a></em>sits at the top as the current flagship of the gacha genre. </p>
 <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><em>Genshin</em> offers the full package to fans by providing an experience rivaling that of most current-gen AAA titles in both visuals and performance. Its open-world style and vast but not excessive cast of playable characters also set it apart as one of the most fun gacha games around for newcomers. On the other hand, its exploration-focused approach makes the game one of the most time-consuming picks on our list in the early and mid-game stages. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">1. Honkai: Star Rail (PS5 / PC / Mobile)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Honkai-Star-Rail-Anniversary-Key-Art.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true">A spin-off/sequel of <em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em> but by all means its own game,<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/honkai-star-rail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Honkai: Star Rail </em></a>takes players on a journey across the universe. The game also mixes the exploration/character mechanics that made<em> Genshin Impact</em> such a success with an unbelievably polished turn-based combat system. Those looking for characters will also be pleased, as <em>Star Rail </em>features a roster of more than 40 unique ones. </p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false"><em>HSR’s</em> story is also praised for always delivering in the biggest moments and staying consistent. At the end of the day, <em>HSR </em>improves upon the best of its older siblings to deliver what I believe to be the best gacha experience currently available. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Helldivers 2</em> review bomb campaign players went on before <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-reviews-are-already-looking-better-after-sonys-backpedaling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony reverted</a> the upcoming requirement for a PSN account login inadvertently created a great design for an in-game cape. Now, it looks like that cape has been brought to life, and players can’t want to get it. </p> <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">Over the past week or so, <em>Helldivers 2</em> players have been through a pretty rough series of movements against and then for the game they love. When Sony indicated that a PSN account would be required to play from the end of May, players went on a review-bomb campaign until this requirement was rescinded. After that, a positive review-bombing campaign began, making a pretty interesting pattern on the game’s stats page. That stats page and this effort have now been immortalized as a cape. </p>
 <h2 id="h-arrowhead-reveals-helldivers-2-review-bomb-cape-is-coming" data-injectable="false">Arrowhead reveals <em>Helldivers 2</em> review bomb cape is coming</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="765" data-injectable="true">Over the weekend, Arrowhead Game Studios’ CEO Johan Pilesedt shared a cheeky <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldiversmedia/status/1789410993119846721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image of a cape</a> in <em>Helldivers 2</em> that looks suspiciously like the Steam reviews <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-ceo-jokes-about-accidental-cape-design-from-negative-steam-reviews-and-players-want-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image that he joked</a> would make a great cape in the game. Players immediately jumped on the past and began begging to have it in their inventory. The Helldivers 2 Media account even posted what looks like a pretty legitimate image of the cape, though I can’t verify if it’s real or a mockup. </p>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">Users seemingly lost their minds when they saw this and posted amazing replies, like Basetrade’s comment, “ID LIKE TO DOWNVOTE THIS POST BUT IN A POSITIVE WAY.” </p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">The cape will be the second to commemorate the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community. The first was the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-can-claim-a-special-commemorative-malevelon-creek-cape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malevelon Creek cape</a> that every player was given in recognition of the insane number of deaths on the planet and how much players hate fighting on it. </p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">This new cape means more, though. It recognizes the power of the community working together not just in the game but outside of it, too. The review bombing was a form of protest, as players aimed to force Sony to reverse its decision to require PC players to have a PSN account. </p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">However, just because a cape is on the way, it doesn’t mean the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community is done fighting. At the time of writing, 177 countries are unable to purchase the game after it was delisted from Steam. Those countries do not allow PSN accounts, meaning it was impossible for those users to play the game once the PSN requirement was instated. </p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">User G.O.A.T.Gaming replied to this same post, saying, “You promised everyone would be able to play Helldivers, and they can’t. We trusted you!” Pilestedt has explained in multiple social media posts that it would be in Sony’s hands to fix this, but Arrowhead Game Studios is hoping it will be resolved soon. </p>

<p data-characters="241" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since it was initially released, <em>Helldivers 2</em> has always had two enemy factions for players to fight against. While players always suspected more would come eventually, it looks like the Illuminate might be arriving in the very near future. </p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Players in <em>Helldivers 2</em> have noticed hints that the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-illuminates-have-popped-back-up-in-an-unexpected-way/">Illuminate faction</a> has been present in the game here and there since its release. However, there’s never been any concrete evidence or enemy unit to point a firearm at and kill. the last few days feel different, though, because the developer has been teasing the faction on Twitter in open conversations with fans. </p> <h2 id="h-pilestedt-is-throwing-around-illuminate-rumors-for-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">Pilestedt is throwing around Illuminate rumors for <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="blue laser illuminate in helldivers 2" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blue-laser-illuminate-in-helldivers-2.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Lifeless’ YouTube channel</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">Arrowhead Game Studios’ CEO Johan Pilestedt has been hinting at the Illuminate from the original <em>Helldivers</em> game over the past couple of days. In response to a call for collaborations alongside a <a href="https://twitter.com/LoopyLewis1990/status/1789402287779004544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phenomenal video that showcases</a> a mod for <em>Helldivers 2</em> that brings <em>Star Wars</em> to the game, Pilestedt said, “Imagine if there was a predator-like alien species in the Helldivers universe that were exiled from the galaxy that were planning vengeance!”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Imagine if there was a predator-like alien species in the Helldivers universe that were exiled from the galaxy that were planning vengeance! 🤔</p>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1789405330104836434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">This is exactly what the Illuminate is. Given their lack of presence in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, it’s assumed that they were eventually wiped out by Super Earth. At least their presence in the local galactic region. That would make them pretty damn cross, and I see them coming back swinging after they’ve licked their wounds a little. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Had the craziest dream that this whole <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Helldivers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Helldivers</a> account linking controversy was revealed to be a marketing ploy by Arrowhead to announce the in-game arrival of the Illuminate, who are attempting to turn Helldivers against Super Earth via social-engineering psiops. It was WILD</p>— ThusKindly (@thus_kindly) <a href="https://twitter.com/thus_kindly/status/1788518071646187863?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Pilestedt isn’t the only one with Illuminate on the brain, though. User ThusKindly on <a href="https://twitter.com/thus_kindly/status/1788518071646187863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter shared</a> what reads like a pretty harrowing dream in which it was revealed that the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-reviews-are-already-looking-better-after-sonys-backpedaling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN account link war</a> between <em>Helldivers 2</em> players and Sony was actually a marketing ploy with the new enemy faction as the surprise ending. </p>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">But we’ve been down this road before. Previously, Arrowhead Game Studios was served with evidence of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-devs-blue-laser-remarks-fuel-speculation-of-imminent-new-enemy-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blue lasers the Illuminate use</a> on the battlefield being caught in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. That was months ago, though, and the enemy faction hasn’t been seen since. While Pilestedt discussing the enemy doesn’t guarantee it’ll be added in the next update, it does make a story shakeup seem like it’s going to happen sooner rather than later.</p>
 <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">At the time of writing, there’s a lovely space at the bottom of the galactic map where a new enemy faction would fit right in. It’s the perfect time for them to appear, too. Players are engaged in a grind to kill 2 billion Automatons for the current Major Order, meaning all of Super Earth’s attention is laser-focused on the top left-hand portion of the galaxy. Not the bottom. </p>

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The first two episodes of<em> Doctor Who</em> season 14, with Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor, were released on May 12, and rather than the Doctor himself, everyone is talking about one character—Maestro. They’re one hell of a villain, but where have you seen that face before?</p> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">It seems that no matter where you look currently, you simply can’t avoid the face of Maestro. The musically talented villain is the undeniable star of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-who-could-be-the-one-who-waits/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjItNGQv4iGAxVTVPEDHXGuCjcQFnoECBYQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw36nDMu5hzpsMg2zdAe-0Ub">The Devil’s Chord</a>, the most recent episode of this season of <em>Doctor Who </em>so far, and they’re actually a pretty familiar face to some people.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">In the show, Maestro is hell-bent on their mission to rid the world of music and keep it for themselves, but in real life, the actor who plays them is as opposed to this idea as it gets.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Maestro-recording-studio.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="Jinkx Monsoon as Maestro in Doctor Who" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Maestro-recording-studio.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Maestro-recording-studio.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Maestro-recording-studio.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Maestro-recording-studio.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="743" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://jinkxmonsoon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jinkx Monsoon</a>, whose legal name is Hera Hoffer, is an American drag queen, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3zqbSX_1GrjT3H3ywILAvA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">singer</a>, songwriter, actress and comedian. It’s safe to say that she’s got a serious amount of talent and is noted for her ability to perform off-the-cuff impersonations of celebrities. To date, she has released two studio albums (The Inevitable Album in 2014 and The Ginger Snapped in 2018), so if anyone was perfect for the role of Maestro, it would be her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">However, familiarity with Jinkx is more likely to come from her roles on television. While she doesn’t have an extensive acting career behind her, she was one of the featured drag queens on season five of <em>Ru Paul’s Drag Race</em> back in 2013, winning the season. She came back to the show in 2022, when she took part in season seven of <em>Ru Paul’s Drag Race All Stars</em>, going on to win that too and earning the title “The Queen of Queens”.&nbsp;</p>

She voice acted in an episode of <em>Steven Universe</em>, playing the main antagonist of the episode “ Lars of the Stars”, Emerald. She was also in an episode of <em>Blue Bloods</em>, playing Tallulah, as well as providing her voice as Normulon and Lemongrab in the gender-swapping <em>Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Dying Light (2015) is soaring on Steam amid a monumental sale that has slashed the game’s price tag down to single-digit dollars. This open-world zombie title, which is often considered one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever made, first wowed audiences almost a decade ago with its high-octane parkour mechanics and grisly combat engine.</p>



<p>As Techland has slashed the price to celebrate Zombie Awareness Month, tens of thousands of people have flooded into the game, boasting the player count by around 330%.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-undead-rising">Undead Rising</h2>



<p>On Steam, which has readily available player data, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/239140#6m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a peak player count of 39,812 players</a> was recorded in the last twenty-four hours. Last month, that peak player count sat at around 9,049. By contrast, 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human, which was released to a mixed reception, boasts a twenty-four-hour peak player count of around 7,000.</p>



<p>The all-time high for Dying Light on Steam is 45,770, so this special sale almost reached a new record. </p>



<p>For reference, the last time Dying Light scored anywhere close to these numbers on Steam was in February 2022 – when Dying Light 2 was released. Isn’t it funny how that works?</p>



<p>Dying Light is well worth playing, even almost a decade after it emerged. It features an immersive, entertaining story that’ll keep you occupied for a good thirty to fifty hours, and there’s a fantastic option for multiplayer if you want to slay the undead alongside a friend. It was one of the defining games of the last generation and one of the best zombie games ever made, so it’s well worth paying a couple of dollars to get ahold of it.</p>

            <p>Fan-favourite WWE fighter CM Punk is returning to WWE 2K24 for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p>Punk marks his return as part of the ECW Punk Pack alongside Terry Funk, Sandman, and The Dudley Boyz, Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley.</p>

<p>Players can also expect MyFaction Content which includes an ECW Paul Heyman Manager Card and unspecified MyFaction Superstar Cards when the pack drops on 15th May for all platforms.</p>
<p>You can see a brief snippet of the action in the teaser below:</p> 
<p>Don't forget that the Post Malone and Friends pack – containing Post, Sensational Sherri, Mosh, Thrasher, Honky Tonk Man, and Jimmy Hart Manager – will follow in June and the Pat McAfee Pack is slated to release in July.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wwe-2k24-u-turns-on-modder-ban-following-community-backlash">WWE 2K24 recently unbanned a prolific WWE modder following complaints from its community</a>.</p>
<p>WhatsTheStatus - who was banned last week for "violation of terms" - revealed on Twitter/X that, after speaking with 2K and the WWE team, they had "come to an agreement, and a fair one at that". Originally, 2K and/or developer Visual Concepts was unhappy with WhatsTheStatus' mods, saying that as they "negatively impact the game experience for other players", the modder was banned in order to ensure there is a "positive WWE 2K24 experience for all players".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the year’s breakout TV series may be getting more episodes. Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/hiroyuki-sanada-deal-shogun-renewed-season-2-fx-emmys-drama-1235911076/">reports</a> that Hiroyuki Sanada, who produces and stars as Lord Yoshi Toranaga in the once-limited series <em>Shogun</em>, has inked a deal to play the part again in a second season, making it all the more likely a second season will happen.</p> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">Keep in mind, season two has not been officially ordered; per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/shogun-season-2-status-strong-chance-1235896010/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, this is an “if-come” deal that just secures Sanada’s involvement, should it get greenlit. Though details are still scarce, the events of season two would likely go beyond the events of James Clavell’s novel that the show’s based on, considering how the original season already covered most of it. But really, should they even do that?</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">'Shōgun' Star Hiroyuki Sanada Inks Deal To Return For Season 2 As FX Limited Series Mulls Emmy Switch To Drama Amid Renewal Buzz <a href="https://t.co/7v2o503ICw">https://t.co/7v2o503ICw</a></p>— Deadline Hollywood (@DEADLINE) <a href="https://twitter.com/DEADLINE/status/1788954613867229289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <h2 id="h-jumping-off-the-pages" data-injectable="false">Jumping off the pages</h2> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">We know that the character of Toranaga is loosely based on real-life Tokugawa Ieyasu who, you guessed it, went on to become the Shogun of a Shogunate that lasted for over 250 years. Many tales can be told of that time, but that would be missing the point of the show.</p>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">Nobody sets out to make a series finale that sucks, but many series still end on notes so low they cause entire fandoms to break down and wonder if they ever really loved the series all that much. See: <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true"><em>Shogun </em>masterfully passed its final test — and definitely not because it ever took the easy way out. <strong>Spoilers ahead:</strong> Though the FX series covers most of the events of the novel it’s based on, it makes the beautifully deliberate choice of ending before the novel does — but not as a way to leave space for a second season.</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">While many were expecting the big battle that the series had been teasing ever since the POV character, John Blackthorne, got recruited to help Toranaga because of his naval warfare proficiency, they got one hour of people talking. This ending would spell disaster many-a-show—but that made for a beautifully subversive closer here. <em>Shogun’s</em> finale spends its climax essentially telling the viewer that this was always Toranaga’s show, never Blackthorne’s.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Blackthorne Draws Lord Toranaga a Map of the World - Scene | Shōgun | FX" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClmWZX28ARg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true">When asked about the involvement of shipwrecked sailor in Toranaga’s master plan, the warlord finally admits he only really has Blackthorne around because he finds him funny. Toranaga excelled at war, sure, but what made him so admirable was his ability to win battles even before they were fought. We never see the final battle because it just isn’t necessary. </p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">What matters is that we see Toranaga planting the seeds for his final victory. We spend the entire series seeing Toranaga moving ahead of his enemies, even when everyone and both gods seem to be against him. It was somehow so much more rewarding to <em>know</em> there’s only one way it could turn out than to see it play out in the same overblown CGI bonanza you see in every big blockbuster nowadays.</p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">Much like Toranaga’s rivals, the people expecting the big battle were paying attention to the wrong moves, and that’s on us — and his rivals. His victory is inevitable; why drag it out?</p>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">What’s on whoever will keep on making the show, however, is the emotional core going forward. Even though they were just pawns in Toranaga’s game of war, many characters that gave their life so that Toranaga could win through the smallest possible amount of bloodshed. These roles were the heart of the show, and I don’t envy the task of filling the gaps they left behind.</p>

<p data-characters="302" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s easy to think of the entire fantasy book genre being aimed at children, but that’s just not the case. There are hundreds of fantasy books and series aimed at adults and young adults that will free you from the shackles of grounded reads and help you dream beyond the rules of reality. </p> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">I always loved reading fantasy books growing up because they take you away from the mundanity of everyday life. I can’t say if the best ones blend real life with their fantasy concepts or not because I genuinely love them all and devoured any sci-fi and fantasy I could get my hands on as a kid. However, there are still plenty of fantasy books to dig into as an adult that you probably didn’t come across as a child and make for accessible reads to help you get into the genre. </p>
 <h2 id="h-the-best-fantasy-books-for-adults" data-injectable="false">The best fantasy books for adults</h2> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Below, I’ve listed what I think are the best fantasy books for adults who want to get into the genre or return to it after a long hiatus of living a busy day-to-day work life. I’ve tried to veer away from anything too niche but also include a few books that are the beginnings of a really engrossing series, just in case you’re hooked after the first page and know you need the next dozen novels. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">10. <em>The Hobbit</em> – J.R.R. Tolkien</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-hobbit-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="the hobbit best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-hobbit-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-hobbit-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-hobbit-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-hobbit-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">To me, if you’re looking to read the best fantasy books for adults, then you can’t go wrong with anything from J.R.R. Tolkien. Author of the incredible <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> series, he’s got a huge backlog of titles for you to delve into if you adore this universe. However, I’d recommend you begin with <em>The Hobbit</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Unlike the movies, this story is fairly short and to the point but extremely gripping. Where the films drew out everything they could, the book is well-paced and follows the original Hobbit on his unexpected journey across Middle-Earth. During this journey, he encounters all manner of fantasy creatures, establishing the very foundations of everything we know about fantasy today. </p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">Regardless of whether you’ve seen the movies or not, this is a fantastic starting point for a journey into fantasy. If you love it, you can continue on into <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and far beyond. You could <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-lego-the-hobbit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">try the <em>LEGO</em> game</a> if you want to experience the book through a new medium. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">9. <em>A Game of Thrones</em> (A Song of Ice and Fire #1) – George R.R. Martin</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-game-of-thrones-best-fantaasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="a game of thrones best fantaasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-game-of-thrones-best-fantaasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-game-of-thrones-best-fantaasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-game-of-thrones-best-fantaasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-game-of-thrones-best-fantaasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="true">If <em>The Hobbit</em> didn’t exist, <em>A Game of Thrones</em> may be the most well-known fantasy book and TV series of all time. It all begins with this first book, where absolutely everything that could go wrong goes wrong. It’s the start of an epic saga that sees one family torn apart by greed, and a world that doesn’t know it’s about to fall to darkness come closer than is comfortable to complete annihilation. </p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">The story follows the Stark family as they enter into the highest level of society and the fight for the Iron Throne that plays out behind the scenes. No one is safe, not even the king, and there’s a threat looming over the world that no one is prepared to even admit exists. Winter. </p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="774" data-injectable="true">What I love about this first book in an entire series that could all be the best fantasy books for adults is how well it introduces every character, setting the tone for what’s to come. You get to know a colorful cast of genuinely interesting people who have all found themselves somewhere in the royal court that extends around the entire region where it’s set. There’s political drama on a global and local level and some of the best lines you’ll ever read. </p>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">Don’t go into this if you can’t take losing your favorite characters, though. This series as a whole is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-episode-is-the-red-wedding-in-game-of-thrones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty brutal</a> and will absolutely not hold your hand while you grieve. It delves into the darkest parts of the human heart in a world where power is everything, and you must do whatever you can to seek it. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">8. <em>The Gunslinger</em> (The Dark Tower #1) – Stephen King</h3> <figure data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-gunslinger-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="the gunslinger best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-gunslinger-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-gunslinger-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-gunslinger-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-gunslinger-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><em>The Gunslinger</em> is the first book in <em>The Dark Tower</em> series, all of which are great fantasy books for adults, but it can be read in isolation and enjoyed without needing to continue through the full set. It follows a lonely character who equates to a fantasy cowboy on a journey of vengeance to find one man. This man has been evading him for a long time and has the ability to twist the minds of those around him, but this cowboy is more than capable of looking after himself.</p>
 <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">This book does a fantastic job of setting up the series and makes you fall in love with some really well-realized characters. Everyone the protagonist has a meaningful relationship with becomes a friend to you as the reader, and you end up missing them when the story moves on. </p> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">If you like a bit of dark fantasy but not too dark, this is the perfect book for you. It doesn’t require you to read all about tentacled monsters and flying whales, but it does invite you into a desolate world that’s intrinsically linked to ours and tells a tale of reluctant fatherhood that will have you rooting for everyone involved as they trudge ever onward. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">7. <em>Neverwhere</em> (London Below #1) – Neil Gaiman</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/neverwhere-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="neverwhere best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/neverwhere-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/neverwhere-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/neverwhere-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/neverwhere-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">Neil Gaiman is a master storyteller, and <em>Neverwhere</em> is one of his most underappreciated books. I first discovered it as an audio drama created by the BBC, which is a great way to consume this fantasy book for adults, and was hooked on London Below from that point. the universe feels similar to Fallen London but takes a much more literal approach to its translation of the surface world. </p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">The story follows a young man who innocently helps a young girl one night, only to be transported from Earth into London Below. This underground version of the city twists it in whimsically dark ways that make it feel oppressive at first but also somehow welcoming and charming after a while. </p> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">It’s a fantastic read and a great way to get into the universe. I’d say it’s probably better if you have at least some level of knowledge of the city of London because some of the characters and locations and their twists might be lost on you without any. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">6. <em>Outlander</em> (Outlander #1) – Dianna Gabaldon</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/outlander-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="outlander best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/outlander-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/outlander-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/outlander-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/outlander-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="764" data-injectable="true">You might know <em>Outlander</em> from the impeccable Amazon Prime show. If not, you’re in for a treat once you’ve read this amazing fantasy book for adults. While the series is close to historical fiction, it’s all framed through a fantasy tale of a woman falling through time without any real knowledge of how she did it. She must find a way to exist in a time when women hold no power and any woman with an ounce of intelligence is treated as a witch. </p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">I adore the setting for this book and the rest of the series: Scotland in the 1700s. It takes a beautiful country and transports you to a time when it was as lush and green with a reasonable amount of civilization as it has ever been—before the English came in and ruined it all. </p> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">Through this book and the series at large, you’ll learn so much about the history of England and Scotland, but it’s the love story between Jamie and Claire that will stick with you. Fair warning: pretty much every book has a few adult scenes, so if that’s not the kind of thing you’re after, maybe skip this one. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">5. <em>Rivers of London</em> – Ben Aaronovich</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rivers-of-london-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="rivers of london best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rivers-of-london-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rivers-of-london-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rivers-of-london-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rivers-of-london-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="741" data-injectable="true"><em>Rivers of London</em> is the first book in a fabulous fantasy series that’s intrinsically English and explores folklore in a way I guarantee you’ve not experienced before. The first book here follows a police officer who, standing guard at a crime scene all night, notices what appears to be a ghost dog. This leads him into a world filled with mystical wonder and starts him on a path you don’t expect when you join the force. </p>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">What I really enjoy about this book and the series at large is how it blends folklore into modern life without it ever feeling jarring. If you enjoy this entry, there’s so much more for you to dig your teeth into. It’s also quite a fresh series in terms of when it was published, so it’s got loads of modern tropes that will help you really get lost in it. </p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="715" data-injectable="true">This series can really bridge the gap between standard fiction and the best fantasy books for adults out there. Author Ben Aaronovich has worked on a number of popular TV shows and is brilliant at bringing stories to the table that are self-contained but add to a wider story arc without making you feel like you’ve missed something. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">4. <em>The Drowning City</em> (The Necromancer Chronicles #1) – Amanda Downum</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-drowning-city-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="the drowning city best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-drowning-city-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-drowning-city-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-drowning-city-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-drowning-city-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="784" data-injectable="true"><em>The Drowning City</em> is a fantasy book I picked up in a second-hand bookshop because I liked the blurb and cover. It’s hard to tell what the story is from either, and that’s partly because it’s completely bonkers. It’s set in a rich fantasy world that’s thick with lore from centuries of history. Every event is fueled by something that happened in the past, and it makes the whole thing feel like you’re exploring a culture more than reading a book. </p>
 <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">What makes <em>The Drowning City</em> one of the best fantasy books for adults is how dark some of its subject matter is. Each location is so vivid that I felt like I was walking down their streets or getting pulled into the canals by their ghosts. the</p> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">I really can’t tell you much about this story without needing to add context that will spoil the plot. What I can say is that you enter the titular location as a newcomer alongside the protagonist and learn all about the magic and politics of the local region as she does. It’s so much fun to explore and is part of a trilogy that you could go on to read if you like a bit of dirty fantasy. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">3. <em>The Golden Compass</em> (His Dark Materials #1) – Philip Pullman</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-golden-compass-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="the golden compass best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-golden-compass-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-golden-compass-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-golden-compass-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-golden-compass-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">Before the TV adaptation was created, I wouldn’t have included <em>The Golden Compass</em> in this list of the best fantasy books for adults. However, I believe that the show opened a lot of people’s eyes to how dark the world that Philip Pullman created really is. </p>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">In this book, you enter into a world where human souls stand by their side as creatures that can change shape until they hit puberty when they settle into one form. What starts out as a tale of children disappearing quickly morphs into one that spans entire dimensions, leading to a war between worlds that’s worthy of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. </p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">The best part of this book, in particular, is its characters. Each one is beautifully flawed and feels like a firm friend you’ll never forget. The book brings them all to life from mere words on a page, and I think any book that can do that is worth your time, regardless of your age. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">2. <em>Carve the Mark</em> – Veronica Roth</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/carve-the-mark-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="carve the mark best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/carve-the-mark-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/carve-the-mark-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/carve-the-mark-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/carve-the-mark-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true">You might know Veronica Roth’s much more popular work, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sci-fi-movies-on-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Divergent</em> trilogy</a>. This follow-up is smaller in size but much broader in scope. It’s set in a star system where the people of each planet have different roles within the stellar society and explores what happens when one society seeks to overthrow and take control of another. </p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">This series only consists of two entries, but they’re gripping and explore the fantastical side of sci-fi that sees humanity intertwined with elements of the universe in a way I’ve never seen explored before or since. That’s why they’re some of the best fantasy books for adults you could hope to read. </p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">At the heart of the plot is a love story that’s probably one of the easiest to understand and identify with, how your weaknesses and strengths can complement someone else’s. It’s beautiful in its own way, a small time investment, and a couple of books you won’t regret picking up. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">1. <em>14</em> (Threshold #1) – Peter Clines</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/14-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="14 best fantasy books for adults" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/14-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/14-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/14-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/14-best-fantasy-books-for-adults.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="776" data-injectable="true">I went into <em>14</em> expecting to be reading something along the lines of <em>Silent Hill 4: The Room</em>, but I was so, so wrong. While it treads the line between sci-fi and fantasy, I think it fits more into the fantasy genre because it’s more of a mystery book about an apartment building and a group of people who all take the oddities they notice about it as a given, and don’t ask questions. That is until one of them starts poking around and makes a startling discovery. </p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">This book is part of a series that’s connected, but you don’t need to read in order. That’s why I love it. If you enjoy a good mystery thriller with twists that are so out of this world you’ll never see them coming, this is a fantastic book to pick up first. </p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="false">The fantasy elements lean quite heavily on the work of H.P. Lovecraft. So, if you’d rather avoid the tentacled region of fantasy, give this a miss. I will say that it does a great job of not being anywhere near as vague as some of those old horror novels and won’t scare you so much as it will get your adrenaline going. Especially in the final chapters. </p>

<p>Despite the rumblings, Sucker Punch isn’t working on a Sly Cooper game, according to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier.</p>



<p>Earlier today, rumors began to swirl following Giant Bomb’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPtzkxO0Ges&amp;ab_channel=JeffGrubb%27sGameMess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Grubb’s video</a> “Perfect Dark and Summer Game Mess update”, where Grubb speculated that Sucker Punch could be working on a Sly Cooper game, which is causing Ghost of Tsushima 2 to take a long time to release. Speculating on Sly, Grubb said, “That’s speculation, but it’s definitely smoke out there, but maybe where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”</p>



<p>Grubb’s comments and speculation subsequently started to make the rounds on Twitter, with some users representing the information as fact. However, Bloomberg’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1789694171176984792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Schreier</a> swooped in on the rumor to debunk it.</p>



<p>“No truth to this one, sorry to say. Sucker Punch is a one-project studio. The reason Ghost of Tsushima 2 isn’t out yet is because AAA video games now take 5-7 years to make. (Also, Sucker Punch is smaller than most other AAA game developers)”, he said.</p>



<p>As for if Sucker Punch will ever make another Sly Cooper game remains to be seen, but at the moment, the team is entirely focused on the next Ghost of Tsushima game.</p>



<p>The last mainline Sly Cooper game to be released was Thieves in Time in 2013 by Sanzaru Games. Despite the game featuring a secret ending alluding to a future installment, Sanzaru issued a statement in 2014 that the studio was not developing a new game in the series.</p>



<p>Do you think Sucker Punch will ever do another Sly Cooper game? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p data-characters="262" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Local Game Stores are becoming increasingly difficult to find as the world shifts to digital storefronts. Luckily for those living in remote areas or whose favorite store closed down, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> has a thriving online player base across many platforms. </p> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="189" data-injectable="false">Many popular platforms take the (excuse the pun) magic from the tabletop to the internet. Each accommodates a variety of game modes and features which makes some more appealing than others.</p> <p data-characters="68" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">Player preferences are primarily formed around three criteria:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false"> <li>Game modes (Ex. Standard, Commander, Two-Headed Giant)</li> <li>Accessibility (Installation, setup, cost)</li> <li>User Experience (Interface, gameplay automation, matchmaking)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="85" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">With those in mind, here are the best ways to play <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> (MTG) online:</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-best-magic-the-gathering-online-games" data-injectable="false">The best Magic: The Gathering online games</h2> <h3 id="h-honorable-mentions" data-injectable="false">Honorable mentions</h3> <h3 data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/"><em>Tabletop Simulator</em></a></h3> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">While <em>Tabletop Simulator</em> can be used to play virtually any tabletop game, it doesn’t mean that it’s easy. MTG can be played in <em>Tabletop Simulator</em> but requires a tremendous amount of work for every player involved. </p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false"> <li>Players will need to create or find a table suitable for MTG on the Steam Workshop. </li> <li>Decks must be created and imported into the game with assets for each card. </li> <li>The process of finding games is left up to the player, mostly an option suitable for games between friends</li> <li>Costs $19.99 for each player</li> </ul> <h3 data-injectable="false"><a href="http://xmage.today/"><em>XMage</em></a></h3> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">When <em>XMage</em> works, it’s one of the best clients for playing MTG online. Unfortunately, <em>XMage</em> is rife with issues both in and out of the game. Players frequently mention being unable to download the client due to website errors or experiencing other game-breaking bugs. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Modern interface, considered a successor to <em>Cockatrice</em></li> <li>Completely free</li> <li>Infrequent updates – new sets are usually introduced within a month of release</li> <li>If bugs are present, it could be months before they’re addressed</li> <li>During a good patch, XMage is considered a go-to platform, but those patches are becoming increasingly rare</li> </ul> <h3 data-injectable="false">4. <a href="https://cockatrice.github.io/"><em>Cockatrice</em></a></h3> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true"><em>Cockatrice</em> launched in 2010 and was the community’s first attempt at digitizing Magic. Wizard of the Coast’s <em>Magic: The Gathering Online</em> was the primary platform for players who wanted to play Magic over the internet.&nbsp;But for many paper<em> </em>players, paying for an additional digital collection of cards simply wasn’t affordable. </p>
 <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false"><em>Cockatrice</em> launched with the promise of a completely free-to-play Magic experience online, a promise that has held up to this day.</p> <figure data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-cockatrice-board.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="magic the gathering mtg cockatrice board" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-cockatrice-board.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-cockatrice-board.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-cockatrice-board.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-cockatrice-board.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">As time has passed, so too have the technology and capabilities of the internet. While <em>Cockatrice</em> still receives support and occasional updates, the interface is dated and the client feels like a chat room from the early 2000s. Setting up and playing on <em>Cockatrice</em> has gotten easier over the years, but can still be off-putting to some players.&nbsp;</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">3. <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo"><em>Magic: The Gathering Online</em></a><em> </em></h3> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true">In 2002, Wizards of the Coast launched <em>Magic: The Gathering Online,</em> which could be considered a pioneer of online card gaming. While heavily criticized for its in-game economy and numerous bugs, MTGO has managed to stay alive despite facing many competitors over its two-decade lifespan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Unlike <em>Cockatrice</em>, MTGO provides <strong>gameplay automation</strong>, meaning instead of arguing with your opponents, you can blame the computer for everything (and you will). At any point in time, MTGO can be described as a buggy but complete experience. For those who don’t mind the costs associated with a digital collection, there isn’t a more comprehensive platform for playing Magic online.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-online-duel-scene.webp?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="mtg online duel scene" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-online-duel-scene.webp?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-online-duel-scene.webp?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-online-duel-scene.webp?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-online-duel-scene.webp?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="5" data-current-count="5" data-injectable="false">Pros:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false"> <li>Complete card library</li> <li>Official Wizards of the Coast product</li> <li>Players own their cards as digital assets, can trade and sell them</li> <li>Can play every game mode</li> <li><strong>Automated actions</strong> simplify the gameplay process and takes the burden off of players</li> </ul> <p data-characters="5" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">Cons:</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true"> <li>Have to purchase or rent digital cards to use, can be very<strong> expensive</strong></li> <li>Client tends to lag in later stages of games</li> <li><strong>Many bugs</strong> with card interactions or with the client itself</li> <li>Client feels very <strong>outdated</strong></li> <li>Only in English</li> <li>Only for Windows</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="161" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, MTGO is only available in English and on Windows PCs. This severely harms the accessibility factor which lowers our overall rating for MTGO.&nbsp;</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">2. <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena"><em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em></a> </h3> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Since its launch in 2018, <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena </em>has been the reigning champ when it comes to the most streamlined MTG experience on the market. Arena is a vast improvement over Wizards of the Coast’s first child, MTGO. The UI has been modernized and the game rules engine was built from the ground up and is written in a way that allows for endless development.&nbsp;</p>

 <p data-characters="5" data-current-count="5" data-injectable="false">Cons:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="125" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Doesn’t contain the complete card library</strong>, only around 10,000 cards out of the 26,000+ (since Ixalan)&nbsp;</li> <li>Game modes such as Commander and Two-Headed Giant aren’t available</li> <li><strong>Can’t trade or sell cards. </strong>Cards can only be obtained through purchasing packs or utilizing a Wildcard system.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Even though it has a smaller card library and only five game modes (four of which are similar to but not entirely identical to paper MTG game modes), Arena earns its place as #2. For people new to Magic, Arena is the place to be. While other options mostly cater to people already familiar with MTG, Arena provides a tutorial, helpful tooltips, and beginner decks to introduce beginners to various mechanics.</p>
 <h3 id="h-1-spelltable" data-injectable="false">1. <a href="https://spelltable.wizards.com/"><em>SpellTable</em></a></h3> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false"><em>SpellTable</em> is the new kid on the block (or at least on this list). During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the future of paper MTG was unclear. <em>SpellTable</em>, previously known as <em>VirtualEDH</em>, was quickly developed as a way to keep the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-commander-in-magic-the-gathering-mtg/">Commander game mode </a>alive (since Commander had limited online support at the time).&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">Within months of its inception, <em>SpellTable</em> joined Wizards of the Coast and was able to expand support to all formats. <em>SpellTable</em> maintains the authentic paper MTG experience by utilizing a mobile phone or webcam and a good ol’ tabletop surface. Over time, the developers have enhanced the app with features that create a sort of “paper Magic 2.0” feeling.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re looking to make a little bit of money on the Marketboard or simply want some more storage space to avoid your inventory filling up in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you’re definitely going to need a retainer or multiple. Here’s how to get them, including how extra retainers work.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">Hiring a Retainer in <em>FFXIV</em> doesn’t only bring with it access to the Marketboard or extra storage – hiring a Retainer and training them up through ventures will allow them to head out on their own adventures, returning with materials or items which can then be used or sold. Don’t worry if this all sounds a little daunting, I can help you figure it out.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-hire-a-retainer-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How to hire a Retainer in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retainer-hire.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The Retainer Vocate options in Final Fantasy XIV" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retainer-hire.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retainer-hire.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retainer-hire.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/retainer-hire.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Before you can hire a retainer in FFXIV, you’ll need to have completed the level 17 MSQ quest “The Scions of the Seventh Dawn.” Then you’ll be able to pick up the side quest, “An Ill-Conceived Venture”, which unlocks Retainers. You must do this side quest in the same city state in which you started (Limsa Lominsa, Gridania or Ul’dah).&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">The quest is always given by an NPC called Troubled Adventurer and can be found in the following location in each state:</p>

 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve hired a retainer, you’ll be asked to design them using the Character Creation menu that you used to create your own character, then give them a name. Once this is done, you can access the Retainer service by interacting with any Summoning Bell.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="54" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">Once you do this, you’ll have the following options:</p> <figure data-found-rows="12" data-current-count="1100" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Option</strong></td><td><strong>What it means</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Entrust or withdraw items</td><td>Opens the retainers inventory, allowing you to transfer items from your own inventory for storage.

 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">Depending on the class or Job applied to the Retainer, the options given when assigning a venture may vary, but in general, there are three different types of venture to which a Retainer can be assigned:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false"> <li>Job specific (Hunting, Mining, Botany or Fishing)</li> <li>Field Exploration (Usually takes 18 hours, costs 2 Ventures)</li> <li>Quick exploration (after the Retainer reaches level 10, takes one hour, costs 2 Ventures)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="false">While Field Exploration ventures take a lot of time to complete, they’re excellent in terms of helping your Retainer level up as they reward far more experience. However, Quick Exploration ventures allow you to gain more items, including gear, much more quickly. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2Xql8H">Wrestling is a huge part of Mercedes Varnado’s career, having gained notoriety as Sasha Banks for the WWE before crossing over as Mercedes Moné for the AEW. But her fans may not realize she is also a huge <em>Sailor Moon</em> fan. The professional wrestler, who recently jumped to acting for <em>The Mandalorian</em>,  has a deep appreciation of the classic magical girl fantasy anime based on Naoko Takeuchi’s 1992 manga. Fans of both wrestling and anime know she donned a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SashaBanksWWE/comments/sm264k/sasha_banks_sailor_moon_attire_royal_rumble_2022/">Sailor Moon-inspired outfit</a> during the 2022 Royal Rumble. So it’s no surprise that she’s openly campaigned <a href="https://comicbook.com/anime/news/mercedes-varnado-sasha-banks-wwe-sailor-moon-live-action-movie-role/">to play Sailor Jupiter</a> in a live-action adaptation of Sailor Moon, if that ever happens.</p>
<p id="QUXy3C">Polygon caught up with Varnado during this year’s Crunchyroll Anime Awards, so naturally we had to ask: Given her love of the anime, which sailor scout does she think would make the best professional wrestler? </p>
<p id="edFpPc">“I would say Sailor Mercury,” Varnado told Polygon. “She’s such a badass; she has such a good attitude. I feel like Usagi would always be a little late to the ring, she would probably slip during her matches a little bit.”</p>

<p id="rSt7Au">Introduced in the eighth episode of Sailor Moon season 1, Sailor Mercury is the first Sailor Guardian that Usagi discovers and the first to join her cause fighting the forces of the nefarious Queen Beryl. Mercury’s true identity is Ami Mizuno, a shy bookworm with an abnormally high I.Q. who is known for her talent for mathematics and computers. Though initially timid, Ami goes on to become the chief strategist of the Sailor Scouts and has a positive, resilient attitude whenever faced with a challenge. </p>
<p id="WqEw15">The 1992 <em>Sailor Moon</em> anime would go on to run for a total of five seasons. The series’ combination of tokusatsu-inspired action and romantic melodrama is credited with revolutionizing the genre of Magical Girl anime, with the combined popularity of the anime’s assorted home releases and films contributing to the comic’s status as one of the best-selling Japanese manga of its time. In 2014, Sailor Moon was later adapted into another anime series called <em>Sailor Moon Crystal</em>, in commemoration of the series’ 20th anniversary. <em>Sailor Moon Crystal</em> is a reboot of the original anime that more closely follows the story of Usagi Tsukino and co. as it was told in Naoko Takeuchi’s original manga.</p>
<p id="BKiIGE">Aside from the series’ popularity, however, Sailor Moon has had a major impact on fans (particularly girls) who grew up watching the anime, and that includes Varnado herself. “I still go back and watch <em>Sailor Moon</em> to get my life lessons, to get my energy,” Varnado told Polygon. “So she still inspires me to this day.”</p>

<p data-characters="214" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re a fan of cozy farming games like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, a new one has hit the scene with an adorable and strangely familiar art style, a historic setting, and a deadly twist — <em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em> is a project created by&nbsp;Unwound Games and originally funded through backing on Kickstarter. The project reached its funding goal within 90 minutes of launching on the site, raising almost $30,000 USD in order to develop the game, which was released fully on Steam on April 29, with a price tag of $19.99 USD. It has gone on to have Very Positive reviews, though not without a few complaints, which I’ll get to later.</p>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">The art style of <em>Plum Grove</em> is a delightful reminder of <em>Paper Mario</em>, with 2D characters roaming around a 3D world containing 2D elements. It almost feels like a stage, with cardboard props that can be hidden behind or interacted with.</p> <figure data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-cemetery.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Cemetary, showing the art style of Echoes of the Plum Grove" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-cemetery.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-cemetery.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-cemetery.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-cemetery.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false"><em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em> is set in what I can only assume is colonial New England, judging by the fashion and the method by which you end up there in the first place. After a disastrous voyage in which everyone else perishes, your character washes up on the shores of <em>Plum Grove</em>, gains a farm and sets off to build relationships with locals, explore the world and progress the story.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="866" data-injectable="true">As for the deadly twist, unlike other games of this type, the villagers around you age, get sick, and even die after you’ve grown close to them. It’s kind of heartbreaking to get to know your neighbors, build relationships and then watch them get Smallpox and die, but you do get some closure by being able to attend their funerals. You can also kill your neighbors with items such as Death Cake, but I’m not sure why you’d want to. There are also ghosts who roam the land.</p>
 <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">If you don’t disable aging, your character will eventually die, so it’s a good job to head out in search of romance, marriage, and, eventually, a child. In fact, considering the fact that this is colonial New England and disease is rife, it might be a good idea to have a whole host of children because once you die, your story will continue through them. You can either experience pregnancy (as a male or female character, <em>Plum Grove</em> doesn’t want to strip that experience from anyone) or adopt children.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-settings.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Settings menu in Echoes of the Plum Grove" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-settings.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-settings.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-settings.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-settings.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">If you don’t want to face death during your playthrough, you have the ability to disable this (as well as disease) in the settings of the game, which is nice. <em>Echoes of the Plum Grove </em>also allows you to turn off the fishing minigame and disable things like hunger, energy and taxes. Yes, you have to pay taxes in <em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">As with other cozy farming games, such as Stardew Valley, Echoes of the Plum Grove has its own events calendar, including events such as a Bake Off and a fishing festival. Speaking of fishing, the minigame is actually vaguely fun, something which shocked me as a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/youll-never-hear-me-admit-it-but-i-enjoy-fishing-in-stardew-valley/">long-time fishing minigame hater</a>. Upon hooking a fish, you just need to follow a path using your mouse until you catch up to the fish creating the path. Again, if you don’t want to do this, you can turn the minigame off in the settings and simply catch anything you hook, but where’s the fun in that?</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-events.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="Events calendar in Echoes of the Plum Grove" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-events.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-events.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-events.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-events.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="743" data-injectable="true">There are some complaints that hold weight from players. There aren’t a lot of options when it comes to character creation, but once you’ve begun to play, you can visit the tailor’s shop to expand your wardrobe. The tools are flimsy at best and repairing them is not only expensive but time-consuming. You can’t repair them yourself, so your only option is the Blacksmith in town, who takes a whole in-game day to fix anything.</p>
 <p data-characters="551" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">The biggest complaint that players have so far, myself included, is how <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197969286163/recommended/1536090/">grind-centric</a> <em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em> is. You don’t get an axe to begin with, though you can purchase one from the Blacksmith, so the only initial way to get wood is by shaking trees around the map, of which there aren’t many. Despite this, recipes call for a staggering amount of resources. The main story can also only be progressed with a rather large stockpile of wood, as well, so you’re going to have to make a choice between crafting and actually progressing.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-hag.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The hag in Echoes of the Plum Grove" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-hag.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-hag.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-hag.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/plum-grove-hag.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="773" data-injectable="false">With that said, there are a lot of things to enjoy about <em>Echoes of the Plum Grove</em>. The locals are interesting, especially the local hag who quests you with insulting 20 people. She’s my favorite. You can get married, have children and forge a lineage through them. You get to explore not only the living world but also a crypt filled with ghosts who want to pass on to the other side. If you’re in a cozy game lull and don’t mind a grind, <em>Plum Grove </em>is a good option.</p>

<p data-characters="241" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Stardew Valley </em>is filled with quests to complete and secrets to find, some of which unlock new areas to explore. One of these new areas, the Witch’s Swamp, not only unlocks new sights but also new features. Here’s how to unlock it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Before you can trigger the quest that unlocks the Witch’s Swamp, you’ll need to have either completed the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/stardew-valley-community-center-guide/">Community Center bundles</a> or the Joja Warehouse tasks. Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to wait for a cutscene in the Mountains to play one night after you retire to bed.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-dark-talisman-in-stardew-valley" data-injectable="false">How to complete Dark Talisman in <em>Stardew Valley</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wizard.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The Wizard in Stardew Valley" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wizard.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wizard.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wizard.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wizard.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">After the Mountain cutscene, you’ll receive a letter from the Wizard in the mail. His ex-wife, also known as the Witch, has some magic ink in her house that needs to be retrieved. Unfortunately, you can’t just rock up to the Witch’s Hut and ask for it back – you need to find the Dark Talisman first, which will grant you access to the Swamp.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">To complete the Dark Talisman, you’ll need to first talk to Krobus. He can unlock a door within the Sewers that leads to the Mutant Bug Lair. Head inside, and you’ll find the Dark Talisman after battling through, as the name suggests, some mutant bugs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve got the Dark Talisman, head north to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-does-a-train-is-passing-through-mean-in-stardew-valley/">Railroad area</a> and find the cave in the top right corner. You’ll be able to place the Talisman on the artifact blocking the entrance and proceed through the cave.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">Make sure to take some Void Mayonnaise with you when you enter the Swamp. You’ll need to give it to the Witch’s Henchman, completing another quest called Goblin Problem and allowing you further into the Swamp. Head into the Witch’s Hut and you’ll find the magic ink on a table, which you can pick up and return to the Wizard to complete Dark Talisman.</p>

There are a couple of fish there, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-the-movie-theater-in-stardew-valley/">Void Salmon</a> and Catfish. Void Salmon don’t spawn anywhere else, and Catfish only appear on rainy days.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">The main draw of the Witch’s Swamp, though, is the Witch’s Hut itself. Inside, you’ll find three different shrines, all of which are useful in a different way and need a specific offering to use:</p> <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="false"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Shrine</strong></td><td><strong>Effect</strong></td><td><strong>Required offering</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Dark Shrine of Memory</td><td>Erases the memory of all past <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-bachelor-and-bachelorette-best-and-worst-gifts-in-stardew-valley/">spouses</a> (including Krobus), allowing you to build relationships with them again.</td><td>30,000 Gold</td></tr><tr><td>Dark Shrine of Selfishness</td><td>Turns any existing children into doves, permanently removing them from a playthrough</td><td>1 <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-prismatic-shard-in-stardew-valley/">Prismatic Shard</a></td></tr><tr><td>Dark Shrine of Night Terrors</td><td>You can use this shrine to toggle monsters appearing on your farm at night on and off.

Gamma comes courtesy of developer ZodTTD, which has been creating emulators for the iPhone since the earliest days of third-party iOS apps.</p><p>The app has both iPhone and iPad versions with support for Bluetooth controllers and keyboards, as well as customizable on-screen controller skins. It uses Google Drive and Dropbox syncing for backing up your game files and save states (those are the snapshots you can save at any time and reload, a little like pausing your game — great for old-school games that don’t let you save any time you want). Like the Delta emulator that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150467/delta-emulator-apple-app-voice-notes-ai-vergecast">ruled the App Store’s top free apps list for weeks</a> before being <a

will.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Gamma</cite></p></div></div><p>Thankfully, Gamma doesn’t require you to go find any BIOS files to run PS1 games. That said, I had trouble running the first two games I tried — <em>NASCAR 98</em> and <em>Shrek Treasure Hunt. </em>But that may have just been the game files I was using, as I could run <em>Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee</em> just fine. Third time’s the charm, right? </p><p>According to Gamma’s App Store page, it collects identifiers that can be used to track you, and may collect location and usage data. For what it’s worth, the app didn’t trigger a location data access request for me, nor did it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data">prompt me for tracking permission</a> (though it did do so for my colleague, Sean Hollister).</p><p>Benjamin Stark, aka ZodTTD, has been around the block. Stark pointed out to <em>The Verge</em> via email that Delta developer Riley Testut’s first iOS emulator, GBA4iOS, borrowed code from an emulator Stark had made called gpSPhone (something Testut <a href="https://rileytestut.com/blog/2013/08/06/the-biggest-beta-test-in-ios-history/">wrote about in 2013</a>). But even that app, Stark said, was based (with permission, he added) on gpSP, an Android emulator created by a developer called Exophase. </p><p>That tradition continues with Gamma, which Testut told <em>The Verge</em> via email is “based off Delta’s codebase (excluding the actual PSX core),” adding that “ZodTTD has my full permission to do that.” Testut said Stark is “the reason I started developing emulators in the first place.”</p><div><p>Stark also developed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-05-30-turbografx-16-emulation-hits-the-iphone.html">TurboGrafx-16</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-12-23-somewhat-playable-n64-emulator-released-for-jailbroken-iphones.html">N64 emulators</a> for the iPhone in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Later, he had a run-in with Google when the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-03-30-android-playstation-emulator-psx4droid-pulled-from-market-finge.html">pulled his app PSX4Droid</a>, also a PS1 emulator, from the Android Market in 2011, at a time when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-05-29-android-markets-most-popular-emulators-disappear-without-a-trac.html">Google was removing</a> many of the most popular emulators from the online store. He <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-04-07-zodttd-makes-psx4droid-3-0-free-claims-google-booted-him-from-a.html">later made the emulator freely available</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-04-08-playstation-emulator-for-android-goes-free-and-open-source.html">open-sourced the code</a>. </p></div><p><em><strong>Update May 12th, 11:36AM ET: </strong>Added additional context and details shared by Gamma developer Benjamin Stark.</em></p><p><em><strong>Update May 12th, 2:10PM ET: </strong>Added comment from Delta developer Riley Testut.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="195" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There’s a rumor swirling about the next great LEGO game. And if true, it’s going to be a massive Sony Playstation collaboration with one of the company’s newest key franchises. </p> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">After a leaker claimed on Twitter that a new LEGO x Sony collaboration was in the works, industry insider Tom Henderson joined in on the tease before just laying all the cards out on the table, identifying the <em>Horizon </em>franchise as the candidate. </p> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm not particularly fond of the "I know something, and you don't" obligatory vague insider BS. But from what I know, there's a LEGO Horizon trailer that's ready to go. </p><p>It also suggests that the rumors of a showcase soon are accurate.</p></div>— Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1789329523948810726?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote>  <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">“I’m not particularly fond of the ‘I know something, and you don’t’ obligatory vague insider BS.” <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1789329523948810726?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1789329523948810726%7Ctwgr%5E9d088063ec918680bcd7742c4b4fad3b478b52b5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.destructoid.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D510778action%3Dedit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Henderson said on Twitter</a>. “But from what I know, there’s a LEGO Horizon trailer that’s ready to go.”</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">If true, <em>LEGO Horizon</em> would be the first new LEGO game since 2022’s <em>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em>, unless you count last year’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/lego-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Fortnite</a></em> expansion. And though it sounds unusual, <em>Horizon</em> does fit the LEGO mold of making games based on hit franchises, like <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>Marvel Super Heroes</em>. </p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true"><em>Horizon</em> is also one of the few Sony franchises to have a physical LEGO collaboration already, with <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/horizon-forbidden-west-tallneck-76989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a genuinely impressive 1200+ piece Tallneck LEGO set</a> seeing release in 2022 (it was discontinued at the end of 2023, though, so good luck finding one). </p>
 <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">The <em>Horizon</em> franchise has quietly become a Sony fan-favorite. Both <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em> and <em>Horizon: Forbidden West</em> became blockbuster hits despite launching alongside other massive titles that took up all the air in the room. </p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">Horizon is also a franchise that has not been afraid to spread its wings, so to speak. A spin-off game, <em>Horizon: Call of the Mountain</em>, served as the flagship title for the PS VR2, and the franchise’s story has continued in a series of comic books. There’s a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-announces-horizon-zero-dawn-series-netflix-among-other-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action Horizon television series</a> in development for Netflix. </p>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">This also adds more fuel to the ongoing rumors that a Sony showcase is imminent. Though not confirmed by Sony yet, many insiders have pointed to May 2024 as a target window for the next event, though it’s not yet clear if that would be a Showcase or State of Play event. </p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="false"><em>Horizon: Forbidden West</em> is available now on PS5 and Steam, and is honestly a no-brainer if you’re looking for a richly engaging action RPG to play this weekend. We <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave the original console release an 8.5</a> back in 2022. </p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is celebrating its one-year anniversary today, May 12, 2024. Below, we look at how its playful sense of experimentation is still leading to new discoveries.</em></p><p dir="ltr">There is no single file for "wagon noise" within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. At no point in your travels throughout Hyrule will you hear a single track that was meant to replicate the sound of creaking wood moving along a dirt path. That's because Tears of the Kingdom's audio system is designed to operate just like its complex physics system. Sounds that happen naturally in the world--wheels turning and hooves stomping, for example--come together just like the wheels and cart themselves. They create a harmonious sound that is made up as you play.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a charming example that highlights what makes pretty much everything within Tears of the Kingdom fantastic. Major elements of the game, from moment-to-moment exploration to the clever physics-based crafting system, encourages player-experimentation and provides an amount of freedom that's literally sky-high. For much of their adventure, players make things up as they go.</p><p dir="ltr">At first, Tears of the Kingdom may have felt less impressive after its predecessor, Breath of the Wild, inspired awe from players. However, the ingenuity of Tears of the Kingdom's mechanics shined beyond that first impression and continues to show how deep the game's possibilities are a year after its release. It's something that even its developers have a hard time believing.</p><p dir="ltr">"When I first saw the prototype, I thought this was going to be a great game, but I also knew: This was going to be very, very difficult," said Tears of the Kingdom lead physics engineer Takahiro Takayama, speaking at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco earlier this year. "I said to myself: Are we really doing this? Development is going to be chaos. The more I thought, the more I worried. I realized that sometimes, it's important to have the courage to push forward." Takayama then showed a montage of chaotically buggy clips from Tears of the Kingdom's early development. "As expected, the world fell apart."</p><p dir="ltr">Players have tried to manipulate every aspect of Tears of the Kingdom, whether it be to solve a puzzle, defeat an enemy, or create something absolutely beautiful.</p><p dir="ltr">Take Link's customizable home near Tarrey Town, for example. Players have the freedom to place sections of the house, including water features, various rooms, and stairs, in whatever manner they please. People have created symmetrical masterpieces and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/1bqs3mk/here_is_my_house/" rel="nofollow ">modern marvels</a> that feel straight out of contemporary Los Angeles. That's just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZj7utSClLo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GZj7utSClLo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Attach a few stone slabs together to create makeshift scaffolding and suddenly you have a way to make one of Hyrule's only floating houses. After a bit of construction and plenty of Ascension use, Link's house will literally sit in the sky, giving you an unobscured view of everything Tarrey Town has to offer.</p><p dir="ltr">It's such a small segment of Tears of the Kingdom – all you do with your house is store weapons, horses, and take the occasional nap, anyways – but players have experimented with the entire Zonai device catalog in order to see what was possible with Link's abode.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the first methods involved using Zonai rockets and hover stones to shoot Link's house into the sky and then keep it in place by activating the stones. Players found that ending the construction phase of setting up your home left the house in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">It goes without saying that Zonai device experimentation is at the core of Tears of the Kingdom, but the structure of the shrine system puts those devices centerstage. And players' thirst for experimentation is still leading to new discoveries. It was only one month ago that a player used one of the tricks in the book: If all else fails, blow it up.</p><p dir="ltr">Standing on a floating island adjacent to the shrine they need to take the gem to, they attach a bomb, a rocket, and a prayer to the gem before using the Ultrahand to stand the contraption upright. They launched the rocket and activated the bomb's fuse at the same time, hoping it would change the trajectory of the gem mid-flight. It couldn't have worked better.</p><p dir="ltr">The gem flew up with the rocket before being thrown towards the shrine by the bomb's explosion. A moment passed before the game automatically transported them to the shrine after the gem landed exactly where it needed to, in front of the shrine's entrance. It was one of those moments that only feels possible in Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">"I swear, it was my first try," Redditor liftingrussian wrote. "I was just curious as to whether it would do anything."</p><p dir="ltr">That curiosity is what Nintendo's game so expertly engenders. While Tears of the Kingdom has a structured narrative, the meat of the experience is finding out what's possible. Can you make a massive bridge of ice blocks by combining this longsword with a Frost Gleeok Horn? Absolutely. Can you glue seven gliders together and still fly them across the sky? Hard to say, but it's worth a try.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo aimed to create multiplicative gameplay with Tears of the Kingdom, which it boils down to "sticking two things together to make something new." It doesn't matter what those two things are--or even if it's 12 things--you'll always find something entertaining that will push your experience forward when you're experimenting with Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Players were finding new ways to take out Guardians in Breath of the Wild with amazing trickshots years after it initially launched. We will surely see players come up with new contraptions, new discoveries, and, above all, new experiences long past this first year of Tears of the Kingdom.</p>

Over the years, games that exist only in audio have taken players into entirely new worlds in which there’s nothing to see and still everything to do. These games have huge accessibility implications, allowing people who can’t see to play an equally fun, equally immersive game with their other senses. And when all you have is sound, there’s actually even more you can do to make your game great.</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a><em>,</em> we explore the history of audio-only games with <a href="https://www.paulbennun.com/">Paul Bennun</a>, who has been in this space longer than most. Years ago, Bennun and his team at Somethin’ Else made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/31/5048298/papa-sangre-ii-is-a-terrifying-world-made-of-sound">a series of games called <em>Papa Sangre</em></a> that were among the most innovative and most popular games of their kind. He explains what makes an audio game work, why the iPhone 4 was such a crucial technological achievement for these games, and more.</p><p>Bennun also makes the case that, right now, even in this ultra-visual time, is the perfect time for a rebirth of audio games. He points to AirPods and other spatial audio headphones along with devices like the Vision Pro, advances in location tracking, and improvements in multiplayer gaming as reasons to think that audio-first games could be a huge hit now. It even sounds a bit like Bennun might have a game in the works, but he won’t tell us about that.</p><p>If you want to know more about the topics we cover in this episode, here are a few links to get you started:</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24153892/verizon-tmobile-att-unlimited-plan-free-phone-offers-fine"><h2>Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile’s ‘unlimited’ plans just got a $10M slap on the wrist</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153472/apple-ipad-pro-animal-well-final-cut-camera-installer-newsletter"><h2>The new iPad Pro looks like a winner</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152949/dji-osmo-pocket-3-opinion"><h2>The DJI Pocket 3 is almost everything I wanted my iPhone camera to be</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24153097/ipad-pro-2024-apple-max-disney-bundle-foxconn-vergecast"><h2>The beginning and end of the iPad</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22846456/onlyfans-management-creators-ghostwriting-catfishing-unruly-agency"><h2>OnlyFans management firm accused of having employees talk to fans as influencers</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="cUe8vi">“Cozy games” are a huge phenomenon right now, because at the end of the day, who doesn’t like being cozy? While some games focus on visceral combat or thrilling narratives, cozy games often focus on creating a comfortable or fulfilling place for players to hang out. Instead of swinging a sword or slaying foes, players can focus on creating the perfect flower bed, or befriending the kind golem next door.</p>
<p id="ovVWUn">Coziness is still a subjective experience, and the finer differences in a game can make or break immersion. Some people love to fish, whereas I find it to be one of the most stressful things a game can include. We’ve rounded up a list of the coziest games around beyond <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24115870/stardew-valley-8-years-later-concernedape"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22783019/animal-crossing-new-horizons-final-review"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a><em> </em>(we figured you’ve played those, if you’re here), so you can pick your particular flavor of comfort. If you’re looking to relax, unwinding with any of these games is a fine choice.</p>

<p id="VfsUQ9"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071913/a-little-to-the-left-xbox-game-pass-organization-game"><em>A Little to the Left</em></a> is a puzzle game about organizing household items. It’s inherently satisfying while also being low-stakes, making it a perfect game to play when you’re looking for something cozy. The puzzles are stuff like organizing tools, removing labels from fruits, and stacking books — all while keeping an eye on a mischievous cat doing cat things. —<em>Nicole Carpenter</em></p>

<p id="uV7PqO">Despite its name being an accurate description of its offering — it clocks in at just a few hours before the credits roll — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/14/20864555/a-short-hike-how-to-do-nothing-impressions"><em>A Short Hike</em></a> stands as tall as the mountain you’re summiting in the pantheon of cozy gaming classics. This 2017 charmer from developer Adam Robinson-Yu helped ignite the cozy game craze and, for me at least, really “peaked” (haha) my interest in shorter games as a format. You play as a young bird on summer vacation on an island, tasked with reaching the summit to take an important phone call. Over the course of your short hike, you’ll meet friends, take on quests, and generally just <em>hang out</em>. Rendered in big chunky pixels and viewed from an isometric camera, <em>A Short Hike</em> leaves a dreamlike impression of long summer days, childhood anxieties, and the thrill of autonomy. My only criticism is that, like all core memories, I can’t go back and experience it anew. —<em>Chris Grant</em></p>

<p id="SBcxEN">Cozy gaming always includes farming sims, and there are very many out there (most chasing the glory that is <em>Stardew Valley</em>). <em>Coral Island</em> doesn’t seek to reinvent the formula, but expands it. The basic gameplay mechanics are familiar: you farm, you fish, you mine. But you also explore an underwater kingdom full of merfolk and the town events all have a Southeast Asian flair to them, like mooncakes at the Harvest Festival. Also, there are so many gorgeous, datable characters. —<em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="xLWTbE"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Nintendo Switch, Windows PC</p>
<p id="sZS6iM">“Dorfromantik” is a German word, expressing a kind of aching nostalgia for the countryside, and Toukana Interactive’s game is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23049119/dorfromantik-review-1-0-update">like a peaced-out <em>Catan</em></a> — a game about placing hexagonal tiles with no goal other than to make pretty maps of forests, winding rivers, jolly towns, and patchwork fields. There’s no economy or tech tree to worry about, no population making demands of you; it’s just you, searching for harmony in the growing landscape. But as aimlessly cozy as that sounds, and as tasteful as the pastel shades of its seasonal changes are, <em>Dorfromantik </em>is an exquisite, hard-edged design that blends the best of strategy and puzzle gaming, and finds a perfect balance between mental challenge and mindfulness. —<em>Oli Welsh</em></p>

<p id="3VvFBr">If you like your coziness with a little bit of horror, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23669611/dredge-review-fishing-game-horror"><em>Dredge</em></a> is for you. The fishing mechanic is a bit of a rhythm game, and generally satisfying when you reel up the fish you want. You play as a fisherman exploring a mysterious cluster of islands. It seems pretty straightforward during the day, but when night falls, creepier and creepier things begin to happen. There are sea monsters, a strange occultist, and corrupted fish. Each area of the map offers different challenges, like navigating windy mangroves and speeding your boat away from vicious creatures, and while each is super beautiful, there’s also an eerie undertone to it all… But fishing is <em>so</em> relaxing! I understand why grandpas love it so much. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="sVKu0R">I suppose you could describe <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23682092/legend-zelda-likes-breath-of-wild-wind-waker-lil-gator-game-review"><em>Lil Gator Game</em></a> as Baby’s First Zelda, except I’m the baby and I’ve (exhaustively) played every Zelda game since 1986. But <em>Lil Gator Game</em> hits different, unencumbered by the very complexity that makes a Zelda game so satisfying. In its place is a pared down, speedrun version: a concentrated, potent play cocktail that finds you, the titular little gator, in the woods with friends trying to drum up some adventure… if only to relive your memories of playing with your big sister, home from school and too busy to play. This framing — of nostalgia and play — is a perfect mirror for the emotions you’re likely to run through as you explore the island, smash cardboard “enemies,” and take on quests for your friends. Very few games have captured this feeling of play for me, which makes <em>Lil Gator Game</em> an easy recommendation, and a game I return to more often than you’d think. —<em>CG</em></p>

<p id="0cGhGh"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23871826/palia-open-beta-review-in-progress"><em>Palia</em></a> is a game in which humanity has re-emerged into a mysterious and magical world. Each player is given their own homestead near Kilima Valley, a bustling village full of friendly elves and odd golems. As the player settles into their new home, they pick up a variety of skills: bug catching, hunting, gardening, furniture building, cooking, and foraging. It’s easy to fall into a comfortable rhythm with <em>Palia:</em> exploring the world by day and building up the homestead by night.</p>
<p id="lsM9QO">One of <em>Palia</em>’s biggest strengths is developer Singularity 6’s regular update schedule. Since launch, the developer has added a new villager, a regular festival, elemental temples, flowers, and more. It feels like the world is evolving in response to all the humans showing up. While I enjoy the game for its cozy vibes, I also get the sense that Singularity 6 is building up to something bigger, and it’s very cool to see these new changes. —<em>Cass Marshall</em></p>

<p id="CZIDJy"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24093693/sea-of-thieves-new-players-2024-updates-rare"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a> is a pirate sandbox defined by the possibility of chaos. Not only do players have to worry about skeletons and sea creatures, but other pirate ships mark a significant threat. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23884469/sea-of-thieves-safer-seas-pve-only-server-season-10">The new Safer Seas mode</a> finally offers a much less stressful <em>Sea of Thieves</em> experience. Safer Seas disables PvP, allowing the player to explore at their own pace. While some regions are inherently dangerous, others are perfectly serene.</p>
<p id="89dKRv">I have rarely felt more relaxed than when I set out on a sloop, listening to the sounds of the ocean. <em>Sea of Thieves</em> has some of the best sound design I’ve ever heard, and it’s soothing to listen to the waves and the creaking of the ship. You can also play the hurdy gurdy with your pals, go fishing, and explore a bunch of gorgeous environments. If you’ve ever been turned off on <em>Sea of Thieves</em> due to the betrayal and battles on the high seas, the Safer Seas update should be right up your alley. —<em>CM</em></p>

<p id="wVU5TI">You might have heard of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/8/18/21373518/spiritfarer-review-release-date-switch-pc-ps4-xbox-one-thunder-lotus"><em>Spiritfarer</em></a><em> </em>before, the game that’s self-described as “a cozy management game about dying.” You might be wondering, <em>How could a game about death be cozy? Spiritfarer</em> takes the topic head-on and confronts fear and the unknown as a way to comfort friends whose time it is to move on. You do this by taking care of them, building up a boat in ways that make everyone comfortable. These acts of labor and kindness are so touching; while it may be emotional, it’s still got a lot of warm feelings. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="uVINnA">Like <em>Dredge</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22935956/strange-horticulture-plant-shop-review-impressions"><em>Strange Horticulture</em></a><em> </em>offers a spooky edge to the cozy gaming experience. It’s less of an adrenaline rush, though, and instead the sinister feeling slowly builds up as you uncover more and more. You play as the owner of a plant shop, and identify plants in your care, which are often medicinal in property. Customers come to you for help, and you must figure out which plant they need. It all takes place within your shop, with outside excursions detailed in text. It’s a cozy organizing game that escalates gradually into something more macabre. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="UH5SVy"><em>Summerhouse </em>has no rules. You simply build, using a bunch of pre-made, pixelated pieces created by developer Friedemann. You can build big houses or little houses, ones in the country or cityside. Every so often, when placing a door or window or roof, you’ll unlock a character — maybe a dog hanging out by a stoop, or a grandma sitting out front of a café. What makes <em>Summerhouse</em> truly charming is that everything is designed to look lived-in, real; these are no McMansions or prefabricated houses. <em>Summerhouse</em>’s sounds are delightful, too. The satisfying snap of clicking a window into place is made all the sweeter with birdsong in the background. —<em>NC</em></p>

<p id="MXkNNN"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24024185/unpacking-dark-star-mode-developer-interview"><em>Unpacking</em></a> follows one young woman’s life through all the places she lives and the objects she owns. You unpack various boxes containing all her items and place them around her living spaces, from her childhood bedroom to her first apartment after college. It’s methodical to fit all these objects in places, and also offers a little bit of freedom and creativity in how you place them (for instance, I always <em>always</em> put her stuffed animals on the bed). The brilliance of <em>Unpacking</em> is how it tells a story without any dialogue or seen characters, and only through these objects and where you’re able to place them. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="xXIQhI">Is there anything more cozy than walking into a kitchen where something fragrant is cooking? <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23811258/venba-review-cooking-game-ps5-xbox-switch"><em>Venba</em></a> is a narrative cooking game that takes the nostalgia for food and uses it to tell a story about a family that immigrated from India to Canada in the 1980s. It’s a moving story about family and food that uses cooking mechanics to explore love and loss. —<em>NC </em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="254" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While we wait (and wait and wait and wait) for Bethesda to say literally anything about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-whats-happening-with-the-skyrim-follow-up/">what’s happening with <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em></a>, let’s talk about <em>Skyrim</em>. That should kill a bit more time. Specifically, let’s talk about modding <em>Skyrim</em>.</p> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Since time immemorial (well, 2011), <em>TES5</em> fans have been modifying the game, improving it several folds, adding new content, fixing bugs…just generally getting as much life out of the ol’ beast as they can. It’s almost as if some people took one look at <em>Skyrim</em> in its vanilla form and went, “nah, mate.”</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">Far be it from me to tell you there are countless ways to tinker with this aging epic RPG. But if you’re new to playing, or you just want a quick rundown on some of the better mods out there, I’ve cobbled together a list of what I feel are some pretty essential ones. You may agree with this list. You may not. I will be answering no questions.</p>
 <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="104" data-injectable="false"><strong>NOTE: I will attempt to provide links to mods that are for the Special Edition of <em>Skyrim</em> where possible.</strong></p> <h2 id="h-skyrim-script-extender" data-injectable="false">Skyrim Script Extender</h2> <figure data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-script-extender-vortex.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Skyrim Script Extender: the SKSE logo next to an orange arrow pointing at the Vortex logo." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-script-extender-vortex.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-script-extender-vortex.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-script-extender-vortex.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-script-extender-vortex.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">When I talk about “essential mods,” you can probably interpret that as just meaning a “generally solid modification that many players highly recommend.” A lot of it will come down to personal preference and how you want to alter the game.</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">However, with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyrim Script Extender</a> (SKSE for short), this one is pretty vital. If you ask people in the community – especially the PC community – what to install first when it comes to modding <em>Skyrim</em>, this will likely be your first port of call.</p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">As the description itself says: this is a tool “used by many <em>Skyrim</em> mods that expands scripting capabilities and adds additional functionality to the game.” You’d be pretty lost without it. The version linked here has already been downloaded over 1.4 million times, and it was only uploaded in 2019.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Unofficial Skyrim Patch</h2> <figure data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-forge.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Screenshot from Skyrim showing a forge next to a trough of clear water." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-forge.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-forge.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-forge.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-forge.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Arthmoor/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">Bethesda games have bugs. The sun is a large ball of burning gas. Everyone knows the uncomfortable sensation of having one shoe tied slightly tighter than the other. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/">Microsoft is pure evil</a>. Oh, sorry. I thought I was just listing things that can be filed under “the bleeding obvious.”</p> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">Yes, <em>Skyrim</em> has been laden with glitches and issues since the day it landed in video game stores (remember them?) While over the years, the developer has attempted to quash some of the major ones, there are still plenty of bugs that exist, even in the Anniversary Edition which came out some tens after the vanilla release.</p>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">That’s where the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unofficial Skyrim Patch</a> comes into play. It is, as the name suggests, an unofficial mod for the game with an eventual goal of fixing every single bug <em>TES5</em> has, and we all know that is quite the mammoth task. The most recent version was uploaded on April 18, which means the team is still hard at work. This is another must.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">SkyUI</h2> <figure data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-skyui.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="The original Skyrim user interface on the left and the more comprehensive SkyUI version on the right." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-skyui.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-skyui.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-skyui.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-skyui.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via schlangster/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">As gorgeous as <em>Skyrim</em> is (or was) when it first came out, there were some criticisms aimed at the game’s standard user interface. While I personally didn’t have much of a problem with it, I could see why it wasn’t everyone’s favorite.</p> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">If you’ve played the game, you’ll surely have your own opinion about it. Which is why we have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SkyUI</a>. This is described as an “elegant, PC-friendly interface mod with many advanced features.” Even from the single image above, you can see the differences between the vanilla version and the mod.</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Is it fair to say it’s more “intuitive?” I’m bold enough to go along with that. While there hasn’t been an update for SkyUI since 2017, Nexus Mods registers over 4.8 million downloads, so they must be doing something right.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Open Cities</h2> <figure data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-windhelm-open-cities-mod.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Skyrim: a city gate open, showing the inside of Windhelm." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-windhelm-open-cities-mod.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-windhelm-open-cities-mod.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-windhelm-open-cities-mod.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-windhelm-open-cities-mod.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Arthmoor/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">A game like <em>Skyrim</em> consistently delivers and entertains, largely because of its immersive quality. Forget the fact that it’s now an older game. When it dropped all those years ago, it was a triumph. It drew people in with its utter splendor, enormous world, and cast of characters that were believable (well as believable as role-playing characters living in a fantasy world full of dragons can be).</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">However, some of that immersion does fall to the wayside slightly when you enter a new city, like Whiterun. Upon opening the main gate, you find yourself confronted with a black loading screen. It’s understandable. Bethesda couldn’t have put all the interior aspects of a city within the main world.</p> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true">However, someone did just that. From the same modder that brought us the Unofficial Patch, we have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87707?tab=images" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Cities Skyrim</a>. This is a mod that fluidly blends the game’s city limits to whatever’s outside its walls. The loading screens are now gone, which keeps you immersed. Plus, it means you can now ride your horse straight into places like Riften. That can only be a plus.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Alternative Start</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Skyrim: the horse and cart ride into Helgen at the start of the game." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Arthmoor/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">When I first got the game in 2011, I was enthralled by the opening. A few days later, a friend came round because they wanted to see it, so I booted the game up, loaded a new save, and proceeded to go through the intro cut scene again. Then some time later, another friend wanted to see what all the fuss was about. By this point, my character’s head had been cut off enough times to satisfy a revolution.</p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">What I’m saying is, even before <em>Skyrim</em> had the long legacy it enjoys today, I had seen the opening section dozens of times. If you are a bit bored with that lengthy introduction, say hello to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alternative Start</a>. Oh look, it’s another mod by Arthmoor.</p> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">With this, you get to opt for a different beginning to your <em>Skyrim</em> playthrough. You can choose to be a hunter living in the woods, a vampire hiding in a cave, or maybe you’ve been shipwrecked. The good thing about this mod is it doesn’t just give you an alternative starting point, it changes things about your character and doesn’t immediately put you on the main quest path.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Helgen Reborn</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen-tower.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Skyrim: an image of the tower in a non-burned down version of Helgen." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen-tower.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen-tower.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen-tower.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skyrim-helgen-tower.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Mike Hancho/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">Speaking of that opening section, we don’t get to experience Helgen much before it’s terrorized by a dragon and left to burn in the ashes of its wake. It’s there and then, in the blink of an eye, it’s left in ruins as you run for your life and, presumably, bugger off to literally anywhere else.</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">With <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helgen Reborn</a>, the city gets a second chance. Modders Mike Hancho (aka Balok) didn’t just turn the opening location on its head by rebuilding it. No, they went above and beyond, bringing something that is more than just a surface restructuring.

Not just a facsimile of the world you walk around. It’s actually the real thing, just zoomed out immensely.

 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">However, it can always be better, and that’s what IcePenguin’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Quality World Map</a> does. With over three million downloads on Nexus Mods, it presents itself as the last word in <em>Skyrim</em> topography. Consisting of high-detailed textures, AQWM (as I’m taking to call it) is a tasty visual addition to your game. I’d say it pairs nicely with SkyUI as well.</p> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">Also, it doesn’t just have this 3D map, either. It comes in a vivid style and even a paper version, if you want something that’s perhaps a bit more <em>Lord of the Rings</em>-y.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The wait for Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been extremely long for fans, but it sounds like the end of the line is finally in sight, and it might have been worth it.</p>
<p>Just two months ago, Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-devs-pretty-confident-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the developers were confident the game would be launched in 2024. Today, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPtzkxO0Ges&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brief new episode of his Game Mess video series</a>, Grubb reiterated that idea while also adding that everyone (presumably at BioWare) is really happy with how it turned out now that it's almost done.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, this is one that I've mentioned before, is coming out this year. Will it be at the Summer Game Fest or around that time? Yeah, they've said that themselves over at EA. It still sounds like that game is coming out later this year, so where would they announce it other than Summer Game Fest? They could hold their own thing, but my expectation is they'll have - well, if they hold their own thing, I think it will be part of the Summer Game Fest orbit, so we should see that game at Summer Game Fest or around that time. And they should have all of the details for that thing because everyone seems really happy with that game; they're pretty pleased with how it turned out. The plan is to launch that this calendar year, so not EA's fiscal year, not before March 2025 or anything like that, this year. And I don't think you're going to have to wait too long after this thing gets announced to play it.</em></p>
<p>The next iteration in the Dragon Age fantasy RPG franchise has had a complicated gestating phase, to say the least. Originally, creative director Mike Laidlaw spearheaded a project codenamed Joplin that was supposed to deliver a smaller, more narrative focused Dragon Age set in the region of Tevinter. However, the project was canceled as it lacked the live service elements that EA wanted; this was before the release of Anthem. Laidlaw <a href="https://wccftech.com/mike-laidlaw-bioware-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left BioWare</a> as a result.</p>
<p>Another Dragon Age project got off the ground under Matthew Goldman <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with those live service elements</a>, but in early 2021, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-will-be-a-single-player-only-rpg-multiplayer-has-been-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that EA had been convinced by the success of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order of the commercial viability of single player games. As such, those live service elements were scrapped, and Dragon Age went back to being single player only.</p>
<p>In June 2022, BioWare finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-more-info-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> Dragon Age: Dreadwolf as the game's final title, which made perfect sense from a narrative standpoint to anyone who played the previous game and its post-launch DLCs. In October 2022, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-is-officially-in-alpha-playable-from-beginning-to-end/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it had reached the Alpha milestone, with the game playable from beginning to end. BioWare previously only had a few months from Alpha to launch to polish its games, whereas, with a likely Fall release window (which might drop near the 10-year anniversary from the launch of Inquisition), it will have been two years dedicated to making it shine.</p>
<p>We don't know much about the game except for a rumor that <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-wont-let-you-control-party-members-directly-according-to-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> direct control of party members (as usual for the franchise) might have been swapped for orders issued via a wheel, similar to Mass Effect. Regarding the available locales, BioWare revealed that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will allow players to explore much more of Thedas than in any previous entry, including Anderfels, Antiva, Rivain, and more.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will once again be powered by the Frostbite engine. It will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Battlestate Games has kickstarted a new event in Escape from Tarkov, basing the parameters of that event on community feedback obtained on social media platforms. In the last few days, the head of the studio at Battlestate, Nikita Buyanov, was fielding suggestions and ideas from the community that was so disappointed when BSG revealed recent controversial changes to the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-tarkov-event-is-an-experiment">New Tarkov Event Is An Experiment</h2>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1789584602551534007/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlestate Games wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As an experiment, we have removed the “Found in Raid” requirement for placing offers on the Flea Market for PvP and PvE modes. We will closely monitor player feedback during the event, and make additional balancing adjustments if necessary.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the most recent round of changes, which are live now in-game, Battlestate adjusted loot balancing (based on feedback) and increased the chance of rare loot spawning in certain areas. They’ve also tweaked inertia strength and boosted the overweight limit, allowing users to pick up more loot without suffering the consequences. </p>



<p>Further, BSG has boosted scav spawns on Interchange to make certain tasks easier, and adjusted the mechanics of the Flea Market to give players more ‘selling slots’. </p>



<p>Finally, The Lab is now free to enter, with BSG having removed the prerequisite that players have a Labs Keycard before they can get into this lucrative, intense map. </p>



<p>On social media channels, players have already responded positively to these changes, but many have recognised that this should be the standard and not a special, limited-time offering to the community.</p>

            <p><strong>Update 6pm</strong>: Netease has apologised for "inappropriate and misleading terms" in its content creator contract.</p>
<p>In a statement posted in Discord shortly after the contract began to make headlines, the Marvel Rivals Content Creator Team said it "sincerely apologised" for the "miscommunication and your unpleasant experiences".</p>
<p>"We are aware that there are inappropriate and misleading terms in the commitment regarding sharing non-disparagement content," the full statement said. "We sincerely apology [sic] for the miscommunication and your unpleasant experiences!</p>

Speaking of this, a suggestions form for Content Creator program is about to release in the [Discord] which open to all opinions. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!"</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it's not clear if previous signed contracts are now null and void, but NetEase says "all terms will go live only when both parties have discussed and have agreed" the terms.</p>
<p>In a statement to press, NetEase said: "The contract is a draft version aiming for long-term co-operation with the creators who are interested in Marvel Rivals. The development team hopes to have more meaningful and consistent feedback, suggestions, and criticisms through more in-depth cooperation."</p>
<p>Original story follows.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Original story, 1.50pm BST:</strong> Players and content creators have hit back at Marvel Rivals for a playtest terms of service contract that prohibits players from making "statements that are detrimental to the reputation of the game".</p>
<p>As shared by former professional eSports player and Twitch streamer Brandon "A_Seagull" Larned, the contract "signs away your right to negatively review the game".</p>
<figure><figcaption>Marvel Rivals announcement trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxoRfbyqGJ8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In section 2.1 of the agreement – subtitled "Non-Disparagement" – content creators are obliged to "agree not to make any public statements or engage in discussions that are detrimental to the reputation of the game".</p>
<p>This "includes but is not limited to", "making disparaging or satirical comments about any game-related material, such as game features, characters, or music", and "engaging in malicious comparisons with competitors or belittling the gameplay or differences of Marvel Rivals or providing subjective negative reviews of the game".</p> <div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Extremely disappointed in <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MarvelRivals</a>. </p><p>Multiple creators asked for key codes to gain access to the playtest and are asked to sign a contract.</p><p>The contract signs away your right to negatively review the game.</p><p>Many streamers have signed without reading just to play</p><p>Insanity. <a href="https://t.co/c11BUDyka9">pic.twitter.com/c11BUDyka9</a></p></div>— Brandon Larned (@A_Seagull) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Seagull/status/1789468582281400792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>As noted by Larned, "many streamers have signed [the contract] without reading just to play".</p>
<p>Interestingly, the FAQs published in the game's discord community says that there is "no NDA for our Closed Alpha Test" and players are "encouraged to share their experience and all types of content on all platforms".</p>
<p>A couple of players <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1193841000108531764/1202076175355355176/1239193021917036544">have also shared concerns about the terms of service</a> on the official Discord server, but as yet, there's been no response to their queries.</p> <div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yeah I tried making a point about it in their creators discord, they said they’d “revise” it but the actual issues haven’t been fixed. This is the type of contract people get PAID to sign, and it’s just for a game code. Not to mention if you break it they can claim damages 😭</p>— Joe (@hzjoe03) <a href="https://twitter.com/hzjoe03/status/1789621768748995053?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>Others on Twitter/X claim the developers agreed to "revise" the contract, but have seemingly yet to do so.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the hero team-based PvP shooter – which is published by NetEase Games – has yet to publicly comment on the matter. We've reached out to NetEase and will update if and when we hear more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-is-a-free-to-play-pvp-shooter-where-heroes-and-villains-fight-together-and-against-each-other">Marvel Rivals is an upcoming free-to-play, team-based PVP shooter</a> for PC with the backing of Chinese publishing giant NetEase.</p>
<p>Described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", Marvel Rivals will pit teams of six against each other as they fight it out over a variety of destructible environments with characters from across the Marvel universe. This includes the likes of Iron Man, Groot, Scarlet Witch and more.</p>

            <p>Steam representatives are informing some Helldivers 2 players that the game's publisher, Sony, pulled it from sale in regions where PSN is not available, not Steam itself.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Sony announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers 2 players on Steam would soon be required to link to a PSN account</a> for safety and security. It said this was always going to be a requirement for players on PC, but due to issues at launch, linking was made optional for a period.</p>
<p>The news was immediately met with intense backlash, which resulted in an influx of negative<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements"> reviews from Helldivers 2 players on Steam</a>. Many <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-players-secure-refunds-as-steam-waives-playtime-limit">asked for a refund</a> as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">Helldivers 2 was pulled from sale in 177 countries</a> where PSN is not available, eventually leading to Sony overturning plans to enforce mandatory PSN linking for Helldivers 2 players on Steam altogether.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cpdbdp/comment/l3k3ri2/">response</a>, a player was told that the game was pulled from "specific regions" "as decided by the publisher", and Steam did not know "when the game might be made available in those countries". Players were then invited to contact Sony themselves to "share [their] feedback" if they had any further questions.</p>
<p>The news should quell debates between players about whether it was Steam or Sony that had delisted the game in affected regions, but it's the latest in a bewildering and confusing list of missteps by Sony as it scrambles to mitigate the fallout.</p>
<p>As for why three additional regions have been added to the restriction, even though Sony has reversed the decision to compel players to connect to a PSN account? Apparently, that's to do with a similar delisting strategy for the upcoming Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut, for which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">Steam has taken the unprecedented action of auto-refunding players who bought it in countries where PSN isn't available</a>.</p>
<p>According to Helldivers 2 creative director and Arrowhead CEO, Johan Pilestedt, that was an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cpdbdp/comment/l3m4dn8/">"administrative error correction"</a>.</p>
<p>"So, to give an update on the three further country restrictions. It was an administrative error correction - they should have been part of the original restriction and it was noticed when the restriction was put in place for Tsushima," Pilestedt explained on Discord. "This was noticed and executed by Valve.</p>
<p>"While it doesn't look positive, it is not an indication of further restrictions. The conversation on region restrictions is still ongoing and is independent of this."</p>
<p>Pilestedt finished on saying that he had "no further information" but developer Arrowhead "still wants the game to be available everywhere".</p>

            <p>PlayStation has reportedly formed a new studio consisting of former Deviation Games devs.</p>
<p>Deviation Games' co-founder, Jason Blundell, is also rumoured to be part of the new studio.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As posted to the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit, former Deviation dev Michael Anthony wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-anthony-72495a183_hey-i-hear-that-a-lot-of-previous-deviation-activity-7190611686209249280-44lx">LinkedIn</a>: "Hey, I hear that a lot of previous Deviation Games employees have setup their own studio at Sony working on an undisclosed new IP.</p>
<p>"All the people I see working there that have signed up are top class developers and hope that you can create a top class new IP with your studio that hopefully gives you all the time you need to create a quality product and not have to deal with red tape from previous projects."</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1cpicr3/exdeviation_games_technical_director_says_that/">Ex-Deviation Games Technical Director says that former colleagues have set up a new internal Sony studio (Led by Jason Blundel, new IP)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Careless_Main3/">u/Careless_Main3</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></blockquote><p>As for Blundell's involvement? Whilst the details are unclear and still very much just speculation at this point, fans have cross-checked recent announcements and <a href="https://twitter.com/JCbackfire/status/1736852589927702938">found this one</a> from Deviation's former community manager, who said back in December that they were now working as a junior game designer for a PlayStation studio under Blundell.</p>
<p>As yet, there's been no official word from Sony about the rumoured new studio, but we'll let you know if and when that changes.</p>
<p>Deviation Games was formed in 2022 by ex-Treyarch and Call of Duty developers and led by Jason Blundell and Dave Anthony. Eighteen months later, however, Blundell departed Deviation, and the studio then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deviation-games-reportedly-lays-off-dozens-following-a-difficult-situation">laid off around 90 employees back in May 2023</a>, citing a "difficult situation" that "forced" the layoffs. In March 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-studio-deviation-games-has-closed-down">the studio was shuttered completely</a>.</p>
<p>The number of layoffs in 2024 across the whole games industry is estimated to be over 9500 so far. The total number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-cant-talk-about-2023-in-games-without-talking-about-layoffs">layoffs in 2023</a> is thought to be around 10,500, and 8,500 jobs were lost in 2022. Chris Dring, head of GamesIndustry.biz, recently explored <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">why there are so many layoffs in the video games industry</a> right now.</p>

            <p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson has revealed plans to "harness the power" of its game communities and use advertising as a "meaningful driver of growth" for the company.</p>
<p>In EA's latest financial <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Q4-FY24-Transcript-FINAL.pdf">report</a>, Wilson fielded comments from investors, advising that whilst the megacorp needs to be "very thoughtful about advertising", given "many, many billions of hours" are spent on its games, "advertising has an opportunity to be a meaningful driver of growth for [EA]".</p>
<figure><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"To answer your question on advertising broadly, again, I think it's still early on that front," Wilson said. "And we have looked over the course of our history to be very thoughtful about advertising in the context of our play experiences.</p>
<p>"But again, as we think about the many, many billions of hours spent, both playing, creating, watching and connecting and where much of that engagement happens to be on the bounds of a traditional game experience, our expectation is that advertising has an opportunity to be a meaningful driver of growth for us.</p>
<p>"We'll be very thoughtful as we move into that, but we have teams internally in the company right now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of our game experiences," Wilson added. "But more importantly, as we start to build community and harness the power of community beyond the bounds of our games, how do we think about advertising as a growth driver in those types of experiences?</p>
<p>In the same call to shareholders, House said EA was amassing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-amassing-largest-battlefield-team-in-franchise-history-to-double-down-on-live-service-multiplayer">"largest Battlefield team in franchise history"</a> to work across "connected multiplayer and single-player experiences".</p>
<p>"Our teams have listened to the community, have learned valuable lessons, and are driving to the future," said Wilson. "Motive, armed with cutting-edge Frostbite technology and compelling storytelling, is joining DICE, Criterion, and Ripple Effect to build a Battlefield universe across connected multiplayer and single-player experiences. This is the largest Battlefield team in franchise history."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Well, Microsoft's Windows 11 is about to receive its first exclusive ad featuring Xbox's Game Pass promotion under the "Settings" option.</p>
<p>News surrounding advertisements on Windows 11 has been circulating for a while now, and it looks like we have finally witnessed the new ad surfacing, promoting none other than Microsoft's gaming subscription service, Game Pass. In the latest Dev channel version 26120.470 (KB5037864), Microsoft says a new Game Pass advertisement will be visible under the Settings home page. Here is how the company describes the change:</p>
<p><em>We are introducing a new Game Pass recommendation card on the Settings homepage. The Game Pass recommendation card on Settings Homepage will be shown to you if you actively play games on your PC. As a reminder – the Settings homepage will be shown only on the Home and Pro editions of Windows 11 and if you’re signed into Windows with your Microsoft account.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/settings-homepage-gamepass-1024x731-1.webp"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/settings-homepage-gamepass-1024x731-1.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="731" srcset="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/settings-homepage-gamepass-1024x731-1.webp 1024w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/settings-homepage-gamepass-1024x731-1-504x360.webp 504w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/settings-homepage-gamepass-1024x731-1-728x520.webp 728w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>

<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-ps-plus-gaming-subscriptions-up-only-1-percent-year-on-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Pass growth</a> on the Xbox console has practically stopped, Microsoft previously said the PC version of the subscription service was still growing. Perhaps this is a way for them to bring Game Pass more visibility from non-core gamers who use Windows daily.</p>
<p>It's important to note that users will only receive the advertisement if they "actively" use the subscription service and have either the Home or Pro version of the operating system. So, judging by this, the advertisement isn't a move that would affect the user experience of the general consumer. Instead, it targets the specific gamer that would actually be interested in seeing the ad.</p>
<p>Despite that, the change marks the era of advertisements on Microsoft's Windows, and it'll likely be a move that would potentially add to the long list of Game Pass subscribers. However, Microsoft should also provide users the option of disabling such advertisements, or must at least provide a value to what users are seeing. A discount offer for new users who sign up through the OS would be acceptable.</p>

<p data-characters="314" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the first creatures you’ll likely encounter while exploring the world of<em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a> </em>is the Ostrich. This long-necked beast wants to eat your character, and it won’t beat around the bush. Unless you know what you’re doing, it’ll chase you, corner you, and make a light snack of you. </p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">You might just lose your mind when you first meet the Ostrich in <em>Animal Well</em>. Every creature up until this point has been pretty docile, but here’s a much larger one that’ll try to stomp on you and grab you in its beak with an added advantage. Its incredibly long neck allows it to pursue you around corners as you attempt to escape it. But don’t worry—there’s an easy way to get past it. </p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-get-past-the-ostrich-in-animal-well" data-injectable="false">How to get past the Ostrich in <em>Animal Well</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ostrich-attacking-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="ostrich attacking in animal well" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ostrich-attacking-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ostrich-attacking-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ostrich-attacking-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ostrich-attacking-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Bigmode</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">To get past the Ostrich in <em>Animal Well</em>, you need to dive underground beneath its feet, press every button you find, and escape through the door once it’s unlocked. This is much easier said than done, much like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-seahorse-boss-in-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every boss-like creature</a> in the game, but there’s one trick you can use to ensure you get through this encounter unscathed. </p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">There are five holes in the ground in the Ostrich room. Within these are four switches that you must press to unlock the door and escape. The Ostrich will reach down with its head and peck your last known location, so you need to time your jumps to avoid it as it does so. </p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">Then, when the Ostrich attacks, get away from it and into one of the holes so you can find and press a button. The Ostrich’s neck will likely follow you, so get as far into the hole as possible because the creature can’t reach right into the corners. </p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">After a short while, the Ostrich retracts its head, allowing you to escape and make a break for another hole. However, the Ostrich can trick you and push its head back down in an attempt to attack you again. Keep an eye out for what the creature is doing as you move, and you should be fine. </p> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="false">It took me longer than I’d like to admit to get past the Ostrich in <em>Animal Well</em> because I wimped out and tackled other parts of the map first. This big bird isn’t nearly as scary as it looks, but it’ll kill you if you get caught. Stick to the holes and get right into the corners. As long as you’re careful, you should unlock the door and escape in no time. </p>

<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There’s a menagerie of creatures for players to contend with in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em>. Some are dotted around the world, and others, like the Snake, are in set locations with a puzzle that can have you scratching your head for a long time. </p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><em>Animal Well</em>‘s Snake is a creature you won’t meet until you’re exploring the final few nooks and crannies of the game’s world. When you do, it can be a bit of a challenge because it wants to crush you while you attempt to escape its arena. The additional element of difficulty here is that the arena is built to lock you in, blocking Bubbles and your Disc, so you’ve got to think your way out of it using a new method. </p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-get-past-the-snake-in-animal-well" data-injectable="false">How to get past the Snake in <em>Animal Well</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snake-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360" alt="snake in animal well" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snake-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snake-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snake-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snake-in-animal-well.jpeg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true">You’ll need to get past the Snake twice in <em>Animal Well</em>. The first is after you enter its room, having found the S Medal and using it on the snake statue near the starting room. A this point, you’ll be on the right-hand side of the room and want to get to the left, past the Snake. </p>
 <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">As you can see in the image above, the Snake will move around the room, creating shapes you can jump on. However, the creature will crush you if you stop moving, so this is pretty risky. Getting across with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-use-the-disc-in-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Disc</a> is impossible because of the vines dangling in front of both exits from the room, and this makes using Bubbles pretty challenging, too. The Snake will also pop these Bubbles and chase you faster than you can create them. </p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">The solution is to tease the Snake into the right-hand corner of the room, run to the left, jump on its head, and ride it to the exit. Jump off the Snake’s head before it crushes you against the ceiling. Beyond this room, you’ll find a new item: the Remote. </p> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">This brings us to the second encounter with the Snake, which is much easier. The Remote will cause the Snake to come under your control so you can move it up, down, left, and right. Once you control it, try getting it to eat all the fruit in the room. </p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">After you’re done messing around with the Snake, you can use the Remote to create a bridge or steps to the exit, allowing you to get from the left-hand side of the room to the right-hand side exit where you first entered. Don’t forget to explore the room above the Snake’s room by using Bubbles because there’s an Egg in there you could easily miss. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/instruments-of-destruction">Instruments Of Destruction</a> goes to the trouble of having a voiceover offer a preamble to each of its missions, but I don't need it. Its launch trailer <em>knows</em> I don't need it, as its own voiceover makes clear: "Take this vehicle, destroy those buildings. Do I really need to explain why?"
</p>
<p>Nope! You don't. And the smashing simulator's 1.0 release is out now.

<p>This is the work of Luke Schneider, among others, and Schneider was the lead tech designer on Red Faction: Guerilla, the famed first-person demolish 'em up. While Guerilla often had you destroying architecture with a sledgehammer or some carefully placed explosives, Instruments Of Destruction sets you loose from its very first mission with some extremely powerful machinery. Expect wrecking balls, rocket-powered diggers, missile-launching mechs, and many more impossible machines.
</p>
<p>These are all prototype vehicles you've been charged with testing across a series of levels, each one an island where the main objective is to destroy some suspiciously empty buildings, and the optional objective is to, perhaps, avoid destroying a particular type of building, or to punt some particular objects into the sea. What I've played of it has been breezy fun so far, although there's promise of depth via hidden bonus objectives, high score tables, and the ability to construct your own vehicles.
</p>
<p>There are around 50 missions in total, but I don't get the impression that Instruments Of Destruction is something I'm going to mainline until complete. Instead I think I'm going to keep it installed for a long while and dip in for short bursts of bursting buildings.
</p>
<p>You'll find Instruments Of Destruction <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1428100/Instruments_of_Destruction/">on Steam</a>, where it's currently £13.16/€14.27/$17.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam, Epic, and Green Man Gaming are reportedly canceling and refunding preorders of the PC port of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/6/24092291/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-release-date-steam"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> for buyers who live in over 170 countries without PlayStation Network access, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">reports <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. That’s despite the fact that arguably the most important part of the game is still playable without PlayStation Network account linking. The news comes after Valve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/5/10/24153281/uhhh-anything-you-want-to-tell-us-about-ghost-of-tsushimas-psn-requirement-on-pc-sony">abruptly delisted the game in those countries yesterday</a>. </p><p><em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>only requires PSN account linking for its Legends multiplayer mode, a requirement the single player campaign is exempt from, the game’s developer went out of its way <a href="https://x.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1786462939748384943">to say in a recent post</a>. Steam, Green Man Gaming, and Epic Games Store each had disclaimers noting the same thing. In theory, that would mean if you don’t care about multiplayer modes, you could still play — but in practice, the platforms are now delisting the game.</p><div><p>The Steam team is <a href="https://twitter.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1789184327642984697?t=8MzM6vyZWq82IfKlShq3xQ&amp;s=19">sending this message</a> out to players who are being refunded:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>You are receiving a refund for a game you pre-purchased - Ghost of Tsushima. The publisher of this game is now requiring a secondary account to play portions of this game - and this account cannot be created from your country.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here’s an example with Green Man Gaming:</p><p>Frustrating as it is, the situation with <em>Tsushima </em>feels cut-and-dry compared to that of <em>Helldivers 2. </em>Earlier this month, Sony announced it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24148144/helldivers-2-steam-psn-account-link-review-bombing">add mandatory PSN account linking to <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, which had already been available to buy in non-PSN countries for almost three months. Steam quickly restricted where the game could be sold to only countries where PSN was available. <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1786652818993999960">Players weren’t happy</a>.</p><p>Following a review-bombing campaign that slid the game’s Steam rating from “overwhelmingly positive” to “overwhelmingly negative” in a matter of days, Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">walked back the change</a>. But despite that, Steam didn’t remove the sale restrictions.</p><p>Then yesterday, three more countries— Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania — <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/137730/history/">were added</a> to Steam’s list of sale-restricted countries. The CEO of Arrowhead, Johan Pilestedt, said on Discord he wasn’t told about the newly-added regions, only finding out about them through the game’s Discord community.</p><div><div role="button"
