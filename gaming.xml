            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earth-defense-force-6-review-bomb-epic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>is being review bombed on Steam due to its requirement that players sign up for an Epic Games account in order to play online.</p>
<p>The game has attracted a "Mostly Negative" review rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on Steam</a> across 909 reviews at time of writing, and since it's only just been released, that's a lot of angry players queueing up to give it a kicking.</p>
<p>Most of the negative reviews point to the fact that it's necessary to sign up for an Epic Games account in order to play any of&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6</em>'s online modes, and also the fact that players must install Epic Online Services in order to play the game at all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earth-defense-force-6-review-bomb-epic-shooting.jpg?itok=oWergjZI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earth-defense-force-6-review-bomb-epic-shooting.jpg?itok=ysSNuVO7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>is attracting hostility from players over its Epic account requirements.</figcaption></figure><p>Pretty much all of the negative reviews I could see on the Steam page pointed to the Epic requirement, although there were one or two criticizing&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>for its lackluster technical performance as well. That's pretty much par for the course when it comes to&nbsp;<em>EDF&nbsp;</em>games, though.</p>
<p>Developer Sandlot and publisher D3Publisher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526914035378" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took to Steam earlier today</a> to address the criticism. The two studios apologize for "the lack of advance notice"; players apparently weren't told that signing up for an Epic account would be needed if they wanted to play online.</p>
<p>Additionally, the two studios point out that signing into the Epic account is "usually" only required once, and that players can play online freely once they've done so without needing to sign in again.</p>
<p>There's no sign that the studios will climb down from the requirement to sign up for an Epic account; since Epic's online services are seemingly baked into&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>on a basic level, it's unlikely that such a walkback is coming.</p>

<p>Although the Epic controversy might have dulled D3Publisher and Sandlot's spirits, the two studios can take solace in the fact that&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>is easily the best-performing game in the series when it comes to player numbers.</p>
<p>At time of writing, the 24-hour Steam player peak for&nbsp;<em>EDF 6&nbsp;</em>was 17,690, over twice that achieved by&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 5&nbsp;</em>(which stands at 8,416). Other&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force&nbsp;</em>games can't hold a candle to those numbers.</p>
<p>Weirdly, this controversy makes&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">second bug-blasting third-person multiplayer-focused shooter</a> to incur the wrath of Steam players over the need to sign up for a third-party account in order to play.</p>
<p>Of course, the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>situation is different in a number of key ways.</p>
<p>For one thing, the need to sign up for a Sony account made it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-delisted-for-over-100-countries-on-steam">impossible</a> for players who couldn't access the PlayStation Network in their home countries to play the game. For another, Sony eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">walked back the requirement</a> to sign up for PSN to play&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, although it has yet to relist the game in many countries.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens in the case of&nbsp;<em>EDF 6</em>. For now, though, if you want to check out Sandlot's latest bug-based splatterfest, it's out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10002862/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>.

<p>In a series of posts on X, multiple Fortnite leaks teased possible Item Shop release dates and details for new content, including the anticipated Deadpool &amp; Wolverine tie-in.</p>



<p>Reliable Fortnite leakers HYPEX and SpushFNBR teased <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1816476086127276083">via X</a> that the Deadpool &amp; Wolverine content will release tomorrow. Their posts elaborate on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-introduce-a-deadpool-wolverine-bundle-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iFireMonkey’s claims</a> from earlier this week.</p>



<p>They claim the cosmetics for each character will go for 2,000 V-Bucks, “including backbling, pickaxe, emote &amp; wrap.” They also claim that Gliders will be 800 V-Bucks apiece, with a full bundle costing 3,600.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>HYPEX <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1816184395289825519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also claimed</a> to have release dates for a wide range of Fortnite Item Shop additions coming in the next few weeks.</p>



<p>HYPEX mentioned launch dates for Stranger Things, Avatar, Futurama, and Summer Road Trip to round out the month. </p>



<p>They also finally offered a concrete date for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-lethal-company-collaboration-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lethal Company collaboration</a>, which HYPEX teased last May. They claim that other IP will include My Hero Academia and Jujutsu Kaisen, apparently coming in the first week of August.</p>



<p>A host of leaks surfaced following Fortnite’s major v30.30 update, including rumors that the desert biome from chapter 1 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-desert-biome-possibly-coming-to-reload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could release in Reload</a>. SpushFNBR claimed that the devs modified a material with the same codename as the biome after the latest update.</p>



<p>At this time, Epic Games did not confirm the release dates or pricing for any the leaked content possibly coming to the Item Shop.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-fallout-london</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/psa-installing-fallout-london-is-a-bit-tricky-here%E2%80%99s-how-to-do-it.936660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-fallout-london<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Fly the Union Flag, plate up some beans on toast, and get the kettle on for a good brew – <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/massive-fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-finally-has-a-release-date-and-its-today">Fallout: London is finally here</a>. The ambitious, long-awaited mod for Fallout 4 is now available for PC players to download for free. But diving into the British wasteland isn’t quite as easy as booting up a new videogame. Depending on what platform you’re using, Fallout 4 might require a little tinkering before it’s ready for Fallout London. Have no fear, though, for this guide will help you to keep calm, carry on, and get Fallout: London installed on your PC. </p><h2>What you need to play Fallout: London</h2><p>To play Fallout: London, you need to own <strong>Fallout 4 and all of its DLC packs</strong>. That’s easily acquired by purchasing the Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition, which is the complete package. If you already own Fallout 4 and the odd one or two DLC packs, you will need to purchase what you are missing. Here’s a list of everything you need to own:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fallout 4</li><li>Automatron</li><li>Far Harbor</li><li>Nuka World</li><li>Wasteland Workshop</li><li>Contraptions Workshop</li><li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li></ul><p>You can use the High Resolution Texture Pack (available for free) if you wish, but it is not a requirement. </p><p>You will also need to <strong>downgrade Fallout 4</strong> to make it compatible with Fallout: London (more on that later in the guide). On top of all that, you will also need the Fallout: London mod itself. This is available to download from GOG, using the GOG Galaxy launcher. Create a GOG account if you don’t already have one and add the free mod to your account using the green button on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallout: London store page</a>. Then download GOG Galaxy, find Fallout: London in your library, and download it. </p><h2>Steam vs GOG</h2><p>Fallout 4 for PC is available on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/199943/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOG</a>. Fallout: London can be played using either version (sorry, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-wont-work-with-epic-games-store-copies-of-fallout-4">Epic Games Store version is incompatible</a>), but if you are buying Fallout 4 on PC for the first time specifically to play Fallout: London, then we recommend buying from GOG. </p><p>Why? Because the installation process is much, much simpler. Team FOLON, the developer behind Fallout: London, has a partnership with GOG. Using the <a href="https://www.gog.com/galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOG Galaxy</a> platform, you’ll be able to simply download Fallout 4: GOTY Edition and then install Fallout: London after. Then it's just a case of launching the game and playing. </p><p>If you own Fallout 4 on Steam, things are a bit trickier. You may have previously read about how the recent Fallout 4 ‘next-gen’ update created compatibility issues with many mods. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-creators-forced-to-delay-hotly-anticipated-mod-out-of-fear-fallout-4s-next-gen-update-will-break-it">Fallout: London was impacted by this</a> (hence the delayed release date) and so it requires a previous, ‘last-gen’ version of the game to work. Where GOG Galaxy only allows this older version to be downloaded to ensure compatibility with mods, Steam automatically downloads the ‘next-gen’ version of Fallout 4. As such, you’ll need to force Steam to download an older version of Fallout 4 to play Fallout: London.</p><h2>How to install Fallout: London on Steam</h2><p>To install Fallout: London using a Steam version of Fallout 4, you will need to access the old 1.10.163.0 version of Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition. The easiest way to do this is by using Team FOLON’s downgrader tool, which is available from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus Mods</a>. If this is your first time modding a PC game then this is probably your best option. </p><p>After downloading, run the Fallout London Downgrader .exe app. This will open a window that will ask for you to select the install path. Click the folder icon to the right of the window and search for where Fallout 4 is installed (by default, that’s "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4"). </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/fallout-4-downgrader-tool-01-1721914465311.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The next window will ask you to log into your Steam account. This is so the downgrader tool can access the older versions of the Fallout 4 files and install them to your system. Enter your username and password, and then follow the prompts to authorise the log-in via Steam Guard. If you’re uncomfortable with logging into your Steam account via the tool, then you can manually downgrade Fallout 4. See below this section for instructions on how to do that. </p><p>With your Steam account logged in, the downgrader tool will begin the process of installing the correct version of Fallout 4. This will take a long time so you’ll need to be patient. When the process is complete, hit ‘finish’ to exit the tool.  </p><p>With a freshly downgraded version of Fallout 4 ready, you now need to install Fallout: London. Boot up GOG Galaxy, find Fallout: London in your library, and download the mod. (Yes, even if you have Fallout 4 on Steam, you need to use GOG to play Fallout: London). When downloaded, you can hit ‘play’ to launch the installer. The system should automatically detect your Steam version install folder, but just double check before hitting the install button (again, by default this is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4"). </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/fallout-london-installer-1721914536172.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>After the install process is complete, you will be able to launch Fallout: London from GOG Galaxy. It will launch straight to Fallout: London’s bespoke main menu and play like a standalone game. </p><p>Two final things to note: you cannot change your graphical settings from the Fallout: London main menu and the game will likely launch in a low resolution. To adjust settings, launch Fallout 4 in Steam and use the ‘Options’ menu in the pre-game launcher. </p><p>You should also disable cloud saves for Fallout 4 in Steam just to prevent any issues. From the Fallout 4 library page, click the cog button and go to the properties menu. In the general tab, turn off the Steam Cloud option. </p><h2>How to manually downgrade Fallout 4 on Steam</h2><p>If for some reason you don’t want to use the downgrader tool, you can manually download an older version of Fallout 4 using Steam’s command console. To begin, we recommend deleting everything from your Fallout 4 install folder (which is, by default, located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4") and then following these steps:</p><p>Type steam://open/console into the address bar of your internet browser. This will prompt Steam to open its console tab. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/fallout-4-downgrade-steam-1721914628438.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>You now need to download each part of Fallout 4’s ‘last-gen’ version individually. There are 15 sections in total. Typing in the following codes will initiate the download of each section:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Part A use: </li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 377161 7497069378349273908</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Part B use: </li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 377163 5819088023757897745</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For the executable file use: </li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 377162 5847529232406005096</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For the English version use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 377164 2178106366609958945</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For HD Texture Pack use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 540810 1558929737289295473</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Automatron use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 435870 1691678129192680960</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Automatron English language pack use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 435871 5106118861901111234</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Wasteland Workshop use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 435880 1255562923187931216</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Far Harbor use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 435881 1207717296920736193</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Far Harbor English language pack use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 435882 8482181819175811242</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Contraptions Workshop use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 480630 5527412439359349504</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Vault-Tec Workshop use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 480631 6588493486198824788</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Vault-Tec Workshop English language pack use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 393885 5000262035721758737</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Nuka World use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 490650 4873048792354485093</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Nuka World English language pack use:</li></ul><p>download_depot 377160 393895 7677765994120765493</p><p>The files will download into your Steam library folder (which by default is located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_377160"). You should now be able to find them in this folder, with each of the sections in its own “depot” folder. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/fallout-4-downgrade-depot-files-1721914758921.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Create a new, temporary folder and move the contents of all the downloaded folders into this new folder. If prompted to remove or replace files, always choose ‘replace’. The aim is to create one single folder full of files, rather than a collection of depot folders. This will create the 'downgraded' version of Fallout 4.   </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/fallout-4-downgrade-full-folder-1721914789336.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Move the entire contents of this new folder into your Fallout 4 installation folder (which is, by default, located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4"). Be sure this folder is completely empty before adding your new files. </p><p>To prevent Steam from automatically updating Fallout 4, you will need to deactivate the app manifest file. In the steamapps folder ("C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\” by default) you will find a file called “appmanifest_377160”. Right click the file and select properties, then tick the ‘Read-only’ box at the bottom of the window. Hit apply and then close the window. </p><p>Download Fallout: London using GOG (this will require a GOG account and the GOG Galaxy launcher). If you do not want to use GOG, you can also manually install Fallout: London. This is advised only for advanced users, and full instructions can be found on the <a href="https://fallout4london.com/release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallout: London website</a>. </p><p>Launch Fallout: London in GOG Galaxy and follow the instructions to begin the game. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/fallout-london-title-screen-1721915107230.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>With these instructions followed, you should now be able to play Fallout: London through either your Steam or GOG version. And if this is your first experience of modding, we hope we've helped make the process simple. Enjoy Fallout: London, and please mind the gap. </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sony has released several DualSense controllers over the last couple of years, but its new limited-edition Concord controller is easily one of its most attractive so far. Inspired by the game and its sci-fi aesthetic, the controller has a matte black base complemented by bold orange and teal lines converging into a single point on the touchpad. There's even a little bit of simulated wear and tear on the paint, to give the device a slightly tarnished finish.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340388-concord-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340388" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340388-concord-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340388"></a><figcaption>Concord limited-edition DualSense controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340388-concord-3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340390-concord_0000_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340391-concord_0001_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340392-concord_0002_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340393-concord_0003_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340394-concord_0004_background.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340390,1300-4340391,1300-4340392,1300-4340393,1300-4340394" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4340390-concord_0000_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4340391-concord_0001_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4340392-concord_0002_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4340393-concord_0003_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4340394-concord_0004_background.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340390-concord_0000_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340391-concord_0001_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340392-concord_0002_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340393-concord_0003_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340394-concord_0004_background.jpg"></figure><p>The Concord controller will be more expensive than your typical DualSense peripheral, as it's priced at $85. This is $10 more than the Deep Earth collection and $15 more than a standard white or black controller.</p><p>Sony has only released a handful of controllers directly inspired by its first-party games, as 2023's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/preorder-marvels-spider-man-2-ps5-limited-edition-console/1100-6516370/" data-ref-id="1100-6516370">featured a subdued DualSense design</a> incorporating symbiote tentacles taking over the bright red portions of that hardware. The controller sold out surprisingly quickly whenever it was in stock, although it remains to be seen if PlayStation fans will flock to the Concord design.</p><p>Concord will launch for PS5 and PC on August 20, and the 5v5 shooter recently wrapped up its closed and open beta sessions. In a departure from other live-service games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-no-battle-pass-you-own-concord-concord-doesnt-own-you/1100-6525272/" data-ref-id="1100-6525272">Concord will not have a battle pass system</a> to grind through as developer Firewalk confirmed that new characters, maps, and modes will be released at no additional cost. Players will only need to purchase Concord itself for $40 and can expect regular content drops, according to Firewalk.</p><p>"Concord’s mechanics may tread a lot of familiar ground within the hero shooter genre, but the way Firewalk Studios’ heroes, maps, and game modes complement each other feels fresh," Jake Dekker wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-didnt-care-about-concord-until-i-played-it/1100-6524530/" data-ref-id="1100-6524530">Concord hands-on impressions</a>. "Each Freegunner has just enough flexibility to break out of their role if they need to, the simplistic arena-style maps prioritize smart ability usage over intimate map knowledge, and the game modes are just complicated enough to encourage teamwork. I’m curious to see if and how Concord holds up with more maps, characters, and game modes in the mix."</p>

A DisplayPort cable that's compatible with DisplayPort 1.4 is needed too. When playing VR games and apps on Steam with PSVR 2, the PSVR 2 app needs to stay installed on the PC, even after its initial setup is complete.</p><p>While using the PSVR 2 headset with Steam, features such as HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (apart from rumble) will not be available. However, 4K visuals, 110-degree field of view, 3D audio, and finger-touch detection will be supported.</p><p>The headset's PC compatibility is a bright spot in some recent bleak VR news. In March, Sony reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-2-headset-production-paused-report/1100-6521906/" data-ref-id="1100-6521906">paused production</a> on additional PSVR 2 headsets due to slow demand.

<p dir="ltr">Although Microsoft has yet to make any official statement regarding the unionization, it hasn't made moves to block employees from unionizing. In 2022--while in the midst of negotiating the acquisition of Activision-Blizzard--Microsoft finalized an agreement with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) with the goal of making it easier for employees in certain positions to unionize, and later announced it would support the organizing efforts of other American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (ALF-CIO) unions in a similar way. ALF-CIO is the largest federation of unions in the United States.</p><p dir="ltr">The news of the World of Warcraft developers' victory comes just a week after 240 employees at Bethesda Game Studios (also owned by Microsoft) joined the union.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft's gaming division has seen massive layoffs in recent months, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">1,900 employees losing their jobs</a> in January alone. More layoffs (and studio closures) followed, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">shuttering of Tango Gameworks</a>, which left the developers behind 2023's highly praised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hi-fi-rush/">Hi-Fi Rush</a> jobless. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has defended the recent layoffs, citing the need to "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">run a sustainable business</a>." The expansion of unions at Microsoft is good news for developers, as it offers them an array of potential benefits, from increased job security to more beneficial salary negotiations.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-am-going-to-be-the-first-person-in-the-world-to-never-get-tired-of-owning-an-ice-cream-maker.936627/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hell-yes-ice-cream-maker<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For years, I’ve wanted to buy an ice cream maker, but friends who had one always told me the same story. They said their ice cream maker was too big, that it required too much prep. They said they never used it. They said they regretted buying it. But I’ve owned one for a couple weeks now, and I have decided that, unlike everyone else in the world, I will simply never get tired of it.</p><p>One of the great things about being a grown-up is that you can just have ice cream whenever you want. I’ve been an adult for a long time, but I still get a thrill from going out for ice cream without having to ask my parents. Given my love of ice cream, I’ve gotten pretty OK over the years at making <a href="https://www.foodiecrush.com/how-to-make-easy-no-churn-ice-cream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no-churn</a> ice cream out of heavy cream and sweetened condensed milk, which creates a very good dessert that’s very close to ice cream. And I’ll even cop to making <a href="https://www.theendlessmeal.com/chocolate-banana-ice-cream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banana ice cream</a> when I have bananas in the freezer, which makes a very reasonable soft serve-alike. But I always knew that none of this was <em>real</em> ice cream, the kind the forbidden machine could make.&nbsp;</p><p>But a few weeks ago I went to admire all the baking pans I shouldn’t buy at the home goods store in my neighborhood, and there was a <a href="https://www.cuisinart.com/cuisinart-frozen-yogurt---ice-cream-sorbet-maker/ICE-21P1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuisinart ice cream maker</a> I’d just read good things about, a single one just randomly sitting on a shelf. It felt like a sign, and when the person behind the counter told me they owned one and used it–<em>sometimes</em>, they warned me–I was sold. I hauled it home, happy to find that while its bowl takes up <em>a lot </em>of space in my very tiny freezer, it still fits while leaving room for other stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My Aftermath colleague Chris will surely write some blog about the best ice cream maker to buy and how to <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hack it</a> into being even better, but I am more interested in the outcome–ice cream!!--than in the tools. The machine is fine; you freeze the bowl for a day, then put it on its motorized stand, press a single button, and pour in your chilled ice cream base. The bowl spins around a little plastic paddle and in 20 minutes you have something that’s very close to ice cream, though you should put it in the freezer for a few more hours to harden up. And then it’s <em>really</em> ice cream–any kind of ice cream you want, unbound by the limited imagination of Big Ice Cream or whatever change you can rustle up from the couch cushions.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing I’ve learned about ice cream so far is that it’s a combination of a bunch of things that don’t want to bind together, that you have to convince water and fat and air to cohere through the careful application of heat and proteins and sugars. There are a million ideas about what the right way to do this is, and what the best ratios are, and what the best ingredients are. I didn’t know that ice cream, so peaceful and happy, had so much tension at its core. At the same time, a lot of this is personal preference. It’s at once a science and an art, with a surprising amount of flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve made what I’ll call three and a half ice creams so far. The first was a <a href="https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/The-Darkest-Chocolate-Ice-Cream-in-the-World/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dark chocolate</a> using a <a href="https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Jenis-Ice-Cream-Base/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">base</a> devised from the founder of Jeni’s Ice Cream, a shop I enjoyed in DC, which contains the unusual ingredients of cream cheese and cornstarch. I tried it mostly because I had leftover cream cheese in the fridge the day I bought my machine, and while I was skeptical, the final product was shockingly excellent.</p><p>The next was a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/plum-sorbet-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plum sorbet</a> that I was worried would turn into a container full of ice shards after freezing (a particular challenge, I’ve learned, of homemade ice cream versus store bought), but which came out tart and smooth, even after several days. Its only downside was that I had too much of it, and grew eager to try new ice creams that I felt like I couldn’t justify until I’d finished the ice cream I already had. (Oh no, a crisis!)</p><p>The third was a <a href="https://www.davidlebovitz.com/vanilla-ice-cream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vanilla ice cream</a> from guru David Lebovitz, and my first foray into using egg yolks. There are a lot of <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/how-many-eggs-should-i-use-to-make-ice-cream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opinions about egg yolks</a>, but I was leery of them mostly because it would mean ending up with a ton of extra egg whites I’d have to find a use for. But lucky for me, Lebovitz also had a recipe for <a href="https://www.davidlebovitz.com/brown-pastry-browned-butter-financiers-recipe-french/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financiers</a>, so I put my extra whites to that and mixed his vanilla with swirls of rhubarb jam I’d made in the spring. I have to say that this one was probably the best, and that egg yolks are totally worth it. (Less worth it, but still worth it, is real vanilla beans, which cost a <em>fortune</em>, oh my god.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The financiers came out weird because I didn’t have the right pan, but then I realized I could add them to a <em>new</em> ice cream. Enter the “half” from above: I made an earl grey base by squinting at an Amazon sample of the <a href="https://jenis.com/products/jenis-splendid-ice-creams-at-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeni’s book</a>, but I think I mixed something up in the ratios. There was oddly <em>little</em> ice cream, and it thickened way too fast in the bowl and wouldn’t churn any more, even though it was clearly not fully churned. That happened at about eight yesterday morning, because this is the kind of person I am now in my ice cream journey, and it was a disappointing way to start a day. But I froze it anyway, throwing in a handful of frozen financier chunks just to see how they’d hold up. It’s… <em>okay</em>: I wouldn’t serve it to anyone else, but it’s still ice cream, and it tastes great even if the texture isn’t what I’d hope for.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m going to try this flavor combo again using an egg-based recipe, and then use <em>those</em> egg whites to make <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/angel-food-cupcakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">angel food cupcakes</a>, which I could add to <em>another</em> ice cream alongside either the rest of my rhubarb jam or with some lemon curd I made, in a food waste-free loop of ice cream, <em>forever</em>. My biggest problem now is that I have <em>too much</em> ice cream, and also a lot of friends who don’t eat dairy so can’t help me eat it, though I’ve been researching non-dairy ice cream recipes obsessively to figure out what I can make for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Will the novelty wear off? Probably. Is an ice cream maker a replacement for just buying ice cream? Definitely not; between freezing the bowl, prepping and chilling the ice cream base, and letting the churned ice cream chill, you definitely can’t just whip up a batch of ice cream whenever the mood strikes you. But does it totally rule to think of any kind of ice cream flavor I want and just create it, no matter how decadent or outlandish or experimental? Hell yes. I now live in a new, wide open ice cream frontier; I can see the ice cream Matrix and bend it to my will. I might grow tired of the ice cream-making process, but I will never grow tired of the ice cream-making power. I will defy the odds. I will make ice cream forever.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced a precipitous 90% quarter-on-quarter drop in its operating profits following the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style life simulation&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>earlier this year.</p>
<p>In a summary of the studio's latest interim financial report, Paradox says its operating profit has fallen from 292.9 million Swedish kronor last quarter to 28.9 million this quarter, with&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em>-related "write-downs" of 208 million kronor being "included in the operating profit".</p>
<p>Overall revenue has fallen by 22% since the first quarter of the year, which isn't quite such a disastrous percentage, but is still probably not what Paradox was hoping for.</p>

On the one hand, Wester says Paradox's "core business" has performed well, but he says the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">cancellation of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">Life by You</a>&nbsp;</em>was "difficult".</p>
<p>In a more detailed report accompanying the quarterly summary, Wester says&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em>'s cancellation gives his studio a "strong motivation to further improve our operations".</p>
<p>He's unexpectedly candid about Paradox's decision-making, admitting that his studio has "made the wrong calls in several projects" and that improvements are needed across production, quality, and risk assessment.</p>
<p>He also says that Paradox won't be starting projects with the "same combination of high risk and high costs" as&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>incurred, so it looks like you won't be seeing any projects similar to the former potential&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>rival anytime soon.</p>

            <p>Over 13 minutes of leaked gameplay from Star Wars Outlaws is currently making the rounds online.</p>
<p>Some of the footage shows the game's opening scenes, although there are no major spoilers. The footage was previously available to view on YouTube, but has since been pulled by Ubisoft. (There was little doubt as to the footage's authenticity, though the company's own copyright claim confirms the video as real.)</p>
<p>Other clips show off the game's aerial combat, along with footage of Star Wars' blackjack-like card game Sabacc.</p>

</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-lets-you-play-blackjack-like-sabacc">Sabacc was confirmed to be part of Outlaws earlier this year</a>, when a description from the ESRB ratings board revealed players would be able to "wager in-game currency" on the card game (this is also more than likely the gambling referred to in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-rated-19-in-south-korea">South Korea's own ratings board listing</a>, which resulted in Star Wars Outlaws getting slapped with an adults-only badge).</p>
<p>While the recently-uploaded footage has been removed from YouTube, the gameplay is still available to view elsewhere. To borrow from many characters in the Star Wars universe, Ubisoft probably has a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set to release next month, on 30th August, across PC (<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/star-wars-outlaws">Epic</a>), <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/star-wars-outlaws/">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/star-wars-outlaws/9p87s3np6sr2">Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p>

<p>Our Chris has already been hands on with Star Wars Outlaws, but came away feeling a little apprehensive about the whole thing.</p>
<p>"The sense, above all, is that Star Wars Outlaws is a game that is intentionally aiming for a mechanical light touch - which is absolutely fine. There is room for games that are more approachable and set themselves up for broad appeal, and its fitting for Star Wars' family audience," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-worryingly-dated-hands-on-with-star-wars-outlaws-ubisofts-galactic-open-world-feels-less-exciting-than-expected">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws preview</a>.</p>
<p>"But in Outlaws' case it feels like a clear step beyond approachable and into something potentially bland."</p>

            <p>
Infamous internet animation series Skibidi Toilet, made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike, is in discussions to be turned into a Michael Bay movie.
</p>
<p>
Bay, who directed disaster film blockbusters such as Armageddon and Pearl Harbour, is reportedly in talks to launch a Skibidi Toilet film and TV franchise with former Paramount Pictures boss Adam Goodman. 
</p>
<p>
"We are absolutely in talks right now, both on the television side and the earliest conversations right now on the film side," Goodman told <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-adam-goodman-1236077245/">Variety</a>. "But it's not a be-all, end-all for us."
</p>
<p>
Skibidi Toilet, for those mercifully still unaware, is an enormously-popular online animation series that has been likened to a Slender Man for Generation Alpha. (Fellow Millenials, think a post-apocalyptic Salad Fingers for tweens.) 
</p>
<p>
The series has accumulated over 65bn views on YouTube, another 15bn on Tiktok, and is ubiquitous on Roblox, where countless spin-off games lie.
</p>
<p>
What is a Skibidi Toilet? I'm so glad you asked. In short, it's a race of evil toilets with human heads. They're led by G-Toilet, an evil toilet with the head of G-Man from Half-Life.
</p>
<p>
The Skibidi Toilet animation series, now 70-something episodes long, follows an ever-escalating war between the Skibidi Toilets and a variety of humans with CCTV cameras, speakers and TVs on their heads. 
</p>
<p>
As of the animation's latest season, G-Toilet has returned as G-Toilet 4.0, now with an array of laser cannons.
</p>
<p>
Skibidi Toilet is the work of Alexy Gerasimov, who has cited machinima videos made in Garry's Mod as a key influence.
</p>
<p>
Reacting to the news of a potential Michael Bay Skibidi Toilet movie franchise, Garry's Mod creator Garry Newman <a href="https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1816168530519195729">wrote</a> on X: "If the Skibidi Toilet movie gets made I'll cut my cock off."

			<p>EXBO is celebrating the 10th anniversary of Stalcraft: X, the free-to-play MMOFPS, by majorly overhauling its features. This title is the giant online game set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, where players can participate in both PvP and PvE gameplay.</p>
<p>With just under 50,000 positive reviews on Steam, Stalcraft: X has been titled Minecraft meets <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-hands-on-impressions-good-hunting/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R</a>, as it includes RPG elements, dynamic shooter components, and an open world requiring survival.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, EXBO has diligently listened to the player base to gain feedback and constantly added new challenges and obstacles for players to try and overcome throughout the game's play through, whether they are playing alone or grouping up with friends to take on the various mutants lurking in the shadows.</p>
<p>In time for the 10th anniversary, EXBO has released the "Day X update," the most extensive update throughout the game's history. While the update isn't out yet, EXBO has released a trailer showing what players can expect.</p>
<p>In the trailer, players can see the massive graphics overhaul that Stalcraft: X is receiving. The game also features a new world with locations, characters, and enemies to uncover. It also features a new soundtrack created by Hollywood musician Jean-Pierre Taieb, who has composed music for shows and movies such as The Grand Tour, Addict, and Perfect Crimes.</p>
<p>In this update, players will be introduced to the Northern factions, which will give them a brand-new perspective on what it's like to live within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and allow them to pick a faction after exploring all of their stories. In addition, to give players the ability to rest, Personal Shelters have now been added to the game, where they can relax and craft valuable items. For those who want to add a personal touch, the shelters are fully customizable and can even transform into an underground base should you want it to.</p>
<p>One of the most important features of the Stalcraft: X 10th anniversary is a brand-new animation engine. The engine has been in development for two years, and the characters will now be animated using it to give them revamped movement, better perception of enemies on the battlefield, and a more lifelike overall appearance when exploring the game.</p>
<p><span>EXBO has released a&nbsp;<a href="https://telegra.ph/All-STALCRAFT-X-innovations-Patchnote-100724-07-09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive patch notes blog</a> on their website, which explains every new detail coming in the Day X update, how the new functions will work throughout the game, and what players can expect to see in the new areas.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-hits-3-million-copies-sold-worldwide/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a loosely translated <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1816473504642134502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, FromSoftware confirmed that Armored Core 6 Fires of Rubicon has officially sold 3 million copies worldwide.</p>



<p>FromSoftware simply thanked all of the fans who played the game since launch. Armored Core 6 Fires of Rubicon first released just under a year ago in August 2023. </p>



<p>Since then, it continued to earn ‘Very Positive’ reviews on Steam and strong scores on Metacritic. It currently holds an impressive 8.0 user score on the latter.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Armored Core 6 just got another Ranked Match Season Update on July 19, with another scheduled for September 2024. The latest major patch was Update 1.06 in February 2024, fixing up bugs and addressing some balancing issues.</p>



<p>However, fans continue to request new DLC for the hit game. Earlier this month, FromSoftware did appear to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-is-seemingly-hiring-for-armored-core-6-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hiring for Armored Core 6 content</a>.  The job listing requested experience with character modeling and textures for robots in particular.</p>



<p>Although Armored Core 6 has now reached 3 million copies sold, FromSoftware still hasn’t officially announced any new DLC. </p>

		<p>Crytek has announced Hunt: Showdown 1896, the next chapter for its PvPvE extraction shooter, will be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 15th August. A free upgrade and replacement from the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> game, it also see PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players no longer able to play as <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/hunt-showdown-to-sunset-on-ps4-xbox-one-from-15th-of-august">the game is sunset on those platforms</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mammon's Gulch Map Reveal | Cinematic Trailer | Hunt: Showdown 1896" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Nrpz5OFPNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 is a leap ahead in a number of ways for the game, while the core battle to defeat an occult beast and get back to extraction will remain the same. Narratively, time has jumped forward and the main location has gone from the Bayou to a new map in the Rocky Mountains called Mammon’s Gulch. This will emphasise verticality with plenty of vantage points above the surface, inspired by the community’s love of DeSalle, and then mines and oil wells to explore below that connect the two mountainous regions. In total there are 16 compounds to scope out, with the map as a whole roughly equivalent in size to what’s gone before.</p>
<p>There’s also a big leap technologically, with CryEngine 5.11 powering the game and Crytek keen to make the most of the current generation consoles. Console players will get a native 4K and 60FPS on PS5 and Xbox Series X, which is stepped down to 2K for Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Other technical improvements include having audio track the true speed of sound, a redone UI, rebalanced perks, weapons and Hunters, a centred crosshair option, overhauled wire trap placement, and more.</p>

<p>Crytek discussed Hunt: Showdown 1896 last year, before it was given the new name. At the time they were <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/if-you-want-to-think-of-it-as-hunt-2-youre-welcome-to-but-im-not-going-to-charge-you-hunt-showdown-manager-on-the-extraction-shooters-impending-engine-upgrade-and-the-pitfalls-of-declaring-a-sequel/">tentative about discussing it as a sequel</a>, though promised that there would be no new game release and charge, similar to how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> was an in-place replacement for the original.</p>
<p>On the plus side, all past player purchases and progress will carry forward to Hunt: Showdown 1896 from the original game, but on the downside, a lot of old maps from the Bayou are being shelved… for now. Crytek has also said that “they will be returning post launch after receiving a revamp of their own.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sea-of-thieves-developer-rare-now-has-a-dedicated-doggo-park.936537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rare-dedicated-dog-park<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sea of Thieves</em>&nbsp;developer Rare has introduced a dedicated dog park to its studio grounds, allowing employees' good boys and girls to frolic to their hearts' content.</p>
<p>In a paw-sitively adorable <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1816166798464598375" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Rare says that staff have been bringing their doggos to work "for a while", and that the dog park represents another opportunity for outdoor pet fun "alongside ample woodland walks".</p>
<p>Not only that, but Rare dogs are provided with "complimentary toys" that they can chew "to their adorable hearts' content". Honestly, it's hard to argue with Rare that their dogs are the cutest. Here are a couple of shots provided by the studio of Rare dogs frolicking. First, this acrobatic friend.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-dog-park-jumping.jpg?itok=GrxKOxYS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-dog-park-jumping.jpg?itok=e92betof 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just&nbsp;<em>look&nbsp;</em>at them.</figcaption></figure><p>If that dog doesn't catch that ball, I'm going to riot. Next, here's this adorably fluffy little creature coming to investigate the camera.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-dog-park-close-up.jpg?itok=5AseEtW_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-dog-park-close-up.jpg?itok=O82881AR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Urgh. So cute.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, check out this photo, which features three little canine friends having a ton of fun with a ball. Well, two of them are. The other one appears to have vacated their brain of the one brain cell shared by all dogs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-dog-park-chaos.jpg?itok=JEhHCE4v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-dog-park-chaos.jpg?itok=FfNXCjE3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These dogs are too precious for words.</figcaption></figure><p>The gaming industry is a difficult place to pay attention to these days thanks to what seems like a relentless tide of negative news, and in fairness, Rare's parent company Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">hasn't exactly</a> rendered itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">immune to that cycle</a>.</p>
<p>Still, sometimes it's nice just to take a look at some little dogs having fun, and a dedicated dog park is a great step, especially if lots of employees were already bringing their dogs into work. I mean, just look at them frolic!</p>
<p>If you're wondering what Rare is currently working on, the studio is still hard at work with its piratical live-service game&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and it's technically also still working on cel-shaded adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/everwild"><em>Everwild</em></a>, although news on that project has been relatively scant since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-is-beautifully-serene-game-from-rare">its announcement</a>.</p>

The Stream Deck Plus originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23517751/elgato-stream-deck-plus-review">launched in 2022</a> with the usual Stream Deck buttons, a new LCD display, and additional knobs, but these docks extend the functionality even further.</p><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fxlr-dock-stream-deck-plus">$119.99 XLR Dock</a> slots into the rear of the Stream Deck Plus and delivers up to 75dB of gain, enough to power Shure’s popular SM7B microphone. Just like Elgato’s dedicated Wave XLR, it even has a headphone jack for zero latency monitoring. </p><p>The XLR Dock means you only need a single USB cable routing to your laptop or PC and a single device instead of having to combine an XLR interface and Stream Deck. The knobs on the Stream Deck Plus can control the microphone, and there are plenty of ways to assign mute switches and more on the main Stream Deck buttons, too.</p><div><figcaption><em>The rear of the XLR Dock for the Stream Deck Plus.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Elgato</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Elgato’s USB Hub for the Stream Deck Plus.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Elgato</cite></p></div><p>If you don’t have an XLR microphone, then Elgato is also launching a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fusb-hub-stream-deck-plus">$59.99 USB Hub</a> that plugs into the back of the Stream Deck Plus. It includes two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and an SD or microSD card reader at the side. All four USB ports will deliver up to 5Gb/s of data transfers, so unfortunately, there are no Thunderbolt speeds here. </p><p>There is also a 65-watt uplink port that provides enough power to charge your laptop if you connect this hub to an external USB-C power supply. In fact, Elgato recommends using a USB-C power supply with this hub: “Most systems are unable to power both Stream Deck Plus and USB Hub on their own, without causing performance issues. For best results, keep USB Hub connected to a power supply at all times.”</p><p>Both the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fxlr-dock-stream-deck-plus">XLR Dock</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fusb-hub-stream-deck-plus">USB Hub</a> are available immediately from Elgato’s web store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, the beautifully grotty sci-fi shooter sequel from Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, has been delayed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-release-date-pushed-back-again-to-september-2024-to-fix-technical-imperfections">once again</a>. It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not <em>that</em> long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.</p>

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>"We know you might be tired of waiting, and we truly appreciate your patience", reads the English-language announcement post on <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1816435698007699568">Xitter</a>. "These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more "unexpected anomalies" (or simply "bugs", as you call them)".</p>
<p>To sate our appetites for schlepping through an overgrown Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and firing rusty AKs at psychic beasts, the deep dive video will include "exclusive interviews, lots of new footage, and a full video walkthrough of one of the game quests". Neat! When August 12th comes it’ll release on "Xbox media channels", which I assume means, like, YouTube, and not some kind of terrestrial TV channel I’ve not heard of where Master Chief presents the 6 'o' clock news.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I’ve been well up for more S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 for ages. I adore the atmosphere of the older S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s, but have always bounced off their hardcore Eurojank, so the notion of having the same world built with updated production values is a intensely compelling one. You can’t argue with taking more time to polish, either – even if it does mean that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o6D_a3PAHw">"Final Release Date" trailer</a> didn’t age particularly well, naming-wise.</p>
<p>GSC have also been forced to deal with far worse than a handful of software bugs. Staff from the Kyiv-based studio were relocated to Prague in the wake of Russia’s 2022 invasion, and early S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 development materials have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-test-footage-has-leaked-online-after-a-year-and-a-half-of-hacker-attacks">stolen and released</a> by apparent Russian hacking groups. Also in 2022, designer Volodymyr Yezhov, who had previously worked on the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-shadow-of-chernobyl">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-clear-sky">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-call-of-pripyat">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat</a>, was <a href="https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1607400845246664704">killed while defending the city of Bakhmut</a> as a volunteer soldier.</p>

The long-awaited post-apocalyptic shooter was slated to arrive on September 5 but will now launch on November 20 to give developer GSC Game World more time to address technical issues.</p>

<p>Additionally, the studio announced it will release its first-ever Developer Deep Dive video to give a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the game. The video will feature new gameplay footage, overviews of its world and locations, a full walkthrough of a story quest, and developer interviews. It is being made in collaboration with Xbox and will premiere on August 12.&nbsp;</p>

It was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2020/07/23/stalker-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-x">formally unveiled in 2020</a> after years of teases at the Xbox Games Showcase but has hit snags along the way, including garnering backlash for now-canceled <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/15/stalker-2-developer-announces-auction-for-metahuman-nft-that-will-appear-as-in-game-npc">plans for NFT implementation</a>. The biggest disruption was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/03/03/gsc-game-world-puts-stalker-2-development-on-sidelines-amidst-ongoing-ukraine-conflict">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>, where GSC Game World is based, which upended development and forced the staff to relocate to Prague, Czech Republic (though some team members actively fought and <a href="https://gamerant.com/stalker-developer-killed-ukraine-vladimir-fresh-yezhov/">sadly perished </a>in the war). Despite all of this, the game has managed to come together, and we even played it during <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/09/the-coolest-games-we-played-at-summer-game-fest-2024-and-more">Summer Game Fest</a> this year.</p>

<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. If nothing else, this delay gives players more time to catch up with the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2024/03/06/original-stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-is-available-on-xbox">Xbox re-release of the original games</a> that arrived earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/">Steam app for Sony's PlayStation VR2</a> headset is due for release on 6th August.

</p>
<p>
The free, official app will allow Steam users to play games on the virtual reality headset, as well as use the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers.
</p>
<p>
Use of the app will also require the PC adapter, which was unveiled in June and will release on 7th August.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-testing-ps-vr2-compatibility-with-pc">PSVR2 compatibility with PC was announced by Sony earlier this year</a>, though a specific release date wasn't given at the time.
</p>
<p>
Then, in May, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-vr2-unannounced-pc-adapter-spotted">PC adapter was certified in South Korea</a>, allowing the headset to plug directly into a PC. This was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">revealed on the PlayStation Blog</a> in June, with a 7th August release for support.
</p>
<p>
The minimum PC requirements, as per both Steam and the PS Blog, are as follows:
</p>
<table data-mobile-mode="scroll">
<tbody><tr>
<td>Operating system</td>
<td>Windows 10 64-bit / Windows 11 64-bit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Processor</td>
<td>Intel Core i5-7600 / AMD Ryzen 3 3100 (Zen 2 or later architecture is required)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RAM / memory</td>
<td>8 GB or more</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GPU / graphics card</td>
<td><ul>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 or later (Turing or later architecture is required)</li>
<li>NVIDIA RTX series</li>
<li>AMD Radeon RX 5500XT or later / AMD Radeon RX 6500XT or later</li>
</ul>

(For the best performance, we recommend that you use an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or later or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or later graphics card)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DisplayPort</td>
<td>DisplayPort 1.4 (must have a standard DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort output port)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>USB</td>
<td>Direct connection only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bluetooth</td>
<td>Bluetooth 4.0 or later</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Perhaps the biggest draw to using PSVR2 on PC is to play Valve's own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-alyx-review-a-legend-returns-in-elegant-form">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, which has become somewhat legendary since its release in 2020.

</p>
<p>
Earlier in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-vr2-production-paused-as-stock-piles-up-report">Sony reportedly paused production</a> of its latest VR headset due to unsold stock piling up.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">Eurogamer's VR expert Ian Higton has also bemoaned the lack of support from Sony</a> for the PS VR2, particularly as the forthcoming Astro Bot is a flat screen game.

The company claims a total loss of $5.4 billion, excluding Microsoft. Parametrix says the healthcare sector was the worst affected, followed by banking, and then airlines. The report says that healthcare companies lost an estimated $1.94 billion, with banking losing $1.15 billion, and airlines a total of $860 million. (It’s worth noting that Parametrix insures companies against such downtime losses, so it’s in their interests to highlight such scale.)</p><p>Of course, even if companies are able to recover losses through insurance, the insurers are going to want their money back too. We’ve reached out to Crowdstrike to ask for their thoughts on the reaction to the $10 coupons, and what plans the firm has in place for customer compensation.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
