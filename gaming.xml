                <p>The next game in the Plague Tale series was unveiled during the Xbox Games Showcase, with the cinematic reveal trailer showing off a new direction for the series. Developed by Asobo Studio, Resonance: A Plague Tale Story is set 15 years before the events of the previous game, Requiem, and it stars a new protagonist named Sophia.</p><p>Described as a plunderer who is on the run and determined to uncover the secrets of her past, Sophia's journey takes her to Minotaur's Island, where she has to face deadly trials and solve puzzles if she wants to stay one step ahead of the army chasing her. Asobo Studios says that it aimed to blend "combat, myth, and fate" together to create a new take on the universe of A Plague Tale, resulting in a heavier emphasis on action.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfssswW0qf4" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lfssswW0qf4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We wanted to expand and explore the world of A Plague Tale with a character--Sophia--that is very close to our heart, but within a much more action-oriented experience," Asobo Studios chief creative officer David Dedeine said in a press release. "This fresh approach comes with intuitive and rewarding combats, as well as a brand-new manifestation of the Macula, the ancient evil. Resonance embraces themes, places and eras that we had never explored before."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4508872-resonance-pt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508872" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4508872-resonance-pt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508872"></a><figcaption>Resonance: A Plague Tale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4508872-resonance-pt.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508877-resonance-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508876-resonance-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508875-resonance-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508874-resonance-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508873-resonance-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508877,1300-4508876,1300-4508875,1300-4508874,1300-4508873" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4508877-resonance-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4508876-resonance-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4508875-resonance-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4508874-resonance-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4508873-resonance-1.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508877-resonance-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508876-resonance-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508875-resonance-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508874-resonance-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508873-resonance-1.jpg"></figure><p>Players will shift between the Middle Ages period of Sophia and ancient Minoan times on their journey, with actions taken in the past having an impact on Sophia's present, and similar to the myth of the Minotaur, Asobo Studio has hinted that a "restless presence" will be stalking Sophia.</p><p>Resonance: A Plague Tale will launch for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026.

            <p>After what has felt like eons of waiting and wondering (and, for some people, setting up summoning circles), we still don't have a firm release for Silksong, but Xbox has confirmed again it will at least be some time this year. </p>
<p>The news was shared by Xbox's Sarah Bond, when she was chatting about handheld devices (more on that in another article, which I will link back to once it is live). </p>
<p>So, it isn't much, but yay for another Silksong mention! We are getting closer, people. </p>
<p>Of course, the time for an actual launch date has to come eventually, and more recently the signs were pointing to an imminent release. Just this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-update-ignites-perfectly-reasonable-shadow-drop-hopes">Silksong updates on SteamDB got fans predicted some kind of shadow drop or launch news</a>, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-release-window-finally-narrowed-down">Switch 2 teaser from April assured fans that the Hollow Knight follow up would arrive this year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy has been revealed as an Xbox exclusive, coming to Xbox Series X|S, PC and Xbox Cloud in 2026. It will also be available day one with Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy - Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfssswW0qf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s a smidgeon of story:</p>
<p>Fifteen years before A Plague Tale: Requiem, young Sophia seeks her independence as a fierce plunderer in the unforgiving world of the 14th century.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a lot of really interesting imagery alongside that, including something a tiny bit roman, no?</p>

<p>We said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/17/a-plague-tale-requiem-review/">A Plague Tale Requiem</a>, “A Plague Tale: Requiem gave me the chills. The graphics, sound design and writing are all phenomenal, and the gameplay is fantastic. There are a few issues with sneaking sections feeling samey, the puzzles being a little too easy, but these are forgivable for just how excellent Amicia and Hugo are as characters. If you enjoyed the first game, or you’re just looking for something narratively compelling, Requiem is the game for you.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-29th-october/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ahead of the dedicated stream that follows the Xbox Showcase, Obsidian Entertainment shared a new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, revealing that the game will launch on 29th October 2025.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, of course, but it’s also launching for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>. Of course it’s day one in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, which might have you sticking with team Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Story Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NUDdFBFTYRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will very much follow in the tone and style of the original, but promises to go bigger and broader on pretty much every level. There’s the new colony to explore in Arcadia, which is the home of skip drive technology, and which you explore as a new Earth Directorate agent trying to figure out if it’s responsible for all the big and scary rifts that are threatening the whole galaxy.</p>
<p>There’s various factions vying for power which you’ll have to navigate, balancing what amounts to the church, state and capitalism, and just as in the original, you’ll have a huge amount of sway over events. Well, depending on your chosen skills and how you do with skill checks and conversations, anyway.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to enlist a crew of companions to help you in your adventure, which will lean in on all of the party tropes of RPGs, with you making decisions and some of them dislike and then remembering that you did that.</p>

			<p>The system previously known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-ally-2-and-project-kennan-xbox-branded-handheld-pictured-in-us-fcc-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Kennan</a> has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIVmyOIV1MQ&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwZ1vjIDCjnzoBIiwnWst0qd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed today</a> as the ROG Xbox Ally, which will come in two variants that will both be able to play all sorts of PC games, including every game revealed during this year's Xbox Games Showcase.</p>
<p>As teased in the past few weeks, ASUS and Microsoft have partnered up to create two new premium handheld PCs that combine the power of Xbox with the freedom of Windows 11. The first model, the ROG Xbox Ally, is powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life without sacrificing gameplay quality, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of SSD storage. The second model, the premium ROG Xbox Ally X, is powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, which will allow players to experience games at higher framerates and sharper visuals, and will come with 24GB of high-speed RAM and 1 TB of SSD storage. Judging from the amount of RAM alone, the premium model shouldn't have any trouble running the vast majority of games currently available well.</p>

<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will launch this Holiday season worldwide. A set release date hasn't been confirmed, but its launch will be momentous even for those who aren't thinking about picking up either system, as the highly anticipated Hollow Knight Silksong will be available when the system officially launches.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">Outer Worlds 2</a> has a release date. It was shown in a new trailer at the Xbox Games Showcase, and featured something several unnamed scientists are calling "humour". </p>

<p>The release date is October 29. "An adventure into capitalism by capitalism," says the trailer above, perhaps misunderstanding the concept of irony. You play an Earth Directorate agent, who ends up on the above planet, Arcadia, "where the fate of the colony, and ultimately the entire galaxy, rests on your decisions—your strengths, your flaws, your crew, and the factions you choose to trust". </p>
<p>We've seen quite a chunk of The Outer Worlds 2 already, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-11-thoroughly-whelming-minutes-of-the-outer-worlds-2">11 thouroughly whelming minutes</a> of first-person blastin' and questy chattin'. Developers Obsidian <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/outer-worlds-2-is-looking-incredible-says-obsidian-boss-but-they-did-consider-throwing-the-whole-team-on-avowed">almost shelved the sci-fi sequel during the Covid pandemic</a> because they had too many projects going at once and it all got a bit much, according to the studio's head. But years later, here we are. </p>
<p>The first Outer Worlds was okay, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-pc-review">according to Alice B's review</a> (RPS in peace). Although it didn't really veer too far off the well-trodden space lanes established by many other space-faring RPGs. Here's what Alice said:

</p><blockquote>The Outer Worlds is alright, innit. It's good fun. Sit back and let the orange and neon wash over you. Boo the cartoonishly evil corporations. Exhale through your nose at their Diet Toothpaste. I bet I'll play it again, in fact. But you can tell it could have been great, if it had taken a few more risks. Real space cowboys take risks, don't they?</blockquote>
<p>Maybe this one will surprise us. </p>

<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156527/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>In honour of the game's arrival on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> as part of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-online-games-list-every-nintendo-classics-retro-game-on-nso-plus-expansion-pack#nintendo-switch-online-switch-2-gamecube-games-3">the Nintendo Classics GameCube lineup</a>, here's our new retro review of one of Link's most memorable adventures...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>If I were to put together a list of my favourite pre-Switch-era <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">Zelda</a> games, those that came before the franchise-transforming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, where would 2002's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a> fit in?</p>
<p>It's an interesting one, a divisive game for a couple of reasons, but for me personally it lands in the top three, which — considering there are over 40 games to choose from (if we go all in with spin-offs) — is a <em>pretty</em> good result.</p>
<p>Yes, some may have baulked at the cel-shaded graphics when they were revealed (didn't get the hate then, don't get it now), whilst others saw the whole wind-conducting and sailing about in a boat as a waste of time, but I absolutely adored everything about it. There may also have been the <em>odd</em> fan who'd sort of grown up with the grittier Ocarina Link, who then didn't welcome this return to younger and more innocent/cutesy days, but we're sure they got over it once they played the thing.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156524/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Because of course, this is a Zelda game that's come to be almost universally loved over time, with any perceived flaws or design dislikes smoothed over once players got to grips with its succession of delightful dungeons whose deviousness comes as a nice surprise when you consider the cute, colourful nature of director and series producer Eiji Aonuma's bold graphical overhaul.</p>
<p>Like any great game in this series, Wind Waker is a masterclass in how an adventure game should flow, in terms of narrative, in terms of how it doles out its new tools and upgrades, and in how it constantly raises the bar with regards to dungeons that test you at every turn. Once you've gotten into its rhythms and made peace with sailing around, settling into a slower pace at times as you journey around this most beguiling of worlds, it's hard not to be very impressed indeed, even if you're not 100% a fan of the (amazing) art style.</p>
<p>There's an enchanting quality — a Saturday morning TV serial sort of charm — to this pirate adventure that, every single time I sit down to play it, draws me right in. I want to shimmy along its ledges, grapple and swing on its ropes, glide with a big leaf through its...undergrowth? Who on earth wouldn't want to spend a whole bunch of time exploring these delights?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/accessibility-report/2707/embed @ 1749400740 -->
<p>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, in this GameCube form, <em>is</em> missing the nips and tucks and an HD lick of paint from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker_hd">the later Wii U revamp</a>. But really, it makes very little difference - well, as long as the speedier boat wasn't a killer fix for you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-do-you-prefer-zelda-wind-waker-hds-bloom-lighting-or-the-flat-og">Some may even prefer the original's colour tone</a>, so you're not missing any real <em>game-changing</em> benefits in sticking with the classic form.</p>
<p>And what a form! This is a wonderfully streamlined, manageable, and constantly engaging slice of Zelda. It doesn't bog you down in busywork (hello, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s Depths), and seeks to charm, surprise and excite at every turn.</p>
<p>You'll come to love sailing your (talking) raft, I'd wager, even come to love all the little repetitive rituals that are part and parcel of setting off for a new adventure. Yes, it can be a bit tedious, but it's so unlike other games, having all this peaceful space to mill around in whilst you fill in the game's delightful little chart of 49 puzzle-y islands. What an adventure.</p>

<p>It's the sort of game whose sandy beaches and windswept waves linger long in the memory. It's also got one of the best variants of Link, so full of expression and goofiness, if you have any misgivings going in, you'll likely have been put at ease by the time the fantastic tutorial opener is done.</p>
<p>This most lively and acrobatic of heroes is also a dab hand when it comes to combat, giving you a fresh and slick take on the series' decades-old, lock-on style of battle that still feels absolutely great to this day, with its swishy sword tricks and flipping around. If you come to Zelda for the usual flow of smart new tools and upgrades that keep things fresh as an epic narrative unfurls, well, you're in for a good time, too. The dungeons and storyline here are series-best stuff (again, pre-BOTW). I won't spoil it, if you're one of the few who've yet to play it, but let's just say that, besides one or two rushed sequences near the end, this is a cracker, and a game that manages to end in an interestingly downbeat, dark-ish way.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156530/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>If you come for cute towns packed full of red-nosed NPCs, weird shopkeepers, tons of collectibles, goofy side quests, and enough entertaining side stuff to balloon the running time from 30ish hours for a campaign-focused run, to around the 70-hour mark for full 100% completion, this old chestnut still has it where it counts. Zelda's kooky, eccentric brand of worldbuilding never lets you down, and that's not something that changed with this entry.</p>
<p>So, you're not getting the flashy HD version here, obviously, and the original — as much as I personally have no issues with it — does do things a little...well...it can be clunky at times, for sure. The speedier boat is a nice thing to have, let's say that much, and it stings once you've had it on Wii U and then have to go without.</p>
<p>There's also that one godawful late-game questathon that they shortened for the HD revamp (you know the one), but again that's not so much a deal-breaker as a slightly annoying bit of padding. Still, worth noting as it's one of my precious few actual issues with this delightful, 'toon-styled romp, though.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156532/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Apart from these hang-ups, though, Zelda: The Wind Waker, from its gloriously sunny opening to its (kinda dark) ending, is a blast, and one of my favourite Zelda games overall. In fact, only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a> top this one for me, if we're talking pre-BotW. I've replayed it a few times now, and it never loses the power to draw you in, once you're over the hump of the tutorial and into the meat of the deviously delightful dungeons on offer. What a timeless treat.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The HD revamp on Wii U may have added a few nice quality-of-life tweaks, but the original GameCube version of The Wind Waker is still an utterly charming and hugely enjoyable romp. The flashy sword-based combat still sings, banging around in your talking boat still feels epic, and the dungeons and narrative delights along the way ensure that this remains one of Link's finest outings. Indeed, bar the odd clunky mission and a rather slow mode of transport, this is right up there with the very best pre-BOTW Zelda games ever made.</p></section>

Not fully human, not entirely a vampire, you have 30 days and nights to save your family or swear revenge on your sire and destroy everyone standing in your way.</p><p>The freedom in gameplay is reflected in Coen’s very nature as a Dawnwalker. Depending on the time of day, players will have different skills, abilities and storyline outcomes.

                <p>Ahead of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-start-time-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6531984/" data-ref-id="1100-6531984">Xbox Games Showcase</a> at Summer Game Fest 2025, a range of Xbox games have begun appearing in Microsoft's Xbox app on PC. While not currently playable, this could be the first look at Microsoft's attempt to unify its PC and Xbox platforms by providing a single library for all of your purchases.</p><p>This approach would align with some peculiar marketing that started appearing when Microsoft announced Gears of War: Reloaded earlier this year. The Xbox Wire announcement noted that the game was due to release on Xbox PC, the first time Microsoft has referred to the PC platform with the Xbox moniker in the name. This followed as a logo in the trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mio-memories-in-orbit/" data-ref-id="5000-632910">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a>, as noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682235/xbox-pc-games-console-library-xbox-360" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, which listed "Xbox PC" as a release platform.</p><p>Right now, a random assortment of Xbox games has started appearing on the Xbox app on PC, from current Xbox Series X|S releases and down to Xbox 360 games. None of them are playable, however, outside of existing games that have released across both platforms already. It's unclear right now if Microsoft is simply trying to centralize your Xbox library across all platforms, or whether some unannounced plans for streaming or emulation of these titles is imminent.</p><p>Microsoft has put effort into improving its app on PC in a race to catch up to Valve's SteamOS. With hardware manufacturers such as Lenovo releasing devices with Valve's version of Linux instead of Windows, Microsoft has made it clear that it is accelerating efforts to streamline gaming on Windows, both on desktop and handhelds, ahead of its collaboration with Asus on an Xbox-branded gaming handheld. These enhancements might include integration with Steam and the Epic Games Store to centralize your entire gaming library in one app, something which is still a bit painful to do via SteamOS.</p><p>Microsoft has numerous titles expected to appear at the Xbox Games Showcase during Summer Game Fest, with hopes for showings of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay-3/" data-ref-id="5000-516152">State of Decay 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/perfect-dark/" data-ref-id="5000-523746">Perfect Dark</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fable/" data-ref-id="5000-516160">Fable</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day/" data-ref-id="5000-631971">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everwild/" data-ref-id="5000-504763">Everwild</a>, and, of course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>.

            <p>Free-to-play "Halo meets Portal" shooter Splitgate 2 says it hears you "loud and clear" about some of the eye-watering prices that have popped up on its in-game store.</p>
<p>In a video update posted to Twitter, 1047 Games' CEO Ian Proulx said he was "doubling down" on being "community first" and confirmed the team was slashing its $80 cosmetics bundle - which was reportedly already on sale from an original $145 price tag - to $40 after fans complained about the pricing.</p>

            <p>Nordic stealth game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream">Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream</a> crept out from behind some barrels during last night's Future Games Show and hit audiences over the back of the head with a release date. Some of the developers also showed up to share their enthusiasm for the game's lighting effects, which to be fair are quite nice.</p>

<p>It's coming out July 15th, pretty soon. If you're not familiar, Eriksholm is set in an alternate universe 1900s in a Scandinavian country filled with pretty props and rustic posters. It's very good-looking, very story-heavy, and having played a short preview of the opening hours, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-city-of-eriksholm-looks-captivating-but-i-wish-itd-sneak-in-some-new-ideas">so far unsurprising</a>. At least when compared to other stealth games. </p>
<p>"Observe guard behaviors, use environmental cues, and find clever solutions to overcome obstacles," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377280/Eriksholm_The_Stolen_Dream/">the Steam page</a>. "Scout environments carefully, use cover and stealth, and employ diversion tactics to evade detection." Sounds like a stealth game alright! There is a "puzzle" element to figuring out the routes around guards, we're told, and that'll maybe become a little more intriguing once all the characters come into play - each with their own ability. Although those abilities are bread and butter stealth tools: blowdart someone to sleep, throw a distracting pebble, or strangle someone from behind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pondering-geoffs-orbs">summer of eternal Geoffs</a> burns ever on. Edwin is out in Los Angeles right now, about to get obliterated by Microsoft announcements during the Xbox showcase. You lot keep reading, and we'll keep writing.

            <p>The rats have escaped, and one of them is clutching a fifteen second teaser trailer for a new Plague Tale game from Focus. The teaser briefly squeaked its way to the sunlight on Focus's Threads account before being swiftly shooed back into its hole, but the rapscallions over at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1l5sfjf/a_plague_tale_spinoff_probably_leaked/">gaming leaks and rumours subreddit</a> grabbed the details. Of course, we don't say rapscallions here. We say rapspringonions. Here's the trailer, via our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-resonance-plague-tale-legacy-accidentally-leaks-online">great mates Eurogamer</a>.</p>

<p>As I say, there's not a great deal to go on here. We see fighting, boating, what looks like a Roman colosseum, and a shadowy minotaur. I didn't play much of the second game, though I did enjoy the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-innocence">A Plague Tale: Innocence</a>, so I'm a bit behind on the rat lore. Reddit has some theories, though. A character named Basilius from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">A Plague Tale: Requiem</a> was responsible, in ancient Roman times, for unleashing Focus's excellent rat tech on the world. So this looks to be a prequel of sorts.</p>
<p>The teaser ends with number '2026', potentially a devious ARG cypher leading to a series of guerrilla marketing posters in bus stops all over Cambridge, each containing a single letter of the sentence "the game is out next year". We'll have to see!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new Tales Of remaster is on the way.</p>
<p>As part of the 30th anniversary celebration, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it tease popped up on social media earlier today, confirming there's a new Tales of Remastered project in the works. Which one? Well, Bandai Namco's being coy about that.</p>

<p>"The next Tales of Remastered will be announced this summer!" the tweet said and… well, nothing else, really. And as for exactly what "this summer" means? That could be the end of August. It could be the end of today. Who knows. As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bandai-namco-teases-new-tales-of-remaster-announcement/">VGC</a> points out, its proximity to this evening's Xbox Games Showcase is probably not a coincidence, though.</p> <div>

<p>As always, we'll let you know as/when this pops up again.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> proved to be so good, some were slow to give Bloober Team much credit, citing how it had a strong blueprint to build from. It's true that Konami's landmark original is as good a starting point as any, and Bloober Team's earlier works were often met with mixed reviews at best--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloober-team-says-its-done-with-shitty-games-and-silent-hill-2-remake-wasnt-a-fluke/1100-6527269/">the team hasn't shied away from its history</a>. To me, it was nonetheless a tall task to live up to a game that so many hold so dear. But if you count yourself among those who are waiting to see if the Polish team can do it again, and with something entirely of its own creation, Cronos: The New Dawn is starting to look like that game.</p><p dir="ltr">Back in October of last year, Bloober Team told me that it's probably always going to be a studio that makes horror games, and at Summer Game Fest Play Days 2025, the team made it clear that it wanted to find its own gameplay hook with its next project. It looked at Dead Space's combat that drove players to cut off limbs and Alan Wake's way of stripping enemies of their "shields" using light sources, and it knew it didn't want its next game to be a simple point-and-shoot horror game. From that guidance, the "merge system" was born.</p><p dir="ltr">Because the time-traveling horror story is set both before and after an epidemic wipes out much of humanity, the places you explore are often home to a great number of dead bodies. Things fell apart fast, and what's left of people have often been morphed into "orphans," the game's name for its enemy monsters. These grotesque brutes come in different shapes and sizes. Some are armored, others shoot acidic puke at you. Some fling slimy, crimson tentacles toward your face.</p><p dir="ltr">Any one of these can be formidable, but the game's merge system allows enemies to combine into a single being, stack multiple abilities at once, and essentially become boss battles of the player's own negligence. To do this, enemies will simply move toward a body and absorb it, inheriting its abilities. The game's tagline, "Don't let them merge," says it all. Wojciech Piejko, the game's co-director who led me on the hands-off demo, jokingly made a similar point as he purposely allowed the monsters to grow for the sake of the demo. "This is not how you should play this game."</p><p dir="ltr">Piejko told me that in testing the game, the team initially didn't put any restrictions on how many times enemies could merge, giving birth to towering monstrosities that became too big to fit in doorways at times. Now, the game will have some restrictions on that system, like enemies that don't merge, and of course, proper boss battles are often siloed in a controlled environment. But the game's way of allowing enemies to seep into one another and create super-enemies immediately felt like the team had found the hook it was looking for.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508865-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508865" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508865-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508865"></a><figcaption>The alternate-history sci-fi horror story will explore Poland across multiple time periods.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508865-1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Players could prevent these mergers from occurring by swiftly killing enemies, or even more proactively, by burning bodies before they reanimated, but your flamethrower, which you discharge like a circular area-of-effect attack with a button press, requires fuel, and this is a horror game, so you can bet that's a tough commodity to come by. From that, tough moment-to-moment choices will be made: Do you use the flamethrower to preemptively dispatch the potential enemies before they've been reborn, or do you save the flamethrower fuel to give yourself some breathing room in a fight for your life?</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond the merge system, I saw a game that was further along in development than I'd anticipated, given that it was only announced less than a year ago. The gunplay looked difficult in the way it should, with headshots hard to pull off on enemies--even when those enemies had multiple heads. The exploration was full of classic survival-horror tropes that I admittedly haven't grown sick of: locked gates needing boltcutters, environmental puzzles that strain reasonable definitions of lived-in spaces, and even a safe room with its own piece in the soundtrack. Notes and audio logs filled in the backstory to a purposely confounding tale inspired by Netflix's Dark. The third-person survival-horror gameplay certainly stands on the shoulders of games and stories that have come before it.</p><p dir="ltr">Although they were developed in tandem for a while and by different teams within the studio, it feels like the lessons Bloober Team learned from Silent Hill 2 are on display. Its time-twisting story has me really interested to see more, and the mix of survival-horror combat and exploration, while familiar, looks really good from this distance. I always err on the side of caution when I've seen only a portion of a much larger game I'll play in full later, but I also feel compelled to state that Cronos: The New Dawn could very well cement a new, more hopeful narrative around this studio.</p>

        <p>"Maintaining transparency and confidence with the community here is always our goal," the developer said.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Gearbox has confirmed via a statement that its games do not contain "spyware" after fans had "concerns about Take-Two's terms of service".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/598528766295202095/">statement</a>, published to Steam, explicitly states that Gearbox's publisher, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, does "not use spyware in its games", and confirmed its privacy policy applies not only to players, but also labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types.</p>
<p>Gearbox was forced to make the clarification after all of the Borderlands games were review-bombed on Steam by players who believe the updated terms were suspicious. Others were unhappy that the revised agreements made mods "a bannable offense", along with using cheats and exploits, or even just using a VPN. A forced arbitration clause for unhappy players in the US also caused considerable consternation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the details of the revised EULA have <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/598528666219110913/">fans reporting that the latest update</a>, if accepted, gives Gearbox "access to root access to your computer under the guise of 'anticheat' software," including access to "IP address, personal information, network traffic, and pictures on your PC", which the developer refutes.</p>
<p>"We know there have been some concerns from Borderlands fans about Take-Two’s Terms of Service. Maintaining transparency and confidence with the community here is always our goal, and we wanted to address some of these concerns," the statement begins.</p>
<figure>

<p>"Take-Two does not use spyware in its games. Take-Two’s Privacy Policy applies to all labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types such as console, PC, mobile app, and website. The Privacy Policy identifies the data activities that may be collected but this does not mean that every example is collected in each game or service."</p>
<p>The latter half of the statement, however, was still contentious for some.</p>
<p>"Take-Two’s Terms of Service prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to," the statement added. "We do this to protect the integrity of the game experience for all users. Take-Two generally does not seek to take action against mods that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties."</p>
<p>Gearbox locked the thread so players could not respond, but players are continuing to make their thoughts known via the user review sections of all Borderlands games on Steam.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-gearbox-ceo-randy-pitchfords-message-to-cost-sensitive-fans">Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford double-doubled down on comments about the cost of Borderlands 4</a>, by inviting "cost sensitive" fans to download <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> from the Epic Games Store for "FREE".</p>
<p>These latest comments come after Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford made headlines when he told a X/Twitter commenter that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">"real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game, even if it came with a $80 price tag.</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">He later tried to justify it</a>, all the while saying pricing was "not [his] call".</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is arriving earlier than expected on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">12th September</a>, and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">Gearbox recently shared more of its latest looter shooter in a new PlayStation showcase</a>. It showed off a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more, all to whip up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156615/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>We’re making this a trend now, huh? It’s never long before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris">Puyo Puyo Tetris</a> makes its way onto the scene. Such was the case back in 2017 with the launch of the original Switch, when a worldwide release of 2014’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/puyo_puyo_tetris">Puyo Puyo Tetris</a> (which released on Wii U and 3DS in Japan) served as one of the very first games available for Nintendo's then-fledgling hybrid.</p>
<p>It was arguably a ‘right place, right time’ moment for the crossover franchise, appealing to casual Tetris fans, puzzle game die-hards, and the massive influx of players just looking for more things to play on their shiny new system. Crucially, it helped reintroduce Puyo Puyo to the wider global market after a lengthy hiatus from localising the franchise.</p>
<p>Now, it seems Sega is aiming to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a> — an enhanced port of 2020’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris_2">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a> — as one of the very first games available for Switch 2. Unfortunately, some bizarre choices within and surrounding this release prevent it from shining as bright as previous entries.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156613/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S takes the sequel that once more mashed the worlds of Puyo Puyo and Tetris and tosses in a handful of new features, many of which are designed to take advantage of Switch 2’s new functionality. That sounds like a pretty solid grab on paper, but a deeper dive into what’s <em>actually</em> new this time around leaves this re-release feeling unjustified.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris_2">Switch review of Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a>, Scully found it to be a worthy sequel crammed with ways to experience the titular two giants of the falling-block puzzle genre. That’s all still true in this version, which retains the original’s wealth of modes, unlockables, customisability options, and more. Whether it’s a simple alternating battle between Puyo Puyo and Tetris, a mode where miniscule Puyos drop from the sky, a fast-paced race to clear 40 rows in Tetris, or Skill Battles that completely change the game by introducing light RPG elements and abilities, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S does an excellent job keeping that simplistic core gameplay loop fresh and varied.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156619/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Its replayability is bolstered by the Adventure Mode, which offers up a light-hearted story featuring the Puyo Puyo cast and a bunch of levels to chew through, as well as its multiplayer modes, which turn it into quite the entertaining party game for the right crowd.</p>
<p>In contrast to all of that juicy returning content, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S adds just a single new mode: Puyo Tetris Doubles. This introduces 2v2 battles to the mix, in which each team must control and drop two Puyos or Tetriminos simultaneously on the same board. Critically, your pieces have collision physics with one another, meaning you need to carefully coordinate with your partner to stay out of each other’s way and drop the pieces in the right places.</p>
<p>It’s a solid addition that can lead to some fun multiplayer chaos, as you desperately beg your friend to please, <em>please</em>, get their annoying square block out of the way so you can nail a T-spin in just the right place.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156620/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>All of that said, Puyo Tetris Doubles mode feels like a small addition to the greater scheme of the game. This sentiment only grows stronger when considering that the mode is limited to a select number of game styles (Versus, Party, and Fusion) and that you absolutely need other players for it to be any fun at all. While Puyo Tetris Doubles can be played with CPU partners and opponents, you’ll be banging your head against a wall trying to wordlessly coordinate with the AI. As such, single-player gamers are effectively left out in the cold when it comes to just about any substantial new content in Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S.</p>
<p>Outside of the one new multiplayer-centric mode, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is pretty light on enhancements. The game certainly looks better on the new hardware, with a resolution bump to keep things looking nice and crisp, and it runs buttery smooth. This version also adds native GameShare and GameChat support, letting you share your copy of the game wirelessly and online with friends.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the incorporation of the Switch 2’s new camera and mouse mode abilities. Players can use a connected camera to superimpose their face on various parts of the board during gameplay — a fun, if ultimately superfluous, little addition.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156617/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I don’t have anything as kind to say about the new mouse controls, which feel genuinely awful and imprecise for Puyo Puyo and Tetris gameplay compared to traditional gamepad input. Your mileage may vary, but it feels distressingly reminiscent of the shoehorned touch and waggle gimmicks that plagued the DS and Wii days. The only saving grace in my eyes is that it’s purely an optional input method and can be viewed as a weird little novelty.</p>
<p>And, well…that’s it. Aside from a few other minute adjustments to the experience, the features outlined above are really the only new things available in Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S. The game feels like it was just <em>slightly</em> updated and tweaked for release on Switch 2 compared to its Switch incarnation, which makes Sega’s release and pricing strategy for this title all the more baffling.</p>
<p>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S continues Sega’s frustrating trend of not offering any sort of upgrade path for its Switch 2 games. Just as with titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</a>, you’ll need to purchase the Switch 2 version of the game at full price, even if you own a copy on Switch 1. There may be some reason to do that for the other aforementioned titles, which see substantial performance bumps on Switch 2, but that’s not the case for Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S. This new version is barely any different from the original release and offers <em>very</em> little to anyone who played Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 the first time around.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156616/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even beyond the egregious pricing strategy, dividing Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S from its non-enhanced counterpart feels like a misstep that could seriously affect the longevity of this game from a multiplayer perspective. There’s no crossplay between the titles, which means that the online experience and player base are even further segmented than before. In the days immediately after launch, I tried multiple times to find any online matches and failed to find an opponent every single time. That could potentially improve as more people dive into the Switch 2 ecosystem in the days ahead, but it feels like a dark omen for this version’s community and future.</p>

<p>More than most, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is a tough release to put a score on. Under no circumstances is it a bad game — in fact, it’s a pretty darn decent game that’s filled to the brim with modes and features to tide puzzle lovers over for the long haul. However, that has everything to do with the solid skeleton of the original Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 and barely anything to do with the minimal additions made to this Switch 2 re-release.</p>
<p>For newcomers to the series or those who missed its original release, there’s plenty of fun to be had here. For fans who already have the original version on Switch, I struggle to think of a greater waste of Switch 2 gaming funds than this.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-hinokami-chronicles-2-dancing-with-daki<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're a <i>Demon Slayer</i>&nbsp;sicko like me, you absolutely can't wait for the next anime movie to drop. Until then, at least, we can look forward to&nbsp;<em>Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2,&nbsp;</em>the video game adaptation of the manga and anime.</p>



<h2>Into the Entertainment District</h2>

<p>At this point in the story, we're entering the Entertainment District arc, and that's where my demo at Summer Game Fest 2025 began. The fight against Upper Moon 6, Daki, has already started, and we're thrown right into the action.</p>

<p>If you played the first&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="496fe62d-e74e-4fdd-9a7c-99a72525c475" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-hinokami-chronicles-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Hinokami Chronicles</em></a>, you'll be right at home with this sequel. Though it's been several years since the previous game, combat does feel largely the same across the board.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Essentially, if the combat clicked with you in the original, it should be just as fun in&nbsp;<em>Hinokami Chronicles 2</em>. It doesn't seem like many changes, if any at all, were made, but then again, did it need to? It's an action-packed, hack-and-slash type of game that doesn't aim to reinvent the wheel.</p>



<p>Combat is focused on one-on-one battles. I got to fight Daki while playing as Tanjiro. In the manga and anime, this is a compelling showdown, as Tanjiro faces his first Upper Moon.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Tanjiro is more than competent enough to stand on his own two feet while he buys time for his friends -- those being Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui, his three wives (yes, three), Inosuke, and of course, Zenitsu.</p>



<h2>Inosuke's Mad Dash</h2>

<p>After a brief battle with Daki, we switch perspectives to Inosuke. The fight with Inosuke takes place before the first one, weirdly enough, so we get to see Daki in her creepy ribbon form after Inosuke roots out her presense.</p>

<p>I enjoyed this sequence, mostly because Inosuke could barge through the brothel and break doors and other various items spread around the area. It was actually quite satisfying, and the feedback on the controller was great here.</p>



<p>The fight with Daki as Inosuke was also par for the course, but it was cool to see her as a ribbon and also fight with Zenitsu and Tengen's wives as support.</p>

<p>The final fight of my demo, that being against a powered up Daki, was more frantic than I imagined. The previous two battles were pretty simple, but Daki was much more aggressive here.&nbsp;A SEGA representative told me this was by design. It makes sense, too; the stakes of the story are much higher now and&nbsp;<em>Demon Slayer</em>&nbsp;is firing all cylinders now that Tanjiro has to take down the Upper Six.&nbsp;</p>





<p>I'm definitely looking forward to finishing the Entertainment District arc (one of the best in the manga and anime), but I'm lukewarm on the others. The following two arcs are my least favorite of the entire series, and I don't know if having it in game form will make those any better.</p>

<p>Swordsmith Village arc is action-packed, sure, but the villains aren't as interesting, and the two Hashira making an appearance don't stack up to the previous ones we've seen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's not at all developer CyberConnect2's fault, and I'll be interested in knowing how they make the slower, more mundane moments of the follow arcs into something more exciting. Time will tell, as&nbsp;<em>Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2&nbsp;</em>launches this year on August 5.</p>

<p>Or, if that simply wasn't on the table, free for the first year. Or free with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. It's painfully obvious to everybody but Nintendo that paywalling this specific software further behind the already-pricey console is a mistake.</p>
<p>And it's a real shame that more people won't experience it, because it makes you feel good about your sizeable investment in the hardware. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> is a peaceful, in-depth exploration of the system, taking you around and inside the device, its controllers, and peripherals (some sold separately - more on that later), and highlighting its various features and novelties. This is the platform holder celebrating and deep-diving into its tech in a way that feels unusual but also <em>very</em> Nintendo.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156642/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In some ways, the granular tech focus here is a necessity. Switch 2, by its nature, is an iteration on a theme, so if you're going to charge a hefty sum for something superficially 'the same but bigger', what better way than to highlight <em>every single</em> upgrade in a fun, demo-filled game of hide-and-seek that breaks it all down?</p>
<p>And the devs really do break it <em>all</em> down. You'll be running around capacitors, over circuit boards, batteries, and myriad chips and components that appear to be modelled extremely faithfully. This is Nintendo tearing down its hardware virtually so you don't have to, and being remarkably frank in some regards. There are various examples of 'we did our best' while discussing the challenges faced with, for instance, dispersing heat and optimising battery longevity. There's no console-wars chest-beating here; it's all very self-effacing. It's essentially an Iwata Asks/Ask the Developer interview in game form.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156636/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game itself takes the form of an explorative, isometric walking-sim affair. You control a person jogging (or running if you hold down 'B') around an oversized Switch 2 and accessories propped up and exhibited across an enormous park. Or are you tiny and the Switch normal-sized? It's never made clear, but hot Welcome Tour lore aside, you run around the virtual gear while the real-life gear throws novel audio-visual and haptic feedback at you. It's a particularly great showcase for HD rumble 2 - I only hope that devs take the time to implement it properly in other games.</p>
<p>Stamp Rally plinths pop up when you approach components and gate progress between areas. So, to get to the main console, you have to locate 18 stamps on the left Joy-Con, and so on. Simple enough, though some less obvious ones do present a challenge, usually when the button or port is on the inaccessible underside and you're hunting for the plinth.</p>
<p>Then there are the minigames, with multiple variations of the same game grouped on little exhibits across the hardware. It's all very 'Switch 2 Experience' for anybody who attended those pre-launch events. There are over 50 games and beating them earns medals to unlock harder variants.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156637/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some, naturally, are better than others. The Mouse Mode ones are <em>generally</em> more challenging and/or frustrating. Removing stains with a paint scraper was much harder on my leg or the arm of the sofa than on a table (where I donned the Joy-Con straps and got the medals first try); my lap or a cushion worked fine with other games, though. If you do hit a wall with one, just move on. You're able to instantly warp to anything you've visited by hitting 'X' to bring up the menu and selecting it, a real godsend.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, you'll be hunting floating pixels, shooting balloons, colouring within the lines, guessing the angle of the kickstand - all sorts. Only one minigame — Breaststroke: Floaty Frustration — is outright bad (it lives up to its name), and while there's nothing here you're likely to fire up again once you've completed the game, they're all effective at demonstrating the possibilities of your shiny new console.</p>
<p>On that theme, and beyond the realm of proper 'games', 14 tech demos highlight neat functions and features, letting you test the noise reduction qualities of the built-in microphone, make the Joy-Con emit sound effects, and plenty more. The 3D Sound demo with the helicopter is a particular highlight, but they're all fun to mess around with. My kids absolutely loved sawing logs, shaking maracas, and hearing themselves with robot voices. The HDR demo didn't wow me, but these are cool toys to play with. Who wouldn't want to rev a motorbike with a Joy-Con?</p>

<p>Beyond <em>that</em>, dozens of info desks contain multiple-choice quizzes testing your knowledge of nearby Insight boards. It's here where Nintendo goes into detail about the hows and whys of design, and in all honesty, it's incredibly interesting for anybody with a penchant for gaming hardware.</p>
<p>The light-hearted quiz questions aren't taxing if you're paying any attention whatsoever to the slides, though it's fun to imagine a world where 'Love' or 'Glue' hold the Joy-Con on. They do get progressively more challenging as you journey inside the console, but there's typically one comedy answer, two vague possibilities, and the obvious correct one. Get a question wrong and the relevant Insight board is flagged, so you can quickly swot up and repeat.</p>
<p>Burning through Insights for review isn't the best way to digest them, and they got repetitive towards the end. One named 'Games Use Electricity' isn't as blindingly obvious as it sounds, but the title made me guffaw. You're not obliged to do any of the quiz stuff, either, and along the way there's lost property to find, some charming NPC writing, cute moments as you skate across the screen, and a bunch of nostalgic nods to Nintendo history.</p>

<p>There are also some smirk-worthy 'purely for reference' disclaimers when they show animations of the Joy-Con being wrenched from the console and other non-sanctioned actions, but Welcome Tour feels like Nintendo being refreshingly open and surprisingly confident. I can't imagine any other platform holder going into this sort of forensic detail for fear of a red-ring-level embarrassment down the line. It might even help allay fears about another Joy-Con drift debacle this gen, as the new mechanisms feature very prominently here.</p>
<p>There's an assuredness in inviting this kind of scrutiny; an admirable pride in the work. "I can't believe they're showing us as much as they are," says one of the milling NPCs, and I can only agree. It's a quality product.</p>
<p>And a surprisingly lengthy one. Due to the weird 10-day delay before playtime data is shown on your profile, I can't say exactly how many hours I've spent opening everything and getting nearly all the medals, but it's got to be seven or eight (and at least one of those was spent on the nightmare dual-mouse UFO bullet hell/star collection minigame). <em>[Update: So it seems Nintendo changed this at some point? I just checked again and it now states "10 hours or more," while the Nintendo Switch App says "11 hour(s) or more" - not sure why there's a disparity, but that total includes 30 mins of battery-testing idle time, plus extra for note-taking.]</em> There are 12 'areas' in all, going from the top of the left Joy-Con into the system itself via the dock, the Joy-Con grip and straps, and even peripherals that don't come with the system - specifically the Camera, the Pro Controller, and the Joy-Con wheels.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156641/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you don't own those things? You can still earn 'fast-track medals' from them via a cute little SOS trick, so progress isn't gated behind them. However, access to a handful of minigames and demos <em>are</em> effectively blocked if you don't have the requisite gear (the Camera, a pad which has the 'GL'/'GR' buttons, and a 4K TV).</p>
<p>For me, it's nothing to get too upset about — there's so much else to be getting on with, and what's the alternative? Remove those experiences entirely? — but it's <em>another</em> straw on the camel's back if you're already irritated by the cost. It also highlights another unavoidable aspect of Welcome Tour: as well as being part instruction manual, part demo, it's also an ad for those lovely accessories you <em>didn't</em> pick up. Yet.</p>
<p>There's an undeniable allure to seeing pristine hardware at this resolution, too, without the skin cells and dust particles and pet hairs and assorted household detritus that attaches itself the moment you remove the packaging. Welcome Tour is deliciously, fetishistically sterile, with gorgeous specular highlights on the logos as you run across them, close-ups of glistening ports and shiny sticks. It tickles the same zones as Sony's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/astro_bot">Astro Bot</a> in some ways, though this is much more of a museum piece.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156645/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It does a fantastic job of highlighting the design chops and consideration that goes into every aspect of Nintendo's products, from the 0.05mm height adjustments to individual face buttons to the minuscule tab on a single foot of the dock that means it will slide (rather than topple over) if you accidentally yank it with a cable connected.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Welcome Tour is modestly priced ($9.99 / £7.99), too, despite the wider economic context surrounding Switch 2's launch and the general upset over pricing across the industry which makes charging for it feel like the last straw. For your buck, there's a surprising amount of bang, though.</p>
<p>So, one more time, then: <em>This 100% should have been a pack-in.</em> But the software itself? It's great.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Welcome Tour is a calming, surprisingly engaging hardware exhibition with a handful of cool minigames, a trove of interesting info, and some neat demos that showcase exactly what the little system can do. It makes you feel good about buying the thing, which makes the platform holder's decision <em>not</em> to bundle it with the console utterly baffling. Featuring expensive add-ons you might not own also won't impress anyone who's indignant that the company wants another 10 bucks for this.</p>
<p>That aside, it's an undeniably fine demonstration of Nintendo's thoughtful design approach. It's cute, it's fun, and it's a shame the whole pack-in argument overshadows the delightful software. Anyone interested in tech, design, or Nintendo in general should check it out immediately.</p></section>
