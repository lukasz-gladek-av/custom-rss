		<p>MachineGames has released a new deep dive gameplay trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, with the archeological adventure set to launch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-is-coming-to-ps5-but-only-after-xbox-and-pc-december-release/">3rd December, and on PS5 in spring 2025</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gameplay Deep Dive - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ik6WEckZKh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>MachineGames Audio Director, Pete Ward, guides us on this tour through the first person action adventure. While there’s some new clips and things to see, it’s fair to say that this video covers a fair bit of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview-action-puzzles-exploration-disguises/">familiar ground from previous trailers,</a> including the figure of Tony Todd as a mysterious and very imposing antagonist right at the start of the game – who sadly passed away age 69 last week, making this game a posthumous appearance – and the companion character, photojournalist Gina, who teams up with Indy on the chase after Emmerich Voss who’s on a global hunt for otherworldly artefacts.</p>
<p>Indy has a camera of his own, using it to take photos of the world as you adventure, potentially getting clues from Indy as you do so. This fills in Indy’s journal, which will track the adventure so far and all the clips. You might also have to get your Agent 47 on with some disguises to get into restricted areas.</p>

<p>I got to go hands on with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle last month, and had a rather good time. Playing in first person (with a few snippets of third person) might be different from what you’d expect, given that Indiana Jones inspired the likes of Tomb Raider and Uncharted, but it works. I said, “I’m rather keen to see how this full adventure comes together. MachineGames are taking a less obvious path, but that’s going to lead to a much more individual and distinctive game and journey. And if you’re going to trust anyone to make a game that’s a lot to do with beating up fascists, it’s probably them!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-vote-charizard-ex-best-card-in-the-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> players have voted Charizard ex the best card in the game, with his meta game rival Mewtwo ex coming in a close second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An IGN poll asked players which of 10 popular cards was the most popular and, with 20.8% of more than 1,000 votes, Charizard ex took the crown. This Stage 2 Pokémon has the highest damage attack in the game, with Crimson Storm's 200 power able to take down any other card in a single shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex is extra powerful because of fellow fire type Moltres ex though. This card lets the player flip three coins and add a fire energy to a bench Pokémon for every heads, so players use it to overload a Charmander, Charmeleon, and eventually Charizard on the bench so it's not impacted by the loss of two energy when using Crimson Storm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second best card in Pokémon TCG Pocket, as per our player poll, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">the biggest rival of Charizard ex at the top of the meta</a>: Mewtwo ex. It came in at just a touch below with 20.1% of votes, so the two are practically neck and neck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewtwo ex works in a similar way as Charizard ex, though as a basic Pokémon itself, players will often put it directly into the active Pokémon slot. It also has a two energy, 50 damage attack, and 150 hit points to keep it around and doing damage, meaning players have enough time to set up a Gardevoir on the bench.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Stage 2 Pokémon takes some time to set up, with Ralts and Kirlia coming before it, but once it's on the bench, players can use its Psy Shadow ability to add one energy to the active Pokémon. This again counters the discard two energy cost of Mewtwo's 150 damage attack, as the standard energy joins the Gardevoir energy each turn to add two at a time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex came Pikachu ex in third place, with 17% of votes, and in fourth place, but way below, came Starmie ex. Both of these have high damage, low cost attacks, meaning if players can deploy them quick enough it's hard for opponents to build a strong board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next in the poll came <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">the infamous Trainer card Misty at 7.3%</a>, followed by Professor's Research at 5.2%, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">Farfetch'd at 5%</a>, Sabrina at 4.5%, and Dragonite at 4.1%. Only the last of these is the leader of its own deck and not a supplementary card, and seemingly the only non-ex Pokémon to stand a chance against the meta leaders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this could change when another set comes out, of course, and while developer Creatures Inc. hasn't revealed when this will be, a datamine of Pokémon TCG Pocket alluded to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-datamine-alludes-to-expansion-set-in-january">an expansion set in December and the next full release in January</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October on iOS and Android as a digital version of the beloved trading card game.

Why Unity? It’s incredibly versatile: you can create both 2D and 3D games for a variety of platforms, including PCs, consoles, and mobile devices. With a robust repository of assets and a large community, it offers extensive resources and support – an invaluable aspect when in-house resources are limited. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>User-friendly interface, extensive documentation, and strong community support</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are also among the huge advantages.

Many of those </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>with minimal coding experience</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also prefer this engine, as thanks to Blueprints, a visual scripting system, they can quickly create prototypes without having to be a coder with decades of experience.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/australia-social-media-ban-could-impact-video-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Australia is looking to pass legislation that could have a major impact as to who has access to what video games and online services in the near future. </p>



<p>The country’s government is working on a plan to ban access to social media for anyone under the age of 16. While it’s targeted to social media, the new law could severely impact access to online video games and gaming networks. </p>



<p>The act doesn’t specifically call out online gaming services, the definition of what constitutes social media could allow for that implication. According to the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2021A00076/latest/text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Online Safety Act</a>, social media service is defined as a an “electronic service” that meets these conditions:</p>



<ul>
<li>The sole or primary purpose of the service is to enable online social interaction between two or more end users</li>



<li>The service allows end users to link to, or interact with, some or all of the other end users</li>



<li>The service allows end users to post material on the service.</li>
</ul>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed that services like Xbox, Steam, PlayStation Network, Roblox, Fortnite, and others would be caught up in the litigation, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-08/how-the-age-minimum-for-social-media-will-work/104571790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it’s obvious that they could</a> fall into the category based on the definition provided. </p>



<p>The enforcement of this new legislation wouldn’t begin for at least another year as traditional social media companies and any others involved work to create a way to enforce the limit on their platforms. According to the Australian government, the companies would be help responsible for underage users on their platform, not the end users themselves.</p>



<p>It’s worth nothing that Australia hasn’t specifically mentioned video games as being a part of the restrictions. It does say, however, that other conditions can be set to determine what qualifies as a “social media service”. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, this is a situation to keep an eye on, especially for those in Australia.</p>

		<p>Crowbar Collective, the creative team behind the Half Life remake Black Mesa, has announced with Team 17 its new rogue-lite tactical co-op shooter. This new game is called Rogue Point, and it is set in a word where the world conglomerates wage war against each other after the passing of the world’s richest CEO.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rogue Point | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFQvOaxl6lk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In this corporate war, players are not one of the many groups employed by these conglomerates. Instead, players form up a team of independent vigilantes who go after these mercenary groups, known as MERX, in attempt to bring an end the power struggle between the corporations.</p>
<p>Ann Hurley, General Manager, Team17 Digital, said, “<em>Team17 has had amazing success in the shooter genre and we’re delighted to offer another incredible title in that space by teaming up with FPS veterans,</em><em>&nbsp;Crowbar Collective. We’ve seen the high quality they brought to Black Mesa and together we know Rogue Point will take things to the next level.”</em></p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;CEO and Project Lead Adam Engels said, “<em>We’re very excited to share that we have partnered with Team 17 for our upcoming co-op shooter,&nbsp;Rogue&nbsp;Point. We cannot wait to go in depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new IP (as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full time development studio). We can’t thank Team 17 enough for their support and expertise. Just like Black Mesa, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of&nbsp;Black Mesa&nbsp;and having Team 17 as a partner for&nbsp;Rogue Point&nbsp;helps us focus on development and community feedback!</em>”</p>

<p>Rogue Point’s campaign will be dynamic so no playthrough will be the same, due to how the mission structures and designs change. The missions themselves are set in four different locations. Players will be able to equip various types of weapons and equipment, along with campaign modifiers which all add to the dynamism of Rogue Point. Changing weapons and equipment will be necessary as different MERX groups are divided into classes with their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>At the moment, it appears Rogue Point is on PC via Steam only and a release date is to be confirmed.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-unreal-engine-5-better/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-can-handle-unreal-engine-5-way-better-than-base-model-new-video-highlights.1032660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-unreal-engine-5-better/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PS5 Pro seems way more capable of handling the demanding Unreal Engine 5 than the base model, as the system runs the demo that first showed what sort of visuals the engine can deliver much better than any other console currently on the market.</p>
<p>As shown in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cycu1</a>, The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5 demo runs considerably better on the newly released system than on the base system without a dedicated patch that would allow the demo to take full advantage of the PS5 Pro's power and features. Resolution changing to keep performance steady is rather noticeable in some sequences, but it is still impressive how the console handles this demanding demo, which uses the very first version of Unreal Engine 5 that lacks many of the improvements that have been introduced over the years.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Matrix Awakens - Can PS5 Pro handle this Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKnW095Kpys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It would be quite interesting to see how the PS5 Pro would run The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5 demo if it were updated to the latest version of the engine. As showcased in a video <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-the-matrix-awakens-cpu-gpu-performance-improvements/">last month</a>, the improvements introduced to the engine since its very first version make quite a difference in terms of image quality and performance.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the mid-generation refresh system by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crowbar-collective-rogue-point<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Mesa&nbsp;</em>developer Crowbar Collective has announced&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point</em>, a co-operative multiplayer roguelite shooter that the studio says will offer "hundreds of ways to play". It'll be published by British veteran studio Team17.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world where the mysteriously-named "CEO", the richest man in the game's world, has died. Using an app called MERX, corporations are attempting to carve up his empire by hiring mercenary teams to fight one another.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might believe, it doesn't seem like you're playing as one of these armies. Rather, you'll play as members of the titular Rogue Point, an "elite, independent vigilante squad" aiming to put an end to MERX and save the day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rogue-point-crowbar-collective-shootout.jpg?itok=hnXDYDkR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rogue-point-crowbar-collective-shootout.jpg?itok=pRQ6C-RW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>pits you against armies of merciless mercenaries.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with up to three friends, you'll take part in what Crowbar Collective and Team17 call "challenging missions", making your way through a campaign in which "no two playthroughs are alike", which is, of course, the standard roguelite boast.</p>

<p>As you play, you'll unlock gameplay modifiers and gear that will help you create "loadouts specific to the needs of the mission", and you'll also come up against MERX classes which will "challenge you in new and surprising ways".</p>

<p>The two studios are also talking up what they call the "Parametric Design System", which they say contributes to "new strategies and challenges with every play" across four "diverse" locations.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point</em>, which shows off some of the tactical gameplay you can expect from the co-op shooter, right here.</p>




<p><em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>will serve as developer Crowbar Collective's second game, following on from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/black-mesa" rel="nofollow"><em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>remake&nbsp;<em>Black Mesa</em></a>, which was finally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-mesa-release-date-finally-set-for-march-2020" rel="nofollow">released back in 2020</a> after enjoying a rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-mesa-finally-adds-xen-levels-roadmap-to-10" rel="nofollow">protracted development cycle</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, unlike&nbsp;<em>Black Mesa</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>isn't a remake, so it'll be interesting to see how Crowbar Collective handles its first original IP. There's no release date yet, but&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on PC via Steam when it does launch.</p>

Since then, the franchise has remained a bright spot in Nintendo’s RPG lineup, with new titles and remakes of previous ones showing up throughout the years to the delight of fans.

Here, they meet an entirely new cast of characters, such as their new flying pig-like companion Snoutlet, and set off on an adventure across multiple islands to restore the shattered world of Concordia.</p><p>You spend your time sailing across Concordia on Shipshape Island—an island that functions as, well, a ship. This acts as your main hub, where you’ll send the brothers out to explore other islands in the sea by firing them out of cannons. It’s a unique system that helps the game feel much more expansive than previous titles in the series.</p><h2 id="h20779"><a id="genre"></a>What kind of game is <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>?</h2><p>As with all of the other games in the Mario &amp; Luigi series, <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> is a role-playing game that features turn-based combat akin to games like <em>Final Fantasy</em> or <em>Dragon Quest</em>—albeit a bit more family-friendly and accessible. The game’s battle system allows you to assign specific attacks to Mario and Luigi separately, such as hammer smashes and jumps, as well as combine the brothers for attack combos that can deal devastating damage.</p><figure id="" data-id="0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-recommend-id="image://0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1178" data-height="664" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and Luigi face off against hostile creatures." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario and Luigi face off against hostile creatures." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-recommend-id="image://0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1178" data-height="664" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and Luigi face off against hostile creatures." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you’re not in battle, you explore Concordia’s various islands where you engage with NPCs to expand upon the world-building and complete side quests. This entry in the series even includes Bros. Moves, which helps you solve environmental puzzles you encounter by letting the brothers use fire and ice spells or even roll into a ball.</p><h2 id="h20780"><a id="long"></a>How long is <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>?</h2><p><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> is the longest game in the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi </em>series, spanning around <strong>30 hours for an average playthrough</strong>. This would include pushing through the main campaign while casually dabbling in a bit of the optional content on offer.</p><p>Those looking to see everything in <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, however, can easily squeeze another 10-20 hours out of the RPG doing all of its side quests and supplementary mini-games for a total of <strong>50 or more hours of total playtime</strong>.</p><h2 id="h20781"><a id="reviews"></a>What do the reviews say about <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>?</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> has received mixed reviews</a></span>. Most reviewers have praised its enjoyable combat and generally likable cast of characters. However, many have bemoaned the overabundance of dialogue, endlessly repetitive jokes, and excessive hand-holding. Perhaps most importantly, some critics say the game feels much more geared toward a younger audience than previous titles in the series. As such, Nintendo may have overcorrected toward that demographic just a bit too much.</p><figure id="" data-id="094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-recommend-id="image://094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="833" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-recommend-id="image://094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="833" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>’s somewhat polarizing reception, I’d recommend watching or reading a variety of reviews to weigh how these various pros and cons might affect your enjoyment of the game before you spend your hard-earned money on it. Everyone’s different, of course, and what bothers some folks might not bother you at all.</p><h2 id="h20782"><a id="coop"></a>Is <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> co-op?</h2><p>Though <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> teases the idea of co-op by name alone,<strong> you may be disappointed to hear that this role-playing outing provides no multiplayer functionality whatsoever</strong>.

Multiple characters including Henry Czerny as Eugene Kittridge, the IMF director who memorably antagonized Hunt in the original 1996 movie, narrate the new trailer to set up the stakes and quickly summarize decades of Tom Cruise’s hero always narrowly saving the day at ever-increasing levels of international risk. </p><p>The trailer shows Hunt’s hacker accomplices Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) back at his side along with new recruit Grace (Hayley Atwell), who was first introduced in<em> Dead Reckoning</em> as a thief who later turned IMF agent. With both pieces of the key to the submarine housing the rogue AI, the crew attempt to get onboard and disable the all-predicting, ephemeral nemesis while everyone and everything that could possible get in their way seems to do exactly that. </p><p>Unlike its predecessor, <em>Final Reckoning</em> wasn’t filmed during the pandemic and will hopefully showcase more of the franchise’s charismatic ensemble cast actually acting together at the same locations and sets. <em>Mission Impossible 8</em> also clearly carries on Cruise’s recent penchant for spectacular stunts. The new trailer shows him hanging off the side of a small airplane shortly after takeoff as he fights with the pilot inside. </p><p>And while the title and trailer certainly make it seem like this could be Ethan Hunt’s last rodeo, Cruise himself doesn’t seem to have any plans of stepping away from the character in the near-future.

            <p>The team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a> - the fan-made reimagining of Valve's Half-Life - has announced its next game.</p>
<p>It's called Rogue Point, and developer Crowbar Collective describes it as a "rogue-lite tactical co-op shooter", which will offer up a "strategic approach to high-octane combat".</p>
<p>This will all see players unlocking various weapons and cosmetics to help them on their way, as they shoot through a "dynamic campaign" (the developer promises that no two playthroughs will be the same).</p>

<p>"The CEO, the richest man in the world, is dead," Rogue Point's official blurb begins. "Cutthroat conglomerates seek to carve up his kingdom. Using the MERX app, rival businessmen can order private mercenary armies as easily as ordering takeout! Only Rogue Point, an elite, independent vigilante squad, dares to fight back."</p><p>Players will need to do what they can to eliminate the MERX, and "put an end to the corporate war" that has befallen society. This can be done with up to four others, making up a team of justice-seeking gun-slingers.</p>
<p>"We cannot wait to go in depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new IP (as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full time development studio)," project lead Adam Engels said today, thanking Rogue Point partner Team 17 in the process.</p>
<p>"Just like Black Mesa, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of Black Mesa and having Team 17 as a partner for Rogue Point helps us focus on development and community feedback!"</p>
<p> You can check out a trailer for Rogue Point in the video above. If you are interested, you can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/">wishlist Rogue Point on Steam now</a>. There is currently no release date other than a vague "2025". </p>
<p>We called Crowbar's past work a "masterful remake that improves upon a classic" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-mesa-review-a-masterful-remake-that-improves-upon-a-classic">Eurogamer's Half-Life: Black Mesa review</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover-and-photo-mode-coming-next-week.1032615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Shift Up have announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover, as well as when you can expect the former's photo mode to arrive.</p>

<p>Both the crossover and the photo mode will be added to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>in an update on November 20th, and they'll both be completely free as well, so you won't have to pay to let Eve cosplay as everyone's favorite blindfolded android.</p>

<p>According to Shift Up CTO Dong Ki Lee,&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>"significantly inspired&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>", and the collaboration between&nbsp;the latter's director Kim Hyung Tae and the former's Yoko Taro was "marked by mutual respect and creativity".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover-costumes.jpg?itok=QXY2pXv6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover-costumes.jpg?itok=dBMWsizy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover will arrive next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The crossover will introduce a host of costumes for&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>based on&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>characters like 2B and A2, as well as&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>stalwart Emil, who will be the proprietor of a shop from which you can buy "eleven different collaboration-special items".</p>

<p>It's not just the&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover, either. This update is also adding a photo mode to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, allowing you to pause the action and take photos of the game's characters, landscapes, and more.</p>

<p>The photo mode will, of course, come complete with lots of different filters and options, so even if you don't quite have that perfect shot lined up, you should be able to get what you need by tweaking a few menu toggles here and there.</p>




<p>This update will also introduce various quality-of-life improvements and gameplay tweaks to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, including new character customization options for Eve, new battle features, and more. You can see a list of what's new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/11/stellar-blades-nier-automata-dlc-photo-mode-launch-nov-20/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, it's an action game created by&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>developer Shift Up, although unlike that game,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sony-publishing-deal" rel="nofollow">a console exclusive</a> and not a mobile gacha RPG.</p>

Also, we got Cobb literally scorching a mother and son from the rival Maroni crime family, an inside look at the devastation The Riddler caused when he flooded parts of the city at the end of <em>The Batman</em>, and insight into Cobb’s plan to take over Gotham. </p><p>As great as the show was, it left a number of questions we need answered when we return to Gotham in 2026 for <em>The Batman: Part II</em></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-recommend-id="image://968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-recommend-id="image://968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In <em>The Batman</em>, Cobb is more of an annoyance than a major player in the action, but he had flashes of being a formidable foe to the billionaire vigilante. As Carmine Falcone’s (John Turturro) lieutenant and drug peddling nightclub owner, Cobb was able to talk his way out of multiple Batman beatdowns and lead him on the one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/iA_wCcG-dQQ?si=NyyehKxTWeDaVITS&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/iA_wCcG-dQQ?si=NyyehKxTWeDaVITS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coolest movie car chases</a></span> of 2022.

In eight award-worthy episodes of <em>The Penguin, </em>Cobb has dismantled the Maroni crime family, inspired mutinies in all of the rival gangs, and is figuratively and literally on top of Gotham. Although Gotham produces a new villain every day, for now, Oz is the king. And he’s already shown how he can influence the media and politics, making him even more formidable.</p><p>The biggest confirmation of Oz being Batman’s next nemesis is in the last scene of <em>The Penguin </em>when Eve Karlo (Carmen Ejogo), creepily cosplaying as Cobb’s mother, tells him there’s nothing in his way of Gotham being his, just before someone gets the bright idea to send the bat signal into the sky.

While Batman was solving riddles and doing the most brooding version of flirting with Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), Sofia Gigante was being drugged, electrocuted, and assaulted in Arkham Asylum thanks to Cobb. Now that she’s back in Arkham Asylum because of the same person, Batman may have gained an ally he doesn’t know he has yet.</p><p>In the comics, Gigante is secretly the serial killer The Hangman, an identity she denies is hers in the show, and runs into issues with Batman. Even if she isn’t The Hangman in <em>The Penguin</em>, she’s shown she’s a ruthless tactician willing to bomb an already decimated community like Crown Point if it means blowing up Cobb’s operation in the process. It would be safe to assume the only joy Gigante feels is the recurring thought of how she will enact revenge on Penguin. Why not let your half-sister’s love interest help do the job for you?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Corruption in Gotham is like sand in the desert. In episode six of <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb spoke about politicians diverting resources like electricity and infrastructure repair to richer communities instead of to the poorer communities like Crown Point that are living in rubble and FEMA tents. In<em> Batman </em>lore, this type of nefarious prejudice is usually the work of one shadowy cabal, The Court of Owls. </p><p>This is a secret society comprised of the wealthiest and most influential people who control every part of Gotham, yet only exist to most of the citizens as an urban legend. The classist divide in the city was a main motivator for The Riddler, who grew up as a poor orphan, targeting corrupt wealthy individuals who he felt abandoned those with similar upbringings. That insidious elitism, along with Gotham’s criminal hierarchy being in flux thanks to Cobb and Gigante’s turf war, might be enough for the true rulers of Gotham to come out of the shadows in <em>The Batman Part II</em>.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In two episodes, the Maroni crime family succession tree was dismantled after Cobb set fire to matriarch Nadia Maroni (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and heir to the throne Taj Maroni (Aria Shahghasemi), before fighting head of the family Salvatore Maroni (Clancy Brown) to the point of a heart attack. </p><p>The Maroni family is no joke and played a pivotal role in <em>The Batman</em>, as Salvatore tried blackmailing Batman’s father Thomas Wayne while he was running for mayor by threatening to release information about his wife Martha Wayne’s struggles with mental illness. This led to a domino effect where Thomas inadvertently got the journalist killed by Carmine Falcone after asking the crime boss to only threaten them into silence, and then got himself killed when he tried to turn Falcone in. In a not-so-roundabout way, the Maroni family is responsible for Batman losing his parents. </p><p>Now, that the heads of the family are gone, is there a long lost familial successor looking to take on the mantle and, as a result, the ire of Batman?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the biggest missteps the movie made that was fixed in the show was the relatively little time fans got to spend in the playground of nightmares that is Arkham Asylum.

Given the fact she’s back in her old, deranged stomping grounds, and the best <em>Batman</em> villains are in Arkham, <em>The Batman Part II </em>would be foolish to treat it like a side quest after <em>The Penguin</em> made us want to live in that world for longer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Gotham is fun, but it’s just one city. Both the movie and the show keep all of the action inside the murderous metropolis. But, in <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb mentioned a few times how partnering with the Chinese crime syndicate The Triads could take his operation international. Now that they not only agreed to join his alliance with the other rival gangs of Gotham, but also had internal mutinies that helped Cobb ascend to the top of Gotham’s crime world, it looks like it’s only a matter of time before we see the true scope of Gotham’s influence beyond the city limits. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros/Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Carmine Falcone spread his seed far and wide, and somehow produced two of the most badass women to ever hit Gotham. Kyle may have despondently left the city after deeming it beyond saving at the end of <em>The Batman</em>, but we all know the woman who eventually becomes Catwoman always crawls back to the city that made her. And her letter to her imprisoned half-sister at the end of <em>The Penguin</em>’s season finale is her first step back home.</p><p>Kyle’s letter not only woke Gigante out of her catatonic gaze, but brought a smile to her face. This is arguably the most compelling wrinkle that <em>The Penguin </em>adds to <em>The Batman Part II</em>’s storyline. What could she have possibly written that would make a woman, who could be facing death in prison, feel joy? Did she congratulate her on wiping out multiple crime families, including the one they were both born to and victimized by? Did she let her know that she thinks she’s innocent (she isn’t) and she was framed (she wasn’t)? Or, maybe she told her a plan she has to get her sister out so they can enact her revenge alongside her lover boy Batman?</p><p>Whatever she wrote, <em>The Batman Part II </em>needs to find a way to make that a catalyst for the sisterly meet-up we all want. Plus, I’m sure if you have undeniable talent like Kravitz and Milioti in your cinematic universe, you’re legally obligated to make them share the screen. Or, you should be. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>The Batman</em> director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Reeves told us</a></span> from the start that Batman wouldn’t been swooping in to save the day in <em>The Penguin </em>because the show was meant to focus solely on telling the story of Gotham’s underworld, not how Batman fights their crimes.

How much prep time does this man need?! </p><p>It’s going to ultimately be amazing when Batman returns into this expanded underworld in <em>The Batman Part II, </em>but it would really insult our intelligence if there aren’t parts of the movie where Batman at least acknowledges he was aware of the events that transpired in <em>The Penguin </em>and let’s us in on what the world’s greatest detective was doing with his time.

While probably best known for his movie appearances in the Candyman and Final Destination franchises, the actor also has voiced some big roles in video games the past few years--such as Venom in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/" data-ref-id="1900-6418134">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Insomniac Games paid tribute to Todd over the weekend, posting a statement <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1855085273035530368" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> noting the team was "heartbroken" by his death. "He brought so much joy to our studio during the production of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and to many fans around the world with his inimitable voice and presence. We are Venom... forever," said Insomniac.</p><p dir="ltr">Spider-Man 2 saw the introduction of the symbiote, portrayed by Todd. Last year, the actor showed up with other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-gets-comic-con-panel-this-month-with-a-bunch-of-big-names/1100-6515752/" data-ref-id="1100-6515752">big names from Spider-Man 2 for a Comic-Con panel called "Symbiotic Relationships."</a> Todd also told <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/marvels-spider-man-2-venom-tony-todd-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel.com</a> before the game launched that "Venom is one of the coolest Marvel characters ever created." Last month, Insomniac revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-comes-to-pc-in-january/1100-6527271/" data-ref-id="1100-6527271">Spider-Man 2 will arrive on PC on January 30</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Todd will also be featured in next month's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

It was truly awe-inspiring getting the opportunity to know and work with him."</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, Todd also voiced roles in Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Half-Life: Alyx, and Back 4 Blood as Doctor Rogers. Meanwhile, his film career spanned decades, showing up in Platoon, The Rock, and 2021's Candyman.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/machinegames/status/1855317325584449952" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We had the great privilege of working with Tony Todd and will miss him dearly.

<p>The good news is these kinds of teases often come ahead of an imminent release, so, hopefully, we won't have to wait long for formal confirmation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Microsoft has announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-november-line-up-announced">Xbox Game Pass line-up for the first half of November</a>, headlined by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator">Goat Simulator</a> Remastered and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Xbox recently reaffirmed its commitment to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reaffirms-commitment-to-bringing-great-games-to-more-people-on-more-devices">"bringing great games to more people on more devices"</a> and plans to "extend" its strategy to bring its most notable franchises to other platforms like PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-will-make-exploration-feel-truly-rewarding-says-machinegames/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, MachineGames has <a href="https://youtu.be/ik6WEckZKh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released </a>a new deep dive video for the upcoming action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. In the footage, Audio Director Pete Ward claimed that the game will make exploration feel truly rewarding, especially for those players who like to wander off.</p>
<p><em>The game is designed around the charm and resourcefulness of our hero. You will be thrown into this story-driven&nbsp;journey where Indiana must hunt for clues to uncover the Great Circle's mysteries. This race for answers will take you to ancient crypts, lost civilizations, and much more.</em></p>
<p><em>The focus for this game is adventure. When you venture into the unknown we want exploration to feel truly rewarding. We carefully crafted each environment to encourage players to uncover clues left, discover valuable objects, and reveal hidden secrets that can aid you in your adventure.</em></p>
<p><em>While the vividly recreated locations you visit have a clear goal driving the story forward, you'll always feel enticed to explore the world and discover the many secrets hiding around every corner. Open areas give you the freedom to find your own adventures beautiful. In these areas, let your curiosity take you off the main path and uncover new missions and mysteries.</em></p>
<p>As an adventure game first and foremost said to have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-a-spiritual-successor-to-classic-adventure-game-fate-of-atlantis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by 1992's classic point-and-click game Fate of Atlantis, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will also place a significant emphasis on puzzles.</p>
<p><em>During your adventure, Indiana's versatile tools are at your disposal. It's up to you to find clever uses for each of them. That includes Indiana's camera. Snap photos to reveal historical insights and important clues. Or if you feel the need, use it to receive puzzle hints.</em></p>
<p><em>The journal is your complete guide. It starts as a blank slate but becomes a detailed archive of your journey with maps, photos, and letters. It's a reminder of where you've been and, for the sharp observer, a hint about where to head next.</em></p>
<p><em>Indiana's greatest tool is his mind. Just like Indie, you'll use yours to navigate buried tombs and activate forgotten puzzles while avoiding deadly traps. Clues from the journal, traversal, and decryption are just a few of the things you'll need to figure out the solutions. Every puzzle is designed to fit seamlessly into the world. They range from smaller challenges hiding forbidden secrets to epic obstacles leading to greater mysteries. Solving these puzzles will make you feel like the world's greatest archaeologist.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be released on December 9 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, while a PlayStation 5 version is being <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepared</a> for Spring 2025. Meanwhile, check out our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a> from a press event.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Minimalist RPG Songs of Rats Revealed for Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/songs-of-rats-dark-indie-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-minimalist-rpg-songs-of-rats-revealed-for-next-year.1032573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/songs-of-rats-dark-indie-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Salient Games and publisher Tesseract Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats</em>, an "indie dark role-playing game inspired by choose-your-own-adventure books". It's coming to PC sometime early next year.</p>

<p><em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>takes place in a cluster of broken-down spaceships and space stations "crushed and combined into one massive structure" known as the Wreckage. Bizarrely, due to "advanced self-repair technology", the Wreckage has become a haven for its inhabitants.</p>

<p>You must venture into the darkest, deepest corners of this "dangerous yet livable labyrinth" in order to uncover "the dark secrets of fallen civilizations", together with a team of fellow explorers that will help you to navigate the Wreckage's many dangers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/songs-of-rats-announced-mutants-battle.jpg?itok=rtgbYN2L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/songs-of-rats-announced-mutants-battle.jpg?itok=MWG2kHli 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>has a deliberately lo-fi, grainy aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><p>As a roguelike,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>will feature an ever-changing world, along with a range of "strange, human and inhuman enemies" with which to do battle. It wouldn't be much of an eldritch superstructure without them, after all.</p>

<p>Exploring will not just get you combat encounters with horrors; it'll also net you bonuses that you can use to upgrade your character, making you better-equipped to survive the dangers of the Wreckage.</p>

<p>Largely speaking,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>tells its story through text and evocative lo-fi images rather than hoity-toity fully-3D graphics, so if you've got any degree of nostalgia for the old days of RPGs, then this one will likely serve you well.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a good sense of the strange, chilly sci-fi aesthetic the game is going for.</p>




<p>Aesthetically,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>shares a fair amount in common with 2022's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/norco" rel="nofollow">retro-style adventure game&nbsp;<em>Norco</em></a>, although it's perhaps a little closer to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/classic-gold-box-rpgs-to-hit-steam-later-this-month" rel="nofollow">old-school dungeon-crawlers</a> like&nbsp;<em>Eye of the Beholder&nbsp;</em>on the gameplay front.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam sometime in the first quarter of 2025. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3300470/Songs_of_Rats/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it here if you like</a>.</p>

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/27/15958176/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-gameplay-preview-nazi-punching"><em>Wolfenstein</em></a> studio released a nearly 15-minute-long video, which seems to give a very good idea of what to expect in the full release. That includes plenty of cryptic puzzle solving inside of ancient ruins, and lots of using a whip in both combat and traversal.</p><p>While the exploration is obviously at the heart of the game, the new video makes it look like there will be quite a bit of variety to the combat as well. The hand-to-hand brawling looks a bit like a boxing game, but you can combine it with the whip to pull enemies towards you like Scorpion in <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. And there are plenty of other fun details, like an excellent adventure journal and an old-school camera that can take photos and provide puzzle hints. If nothing else, it should fill that <em>Tomb Raider</em> or <em>Uncharted</em> shaped hole in your gaming time.</p><div><p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>is arguably Xbox’s biggest release of the year, following other notable first-party games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc"><em>Hellblade II</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24262053/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-review"><em>Starfield</em>’s <em>Shattered Space</em> expansion</a>, and the upcoming<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248947/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-cloud-release-date"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em></a><em>. </em>While it’s coming to Xbox and PC this year (it’ll be on Game Pass day one), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"><em>the Great Circle</em> will also be launching on the PS5 in the spring of 2025</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293395/mattel-wicked-doll-porn-website-url-misprint-error"><h2>Mattel accidentally linked a porn site on Wicked doll packaging</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291530/dji-neo-vertical-video-faster-tracking"><h2>DJI just added the two most requested features to its $199 Neo drone</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289937/nyt-tech-workers-strike-games-wordle"><h2>NYT tech workers are making their own games while on strike</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291281/mobvoi-home-walking-pad-review-treadmills-fitness"><h2>I got a desk treadmill to relieve stress — instead, it stressed me out</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/10/24291418/stardew-valley-mario-luigi-brothership-heretic-installer"><h2>Chill games for a chill weekend</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This look at the back end, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently shared</a></span> by <em>Pokémon</em> community account CentroLeaks, outlines a suspected upcoming schedule of the card game from new events to new booster packs, with the card set after Genetic Apex <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly arriving around January 29</a></span>.</p><p>That deduction was based on the apparent naming convention in the code which tags current in-game events as part of A1, while after January they move to A2. But that doesn’t mean players will have to wait several months before the game’s first new cards appear. There’s also an A1a booster pack event starting around December 17 which seems like it could be part of a smaller, mid-season mini-expansion. That’s a good thing if it turns out to be accurate, as anyone playing daily up to that point will have likely filled out much of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s existing Pokédex outside of the rarest cards. </p><p>Other significant milestones in the datamind findings <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684">point to a new store update</a></span> on December 1, as well as something Bulbasuar-themed appearing in the weeks after that. In the meantime, November appears to have a part 2 to the current Meowth event waiting in the wings, as well as a potential Black Friday event and something called “Mass Outbreak.” </p><p>If you ask me, the updates can’t come soon enough. I’m starting to tire ever so slightly of the existing battle meta, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506">Lapras event</a></span> is truly a grind. Fortunately, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> still excels at the thing I need it for most: 5 minutes of peace staring at beautiful <em>Pokémon </em>cards while I drink my morning coffee. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
