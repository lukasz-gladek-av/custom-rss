			<p>A Dino Crisis remake powered by Unreal Engine 5 is in development by a fan, and a playable demo is now available for download, allowing fans to try out this remake themselves.</p>
<p>The Project Crisis remake is currently being developed by a single developer, Stefano Cagnani, so we shouldn't expect the same level of quality as other fan-made projects with multiple people working on them. Still, the demo is still an interesting way to see how the classic survival horror game would look and play using more modern technology. The demo can be downloaded <a href="https://stefano-cagnani-3.itch.io/dino-crisis-rebirth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Despite being a beloved classic, CAPCOM hasn't shown much interest in remaking the first entry in the Dino Crisis to date.&nbsp;<span>Back in&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August</a>, producer and director of the original game, Shinji Mikami, talked about the franchise, saying that the success of the Monster Hunter series reduced the need for a new entry in the series, a weird statement considering the two franchises have nothing in common.</span>&nbsp;Still, as CAPCOM did bring back one of its beloved series that hadn't seen a new entry in the while, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/">Dead Rising</a>, there's still hope for a remake of the original Dino Crisis in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>While waiting for CAPCOM to bring back the series, PlayStation 5 owners will soon be able to enjoy the original Dino Crisis on their system, as the game will be added to the PlayStation Plus Classics lineup this month, together with another beloved classic, Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain.</p>

As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-wikipedia-page-locked-after-salty-fans-try-to-rewrite-its-critically-acclaimed-reception">Eurogamer</a>, the page has now been locked following some deranged edits that altered review scores to appear much lower than they actually were.</p>

<p>These salty edits were apparently the work of the usual suspects. You know, the sort of silly sausages that love games so much they spend every waking hour not playing them so they’ve got more time to harass voice actors - although there’s also some speculation it might have been series diehards sceptical about the positive reception. The edits have been attributed to both <a href="https://x.com/airbagged/status/1842644442433700020">“anti-woke dorks”</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1fwvmqb/seriously_trolls_cant_handle_sh2rs_success_so">“trolls”</a>, although I’ve also seen the words “Asmongold Subreddit” floating about.</p>
<p>There was also some highly ignorable twattery around Maria’s new character design not being suitably jorkable doing the rounds, which is very funny if you know where the story goes. The nonsense has even found it’s way to series artist Masahiro Ito, <a href="https://x.com/adsk4/status/1843210691492422049">who Xeetered</a> “This is NOT the account to take it out on. I decided to block all of them who did it to me IMMEDIATELY from now on,” presumably in response to general trolling.</p>
<p>I did briefly check Wikipedia just to see how easy it was to edit a page, since I’d never done it before. Turns out, yep, it takes mere seconds. Don't worry, I changed it back. </p>

<p>The Silent Hill 2 Remake itself has been available to play for a few days now, but only for fans that purchased the Digital Deluxe edition. I will call "premium access" out as bullshit whenever I see it, but those early players are at least having a good time - it’s currently sitting at a 96% ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ on Steam. None of this means anything until our man-in-the-fog Brendy unleashes his own verdict, of course, so do check back for that soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Epic Games has offered a few more details on its under-wraps Disney project, which will connect into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The mysterious project was announced earlier this year alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">$1.5bn investment by Disney into Epic Games</a>, strengthening the already-close bond between the two companies. 
</p>
<p>
Fortnite features dozens of Disney skins, including characters from Star Wars, Marvel and now Pixar franchises. In the coming weeks, Disney animation villains such as Cruella De Vil and Maleficient will also join the game's ranks. 
</p>
<p>
All of these skins can be used without restriction: Spider-Man and Luke Skywalker can team up to headshot enemies with shotguns and uzis before doing the floss dance to celebrate. But it sounds like this won't be the case with Epic Games' Disney-specific mode.
</p>
<p>
"Not every outfit will be able to do everything," Epic Games exec Saxs Persson said, speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">The Verge</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"A [Lego] minifig doesn't hold a gun," he continued (which is true to a point - minifigures aren't used in Fortnite's battle royale mode, though they certainly can wield guns in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>). "Brands should be able to enforce the brand guidelines to the degree that they're comfortable with that brand being associated with particular ratings."
</p><p>The Disney experience will share - to some extent - Fortnite players' existing "lockers" of cosmetics. But just as some skins don't have Lego versions, it seems likely many Fortnite skins won't have Disney alternatives either (so John Wick and Predator seem unlikely to be rubbing shoulders with the Seven Dwarves).</p>
<p>
"Disney wants a persistent place where all things Disney can be there, but they want to be part of an ecosystem we've built," Persson continued. 
</p>
<p>
The game will connect with Fortnite so players can "flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience," he added, saying that players will be able to join the experience either by coming "in the Disney front door or the Fortnite front door".
</p>
<p>
This sounds like the game will be available as a standalone product, but will also be accessible within Fortnite as another one of the game's modes. Indeed, this fits with the publishing model Epic Games has discussed previously, and again at Unreal Fest in Seattle last week, where Unreal Engine projects will eventually be publishable seamlessly both on their own and within the hugely-popular Fortnite. 
</p>
<p>
It is, as ever, a very busy time for Epic Games, following this past weekend's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-live-event-sees-56m-players-defeat-doctor-doom-in-hour-long-battle">Fortnite Doctor Doom live event</a> and the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-launches-major-new-lawsuit-in-app-store-fight-this-time-against-samsung-and-google">recently-launched legal action against Google and Samsung</a>.

            <p>Assassin's Creed and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a> studio Ubisoft has acknowledged last week's buyout reports, stating it "regularly reviews all its strategic options in the interest of its stakeholders".</p>
<p>On Friday, it was claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">Ubisoft and Chinese tech company Tencent were considering a buyout</a>, to help stabilise and "bolster" the French firm, following a decline in its market value.</p>
<p>One of the possibilities reportedly being discussed to do this would involve teaming up to take Ubisoft private. These talks were said to be in the early stages, and nothing was certain.</p>

<p>Today, Ubisoft shared a statement regarding this report with Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"Ubisoft has noted recent press speculation regarding potential interests around the Company," the company wrote. "It regularly reviews all its strategic options in the interest of its stakeholders and will inform the market if and when appropriate.</p>
<p>"The company reiterates that management is currently focused on executing its strategy, centred on two core verticals - open world adventures and GaaS [Games as a Service]-native experiences."</p>

<p>In September, Ubisoft saw its share price drop after the company announced its upcoming release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will now debut on 14th February 2025, instead of its previously planned November arrival.</p>
<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">ultimately agreed to delay Shadows after seeing "softer than expected" sales for Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which has now reportedly just passed the 1m sales mark after launching on 30th August.</p>
<p>Prior to this, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-investor-writes-open-letter-to-express-deep-dissatisfaction-with-company-performance">Ubisoft investor wrote an open letter to the company</a> to express their "deep dissatisfaction" with its performance and strategic direction. In this letter from Juraj Krupa of Slovakian hedge fund AJ Investments and Partners, the investor urged the board to take Ubisoft private, calling it "a great company", but one that is "deeply undervalued" due to mismanagement from the Guillemot family and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Halo developer 343 Industries has rebranded as Halo Studios and announced that they have multiple Unreal Engine-based games in development.</p>
<p><iframe title="A New Dawn | Halo Studios" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first Unreal project that they’ve discussed is the purely internal ‘Project Foundry’, a research project that looks to explore all the possibilities and potential that Unreal Engine can give to future Halo games. The fruits of this effort are seen in the video with a variety of different worlds and landscapes, from a traditional Halo-y environment to a fully Flood-infested world.</p>
<p>This will mark an end of the long lineage of Halo game engines that go all the way back to the original game on Xbox, though it’s never been the easiest engine to work with. As Bungie passed the baton over to the newly formed 343 Industries, the new team revamped the game engine for the tail end of the Xbox 360 era and Halo 4. Halo 5 was meant to have a lot of work on the production pipeline, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/01/halo-boss-reveals-reason-behind-infinites-new-slipspace-engine-ign-unfiltered">343 leadership admit that never really happened</a> when hyping up the Slipspace engine for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-infininte">Halo Infinite</a>.</p>
<p>Except that Slipspace might have reworked a lot of the game engine, but it didn’t necessarily become easier for 343 and its team of contractors to work with – company policy of keeping contractors on for only 18 months seeing a lot of brain drain through Infinite’s development and repeatedly training new staff.&nbsp;Switching to Unreal Engine 5 will certainly help on that front, though it’s still a massive shame to see yet another studio give up on in-house tech.</p>

<p>Through all this, the 343 brand took ding after ding, so it makes sense that they try to shake off that bad reputation with a new name. Fans will hope that they can quickly replicate the feel of Halo as well, not just the l</p>
<p>Microsoft’s game studios are no strangers to using Unreal Engine. The Coalition is renowned for their mastery of Unreal Engine for their Gears of War games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">Gears of War E-Day</a> their first full production with UE5 – always able to extract the very best out of it and the Xbox console hardware. You also have Ninja Theory doing incredible things for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review/">Hellblade II</a>, Obsidian using Unreal for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a>, and on, and on.</p>
<p>However, having had to wrap up development on Halo Infinite and then support it, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/18/halo-infinite-co-op-how-to-play/">adding co-op many months later</a>, Halo Studios is a long way behind their compatriots. The Coalition, for example, shared <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/27/the-coalition-post-first-alpha-point-unreal-engine-5-tech-demo-running-on-xbox-series-xs/">this kind of tech demo back in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a long road ahead, in other words, for the next full Halo game. Will 343… I mean Halo Studios do something smaller in the meantime?</p>

Halo Studios has had to dedicate a lot of staff to developing the Slipspace Engine, and parts of it are almost 25 years old. </p><p>“One of the primary things we’re interested in is growing and expanding our world so players have more to interact with and more to experience,” says Chris Matthews, art director at Halo Studios. “Nanite and Lumen [Unreal’s rendering and lighting technologies] offer us an opportunity to do that in a way that the industry hasn’t seen before. As artists, it’s incredibly exciting to do that work.”</p><p>Halo Studios isn’t committing to any release dates or new <em>Halo </em>game announcements just yet, but the team has been building some examples of <em>Halo </em>running in Unreal. Dubbed Project Foundry, the work is “neither a game nor a tech demo,” but more of a research, development, and training tool. It’s also the foundation for how the studio is changing up the way it builds <em>Halo</em> games.</p><div><figcaption><em>The world of Halo in Unreal Engine 5.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Halo Studios</cite></p></div><p>Project Foundry has been built as if it was a shipping game so that a bunch of it can appear in <em>Halo </em>games in the future. “It’s fair to say that our intent is that the majority of what we showcased in Foundry is&nbsp;<em>expected</em>&nbsp;to be in projects which we are building, or future projects,” says Hintze.</p><p>Project Foundry includes more detailed landscapes for Halo biomes, as well as foliage levels we haven’t seen in <em>Halo </em>games in the past. Master Chief’s armor has even been remodeled in this footage, months after I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">exclusively revealed in <em>Notepad</em></a><em> </em>that Microsoft was working on some form of a&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>&nbsp;remaster.</p><p>Halo Studios is now working on multiple <em>Halo </em>games, while the Slipstream Engine will continue to power <em>Halo Infinite</em>. “We had a disproportionate focus on trying to create the conditions to be successful in servicing&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>,” says Hintze. “[But switching to Unreal] allows us to put all the focus on making multiple new experiences at the highest quality possible.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>For all the things it did well, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/14/mortal-kombat-1-review/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> had a pretty rocky start, exhausting title-numbering changes aside. With crossplay absent at launch, microtransactions bogging down every moment of gameplay, and a lack of final polish, it wasn’t in the best spot on day one. Some pieces of the package shined out of the gate, though, and for me the thing that helped the game sing despite those launch woes was the story mode. In completely resetting it’s universe and dropping us into a new, remixed world crafted by the actions of Elder God Liu Kang, the messy fiction of the Mortal Kombat franchise was given a fresh-start that led to a lot of genuinely fascinating and gripping story moments. I was hopeful that the large new story mode featured in the Khaos Reigns expansion would build off of all that promise and potential, but instead I was left feeling disappointed.</p>
<p>The modern series had built up a very Marvel Cinematic Universe style approach to it’s story full of multi-dimensional character variants and crossover shenanigans that, ultimately, served to reach the goal of giving us the completely reset universe we see in Mortal Kombat 1. The Khaos Reigns story picks up immediately after the events of this game’s ending, which had teased with rote multiverse fanservice that is briefly exciting, but ultimately served to distract from the new universe and main timeline characters that the game had spent so long getting us attached to. That khaos is thankfully reigned back in the opening moments of this DLC story, as we instead focus on interesting lore built up in the main game like Bi-Han’s transformation into Noob Saibot and the feud between the Shirai Ryu and the Lin-Kuei.</p>



<p>It’s an incredibly strong start… but then the plot takes a complete sharp turn early on when Khaos Havik appears, signalling yet another MCU-ification of the Mortal Kombat story mode. Instead of a primary focus on the established characters and our new narrative threads, things immediately turn into an Avengers Endgame fanservice-fest as we’re whisked away to Khaos Havik’s realm alongside a host of new fanservice-y character variants.</p>
<p>My issue isn’t that these moments are dull – they’re really fun, and as someone who’s grown up with Mortal Kombat I do love seeing callbacks and timeline shenanigans like these play out – but I would love for Mortal Kombat to grow up a bit. It felt like we were finally making progress in telling a new and meaningful story with the base campaign, but by the time the credits rolled on the barely three-hour long Khaos Reigns story mode, all I felt like we did was go on a fun yet fruitless filler episode adventure.</p>


<p>The other hefty part of the Khaos Reigns expansion is the promise of six new playable characters, but only three of them are available at the time of writing – Noob Saibot, Cyrax, and Sektor. I’ve never been a massive fan of the red and yellow androids, so Cyrax and Sektor being part of this expansion didn’t excite me too much. That being said, the way they’ve been reimagined both in terms of story and gameplay for Khaos Reigns is really interesting.</p>
<p>The robotic ninja duo are now woman warriors who wear augmented armour to do battle, instead of being full cyborgs. Their play-styles are also much more distinct than in the past, with Cyrax having a more fast-paced rush-down reimagining of her original moveset while Sektor has become a very ranged, projectile heavy kombatant.</p>
<p>Noob Saibot is the character I’m most nostalgic for of the three, but his visual design in Khaos Reigns has got to be the most bland and unimaginative interpretation of the smoke-slinging ninja that I’ve ever seen. Thankfully, his wild moveset is just as fun as was in past games, and I’m sure some costume cosmetics down the line will give me a style-swap for him that gets me way more excited to play as him.</p>

<p>As for the upcoming characters in the pass – Ghostface, Conan, and the T-1000 – I can’t say I’m all too excited about them. NetherRealm Studios has relied heavily on guest characters for almost all of their modern fighting game releases, but as these games grow and the list of untapped crossover characters thins, it’s way less exciting to see film and comic characters dropped into the world of Mortal Kombat when there are so many original characters I’d rather see in the roster instead.</p>
<p>The first character pass for this game felt almost too on-the-pulse with it’s pop culture crossover picks – does anyone even talk about Peacemaker anymore? By comparison, the crossover selection for Khaos Reigns is practically as far away from the pulse of pop culture as possible, with picks like Conan and the T-1000 feeling like desperate pleas to the players who are old enough to have been around since the onset of this franchise and even know who either of those characters are. Ghostface is a solid exception to this rule. The Scream franchise has had a pretty major resurgence in the last few years and strikes a chord with a pretty wide variety of people, and I feel like the character’s design fits the world of Mortal Kombat pretty well.</p>
<p>All in all, Khaos Reigns is an overpriced and underwhelming expansion for a fighting game that really needed a big win. Mortal Kombat 1 has been in a rocky place since launch, and I don’t see this expansion or the content it adds turning things around for this game for very many people.</p>

			<p>A few months ago, Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested</a> $1.5 billion in Epic Games to create a persistent universe for its franchises in Fortnite, one of the most popular online games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">The Verge</a> has now disclosed that they have managed to get information about the venture from Epic Games EVP Saxs Persson at the Unreal Fest in Seattle. Here's what Persson had to say on the subject:</p>
<p><em>Disney wants a persistent place where all things Disney can be there, but they want to be part of an ecosystem we’ve built. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to be able to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience really.</em></p>
<p>Persson says that players can enter the universe "in the Disney front door or the Fortnite front door." He also clarified&nbsp;that the supposed projects will have the same backend as Fortnite, with the overall cosmetic layout and social graph, but the key difference would be in the in-game content and maybe the accessibility you will have to the Disney universe. The big concern with this venture was fortunately addressed by Persson when he says that this partnership doesn't mean that Disney characters would do anything in the Fortnite universe:</p>
<p><em>Not every outfit will be able to do everything. A LEGO minifig doesn’t hold a gun. Brands should be able to enforce the brand guidelines to the degree that they’re comfortable with that brand being associated with particular ratings.</em></p>
<p>This project is definitely worth following, although presently we don't have any hints as to when it might become available.</p>

            <p>Alas for the Maw. Last week we had a critical mass of people being off sick, away on trips, away on holiday, or locked in the cellar reviewing very long video games. As such, the flow of news to the dark god of video games journalism was sluggish. Thankfully, the Maw seems to have let us off lightly. It could have risen kraken-like from the abyss and swallowed the planet. Instead, it has merely <a href="https://www.space.com/earth-will-capture-second-moon-sept-2024">summoned an extra moon</a>. Quickly now, let's run through the week's PC game releases of note and top the Maw up before that bonus satellite does anything unconventional, like growing teeth.</p><!--more-->
<p>We open Monday 7th October with a trio of indie charmers: stylishly stark detective story <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phoenix-springs">Phoenix Springs</a>, epistolary Animal Cross 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kind-words-2-lofi-city-pop">Kind Words 2</a>, and the latest of many posh, 8 or 16-bit throwback RPGs, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2017620/Beloved_Rapture/">Beloved Rapture</a>. On Tuesday 8th, a chorus of sirens as Bloober's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> exits the fog, pursued by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>'s Vessel Of Hatred DLC. If Silent Hill 2's woeful paranorma-burg is too harrowing for you, why not play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1927150/Townframe/">Townframe</a> instead - it's also about people's memories of weird towns, but in a cuddly way. On Wednesday 9th, you must type to survive waves of evil words in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/glyphica">Glyphica</a>, which somehow wasn't made by a games journalist. There's also first-person melee platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shady-knight">Shady Knight</a>, for people who think the sword is mightier than the pen, actually. On Thursday 10th October, an RPG for the Dreamcast diehards, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691750/Sky_Oceans_Wings_for_Hire/">Sky Oceans: Wings For Hire</a>. Meanwhile, the Overcooked formula has finally come for junkyard management in the shape of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358790/Tipston_Salvage/">Tipston Salvage</a>. And on Friday 11th October, clear some space for highly Personable RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. Or if that's too ponderous a release to end the week on, Breath of the Wildy platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa">Europa</a>.</p>
<p>Enough? Enough, I think. As ever, feel free to share any amazing PC games we've missed and chuck suggestions for stories into the comments. Find our weekly news liveblog below.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/343-industries">343 Industries</a>, developer of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a> series, has confirmed it is working on multiple new games for the franchise under a new name: Halo Studios. 
</p>
<p>
In a surprise announcement last night, the freshly-rebranded Halo Studios debuted a first look at Project Foundry - its experimental look at how the Xbox flagship franchise will look developed in Unreal Engine 5. 
</p>
<p>
All Halo games from here on out will use UE5, Halo Studios  confirmed, ditching its own proprietary Slipspace Engine it toiled on for years.

<p>
Project Foundry is not a new game per se, more an advanced tech demo. Still, in a six-minute video and accompanying <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/">Xbox Wire</a> blog post, it is made clear that the quality on show is supposed to be fully representative of what an Unreal Engine 5 Halo game could look like - and indeed, parts of Project Foundry could pop up in future projects.
</p>
<p>
"It's fair to say that our intent is that the majority of what we showcased in Foundry is expected to be in projects which we are building, or future projects," Halo Studios boss Pierre Hintze said.
</p>
<p>
Project Foundry includes a slice of Halo's classic Pacific Northwest setting, stuffed full of trees and detail, and our first look at Master Chief himself battling a pair of Covenant Elites. Other areas that have been modelled include the Coldlands, a new and frozen location, and the Blightlands, a gooey, disturbing setting that has been taken over by Halo's Flood.
</p><p>
"The first Halo redefined console gaming in 2001, and over the generations Halo has pushed the state of the art forward with amazing gameplay, story, and music," <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1843138089285480448">said</a> Tim Sweeney, boss of Unreal Engine maker Epic Games. "Epic is honoured that the Halo Studios team has chosen our tools to help with their future work!"
</p>
<p>
Halo Studios' wholesale move to Unreal Engine is not unexpected. Back in early February 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-df-direct-weekly-on-halos-switch-to-ue5-and-the-new-ps5-beta-firmware">it was reported that the then-343 Industries was ditching Slipspace for Epic's ubiquitous game tools</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/343-industries-reflects-on-one-year-of-halo-infinite">Halo Infinite did not meet expectations</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nearly-100-staff-axed-from-halo-developer-report-claims">staff layoffs</a>, and following similar switches by CD Projekt Red for the next Witcher game, and Crystal Dynamics for Tomb Raider. 
</p>
<p>
Ditching the studio's own Slipspace Engine means adopting an industry-wide standard, which should speed up hiring and onboarding (and Halo Studios' announcement now is at least in part to encourage recruitment). But it is also the company turning the page on the development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a>, which is widely seen as having not met Microsoft's expectations.
</p>
<p>
"Respectfully, some components of Slipspace are almost 25 years old," studio art director Chris Matthews said.
</p>
<p>
"We had a disproportionate focus on trying to create the conditions to be successful in servicing Halo Infinite," said Hintze. "[But switching to Unreal] allows us to put all the focus on making multiple new experiences at the highest quality possible."
</p>
<p>
So, when will these new Halo games materialise? Not just yet, it sounds like. 
</p>
<p>
"We should talk about things when we have things to talk about, at scale," Hintze said. "Today, it's the first step - we're showing Foundry because it feels right to do so - we want to explain our plans to Halo fans, and attract new, passionate developers to our team. The next step will be talking about the games themselves."

			<p>A few hours ago, just before the 2024 Halo World Championship finals, 343 Industries <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/a-new-dawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> multiple big news for the Halo franchise, starting with the studio's name change. 343 Industries will be henceforth known simply as Halo Studios.</p>
<p>The other big news is that there are multiple games in development, all of which are being made with Unreal Engine 5. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-reportedly-dropping-slipspace-engine-in-favor-of-unreal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> from a couple of years ago were true, then: the Slipspace Engine, created specifically for Halo Infinite, has already been abandoned.</p>
<p>The developers explained that it was too much to continuously support and grow their own stack while making content for the Halo games. With Unreal Engine 5, that's not an issue anymore. Moreover, the Slipspace Engine simply lacked some things built into Epic's game-making tool.</p>
<p>Studio Art Director Chris Matthews said:</p>
<p><em>Respectfully, some components of Slipspace are almost 25 years old. Although 343 were developing it continuously, there are aspects of Unreal that Epic has been developing for some time, which are unavailable to us in Slipspace – and would have taken huge amounts of time and resources to try and replicate. One of the primary things we’re interested in is growing and expanding our world so players have more to interact with and more to experience. Nanite and Lumen offer us an opportunity to do that in a way that the industry hasn’t seen before. As artists, it’s incredibly exciting to do that work.</em></p>
<p>To familiarize themselves with UE5, the team worked on a research project called The Foundry to see if they could replicate the feeling of Halo environments. In the video below, they show off three different biomes: the classic Pacific Northwest, something entirely alien, and a world infested by the Flood.</p>
<p><iframe title="A New Dawn | Halo Studios" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Halo is only the latest big franchise to switch from a proprietary engine to Unreal Engine 5, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tomb Raider</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher</a>. Needless to say, Epic is pretty thrilled about the news. Bill Clifford, Vice President and General Manager of Unreal Engine at Epic Games, stated:</p>
<p><em>Halo is such an incredible franchise and it’s awesome to see Halo Studios already pushing the boundaries of Unreal Engine 5. We’re honored to support the Halo team in realizing their creative visions through Unreal Engine. Project Foundry’s work demonstrates how they can bring Halo to life with beautifully detailed, uncompromised worlds.</em></p>
<p>Halo Studios is also <a href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/search?q=%23halo&amp;l=en_us&amp;pg=1&amp;pgSz=20&amp;o=Relevance&amp;flt=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring</a> as they expand to accommodate development for multiple projects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-world-championship-spacestation-winner/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The 2024 Halo Championship Series season has ended dramatically, and Spacestation has lifted the scene’s ultimate trophy. In a close-fought grand final, Spacestation faced off against a capable OpTic Gaming, and for a moment, it looked as though OpTic had the win in the bag.</p>



<p>This marks the third victory for Spacestation this year alone, and it has netted the team a whopping $400,000 prize.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-so-close-again">So Close, Again</h2>



<p>OpTic Gaming went wild in the grand final in Seattle, producing a 3 – 0 lead before Spacestation could scrape together a response, and from there, it was all she wrote. OpTic had almost produced a bracket reset, but Spacestation went <strong>in</strong>, hitting four maps back to back to secure the trophy and the $400,000 grand prize.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Unfortunately, many fans took to social media as the map wins unfolded for Spacestation to slam the team’s ‘restart cheese’. That’s not the first time this issue has surfaced this year, and it’s starting to be a bit of a sticking point for HCS fans worldwide.</p>



<p>OpTic Gaming’s FormaL walks away from this loss with uncertainties ahead. In recent weeks, the iconic esports competitor with a stunning career has toyed with the idea of retiring from Halo and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/formal-coming-back-to-cod-scump/">transitioning back to Call of Duty</a>, mirroring a move he made in 2021. He was on fire during the final stages of the Halo World Championship, but it wasn’t enough to secure the trophy.</p>



<p>Sadly, that’s the third time this season that OpTic Gaming has fallen in second place to Spacestation – the topic of kryptonite has certainly started rising.</p>

The Far Cry strategy board game takes players back to one of the most memorable locales from the video games: Far Cry 3's Rook Islands. Far Cry 3 took the top spot in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-far-cry-games-ranked/1100-6496072/" data-ref-id="1100-6496072">our series ranking</a>, so it's pretty cool that Funforge collaborated with Ubisoft to turn the iconic open-world FPS into a tabletop strategy game.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3VJ3F53?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Far Cry: Escape from Rook Islands</a> is designed as a reinterpretation of Far Cry 3, so it has the same premise: You and up to three friends are stranded on the beautiful but dangerous tropical islands controlled by the fan-favorite villain Vaas Monetenegro.</p><p>The board game features eight story-driven missions. The combat system is card-based with a tactical bent that requires you to consider each move when squaring off against the Acolytes of Vashna and other threats. As you can see in the picture above, the game comes with a bunch of different components. It has numerous overarching systems, including experience points for leveling up, upgrading weapons, crafting potions, and gear management. Each playable character has their own unique specialties to promote teamwork. A Friendly Fire mode can be used to make the missions more challenging.</p><p>Far Cry: Escape from Rook Islands is fully playable solo, too.</p><hr><h2>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice - Strategy Board Game</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379652-acbrotherhood.png" data-ref-id="1300-4379652" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379652-acbrotherhood.png" data-ref-id="1300-4379652"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379652-acbrotherhood.png"></figure><p>If you're bummed about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">Assassin's Creed Shadows delay</a> until February 14, you could pass the time by getting together with some friends to play the official tabletop game. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B59Z8D4Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice</a></strong> is on sale for 50% off, dropping the price from $80 to $40. This deal is even better when you consider that the game was still sold for its original $140 list price as recent as July of this year.</p><p>Brotherhood of Venice tells an original story within the Assassin's Creed universe during the Italian Renaissance. It features beloved characters from the video games and new characters created by Synapses Games; the publisher collaborated with Ubisoft to make an authentic Assassin's Creed experience. If you like tabletop strategy games and Assassin's Creed, Brotherhood of Venice is a serious bargain at this price.</p><p>The replayable campaign is split into 26 quick chapters, with each run lasting 30-90 minutes on average. You and up to three friends are tasked with investigating and assassinating enemies of the Brotherhood.</p><p>Brotherhood of Venice is designed as a cooperative experience, but the ability to play solo by controlling two Assassins was built into the game. The five playable Assassins are custom-molded miniatures. As shown in the image above, the miniatures are unpainted, but you can paint them with the help of an acrylic paint set, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HUAL-Professional-Students-Beginners-Christmas/dp/B0B2WNG3B1?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this budget-friendly starter kit from Amazon</a>.</p><p>Along with the miniatures, the box contains a gameboard, cardboard character standees, dice, cards, and an instruction booklet.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-retro-gaming-hoodies-zelda-super-mario-prime-big-deal-days-2024/2900-5838/">Official Nintendo Retro Hoodies Are 20% In Amazon's Early Big Deal Days Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/lego-set-prime-big-deal-days-amazon-deals/2900-5823/">Best Lego Deals At Amazon Ahead Of Prime Big Deal Days</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-prime-big-deal-days-deals/2900-5817/">Best Nintendo Switch Console, Game, And Merch Deals Ahead Of Prime Big Deal Days</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-prime-big-deal-days-deals/2900-5816/">Best PS5 Deals Ahead Of Prime Big Deal Days Sale At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-complete-calvin-and-hobbes-is-on-sale-for-best-price-in-years-for-prime-big-deal-days/1100-6526922/">The Complete Calvin And Hobbes Is On Sale For Best Price In Years For Prime Big Deal Days</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/binding-of-isaac-strategy-card-game-is-ridiculously-cheap-at-amazon-for-prime-big-deal-days/1100-6526924/">Binding Of Isaac Strategy Card Game Is Ridiculously Cheap At Amazon For Prime Big Deal Days</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-has-big-discounts-on-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-more-square-enix-games/1100-6526819/">Amazon Has Big Discounts On Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth And More Square Enix Games</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-deluxe-illustrated-book-box-set-lotr-collector-edition/1100-6525568/">Lavish New Lord Of The Rings Illustrated Book Box Set Is 25% Off At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>All future Halo games will be developed in Unreal Engine 5, and will be created by a new studio at Xbox, sort of. Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced on Sunday night</a>, during the Halo World Championships, that developer 343 Industries will be changing its name to Halo Studios to signify a “new dawn” for the Halo franchise.</p>



<p>In addition, it was revealed that Halo Studios has multiple games in development.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="A New Dawn | Halo Studios" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-why-the-change-to-unreal-engine-5-for-halo">Why The Change To Unreal Engine 5 For Halo?</h2>



<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries,” studio head Pierre Hintze said. “Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of&nbsp;how&nbsp;we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p>



<p>As part of that change, Halo games will no longer use the Slipspace Engine that was created specifically for Halo Infinite. This opens up developers to work on the new games as opposed to simply upkeep the engine itself. The move to Unreal Engine 5 for Halo will allow for better development games for fans thanks to the benefits the engine offers developers.</p>



<p>“Respectfully, some components of Slipspace are almost 25 years old,” said studio art director Chris Matthews via Xbox Wire. “Although 343 were developing it continuously, there are aspects of Unreal that Epic has been developing for some time, which are unavailable to us in Slipspace – and would have taken huge amounts of time and resources to try and replicate.”</p>



<p>“We had a disproportionate focus on trying to create the conditions to be successful in servicing&nbsp;Halo Infinite,” Hintze said. “[But switching to Unreal] allows us to put all the focus on making multiple new experiences at the highest quality possible.”</p>



<p>As far as the new games in development, Halo Studios says they’ll release when the company feels they’re at the right state to be released. </p>



<p>What do you think of the changes at the former 343 Industries, now Halo Studios? Does the move of Halo to Unreal Engine 5 have you excited about its future? Join the discussion below or at the official Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

    <p><span>First look at the world of Halo in Unreal Engine 5.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Xbox Game Studios [918 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> subsidiary <a title="Companies > 343 Industries [132 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/xbox-game-studios/343-industries">343 Industries</a> is changing its name to Halo Studios, and all future <em>Halo</em> projects will be built in Unreal Engine 5, including multiple new <em>Halo</em> games currently in development, the studio <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a>. <span id="more-919742"></span></p><p>“If you really break <em>Halo</em> down, there have been two very distinct chapters,” said Halo Studios head Pierre Hintze in a statement. “Chapter 1: <a title="Companies > Bungie [222 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-interactive-entertainment/bungie">Bungie</a>. Chapter 2: 343 Industries. Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of how we make <em>Halo</em> games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p><p><em>Halo</em> games previously ran on Halo Studios’ proprietary Slipspace Engine, which required a large portion of staff to upkeep.</p><p>“We believe that the consumption habits of gamers have changed—the expectations of how fast their content is available,” said Hintze. “On <em><a title="Games > Halo Infinite [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a></em>, we were developing a tech stack that was supposed to set us up for the future, and games at the same time.”</p><p>Halo Studios chief operating officer Elizabeth van Wyck added, “The way we made <em>Halo</em> games before doesn’t necessarily work as well for the way we want to make games for the future. So part of the conversation we had was about how we help the team focus on making games, versus making the tools and the engines.”</p><p>Adopting Unreal Engine 5 also means Halo Studios can create games with a focus that can satisfy fans, even setting up multiple games to create different games simultaneously.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Studio art director Chris Matthews explained, “Respectfully, some components of Slipspace are almost 25 years old. Although 343 were developing it continuously, there are aspects of Unreal that Epic has been developing for some time, which are unavailable to us in Slipspace—and would have taken huge amounts of time and resources to try and replicate.</p><p>“One of the primary things we’re interested in is growing and expanding our world so players have more to interact with and more to experience. Nanite and Lumen [Unreal’s rendering and lighting technologies] offer us an opportunity to do that in a way that the industry hasn’t seen before. As artists, it’s incredibly exciting to do that work.”</p><div id="carousel_919742"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>To showcase what the future of <em>Halo</em> will look like, Halo Studios created “Project Foundry,” which is not a neither a game nor a tech demo, but an exploration of what is possible for a <em>Halo</em> game in Unreal Engine 5, as well as a training tool for how to get there.</p><p>“Where this type of work’s been done historically, across the industry, it can contain a lot of smoke and mirrors,” explained Matthews. “It sometimes leads players down paths where they believe it’s going to be one thing, and then something else happens. The ethos of Foundry is vigorously the opposite of that.</p><p>“Everything we’ve made is built to the kind of standards that we need to build for the future of our games. We were very intentional about not stepping into tech demo territory. We built things that we truly believe in, and the content that we’ve built—or at least a good percentage of it—could travel anywhere inside our games in the future if we so desire it.”</p><p>Hintze added, “It’s fair to say that our intent is that the majority of what we showcased in Foundry is expected to be in projects which we are building, or future projects.”</p><p>As for what is to come for the <em>Halo</em> series, while Halo Studios is not talking specifics about the new games in development quite yet, it did say that a new <me>Halo game is not imminent. <em>Halo Infinite</em> will continue to be supported through the Slipspace Engine, and it will continue to receive more Operations and Forge mode updates.</me></p><p>“One of the things I really wanted to get away from was the continued teasing out of possibilities and ‘must-haves,'” Hintze said. “We should do more and say less. For me, I really think it is important that we continue the posture which we have right now when it comes to our franchise—the level of humility, the level of servitude towards <em>Halo</em> fans.</p><p>“We should talk about things when we have things to talk about, at scale. Today, it’s the first step–we’re showing Foundry because it feels right to do so—we want to explain our plans to <em>Halo</em> fans, and attract new, passionate developers to our team. The next step will be talking about the games themselves.</p><p>“We had a disproportionate focus on trying to create the conditions to be successful in servicing <em>Halo Infinite</em>. [But switching to Unreal] allows us to put all the focus on making multiple new experiences at the highest quality possible.”</p><p>Watch the “New Dawn” developer video featuring “Project Foundry” below.</p><h2><span>A New Dawn</span></h2><p><iframe title="A New Dawn | Halo Studios" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-studios-unreal-engine-xbox-343-industries-halo-world-championship<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">343 Industries will now be known as Halo Studios in a fresh beginning for Xbox's flagship franchise.</h2></div><section><p>The future of Halo is starting to come into focus. During Sunday's Halo World Championships, 343 Industries made a number of announcements, including that it will officially be changing its name to Halo Studios and that it's working on multiple new games. In addition, the newly-rebranded studio say that all future projects will be developed on Unreal Engine, leaving behind the Slipspace Engine utilized by Halo Infinite. </p><p>The announcements were unveiled in a seven-minute video shown ahead of the Halo World Championship's grand finals, which showcased the results of Project Foundry — an experimental project designed to show a Halo game built using the Unreal Engine. While it's not much more than a tech demo, it offers a glimpse at a fresh beginning for Xbox's flagship franchise in the wake of 2021's Halo Infinite.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It's a huge shift for the Halo series, not the least because of the resources poured into the Slipspace Engine over the course of its development. The studio formerly known as 343 Industries notoriously struggled with the Slipspace engine during Halo Infinite's development, in part because it used tools dating back to the early 2000s. Still, it was expected to serve as the foundation for the series after Halo Infinite.</p><p>“Respectfully, some components of Slipspace are almost 25 years old,” art director Chris Matthews said in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>.  “Although 343 were developing it continuously, there are aspects of Unreal that Epic has been developing for some time, which are unavailable to us in Slipspace – and would have taken huge amounts of time and resources to try and replicate."</p><p>An early 2023 report suggested that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-343-studio-shakeup">Halo's developers were ready to hit the reset button on the series</a> after a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-developers-mass-layoffs-human-impact-sony-ea">heavy shakeup within the studio</a>, including transitioning to the Unreal Engine. The report also said that Halo's developers were focusing on pitching new Halo games while prototyping ideas. Project Foundry appears to be the culmination of that effort.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Halo Studios: Unreal Engine Screenshots Revealed</h3></div></output><p>The newly-rebranded Halo Studios, for its part, is seeking to forge ahead under the leadership of Pierre Hintze and Elizabeth Van Wyck, with the studio now working on multiple new games. The three stepped into top roles at the studio in the wake of studio GM <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-boss-bonnie-ross-leaves-343-studios">Bonnie Ross' departure in 2022</a>, with series veteran Joseph Staten leaving Xbox in 2023. The new name and engine follows Xbox saying earlier this year that it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console">"full speed ahead" on a next-generation successor to the Xbox Series X|S</a>. </p><p>"We had a disproportionate focus on trying to create the conditions to be successful in servicing Halo Infinite,” says Hintze. “[But switching to Unreal] allows us to put all the focus on making multiple new experiences at the highest quality possible.”</p><p>The projects will be "ready when they're ready," Halo Studios says.

These would also make for great stocking stuffers for fans this holiday.</p><hr><h2>Mega Pokemon Retro Sets with Sprite Designs</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmega-pokemon-pikachu-building-toy-kit-400pc%2F-%2FA-89081354&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fretro-pokemon-mega-bloks-target-circle-week%2F1100-6526933%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pikachu Retro Set (400 pieces)</a> -- $17.49 (<del>$25</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmega-pokemon-charmander-building-toy-kit-349pc%2F-%2FA-89081352&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fretro-pokemon-mega-bloks-target-circle-week%2F1100-6526933%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Charmander Retro Set (349 pieces)</a> -- $17.49 (<del>$25</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmega-pokemon-bulbasaur-building-toy-kit-374-pc%2F-%2FA-89081355&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fretro-pokemon-mega-bloks-target-circle-week%2F1100-6526933%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bulbasaur Retro Set (374 pieces)</a> -- $17.49 (<del>$25</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmega-pokemon-squirtle-building-toy-kit-367pc%2F-%2FA-89081356&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fretro-pokemon-mega-bloks-target-circle-week%2F1100-6526933%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Squirtle Retro Set (367 pieces)</a> -- $17.49 (<del>$25</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmega-pokemon-pixel-eevee%2F-%2FA-89952681&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fretro-pokemon-mega-bloks-target-circle-week%2F1100-6526933%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eevee Retro Set (323 pieces)</a> -- $17.49 (<del>$25</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmega-pokemon-mew-building-toy-kit-434pc-retro-set%2F-%2FA-89952670&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fretro-pokemon-mega-bloks-target-circle-week%2F1100-6526933%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mew Retro Set (434 pieces)</a> -- $17.49 (<del>$25</del>)</li></ul><p><strong>How to save even more</strong></p><ul><li>Spend $40, save additional $10 - Add three Pokemon to cart</li><li>Spend $75, save additional $20 - Add five Pokemon to cart</li></ul><p>The $17.49 price is already great, but it'll drop even lower if you buy three or more.

			<p>Until Dawn Remake on PC is reportedly filled with several bugs. Users report that ray traced settings are completely broken, and some upscaling technologies aren't effective at all.</p>
<p>For those unaware, the studio Ballistic Moon, a new team founded by former leads at Supermassive Games, was selected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-pc-specs-released-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-and-ray-tracing-are-supported/">release Until Dawn Remake on PC</a> (and PlayStation 5), which did excite fans considering that the title's stunning visuals were being held back by inferior platforms, but now it is being disclosed that the game's graphical state is entire of bugs and that users are utterly disappointed by how the PC port isn't working with RT like it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-pc-specs-released-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-and-ray-tracing-are-supported/">originally advertised to be</a>.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/until-dawn-remake-amd-fsr-3-0-frame-generation-ray-tracing-hdr-are-not-working-on-pc/">DSOgaming</a> claims that Until Dawn Remake on PC sees no visual change when ray-tracing is enabled and that the image quality is exactly the same. This is a surprising fact, given that not having RT on a PC port makes it completely useless. Here's a look at the game before vs. after RT is enabled, and by first impressions, there are no changes to the overall graphics.</p>

<p>Well, the non-functionality of RT isn't the only disappointment here, as it is said that the title isn't working with AMD's FSR 3.0, however, NVIDIA's DLSS works just fine. The developers promised that all upscaling technologies would support the PC port; however, for AMD users, it is a disappointment that a crucial feature wasn't working for them. Overall, the title feels rushed, and several other bugs make the PC port a failure when it comes to addressing the graphical capabilities that the PC platform holds.</p>
<p>We expect the developers to push out an optimization update to get the PC port up and running since, in this state, it won't prove to be much of a success.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> star Josh Hutcherson says the second Freddy-themed movie is "much bigger" and "scarier" than its predecessor.</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.esquire.com/style/mens-fashion/a62490388/josh-hutcherson-ritz-carlton-late-checkout-interview-2024/">Esquire</a>, as spotted by <a href="http://v/">TheGamer</a>, Hutcherson talked about the "higher stakes" and teased that there will be "more" and "different" animatronics, with the Freddy universe "opening up in a big way".</p>

<p>"We're finding the balance right now of building this world and expanding it in a really cool way but also making sure the characters stay really grounded," Hutcherson said. "That's something that I really think that we all fought for in the first film, because this world that was created in Five Nights at Freddy's, it's so out-there.</p><p>"It's so over-the-top and wacky, in a way, that to find the emotional truth of the characters was gonna be what was gonna work. I think the fans are gonna flip for it. It's gonna be a lot of fun with the source. It's gonna be scarier, too, actually."</p>
<p>Talking about how much he enjoys working in the Freddy-centric world, Hutcherson says the possibilities with his character, Mike, "are endless".</p>
<p>Does that mean a third movie could be on the way?</p>
<p>"This could have a very potentially long run and it could be a lot of fun, but at this point we're focusing on the second movie. We'll see what comes after that," Hutcherson teased.</p>
<p>Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-officially-in-the-works">announced the sequel back in April at CinemaCon</a>.</p>
<p>On its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sees-second-largest-video-game-adaptation-debut-of-all-time">Five Nights at Freddy's scored the second-largest debut of all time for a video game adaptation in the US</a>, coming only behind that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">Nintendo and Illumination's animated Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Wikipedia has had to lock down the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> page after repeated vandalism from editors who refuse to accept that the remake of Konami's seminal horror game released to critical acclaim earlier this week.</p>
<p>Outright lies around the games reception and metacritic score - including one edit that said the game had "received the worst reviews imaginable" - means the page has now been put into a semi-protected state to stop unregistered users from making wild, unsubstantiated claims, including one that said Eurogamer had awarded it 0/5 stars when, in fact, it got top marks.</p>

<p>It's unclear what's motivating the edits, although its presumed by some to have been fuelled by the nauseating discourse that the game is "woke" because of changes made to the characters facial features and clothing.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it may stem from some fans' dismayed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> has been remade by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> or, indeed, at all.</p> <div>

<p>Though its still early days and the only people who've got their hands on the game so far have stumped up for the deluxe edition that comes with early access - which naturally may lead to a positive bias - Silent Hill 2 Remake is sitting on an "overwhelming positive" user score on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/">Steam</a>, too.</p>
