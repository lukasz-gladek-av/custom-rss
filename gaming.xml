			<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword's <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/">announcement </a>was one of the highlights of last year's The Game Awards show, even though it wasn't exactly a surprise since there had been a few indications before the reveal that CAPCOM was planning to bring the series back in some form. No matter how loved the series was during its PlayStation 2 days, however, there's no denying the franchise was going to face some challenges in the modern video games market, where the soulslike genre has become the predominant formula for action RPGs, a genre the series could easily fall into by shedding away the gameplay elements inspired by the Resident Evil series. Thankfully, Onimusha: Way of the Sword is not heading this way, as the game will stay very true to the series' roots while providing a modern gameplay experience that is sure to make it stand out as a rather unique experience.</p>



<p>During Gamescom last month, I had the chance to try out a playable demo of the game lasting around 30 minutes. Though short, and a little rough around the edges, which is making me wonder if the game is a little further from release than the way more polished <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/">PRAGMATA</a>, this demo did an excellent job showcasing how Onimusha: Way of the Sword will feature a modernized take of the series' classic formula. Controlling Miyamoto Musashi as he searches the iconic Kiyomizu-dera temple for the source of the Malice that has gripped the temple, I was able to appreciate not only the incredibly atmospheric rendition of the temple, but also the gameplay mechanics, which will set the game apart from other similar games combining a historical Japanese setting with fantasy elements. </p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword is set to be a more than worthy entry in the series</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although Onimusha: Way of the Sword does away with the fixed camera angles of most of its predecessors, controlling Musashi felt instantly familiar, with some camera angles mirroring some of the series' typical angles, but with increased dynamism. Similarly, combat also felt pretty familiar and unmistakably Onimusha, with a focus on staggering Genma demons, parrying their attacks and eliminating them with one-hit Issen counterattacks. In just a few minutes, I instantly felt at home navigating the temple, solving some simple puzzles, and absorbing wandering souls using the Oni Gauntlet to power up weapons and enable special techniques, which both felt rather varied in the demo despite the limited selection.</p>



<p>After exploring the moderately intricate temple for a few minutes, I was confronted by Sasaki Ganryu, a character clearly based on some of the most popular representations of Kojiro Sasaki, the most famous of Musashi's rivals in real history. The battle that followed was rather cinematic, and watching Musashi and Sasaki Ganryu trade blows was a true spectacle, if not a little too easy, as parrying his attacks was far from difficult. As the game is likely still far from release, I am not too worried about game balance, although I don't expect the game to be a massive challenge, as CAPCOM already confirmed it is not <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-a-linear-game-that-wont-place-too-much-focus-on-difficulty/">focusing on difficulty.</a></p>



<p>Back when Onimusha: Way of the Sword's gameplay was finally shown, I wasn't particularly keen on what looked like a slow and clunky experience, but playing the Gamescom demo completely dispelled any doubt I may have had about the game. If the final release holds to the quality level showcased in the demo, Onimusha: Way of the Sword will undoubtedly be the revival the classic action-adventure series deserved after years of complete silence. Hopefully, it will make its way on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S before the end of 2026, as announced.</p>

All the basics are recreated, of course, like the general layout of the office and the desks. The downstairs warehouse is there, too.</p><p>But this user-created space really shines with the finer points, like two chairs on the roof to signify where Jim and Pam watched fireworks together, along with the snowman-like sculptures in the parking lot where Jim was terrorized by Dwight.</p><p>It also includes a radar speed sign outside and multiple people standing around it, mirroring that time Michael ran a humanly impossible 31 mph. These smaller details aren't in the flyover video embedded below, but can be found in the creation itself and shared by the creator in comments posted on Reddit.</p><p>This is just the latest example of the immense creativity of No Man's Sky players, and you don't have to look hard to find more. Game creator Sean Murray highlighted some of his favorite No Man's Sky custom ship builds this week, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-sky-players-are-going-wild-with-the-new-ship-builder/1100-6534464/" data-ref-id="1100-6534464">a ship modeled after Thomas the Tank engine and even himself.</a></p><p>As for The Office, the show's spin-off series The Paper is out now on Peacock. The show follows the same in-universe documentary crew that made The Office, but this time they're making a documentary about a struggling newspaper and the efforts to revitalize it. The show stars Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore, all episodes are out now, and a second season has already been ordered.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>MindsEye, the game from Build a Rocket Boy that had an <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">abysmal launch</a> and is still listed as the worst-reviewed game of 2025 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=13">Metacritic</a>, just got its latest update following <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">layoffs at the studio</a> and reports that its launch went so poorly, its publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-disastrous-launch-io-ionteractive-publishing/">IO Interactive is reconsidering its entire publishing branch</a>.</p>



<p>2023 had Lord of the Rings: Gollum, 2024 had the likes of South Park: Snow Day and Funko Fusion, and 2025 has MindsEye. Other games could join it of course, but Rockstar veteran Leslie Benzies' Build a Rocket Boy studio is "<em>committed to refining MindsEye</em>," in the hopes that it will one day not belong next to the games mentioned above.</p>



<p>"<em>Update 4 introduces a range of UX improvements, numerous performance enhancements to the game and we’ve squashed a load of bugs,</em>" Build a Rocket Boy's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265250/view/506213027443377972?l=english">update on the game's Steam page reads</a>. "<em>These efforts will continue in Update 5, where our team is working hard to deliver a major performance, combat and Enemy AI system improvement.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We remain committed to refining MindsEye and enhancing the gameplay experience. Ongoing updates will continue to be shared.</em>"</p>



<p>The full patch notes posted go on to list a huge swath of bug fixes and improvements the update contains for all platforms, but if you've played MindsEye, then you're aware that it'll take more than squashing several bugs to fix this game's issues.</p>



<p>We'll see if Build a Rocket Boy is able to carry on updating the game, or if it'll run out of road to get the job done, and MindsEye becomes Build a Rocket Boy's first and last major release.</p>

Alongside the full game in a steelbook case, it includes a Golden Gun figurine with a stand and hidden compartment, a certificate of authenticity, and a bundle of deluxe DLC skins and outfits.

Once built, the figures stand about 5 inches tall and work well as shelf or desk décor.</p></div><p id="euki-compressed-air-duster"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="EUKI Compressed Air Duster">EUKI Compressed Air Duster</h2></p><div catalogid="e84a4060-08b0-4b74-91bb-9e749cf3ae4b" id="227639"><div id="227639" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>EUKI Compressed Air Duster</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>150000RPM Electric Air Duster, Cordless Rechargeable</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The EUKI Compressed Air Duster ($39.99) is a rechargeable alternative to disposable air cans, built with a 150,000 RPM motor and three speed settings for different cleaning tasks.

What makes this set even more exciting is its size , about 90 cards before secret rares, which makes it the smallest English set in nearly a decade. For collectors like me, that usually means a much more manageable chase, while still packing in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokemon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-august-28">plenty of heavy hitters</a> for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The product lineup looks pretty stacked too. We’ll be getting the usual booster packs and booster box (36 packs), a 9-pack Elite Trainer Box featuring a shiny new Charcadet promo, and an Ultra-Premium Collection built around Mega Charizard X ex. On top of that, two theme decks for Mega Gengar ex and Mega Diancie ex are arriving a few weeks early on October 24, which is a fun way to get a taste of the set before launch. If you’re like me and love cracking packs, the booster box is the way to go, but the UPC is already looking like the big collector piece this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What ties it all together is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6bvY?object_uuid=97d94ead-e156-41ee-a9fa-29018626708d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Japanese set Inferno X</a>, which hit shelves there in late September. That set had only 80 cards, and once you add in the Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie decks, you basically get the full Phantasmal Flames lineup. We’ve already seen some killer reveals, including the Mega Charizard X ex secret rare previewed at Worlds, so I’m fully expecting that to be the chase card when this launches. Between the smaller set size, Charizard hype, and some solid gameplay cards, I think this one’s going to fly off shelves and I’m definitely locking in my preorder.</p><p id="back-to-the-future-steelbooks"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Back To The Future Steelbooks">Back To The Future Steelbook Preorders Are Live</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 40th anniversary Back to the Future steelbooks are a collector’s dream.

Its Theta Max ability that heals on evolution and the scaling power of Emerald Break made it a competitive monster in its day, and the shiny black-and-gold artwork cements it as a collector grail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/98PeZO?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Gengar EX (Secret Rare – Phantom Forces)</a> isn’t far behind, up 357% since January to $415. Its Phantom Gate attack let it copy any move from the opponent’s Active Pokémon, a flexible strategy that earned it lasting fan love. The secret rare gold trim adds collector prestige, making this one of the most desirable Megas not named Rayquaza.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also climbing fast is <a href="https://zdcs.link/911JRq?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Rayquaza EX (Full Art – Roaring Skies)</a>, now at $656.93 compared to $164.04 in January. Its Delta Evolution rule bypassed the usual Mega Evolution turn-ending drawback, giving it unique competitive edge at release. The vibrant green artwork adds to its desirability, and while overshadowed by the Shiny Rayquaza, it’s carving its own path upward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjLYq?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Charizard EX (X – Flashfire)</a> has also doubled and then some, climbing from $126.89 to $349.99. Though its Wild Blaze attack forced players to discard five cards after dealing 300 damage, the Mega X design remains one of Charizard’s most iconic forms. Collectors chasing Charizard cards across eras are pushing this one higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5XJ2L?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Primal Groudon EX (Shiny Full Art – Ancient Origins)</a> has jumped from $126.89 in January to $349.99 today.

Its Omega Barrier ability that blocked Trainer effects made it uniquely powerful, and while it’s cooled, the mechanics and artwork give it plenty of long-term upside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2jlx?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Mewtwo EX (Full Art – BREAKthrough)</a> has shown one of the biggest percentage gains, from $37.21 to $145.04. Its Psychic Infinity attack scaled with Energy on both Active Pokémon, giving it offensive versatility. While its growth has slowed compared to Rayquaza and Gengar, this plateau is a clear chance to lock in before it spikes again with the Mega Evolution revival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrYDN?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Alakazam EX (Full Art – Fates Collide)</a> has climbed from $28.85 to $99.97 but has now steadied in the $90–100 range. Its Zen Force attack synergized well with spread-damage strategies, though it never became a meta staple. Collectors have kept it relevant, and with prices flatlining, this looks like a buy-and-hold card heading into Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8dE4?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Charizard EX (Generations)</a> has tripled from $64.66 to $196, but growth has tapered. Its Heat Typhoon coin-flip mechanic made it more of a novelty card, yet the Generations anniversary branding has cemented its long-term collector appeal. With Charizard’s legacy tied tightly to every new era, this plateau may be short-lived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjxWG?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Charizard EX (Full Art – Evolutions)</a> mirrors its Generations counterpart, rising from $64.66 to $196 but settling into that range. The Crimson Dive attack packed 300 damage at the cost of self-harm, which limited competitive use, but Evolutions nostalgia has carried it. With the Mega Evolution resurgence on the horizon, this lull feels like a rare buying opportunity before Charizard prices inevitably rise again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong may be the sequel to Hollow Knight, but players are quickly finding out that it doesn't exactly play the same way Hollow Knight did. With a new protagonist and new moves, the controls and abilities available might have some players fumbling or struggling, especially when it comes to Silksong's trickier platforming sections. Fortunately, there's a way to switch back to the Hollow Knight moveset available pretty early on, if you really must.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: This article will contain spoilers for Silksong's early game, including the first two major unlockable abilities and one of the earliest bosses. If you haven't thoroughly explored the Deep Docks area just yet, you may want to wait and come back to this later.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hornet's default moveset is very, very different from that of the Knight in Hollow Knight. She has more range than the Knight, but her Needle swings are just a touch slower. She also is unable to "pogo" off of enemies the same way the Knight was - while he could slash downward to bounce off a foe, Hornet can bounce only by shooting downward at a diagonal 45 degree angle. This makes some of the game's jumping puzzles significantly more tricky until you get used to the new abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's my personal recommendation to just practice and get used to Hornet's moveset as the game clearly intends, it's possible that having the Knight's abilities might be a benefit in certain circumstances, or maybe you just want to play that way. For that, you need to get the Wanderer's Crest, which is a different crest with different slots for tools than your default Hunter's Crest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wanderer's Crest has a few requirements to unlock: you need to have beaten the Bell Beast and unlocked Hornet's sprint ability found in Deep Docks. You'll also need to have a Simple Key with you, which can be acquired easily from the merchant in Bone Bottom. If you've already bought and used that key, you'll have to find one elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With key in hand, head up into Mosshome, and head west as far as possible. Once you get to the elevator room (the one that takes you back down to Bone Bottom), use your dash to cross the big gap, and keep heading west into the Wormways. Progress through the Wormways westward and down to a hut where the crest is waiting for you. Our video above has a far more detailed explanation of how to get this item.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wanderer's Crest does make it a bit harder to fight enemies, especially at range, but can make exploration easier, so just be warned. You can swap it out any time at a bench, and experiment with both crests and figure out which one works for you. We're just getting started with Silksong, so who knows, maybe there will be even more crests out there with cool new abilities waiting for us to find them!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong is out now, and we're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong">hard at work on our Wiki guides</a> of everything you might possibly want to know as you start your adventures in Pharloom. We've also got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review">review-in-progress covering our thoughts so far</a> that we'll update with a score as soon as we've finished the game.

      A video shows how different storage media can affect <em>Mario Kart World</em> load times.

          </p>

<p>CD Projekt Red VP of Technology Charles Tremblay has alluded to this same challenge when talking about the Switch 2 port of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g42TZdesZvY">a June interview with IGN</a>, Tremblay said the data transfer speeds enabled by MicroSD Express were "great," while streaming data from a Switch 2 Game Card was merely "okay." Tremblay did go on to say that "all the performance we have on [input/output] is very good on [the Switch 2]," especially compared to the extremely slow physical hard drives that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/cdpr-ceo-blames-in-game-streaming-for-cyberpunks-console-problems/">plagued <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s performance on older hardware</a>.</p>
<h2>Slow down, you move too fast</h2>
<p>From the outside, it's a bit odd that Nintendo allowed this loading-speed dichotomy to exist on the Switch 2 in the first place. On the original Switch, read speeds for both SD cards and Game Cards <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1jsl1u2/if_the_switch_2_game_cartridge_is_slower_than/">reportedly maxed out around 90 MB/s</a>. But when designing the new Switch 2 game cards, Nintendo settled on a format that would stream data much more slowly than for downloaded games on the same console.</p>
<p>That decision might have been an attempt to minimize hardware costs for the Switch 2's Game Card interface. If so, though, it doesn't seem to have done much to reduce the costs of manufacturing Switch 2 game cards themselves. The cost of manufacturing those physical Game Cards has been <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/switch-2-publishers-quietly-step-away-from-real-physical-game-carts-opinion">frequently cited</a> as a major reason many publishers are using cheaper Game Key Cards in the first place, though <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l45oa4c3p2ndptazexy33q3z/post/3lxzsvi6s7c2e">Bantin</a> said that he "[didn't] recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion [for <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em>]—probably because it was moot."</p>
<p>Nintendo could get around this variable loading speed issue by letting players pre-install games from a Switch 2 Game Card to internal or expansion storage, as Microsoft and Sony have either <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/ps3-games-to-offer-install-option.263753/">allowed</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/xbox-one-review-more-than-a-game-console-less-than-a-living-room-revolution/">required</a> on their disc-based consoles for decades now. But that solution might prove onerous for physical game card players who want to avoid clogging up the limited 256GB of internal storage on the Switch 2 (and/or avoid investing in pricey MicroSD Express cards).</p>
<p>As time goes on, many developers will likely learn how to adapt to and tolerate the Switch 2's relatively slow Game Card interface. But as gamers and the industry at large <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/fewer-and-fewer-console-games-are-seeing-a-physical-release/">continue</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-2-and-the-death-of-disc-based-video-games/">transition</a> away <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/too-much-of-a-good-thing-mourning-the-slow-death-of-the-retail-game-store/">from physical media</a>, some developers might decide it's not worth compromising on loading speeds just to satisfy a shrinking portion of the market.</p>

<section><p>And Roger isn't very accessible, but maybe that's the point.</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">How does one properly deal with grief? The grief of recollecting beautiful memories, knowing they can never return. The grief of watching the life you built for yourself drastically slip away. The grief of seeing a loved one lose themselves to dementia. I've lived these moments. The pain of watching my grandfather, the kindest and gentlest man in my life, lose his entire personality and identity to dementia. The worst part is arguably watching the disease progress, seeing him lose more and more every year. Yet, throughout these powerful and intense moments of grief, love shines through in every scenario. This is the excellence of And Roger, a visual novel that swept me away with its brilliant gameplay and masterful storytelling, and for the first time in my life, made me reconsider how I critique inaccessibility.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Spoilers for And Roger to follow.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">Developed by TearyHand Studio, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/and-roger/" data-ref-id="5000-654160">And Roger</a> follows a couple as the wife, Sofia, progressively loses herself to dementia. The hour-long game, composed of three chapters, recounts moments throughout Sofia's life, particularly those associated with her husband, Roger. Players see the evolution of the couple's life together, performing varying quick-time events to progress the story. Yet, with each loving and tender core memory, the shadows of Sofia's disability continuously lurk.</p><p dir="ltr">But I'm not here to explore the emotional depth of one of the most powerful games I've ever played. Rather, I want to explore something that continually struck me as I completed each minigame: how a lack of accessibility, ultimately leading me to struggle, made the story much more impactful. The power of this short experience was so great that it made me reflect on my own beliefs and journalistic practices as both a disability reporter and disabled gamer. How I view accessibility will forever be changed because of this game.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Love and quick time events</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">And Roger begins with Sofia as a small child, struggling to wake herself. She tells herself she's exhausted and dizzy--that her body feels abnormally heavy. The music during this sequence is haunting and made me feel uneasy, as if I were about to enter a horror game. Instead, I found myself thrown into the game's first QTE, which required me to rapidly press a white button to sit Sofia up. Like Sofia, I struggled immensely to click the button on the screen. With every slip, she would fall back into her bed, forcing me to start over. And after completing the task, I felt drained, barely able to move my hand across the mouse. My stamina mirrored hers, yet this was only the beginning; as she slowly forced herself into the bathroom, we were confronted by another minigame: brushing her teeth.</p><p dir="ltr">After finishing that sequence, players are introduced to a strange man that Sofia mistakes for her father. He appears friendly, instructing her to go about her day and eat breakfast. The interactions are tense, with one minigame consisting of the strange man feeding Sofia, much to her objection. The uneasiness builds, with the stranger asking Sofia to take some medication to feel better.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562834-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562834" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562834-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562834"></a><figcaption>Sofia sleepily brushes her teeth in And Roger.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562834-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As a scared child, she resists. And the QTE expertly reflects her struggles to fight. Again, by rapidly pressing a button, players are meant to push the man's hand away. The event itself was impossible to complete without outside assistance. Like Sofia, I felt powerless, completely unable to budge the extended hand until someone else was able to take control. After the event, I felt considerably weaker, but I continued to play, leading Sofia out of the apartment and into a bakery where she collapses at the sight and smells of a presumably safe space.</p><p dir="ltr">The bakery remains a key setting, both in terms of QTEs and core memories. Chapter Two begins with Sofia entering the bakery to purchase baked goods; There she meets Roger, and the connection is immediate. The ensuing dates consist of QTEs ranging from moving dials to choose a hairstyle, to tracing heart monitor lines as the two talk. It's a beautiful way to explore their blooming relationship, and the games expertly reflect the tenderness and fragility of new love.</p><p dir="ltr">Through these sections, Chapter Two beautifully demonstrates the importance of love and finding joy. Yet the struggles of dementia are ever present, and one QTE abruptly and forcibly brought me back into Sofia's current world.</p><p dir="ltr">Food is integral to the relationship between Sofia and Roger. Their romance began at the bakery, and numerous QTEs--from chopping vegetables to shifting dials to purchase bread--reflect this special bond. In one scene, players are required to spin a button around a pot, stirring the soup inside. If the button falls outside of the ring, the meter to complete the objective progressively depletes. On numerous occasions, my strength and stamina levels would fail to keep up with continuously spinning a button. After approximately 10 minutes and several breaks, I finished the task, once again leaving me physically exhausted. And after finishing and eating the meal, Sofia mimicked my energy levels, dropping the pot of soup on the floor.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Inaccessibility as a tool</h2><p dir="ltr">I've been professionally critiquing accessibility in games for six years. My reviews always focus on what is or isn't included, and how the lack of appropriate options or designs make games unplayable. With And Roger, I found myself conflicted with my own ethics and morals as a disability reporter. As someone who regularly pushes back on the belief that accessibility can ruin artistic vision, I struggled coming to terms with the fact that, in this instance, inaccessibility had made the game so much more profound.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562837-copyofqas%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4562837" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562837-copyofqas%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4562837"></a><figcaption>Sofia says she feels like she forgot something in a still for And Roger.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562837-copyofqas%281%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Players are meant to feel Sofia's struggles as she navigates her world. We're meant to feel her exhaustion, frustration, and animosity toward people and activities that once brought so much light into her life. And for me, someone with a physical disability, struggling to perform and finish certain QTEs only enhanced my connection with her. Do I recommend more games adopt this practice of forgoing accessibility? Absolutely not. But for this specific work of art, the emotional journey was vastly improved because I struggled to play.</p><p dir="ltr">And Roger wants players to appreciate the everyday moments in life, cherishing them on the chance they're one day outside of your control. Yet in addition to a greater appreciation for life, I also have a newfound appreciation for games and the unique way my disability interacts with them. Inaccessibility is so innately tied to the disabled experience. And Roger showed me that there is often beauty in moments of frustration.</p>

        <p>Plus new TikTok-style video feed incoming.</p>

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Roblox is investing heavily in AI to assist users with game development, while also increasing the amount of money they can earn.</p>
<p>The news comes as part of the Roblox Developers Conference, where the platform also unveiled its new TikTok-style Moments feed of short-form videos taken directly from Roblox games.</p>
<p>Roblox now boasts an average of over 111.8 million daily active users and 390 billion visits to its games. Last month Roblox had a record-breaking 45 million concurrent users - higher than Steam - and over the past year, creators have earned over $1bn.</p>
<p>Roblox is now rewarding its creators with an increase to its DevEx rate - essentially the exchange rate from Robux to real cash. This has now risen by 8.5 percent, meaning 100,000 Robux equals $380.</p>
<p>AI is also a major way Roblox is enabling smaller teams to develop games on the platform. "To achieve our mission of connecting a billion people, we need creators around the world building at massive scale," the company said. It believes the majority of the top 1000 in-platform games were built by teams of, on average, fewer than 10 people.</p><p>In total, Roblox has 400 AI models in production. Its star product is 4D Objects, which it believes will overhaul UGC. Users will be able to create fully interactive scripted assets by a simple text prompt - for instance, generating a fully drivable and customised car.</p>
<p>Other AI products include text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs, allowing creators to add dialogue to characters or command NPCs, and real-time voice chat translation (starting with English, Spanish, French, and German).</p>
<p>Roblox's other major development is its Moments feed. This will allow users to capture and edit short clips from games and share to a scrollable feed. Roblox hopes this will aid discovery on the platform, with users able to jump straight into a game from these videos. It will soon be available in specific countries in beta form (but not the UK or Australia).</p>

</figure>
<p>"For years, our users have been doing this off-platform, creating a massive presence with Roblox-related content garnering over 1 trillion video views on YouTube," the company said. It's understandable it would want to keep this engagement on the platform. It also follows the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitchs-revised-mobile-app-will-arrive-this-summer">similarly updated its mobile app with a Discovery Feed of clips</a> - it's clear the dominance of TikTok on social media is impacting many gaming platforms.</p>
<p>These developer updates from Roblox follow continued efforts from the company to improve safety, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-continues-efforts-for-child-safety-by-expanding-age-estimation-to-all-users-by-end-of-the-year">Roblox expanding its age estimation requirement to all users</a> of the platform who access its communication features by the end of the year.</p>
<p>These safety efforts follow years of concern, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">multiple reports accusing Roblox of being unsafe for children</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit">Roblox responded to a lawsuit accusing the company of failing to protect children</a>. "Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue," it wrote. "No system is perfect and bad actors adapt to evade detection, including efforts to take users to other platforms, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ. We continuously work to block those efforts and to enhance our moderation approaches to promote a safe and enjoyable environment for all users."</p>

We would <em>love</em> to ask you some questions and would greatly appreciate it if you could take the time to respond to our anonymous survey.</p>
<p>Why is this important to us? Our websites survive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/ownership#how-does-site-make-money">mainly due to those</a> who choose to advertise their games on our websites. Advertisers typically (and understandably) want to know who they are advertising to, therefore, our survey gives us a snapshot view of our audience in 2025.</p>
<p>This year we're trying to keep things quite focused and have boiled everything down to 20 simple questions. Some of them are about you, some of them about which platforms you own and the games you buy and finally where you typically get your gaming news. All questions are optional, but any personal questions will contain a 'Prefer not to say' option.</p>
<p>We are running the same survey across all Hookshot websites; that is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Nintendo Life</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/">Pure Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/">Time Extension</a>. You only need to answer it once, and it doesn't matter which site you do it on.</p>
<p>We will run more site-specific surveys in due course.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-reeses-oreo-cup-review-tasty-cookie-snack-candy-2000623453</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-reese%E2%80%99s-oreo-cup-is-tasty-but-only-if-luck-is-on-your-side.1290105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the last few years, it feels like there has been a large increase in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/reeses-peanut-butter-cups-now-with-hard-bits-1776649563">number of limited-time Reese’s Cup variations</a> and gimmicks. Many of these have been bad. But the newest crossover featuring Oreo cookies is the first time I’ve tried one of these oddball concoctions and enjoyed it. But only when RNG was on my side.</p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/reeses/posts/you-asked-we-crushed-it-reeses-oreo-cups-are-coming-this-september/1218885443616524/">Released this month, the new Reese’s Oreo cup</a> isn’t simply a <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-ranking-worst-best-list-chocolate-bar-1851679251/38">Reese’s cup</a> with some Oreo bits shoved inside. Well, okay, sure, it is mostly that, but the Reese’s cup itself is half milk chocolate and half white chocolate. As someone who is a big fan of the white chocolate Reese’s Cup, I was very happy about this choice. It also makes sense as the Oreo cookie bits, in theory at least, should blend with the white chocolate to create something similar in taste to an actual Oreo cookie.</p> <p>And then you have the classic Reese’s peanut butter filling, which is fine by me as I love that stuff more than real peanut butter. So does this all come together into a winning creation? Well, you know the answer already, I said it in the first paragraph. But yes, it’s pretty dang good!</p>

 <p>The cookie bits add a nice and crunchy texture to each cup, and the darker, more bitter flavor of the Oreo cookie cuts through the peanut butter, so they complement each other in a way that a lot of other gimmicky flavors have been lacking. But that Oreo-ness also doesn’t overpower the entire cup, something that can also happen. (Looking at you, fudge-filled Reese’s Cups.) Instead, the cookie bits and the rest of the cup blend together perfectly. The white chocolate top of the cup also helps add a bit of sweetness and creaminess to the candy, which does sort of recreate the taste of an Oreo that has been dipped in peanut butter. I would know how that tastes, as I’ve done that many times before.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000623478" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623478"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623478">©Reese’s / Oreo</figcaption></figure> <p>There is an asterisk, though, next to my “Pretty Dang Good!” appraisal of the new Oreo Reese’s abomination. It all depends on how much Oreo is in your Reese’s Cups. I bought four of the King Size version and three of them had a lot of cookie bits and were fantastic. But one had barely any inside the peanut butter, so you were left with a cup that was just half white chocolate and half milk chocolate. Not a horrible fate, but disappointing if you were expecting some Oreo goodness.</p>

 <p>For those of you out there who miss the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=crunchy+cookie+cup&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS955US955&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#imgrc=D8sfDROw0w3ReM&amp;imgdii=EKOEBjAnc7XWNM">Crunchy Cookie Reese’s Cup from the ’90s</a>, this might be your best bet for re-experiencing that fan-favorite flavor that is no longer sold by Reese’s. From my memory, it’s not quite the same thing, but it’s awfully close. And in the absence of Reese’s bringing it back, this will do just fine for all of you longing for the sweet return of the Crunchy Cookie cup.</p> <p>One last note: If you do buy some of these, stick ’em in the fridge. The one I stuck in the fridge and tasted a few hours later was even better. I mean, Reese’s Cups in general are better cold, but these in particular taste wonderful. The cold stiffens up the chocolate more and adds even more crunch. It’s nice. I can’t buy any more or I’ll eat them all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon Prime Video has given the green light to a Life is Strange TV series, a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-luckychap-1236509181/">Variety</a> has revealed. It'll be written by Charlie Covell, the same writer recently behind Netflix's show Kaos and the Channel 4 mini series Truelove. Covell will also act as executive producer and showrunner, while Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg, and Timothy I. Stevenson will tag along as executive producers through Story Kitchen. Square Enix is also listed as one of the producing entities alongside Story Kitchen, Amazon, and LuckyChap, but neither <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-devs-deck-nine-lay-off-more-staff/">Deck Nine</a> nor <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Dontnod</a> seems to be involved.</p>



<p>It's the latest videogame to TV series adaptation Amazon has in the works, adding Life is Strange to its list alongside its <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/">Tomb Raider</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">God of War</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-tv-series-from-amazon-will-star-henry-cavill/">Warhammer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-is-a-live-action-tv-adaptation-of-the-game-series-due-this-october-on-amazon-prime-video/">Like a Dragon: Yakuza</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">Mass Effect</a> TV series. Similar to some of the aforementioned adaptations, there have been multiple attempts at making a Life is Strange adaptation work in some way, with Amazon Prime Video finally being the one to close on a deal.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Amazon MGM Studios has greenlit Life is Strange, based on the critically acclaimed best-selling video game, straight to series from creator/showrunner Charlie Covell.</p><p>Square Enix, Story Kitchen, and LuckyChap set as producers. <a href="https://t.co/r595wGEVRx">pic.twitter.com/r595wGEVRx</a></p></div>— Amazon MGM Studios (@AmazonMGMStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonMGMStudio/status/1963995557673796088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>On the part of Story Kitchen, Johnson and Goldberg said, "<em>Story Kitchen has always believed that ‘Life is Strange’ deserved to be more than just a game—it’s a cultural touchstone</em>. <em>After a decade-long journey, we’re honored to be bringing this beloved story to Amazon MGM alongside our incredible partners at Square Enix, our brilliant showrunner/writer Charlie Covell, and the amazing team at LuckyChap. Together, this thoughtfully assembled dream team is ready to share Life is Strange with the world in an entirely new way!</em>"</p>



<p>For Covell's part, they added, "<em>It’s a huge honor to be adapting ‘Life Is Strange’ for Amazon MGM Studios</em>. <em>I am a massive fan of the game, and I’m thrilled to be working with the incredible teams at Square Enix, Story Kitchen and LuckyChap. I can’t wait to share Max and Chloe’s story with fellow players and new audiences alike</em>."</p>



<p>Square Enix External Studios co-studio heads Jon Brooke and Lee Singleton added, "<em>For years we’ve had so many people asking us to create a ‘Life is Strange’ TV show and we’re so pleased to finally partner with Amazon MGM Studios who we trust will do an incredible job bringing our universe to life</em>."</p>



<p>With its setting, gameplay, and narrative focus, Life is Strange is a clear candidate for adaptation fodder in what's been a renaissance for videogame to TV or movie adaptations in recent years. So far, Amazon has only proven itself with its Fallout series, and with so many other adaptations in the works, not just at Amazon, it's worth asking when people will start feeling fatigued from all these adaptations, especially if the quality bar on them takes a drastic drop. </p>

But it commits one terrible, unforgiveable sin: Silksong won't let players pet the dang dog-er, well, the bug that's <em>like</em> a dog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: Spoilers for the first few hours of Hollow Knight: Silksong follow.

The Bell Beast is encountered early in the game in The Marrow, trapped within enormous silk webs. You need to unlock the Silk Spear to free it, and once you do, a fight will ensue. We've got a whole guide on this guy if you're having trouble finding or defeating him, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bell_Beast_Boss_Guide">so make sure to check that out</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you beat the Bell Beast, it becomes docile, and you can summon it at any fast travel station to have it take you to any other station in Pharloom. That in itself is helpful enough, but the absolute best thing about the Bell Beast is how it basically acts like a big puppy whenever it sees you. It'll dig around in the bells beneath its feet, react excitedly when you ring the bells above its head, and genuinely just gives off enormous puppy energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>But Hornet can't pet it. </em>And fans really feel like they should be able to!
