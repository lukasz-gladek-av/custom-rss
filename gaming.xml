            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/repo">R.E.P.O</a> is a six player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> extraction spooper that currently sits atop Steam's best seller charts, having amassed around 70k players the week following early access launch on Feb 26, and another 160k since then. That's around 230 thousand players avoiding knifey chef frogs and persistent ducklings while extracting valuables to fill a cash quota. It's a bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> but even heavier on the absurdity.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this popularity comes down to two things. Firstly, the game is a verdant flub factory, stuffed with the sort of chaotic physics mishaps that translate very well to short video clips. Even the loot extraction point can kill you if lingered in too long. Secondly, the 'Jim Henson does <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> Automata' robots you play as flap their mouths in time to your mic chatter, making even the most bowel-curdling fear shrieks from your teammates look like a hammy comedy routine.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'd usually emit a croaking complaint about being too old for anything viral - the acrid dust cloud from my throat lingering in the air momentarily before cascading downwards and coating me in a grimy sheen of irrelevancy - but R.E.P.O. actually looks great. As it stands, though, you need five willing friends to play: a truly biblical quantity of mates, in the sense that it'd be faster to carve co-op partners from my own ribs than hash out that sort of byzantine scheduling.</p>
<p>Good news re: my organs staying shielded - developer Semiwork are planning on introducing public or private matchmaking. This'll come with a kick button to keep players honest, although they do say it's not quite that simple, since server coding is new ground for them. Here's the update video.</p>
<figure>

<p>Joining ironmates mode is a new museum level, which they show off by demonstrating some award-winning box parkour. There's also some quality of life bits, like a border at extraction points to show when loot is out of bounds so you don't accidentally let it get crushed. Semiwork also show off a squinty, angry facial expression. Finally, there's a bucket you can pop over the duckling monster that likes to imprint motherhood on one of your crew then follow you around getting in your way and biting anyone that tries to touch it.</p>
<p>My current idea o' the day is Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the 'chronotope' - time and space configurations as a kind of contextual bubble -  as mentioned by valued RPS community member #9976 in the comments to Sunday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-80-days-heavens-vault-and-a-highland-songs-jon-ingold?view=comme">Booked For The Week</a>. A fifteen minute internet rabbit hole with coffee this morning led me to <a href="https://youtu.be/r4yluKPhTKE">this video</a> by the eminently listenable Belgian sociolinguist Jan Blommaert, who gives the example of a lecture: the space is the hall, the time is the lecture slot, and this particular chronotope encourages or necessities certain identities, roles, or modes of behaviour within in. An insightful framing of the twin navigations of interpersonal relationships and horror-harried spaces in social extraction games? You, uh, you might be starting to see why I'm enthusiastic about R.E.P.O.'s no-mates mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Heinlein. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/starship-troopers-neill-blomkamp-1236327071/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/starship-troopers-remake-set-neill-blomkamp-1236338005/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> backed up the report.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new Starship Troopers movie is not a continuation of or related to Paul Verhoeven’s cult classic 1997 sci-fi satire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/starship-troopers">Starship Troopers</a>. Rather it is a new adaptation of Heinlein’s novel, and comes from Sony’s Columbia Pictures.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/16/starship-troopers-1742154834885.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers satirized the novel upon which it is based.

Arrowhead's Helldivers is heavily inspired by Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and sees cannon fodder soldiers tasked with defending a satirized fascist Super Earth regime from alien bugs, among other enemy factions, while preaching Liberty and Managed Democracy to the masses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony now faces the prospect of having new Starship Troopers and Helldivers movies going up against each other, although The Hollywood Reporter said Blomkamp’s take is not a remake of the Verhoeven movie, rather a return to the source material. Heinlein’s book that Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers is based on differs strongly in tone from the film, with many believing it promotes the ideals the film satirizes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither this new Starship Troopers nor the Helldivers movie has a release window, so it may be some time before we see or hear from either project. Blomkamp’s last film was Sony’s own Gran Turismo, an adaptation of the long-running PlayStation-exclusive driving simulation series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by TriStar Pictures/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-actor-ashly-burch-says-sonys-ai-aloy-video-left-her-feeling-worried-about-game-performance-as-an-art-form<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon actor Ashly Burch has addressed the AI Aloy video that leaked online last week, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Verge</u></a> reported on the emergence of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leaked-internal-sony-video-uses-horizons-aloy-to-show-ai-powered-playstation-character-prototype">an internal Sony video showing off tech that uses Aloy from the Horizon series to demonstrate AI-powered characters</a>. Sony has yet to respond to IGN’s request for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the now deleted video, Sony Interactive Entertainment director of software engineering, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, has a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy via voice prompts and AI-generated speech and facial animations. Raghoebardajal asks Aloy how she's doing, to which she responds: "Hello, I'm managing alright. Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice heard coming from Aloy's mouth is clearly not that of Burch, rather a robotic voice similar to those heard from text-to-speech voice generators. AI Aloy's facial movements are stiff and her eyes appear lifeless as she converses with Raghoebardajal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Burch, who has voiced Aloy in all four Horizon video games released so far (Zero Dawn, Forbidden West, Call of the Mountain, and Lego Horizon Adventures) took to social media platform TikTok to confirm that she had seen the video, and that Horizon developer Guerrilla had got in touch to let her know that the tech demo did not reflect anything that was in active development, nor did it use any of Burch’s performance (facial or voice data). That presumably rules out AI Aloy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">the upcoming Horizon multiplayer game, assuming the character is in the game, and the inevitable Horizon 3</a>. However, as Burch pointed out, Guerrilla (and parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment) owns Aloy as a character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all this in mind, Burch said the AI Aloy video left her feeling “worried about game performance as an art form,” and used it as a jumping off point to discuss the ongoing video game voice actors strike that has claimed a number of high-profile casualties in recent weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) issued an update to its members on the status of negotiations over video game actor AI protections, saying that while progress had been made, it was still "frustratingly far apart" with the industry bargaining group on key issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently what we’re fighting for is, you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form, you have to compensate us fairly, and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double,” Burch said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements. I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility, it makes me so sad it hurts my heart. It scares me. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue to do this job. If we don’t win, that future is really compromised.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast,” Burch continued. “Certainly not Guerrilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology isn’t the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I support the strike. I’ve always supported the strike. I believe fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and the longevity of this career that we all love so much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Burch then pointed to the temporary union contracts that currently give all the protections the striking voice actors are asking for, that any video game company can sign right now. “There’s the interim, the tiered, and low budget agreement contracts available right now for any game company to sign,” Burch said. “I believe we deserve to be protected.”</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734" data-video-id="7481742753991314734"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@ashly.burch" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ashly.burch</a> <p data-cy="paragraph">let us speak on AI aloy</p> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7481742843657194286?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Ashly Burch" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - Ashly Burch</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen"><u>Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets</u></a> as part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an "AI slop" zombie Santa loading screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the voice actor strike has begun to impact a number of video games. Players have reported that games such as Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft appear to have certain NPCs left unvoiced in otherwise voiced scenes, likely due to the strike. Late last year, SAG-AFTRA struck League of Legends after Riot <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-strikes-league-of-legends-over-alleged-flagrant-violation-of-labor-law"><u>allegedly tried to subvert the strike by canceling a game in response</u></a>. And Activision confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 characters were recast</u></a> after players expressed concern about new voices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-voice-actors-say-they-found-out-they-were-replaced-when-the-patch-notes-went-live"><u>two Zenless Zone Zero voice actors revealed</u></a> they learned they'd been replaced when they saw the game's latest patch notes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything"><u>weighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers</u></a> who seek "personalization across everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-reportedly-compared-to-elden-ring-for-its-player-freedom/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet may be very different from what we're used to in Naughty Dog games. The studio's trademark has usually been cinematic, narrative-driven games, at least since Uncharted and, of course, The Last of Us.</p>
<p>However, MinnMax's Ben Hanson teased that he had heard from his sources that the studio's next project was being compared to something else. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhdtygZnYqI&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 2024 podcast</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>I heard from somebody very in the know who worked on the game that they're like Jesus Christ... the tone was like you are all not ready for how amazing this is going to be... and the tone was (I'm not going to say the game that they referenced to compare it)... but they compared to a game with a lot of player freedom.</em></p>
<p>Back then, the game hadn't been unveiled yet. That happened a couple of months later at The Game Awards 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a gorgeous debut trailer</a>. Now that the dust has settled, in the latest episode of The MinnMax Show, Ben Hanson has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rcMrvLXPNY&amp;t=7232s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> exactly which game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was being likened to:</p>
<p><em>I think it's fine to say it now: that game was Elden Ring that it was compared to back then. If I would have said 'Naughty Dog's next game is like Elden Ring' and then that reveal trailer came out, I feel like we would have been lit on fire. But now that idea of, okay, it's taking place on one planet, kind of uncovering the history of this world, you can kind of see a little more where they might be going with that.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Neil Druckmann has since provided a bit more context. Before the reveal, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-druckmann-new-project-is-the-most-thrilling-yet-may-redefine-mainstreams-perception-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that the new game was fresh to the studio, and he was curious about the players' reactions. This certainly fits such a big change in the degree of player freedom compared to Naughty Dog's most recent games.</p>
<p>Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> as recently as last week that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet would be a lonely game for players, unlike Uncharted and The Last of Us, where the main characters were almost always accompanied by allies. This is another hint that MinnMax's report is correct.</p>
<p>Of course, many questions remain. Is this a full-fledged action RPG, then? Can players explore the world of Sempiria in whichever order they see fit? Naughty Dog will undoubtedly respond in due time, although the game creator himself has also warned the project is still some ways off, so we might have to wait a while before learning all those details.</p>

            <p>I very much recommend the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784470/9_Kings/">Steam demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/9-kings">9 Kings</a>, so it's with no shade I say that I'm using 'strategy' here the same way a tube passenger might use a hardback of Ulysses to envelop their novelisation of 2 Fast 2 Furious. Griddy placement and tower defence tactics are involved, but this is primarily a game about launching rocks at dickheads. This is fine by me: launching rocks at dickheads is as solid a premise as any videogame needs to have.</p>

<p>You'll start off with a 9 square grid surrounding a castle, then fill out those plots each turn by picking one of three cards. Some are buildings, like a cemetery that summons imps to fight in place of your slain units. Some are troops who'll rush to the centre of the battlefield at the beginning of each round. Your troops fight automatically, but you do have an important job here. I'm not sure if I mentioned it already: it's dropping rocks on heads. When you drop a rock really good, your dying foes squeak in falsetto anguish like a Lemming opening a devastating phone bill.</p>
<p>I'm being a touch facetious when I say it's all about rocks and heads. The demo is naturally a stripped-back sample, and even within it, I did start to notice some emerging combos. I gifted a square to some mercenary units early. They grew in number the more gold I had, which meant I could skip turns guilt-free by throwing cards down a well later, since each time I got bonus gold and so more bodies. There's also plenty of choice in how you expand your original plot, with positional buffs for certain buildings</p>
<p>Steam sez:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Build up your city into the most powerful of all kingdoms. Through endless combinations of buildings, troops, spells and positioning, find ways to break the game and become overpowered. Grow your kingdom in strategic ways, prepare for dozens of unique events, and show the world your kingdom can last longer than any other."</p></blockquote>
<p>If the full game contains lore, I would like to know where the rocks come from. They evidently come from your castle but there's no catapult or anything, just a void containing infinite rocks and the means to launch them. Gargantuan slingshot? Monkey with strong tail? Hellstorm rock battery? Answers, please, when the full game launches this April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, a fan-made standalone remake of Counter-Strike called CS: Legacy was unveiled with an announcement trailer. It's being made by a small group of developers who previously worked on CSPromod between 2008 and 2012 and have since got back together for this new project.</p>
<p>According to them, CS: Legacy will be a completely standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6, built from the ground up with entirely custom code and game assets (textures, models, sounds, animations, UI, et cetera). The game is built on Valve's official 2013 Source Engine SDK codebase, with the developers making their own major rewrites to the renderer, shaders and various systems. It runs on its own advanced custom branch of Valve's official Source Engine 2013 public SDK. The aforementioned tweaks include a custom renderer, Physically Based Rendering shaders, a wholly rewritten reflection system, a fully custom UI, custom in-house source engine tools, and many more features.</p>
<p>The early access will include five maps: Dust2, Nuke, Train, Poolday, Aim_map. Fans can support CS: Legacy by subscribing <a href="https://www.patreon.com/CSLegacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the team's Patreon</a>, which includes six tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 - Lock and Load ($8 / month)</li>

<li>Tier 5 - Monster Kill ($108.50 / month)</li>
<li>Tier 6 - Godlike 1337 ($1,447.50 / month)</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter allows all the previous tier rewards as well as the following exclusive ones:</p>

Through the simple act of taking a photo, photography games and photo modes implore us to notice our surroundings, document our experience, and take a moment to commit to memory the images and emotions that we felt along the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To better explore those connections and mechanics, Game Developer is publishing a series of new articles digging into the topic, and highlighting some classics as well. Come along with us as we take a look at the history of photography in video games and its popular uses within the genre and preview the new interviews, essays, and deep dives publishing in the days to come.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ll be highlighting reader-submitted articles throughout the week and there’s tons of great stuff to look forward to, like an essay from Beasts of Maravilla Island developer Michelle Olson about eschewing photographic critique, an interview with the developers of Texas Chainsaw Massacre on why they went with the free release of an idyllic photography minigame as a prequel to their horror title, and a poignant feature from our senior editor Bryant Francis on what basic photography tips can teach us about making better photo modes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ll also be revisiting interviews, blogs and features from Game Developer’s recent past, unearthing postmortems from games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/postmortem-sundae-month-s-pupperazzi">Pupperazzi</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/postmortem-toem">TOEM</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as well as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-some-indies-are-approaching-photography-mechanics-in-their-games">interviews with indie developers about how they’re using photography in video games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Stay tuned for insight on how these games are put together and the features that developers find vital to the photography game experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If this topic fascinates you, there’s still time to submit an article to our blog section about photography games and photo modes in video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take a peek at our blog submission guidelines and FAQ, head over to our blog submission page and send us your thoughts.</span></p></div></div><div data-module="text-box"><h2>The Player Experience of Scoring (&amp; What is a "Good Photo" Anyway??)</h2><div data-module="content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>From 'The eye of the beholder: Measuring player success in photography games' by Michelle Olson</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While scoring photos as a mechanic does provide extra feedback on the player’s actions, and can create ways for content to be gated or progression to be measured, it creates a very specific mindset when one is taking photos in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To me, this type of photography feels more like client work, rather than artistic expression. Not only is there a prompt of what to take a picture of, but there are strict guidelines on how that subject should be photographed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Pokemon Snap offers some variety by providing different opportunities to photograph the same subject in different environments, players aren’t able to have full freedom of composition.</span></p></div></div><div data-module="content-spotlight"><article title="Photo Wk - Blog Spotlight" text-alignment="left" data-testid="content-spotlight-article"><div data-testid="content-spotlight-content-container"><p data-testid="content-spotlight-summary">Featured Blog</p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-eye-of-the-beholder-measuring-player-success-in-photography-games" data-discover="true"><h2 data-testid="content-spotlight-heading">The eye of the beholder: Measuring player success in photography games</h2></a><p data-testid="content-spotlight-body">An exploration on how different photography games measure player progress, and how to balance progression metrics and artistic freedom.</p></div></article></div><div data-module="text-box"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, there are often ways to achieve the “best” shot - a particular photo of a particular behavior that will always be worth more points than any other photo a player takes with the same subject. While these moments are often adorable and lovely, it creates an opportunity where one very specific composition is incentivized, and disincentivizes taking other interesting photos of the same subject.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a totally valid way of approaching this type of gameplay - to give a prompt, and ensure the player captures the prompt to the specifications of what the game wants to see. In essence, this “gamifies” the art of photography.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, I think it’s important to ask ourselves as designers of photography games - do I want this to feel like client work? Or do I want this to feel like artistic expression? Either is appropriate, so long as we are deeply intentional about it.</span></p></div><div data-module="content-spotlight"><article title="Photo Week - Manual Highlight 1" text-alignment="left" data-testid="content-spotlight-article"><div data-testid="content-spotlight-content-container"><p data-testid="content-spotlight-summary">Sweet Snaps &amp; Expressive Edits</p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/alekon-lets-players-make-the-picture-perfect-photo-album" data-discover="true"><h2 data-testid="content-spotlight-heading">Alekon lets players make the picture perfect photo album</h2></a><p data-testid="content-spotlight-body">This Pokémon Snap-inspired game uses robust photo editing tools to create an expressive space for players.</p></div></article></div><div data-module="content-spotlight"><article title="Photo Wk - Spotlight 2" text-alignment="left" data-testid="content-spotlight-article"><div data-testid="content-spotlight-content-container"><p data-testid="content-spotlight-summary">Dynamic Photos in a 2D World</p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/deep-dive-how-custom-tools-made-the-2d-photo-mode-of-a-highland-song-sing" data-discover="true"><h2 data-testid="content-spotlight-heading">Deep Dive: How custom tools made the 2D photo mode of A Highland Song sing</h2></a><p data-testid="content-spotlight-body">Photography isn't just for 3D games.

"Don't bore your friends with photos that would bore you if they weren't your own," he wrote. "If you're shooting the sunrise over Bar Harbor, Maine, don't try to include your half-asleep spouse." Sarcasm was a second language for Grandpa, but I remember he seemed sincerely frustrated at how his peers didn't understand the basics of photography, equaled only by his frustration of how they were intimidated by computers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Photography Week, I revisited his guide and thought about how he was trying to teach fellow retirees better ways to take shots.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-art-to-programming-conversation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first component is the words themselves, and how you decide to have them stored. For the purposes of the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rockin’ Racket</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, on which I am a Programmer and part-time Artist, we used Ink. Ink is a narrative scripting language developed by Inkle Studios. I am in no way an expert on it so if you would like to learn more I suggest reading about it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, the general idea of an Ink file is to structure a text file into a conversation, with each line of text being a line of dialogue, but with the added bonus of having specific use cases for multiple different options for the next line, sections of conversations, and a variable system. Ink files also allow for dependencies, meaning developers can have an Ink file which uses variables from another through the “INCLUDE” keyword. The core of my work was in regards to programmatically reading Ink files within scripts for Unity, which is streamlined through the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ink-Unity Integration</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> package developed by the same company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The package compiles Ink files into readable JSON files that, inside scripts, can be converted into Story objects. These Story objects store the current line, variables, and an incredibly handy, line specific type of variable called a tag which is indicated as “#tagName: tagValue”. Each tag is a part of an attribute of the Story that updates for each line. Now that you are more aware of Ink files and their capabilities, I can discuss the dialogue system which I developed for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rockin Racket</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The dialogue system I developed was meant to be a fully independent piece that could be put into a scene, and work with no issue. To achieve this, I have a system of triggers and a manager, wherein the triggers have an attached ink file that, upon being triggered, sends its ink file to the manager object. The manager object deals with both the graphical display of the dialogue, and the programming backend. In order for players to see the dialogue, the UI consists of a main dialogue panel, where in the top left corner is a nametag, the middle of the panel is where lines of dialogue appear, the bottom is where dialogue choice buttons appear, and the center of the right-side is the continue dialogue button. Behind the main panel are two character sprites, a smaller sprite on the left indicates the player character, and a larger sprite across the whole right-side of the screen is the character being spoken to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To achieve a reactive and dynamic system we used a mixture of ink tags to update the nametag, update the emotions of the speaker, and the layout of the dialogue window. In order to use the ink tags in Unity, you must first process them from the Story object. Luckily, each tag is actually just a string of characters after a # symbol in Ink, and all tags present in a line can be retrieved through the currentTags attribute of the Story object as a list of strings. However, this structure does mean that you must first process tag values, by splitting them, before using them. To split a tag, you can just use the built in “split” String function in Unity, and store the split strings in a length 2 array. The first element at index 0 will be the key for the tag, and the second element at index 1 will be the value. Then, you can set up differing behaviors for different tag keys. After implementing tag processing, I worked with the narrative writer to ensure three tags were present, speaker, portrait, and layout.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The layout tag is obviously used to update the layout which is a simple call to a Unity Animator. Animators in Unity can be used for far more than just importing frame-by-frame animations, but one easy use they can have is to save certain sets of object positions, which is perfect for saving layouts. The other tags are more interesting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The speaker tag is the name of the character speaking which, depending on the character, updates the nametag to the value given in the tag, and updates the background color of the name tag to match the character speaking, since each main character in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rockin’ Racket</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a signature color that defines their palette.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The portrait tag is the most complex, but is still relatively straightforward. For starts, each line that changes the portrait tag has to have 2 of them, one for the player character sprite, and one for the other character sprite. However, since each tag is a string, unlike normal variables in programming languages, two different portrait tags will be processed. To determine which sprite Animator to use, the first word of the string is checked to see if it is “harvey”, the name of the player character. If it is, then the animator used is the one that updates the player character sprite, but if it is not, then the animator used is the non-player character sprite. Each animator has a list of recorded animations, and the tag values of tags with key “portrait” are names of the animations, and the manager tells the animator to play the tag value, essentially allowing Ink to tell Unity what to animate next.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The&nbsp; easiest piece is retrieving the next line of dialogue, which is a simple call of the “nextLine” method on the Story object. The return value is a string with that line of dialogue which you can simply update a TextMesh object to display the retrieved value. However, calling it also moves the Story along, meaning you need to handle tags whenever calling this method.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To allow for player input, Story objects also have a currentChoices attribute, wherein you can determine if choices are available at a given line, and how many. By calling this method whenever progressing, you can check whether the line is a simple dialogue continuation, or if you need to show choice options. Implementing choice options is also quite simple, as each choice is set to an index corresponding to their position in the currentChoices list. Then, by setting each choice as its index, you can determine what choice the player makes and call the “chooseChoiceIndex” method on your Story object, using the index of the player choice as input. After it's a simple call of “nextLine” to progress the story to the right dialogue tree! Altogether, this system helps create an adaptable workflow, and opportunities for interesting UI elements!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you would like to follow the development progress of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rockin Racket</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you can find the project’s socials below!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rockinracket/">Instagram</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/rockinracket">Twitter (X)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@RockinRacket">Youtube</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The foundation of the mathematical principles of Bezier curves are the Bernstein polynomials which were established in 1912. There are countless usages of Bezier curves in the field of computer science, from animating smooth transitions for user interfaces and rendering dynamic fonts, to creating modeling tools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In basic terms, Bezier curves are defined with a variable number of control points. With just two control points, it forms a straight line, also known as a linear Bezier curve. However, things get more interesting when there are more than two control points. A Bezier curve with three control points is a quadratic Bezier curve, while one with four points is a cubic Bezier curve, and so forth. Quadratic and cubic Bezier curves are particularly popular in tween animations because of their balance between computational simplicity and the capacity to represent an unlimited range of curves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The parametric equation of a Bezier curve can be written as:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">where:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">B(t) is the point on the Bezier curve at the parameter t.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">n is the degree of the Bezier curve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">P_i are the control points.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Implementation">Implementation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this section, we will explore the practical implementation of a Bezier curve using JavaScript. Starting with the binomial coefficient function. We can use a recursive approach due to its simplicity. However, recursion may not be the most efficient for large values due to the potential of stack overflow and excessive function calls. For those cases, an iterative solution would be more suitable. In the case of Bezier curves, the most commonly used variants are the quadratic and cubic ones, so a recursive implementation is enough:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving on to the core of our implementation which is the Bezier curve equation itself. To encapsulate our logic, we can create a class called ‘BezierCurve’ that has an array of control points. It also provides a method named ‘getPoint’ that returns a point on the curve with the t parameter as the input. The implementation is shown below:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the ‘BezierCurve’ class in place, we now have a basic implementation of a parametric Bezier curve. In order to make things more interesting, below is a simple rendering of our ‘BezierCurve’ class in action:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The graph showcases a cubic Bezier curve, with its shape influenced by the four control points marked in red. In the next section, we will uncover some practical applications of the Bezier curves.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Use Bezier curves for animations">Use Bezier curves for animations</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bezier curves are commonly used in animation engines, offering a way to provide smooth transitions. For example, in web development, CSS provides native support for custom easing functions using Bezier curves. The same goes for software and game development, where UI design requires flexibility and modularity. As an example, a menu pop-up animation might need to start quickly and decelerate towards the end. Implementing such non-linear dynamic animation directly through code can be complex, and might have less control over variables in the animation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Bezier curves, this process can be simplified by defining a curve with four points, starting at (0, 0) and ending at (1, 1) to clamp the animation within a normalized range, and adding two control points to create the desired smooth effects. For the pop-up effect, the two middle control points can be at (0.25, 1) and (0.5, 1) respectively to generate a Bezier curve commonly known as “ease out quad” in CSS and tween engines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To illustrate this, we will provide an example of how we can apply Bezier curves to a simple linear animation. Consider the following basic JavaScript code snippet that changes the transparency of a circle linearly:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The result animation looks like this:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To enrich this animation with a smoother transition, we can incorporate our ‘BezierCurve’ class by defining an “ease out quad” curve with control points of (0, 0), (0.25, 1), (0.5, 1) and (1, 1). Then replacing the linear alpha transition with the result of the ‘getPoint’ method, we can achieve a more refined animation:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The modification yields an animation that starts quickly and slows down gently.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Besides the common “ease out quad” ease type, there are numerous predefined ease types that can add more characteristics to animations. We can also easily create our own ease types with the help of websites such as https://easings.net/.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Use Bezier curves for movement">Use Bezier curves for movement</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Apart from providing smooth animations for applications and games, Bezier curves can also be used to define a curved path for objects in games to move along. Consider a 2D shooter game where some enemies move in different paths. While straightforward paths like a straight line or even a circle can be hard-coded, this approach lacks flexibility and makes adjusting and visualizing the path challenging.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For this case, we can also use Bezier curves to both visualize and design complex paths with ease. Here’s an example of an object moving along a visualized curved path defined by a set of Bezier curve control points:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s a basic idea of how it works: the Bezier curve provides a set of positions based on the t parameter which represents time. By updating the object’s position to correspond with these points, it’s able to traverse through the path smoothly.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s all for this post. There are still many other applications of Bezier curves. In conclusion, the flexibility and modularity of Bezier curves make it a powerful tool for developers. It simplifies complex curve equations into easier representations with control points.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">References</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#:~:text=A%20B%C3%A9zier%20curve%20(%2F%CB%88b,by%20means%20of%20a%20formula.">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#:~:text=A%20B%C3%A9zier%20curve%20(%2F%CB%88b,by%20means%20of%20a%20formula.</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">https://easings.net/</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/some-factors-to-managing-a-team<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Pexels user Helena Lopes.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Introduction</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the capstone for the Game Development Specialization for Computer Science majors at Indiana University, I have been working as a Systems Programmer and a Project Manager at Crystalline Games LLC. The company was formed as part of the program, and the capstone/goal of the develop a game from concept to release by the time you graduate. Every team needs proper communication and cooperation, whether it is a massive AAA studio or a small studio of college students who aren’t even getting paid to make the game. As my time with the team lengthened, I took on more managerial responsibilities in alignment with my skills. In this post, I will review some key experiences I learned during this time. As of now, December 2023, the project is still ongoing, so I may come to learn even better ways to help the teams I am part of work together and become efficient.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Balancing Management and Programming Work">Balancing Management and Programming Work</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As part of a small team, my role consists of both programming and team management. I work alongside the producer/lead programmer to help delegate programming tasks each week. I also am responsible for the majority of code branch reviews. As a student, there is limited time each week to work on the game, so balancing the management and programming tasks I have each week is vital. Communication plays a key role in this balance. Since I am not the only person who can perform these tasks, I work with the lead programmer each week to get help when needed for them. This is the first buffer to issues with time management for completing tasks for both my roles. If that is not an option for a particular week, the next choice is to prioritize development over review and management tasks. Our game is yet to arrive at an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) status, so we prioritize developing the minimum level of content first. There will be other weeks with extra time available for either me or the lead programmer to complete the management and review work. Depending on the state of your game and the size of your team, you may need, or not need at all, different ways to balance multiple roles and tasks for each week.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Learning What to Expect From Co-Workers">Learning What to Expect From Co-Workers</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Especially on an unpaid project with college students, everyone will have a different level of dedication and time available for the project. With this in mind, it is important to keep track of the types of tasks each member struggles with and excels with, and how often people are over/under estimating the work they can complete each sprint. The better aware you are of who is good at what, the easier it will be to delegate tasks without issues. It is also good to keep in mind what parts of the code and systems the person knows well or has been continually working on. The fresher the details of the code, the easier it is to work with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;Another important thing to be aware from co-workers is the level of communication they provide. Some people need to be directly and explicitly told how and what they need to communicate, or they will not communicate at all. Some people will communicate all their work enthusiastically. Communication is a key component to all team work and even small updates on the timeline of workflow can help with project management. The sooner you can be aware of issues, the sooner they can be resolved or worked around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;Learning what to expect from your co-workers will help team management run smoothly, and will help prevent issues before they ever happen, especially in small team environments where there is less room for error or overlapping work.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ask For Help!">Ask For Help!</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is pretty straightforward, don’t be afraid to ask for help from your co-workers! Ask for help as early as you think you may need it. Asking for help is beneficial in two ways, it communicates a potential problem to managerial roles, and it can also get the potential problem solved quicker than it would with asking. It’s quite common to hear “nobody can do everything on their own” and that’s true. That is why we are on a team in the first place. A new mindset helping brainstorm ideas is one of the best ways to problem solve. If team members aren’t available, there are forums like Stack Exchange, or even game developer discord channels where you can ask for help. Many times, whoever you ask will be willing to help, because you are a team or a member of the community, so it never hurts to ask for help. It will make everything run smoother.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The operation of an efficient game development team is extraordinarily difficult to balance. These are a few key factors I have found influence the operations the most. As long as someone on the team can be in charge of managing these communication and coordination worries, the team can operate smoothly.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/user-testing-ui-on-an-ever-changing-design<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the past 2 years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on my company’s upcoming indie game. It presented several challenges as I was filling in multiple roles: lead producer and UI artist. Our design struggled to be solidified time and time again as the type of gameplay we were trying to create was a combination of genres, so we had very little to base our concept on. However, it taught me an important lesson regarding leadership and decision making. Don’t fall into the trap of eternal ideation, make a choice and try it out.</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Make a choice/Develop a Design</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Create a bare bones prototype</span></p></div></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first iteration of our UI bar in game lacked a lot of stylistic decision. My goal was to use UI to determine how the game should add pressure and goals for the player. The best way to quickly determine this was to add in a timer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We liked how the timer worked in playtesting and moved forward by adding in complexity. So, I created a bar that filled when the player collected pick-ups, but consistently lowered at the same time to simulate a timer. I also made the decision to add in simple theming to make the UI feel slightly more unified with the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, I had to work with the team to tackle a new design issue: multiple pick-ups.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">This is the part of the design where our game was undergoing some key design choices. It was very hard for the team to settle on one UI direction, so I finally made the choice to move forward with a concept.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted to convey to the player that they were collecting multiple objects at different rates, so I created 4 bars. To test if the concept was clear, we decided to remove the timer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I put them all together in one pot and user tested. This user test was interesting because before this point, gameplay goals had never been vocalized as extremely unclear. Additionally, the UI took up way too much of the screen and demanded too much visually from the player. So, I went back to the drawing board.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I decided to rework the design so that it would require 2 UI elements: 1 that tracked the collective pick-up count and one that tracked each individual bar that the player could refer to on their own time. This was done because the design goals for the player were becoming much too complicated for a single element. The number of pick-ups had became important knowledge, so I cut the old UI in half to make it look more like a bar. This was met with mixed reviews. The counter-bar did its job and made the player goal much clearer, but the intention behind the art was lost on the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, I settled on a flame that also nodded to our theme, but worked much better for a counter. To make the goal clearer and more challenging I worked with a programmer to put locks on certain items that would only disappear when the player reached the number count presented. This user test went very smoothly and let us know that we could now move on to polishing the art. In the meantime, we decided to start workshopping the individual pick-up bars that would be displayed on a separate menu. That has yet to be implemented, but I am excited to see how that process will go.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This entire process has reiterated to me time and time again how important it is to playtest concepts as much as possible. Many of the designs above worked in one moment, but failed when new elements were added to the game. In addition, I would like to note the importance of testing for accessibility. I discussed the color choices for this first pass art with many color blind testers to solidify that the game my company is making is accessable to all players. But overall, the biggest lesson my design team has had to endure during this process is don’t rule things out before you’ve tried them. Sometimes, the most complex design isn’t the best one. There are more solutions than you’ll see the first time around.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
