            <p>Electronic Arts, publishers of Clive Barker's Undying and Pooh and Tigger's Hunny Safari, have let employees know that they're ending full remote working and hiring, and implementing return to office for all employees as part of hybrid work plans, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">reports IGN</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In-person work results in a "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players," said CEO and unholy human-blazer hybrid Andrew Wilson in an email to employees, viewed by IGN. As a player, I do wish these people would stop speaking for me to make their employees' lives worse</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means that all employees of the company within 30 miles of an EA building will be forced to transition to a hybrid work model with at least three days a week in office. Those outside this radius will be, according to the somewhat ominous wording in an email to employees from president Laura Miele, "considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid".</p>
<p>IGN chatted to several employees anonymously, who report feeling upset, confused, or unsure about what will happen to their jobs if they couldn't move within that 30 mile radius. "Existing remote workers would have their 'exemptions' to return to office 'sunset' sometime in the next 3 to 24 months," two sources explained to IGN. Childcare, medical conditions, and long commutes were all given as reasons. RTO mandates are sometimes referred to as "quiet layoffs"  due to these sorts of issues - at some level, EA must be aware that some of their employees would find it impossible to meet the new requirements.</p>
<p>EA recently laid off around 300 workers, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">around 100 at Titanfall studio Respawn</a>. Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">they laid off 5% of their workforce, close to 670</a>. Andrew Wilson and Laura Miele <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">took home around $40 million between them in 2024</a>. According to one Ebay listing I found, this is enough to buy 3 million second hand copies of Pooh and Tigger's Hunny Safari - far more copies than anyone would ever need.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
EA has detailed a new in-office working policy that will see all local employees return at least three days a week, and largely phase out remote roles.
</p>
<p>
The changes mean any employee living within a 30-mile radius will be required to commute at least three days a week under a new hyrbid policy. 
</p>
<p>
Employees working outside of that 30-mile radius will continue to work remotely unless their role is designated oherwise - though there's uncertainty over EA saying it will additionally  "sunset the Offsite Local work model" over the next "three to 24 months", depending on location.
</p>
<p>
Staff members this affects told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">IGN</a> they believe this means existing remote workers will have their "exemptions" removed over the next two years, with uncertainty over any remote working after that time. 
</p>
<p>
Certainly, it sounds like fully remote work will be an exception going forward. Any exception to the above policies or future hiring for a remote position will need direct approval from EA CEO Andrew Wilson or company president Laura Miele, the latter said in an email, describing the changes as a shift from "a decentralised approach to a globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model".
</p>
<p>
Explaining the changes, Wilson said in-person work was EA's preference as it provided "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted EA for detail on how this policy will impact the company's UK studios. 
</p>
<p>Numerous employers are attempting to bring staff back to offices following years of remote working - to a mixed response. In March 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developers-blast-rockstars-reckless-decision-to-return-to-office-full-time">developers working on GTA 6 criticised Rockstar for telling employees they must return to the office full-time</a> with just a month's notice, calling the decision "reckless". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Call%20of%20Duty:%20Black%20Ops%206%20developers%20protest%20over%20office%20working%20policy">Protests were held by Call of Duty developers</a> in autumn last year over Activision's return-to-office plans, around the same time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Ubisoft%20staff%20told%20to%20strike%20over%20remote%20working%20changes">Ubisoft workers also went on strike in Paris</a>.

		<p>Ubisoft has decided to extend the development timelines for some of its “biggest productions”, in order to try and ensure they meet the high bar set by the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, both by critics and at the tills.</p>
<p>These are unnamed titles that did not have confirmed launch windows, pushing their release back to mid-2026, 2027 or early 2028 and generally giving development teams longer to work on projects. The suggestion that these are their top tier games, and from an investor call Q&amp;A, this would refer to the publisher’s top brands, including Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six, The Division and Ghost Recon.</p>


<p>“After a review of our pipeline,” CEO Yves Guillemot said, “we have decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success. As a consequence, FY2026-27 and FY2027-28 will see significant content coming from our largest brands.”</p>
<p>This gives an indication to investors that there will not be a massive budget release this financial year. The company still has committed launches for Anno 117: Pax Romana, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/10/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-now-set-for-2026/">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>, The Division Resurgence spin-off, Rainbow Six Mobile, Rainbow Six Siege X, and some unannounced titles within this window.</p>
<p>FY 2024-25 was down on the previous year, despite the launch of Assassin’s Creed Shadows in March, after the underperformance of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> last summer. However, AC Shadows should have a long tail into FY 2025-26 that, alongside the new titles, should keep things steady through this year for the successive years to improve upon.</p>

<p>Announced back in March, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">Ubisoft is creating a new subsidiary in financial partnership with Tencent</a> to act as a new home for some of its biggest studios and franchise – specifically Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six. The expectation is that this will be fully formed by the end of this year.</p>
<p>That comes after their “cost savings program” (read: layoffs) that took place over the last few years. Guillemot says they “are committed to going further” (read: more layoffs) and will aim to make additional savings of €100 million in the next two years. The company cut around 3,000 jobs in the last two years to save €200 million, so simple maths suggests that 1,500 more jobs will be cut in the next year or two. That’s always reassuring to hear for employees…</p>

Games has announced and released Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition, which it described as "the most extensive version" of the gory fighting game. But for fans, the release of the Definitive Edition has sparked significant concern that NetherRealm has now moved on from the game, and that it won’t see any new DLC characters or significant content updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition offers the main game packaged together with previously released downloadable content, including the Khaos Reigns story expansion, Kombat Pack 1, and Kombat Pack 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Definitive Edition also adds new character skins for Johnny Cage, Kitana, Scorpion, and Shao Khan “inspired” by the upcoming Mortal Kombat 2 film, the Mortal Kombat (2021) movie character skin for Sub-Zero; and the tournament themed character skin (outfit) for Liu Kang.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans, The Definitive Edition feels like a line has been drawn under Mortal Kombat 1. While Warner Bros. is known for its definitive and ultimate editions, and indeed NetherRealm games tend to get them, this time there is a sense of finality to the release. And with no announcements forthcoming about a Kombat Pack 3 or anything else meaningful for Mortal Kombat 1, fans believe that March 2025's release of the T-1000 guest character will go down as the game's final content drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, it’s a big disappointment for hardcore Mortal Kombat 1 fans, who had hoped for significantly longer term support for the game. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago">many are now pointing to a September 2024 tweet from NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon</a>, who at the time moved to reassure fans already concerned that the studio had moved onto its next game by saying: “NetherRealm is still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game is done, it’s their way of saying ‘Goodbye! Come back the next year or two for another overly priced game bloated with guest characters!’ " <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1kmiyaw/the_game_just_fucking_came_out_dude_what_the_hell/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said a clearly disgruntled redditor</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“MK1 officially has a shorter content lifespan than the f***ing Texas Chainsaw Massacre game lmao,” said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, in July 2021, NetherRealm announced it had started work on its next project (Mortal Kombat 1) and, as a result, there would be no further DLC for Mortal Kombat 11. That announcement came two years and three months after the release of the game. NetherRealm is yet to make a similar announcement for Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now">Mortal Kombat 1 enjoyed something of a resurgence in January with the secret fight with Floyd</a>, the pink ninja developer Ed Boon had been teasing for years. That sparked a fun community-wide effort that breathed new life into the game. But that was a rare bright spot for what has, overall, been a disappointing release for many core Mortal Kombat fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator was the final DLC character added to Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s sales success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1 has sold 5 million copies, with the franchise now up to 100 million. Mortal Kombat 11 became the best-selling game in the franchise by passing Mortal Kombat X's nearly 11 million units sold worldwide. By 2022, Mortal Kombat 11 had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Clearly, Mortal Kombat 1 has underperformed compared to previous games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Stab-o-sneak merchants Ubisoft are pushing back the release of several unspecified big name projects in the wake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which CEO Yves Guillemot says "has reaffirmed the power of the Assassin's Creed brand". The tactical snoop 'n' shoot peddlers are also looking to cut costs by at least €100 million across their organisation, following a difficult year in which they've partnered with Tencent to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">launch a new corporate subsidiary</a> dedicated to their most popular games.</p><!--more-->
<p>"This year has been a challenging one for Ubisoft, with mixed dynamics across our portfolio, amid intense industry competition," observed Guillemot in <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf">Ubi's latest earnings results</a>, adding that the company's overall earnings for the past year are "slightly below objective". He says they're in a strong position regardless thanks to the "discipline applied across the Group", which presumably includes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">those mass layoffs in January</a>, amongst other cutbacks. According to the earnings call, Ubisoft have shrunk their staff headcount by "around 3,000" since the end of September 2022.</p>
<p>By "discipline", Guillemot is also probably referring to Ubisoft's repeated delaying of Assassin's Creed Shadows to ensure a more positive reception than that achieved by last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. He says the delay has paid off, with Shadows having the second highest launch day revenue of any game in the series. "The launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows was a defining moment," the Ubiboss continued. "It reaffirmed the power of the Assassin's Creed brand, with a highly favourable community response from long-time fans and new players alike."</p>
<p>Guillemot says Ubisoft have completed their cost-cutting plans "ahead of schedule". Still, management remain focussed on "discipline", with plans for "additional savings of at least €100m over the next two years to drive structural efficiencies and reinforce the foundations of our organization". So, more job losses then?</p>
<p>Ubisoft are also still completing the creation of their new Tencent-backed subsidiary, which will oversee development of future Assassin's Creed, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six games. We can expect a "new organisation" to be announced later this year. The publishers have also "decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success", which means that "[Financial Year] 2026-27 and FY2027-28 will see significant content coming from our largest brands."</p>
<p>The rest of Ubisoft's 2025 and early 2026 will look relatively trim by comparison. On PC, we can expect <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anno-117-pax-romana">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> and Heroes Of Might And Magic: Olden Era, together with expansions for Assassin's Creed Shadows and, just possibly, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time remake</a>.</p>
<p>An accompanying <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/6pXJlDFC1Nrw8mwM4M8Nr8/d4036561f95076c3acdb1003819058ef/Ubisoft_FY25_Slideshow_vfinal.pdf">slideshow presentation</a> maintains Ubisoft's commitment to the two wolves that lurk inside every triple-A game company - "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> adventures" and "GaaS-native experiences", aka live service games. They want to both "improve the quality of narrative-driven solo experiences" and serve up "richer multiplayer features with more frequent content updates".</p>
<p>I don't see any mention here of "disciplining" executive salaries and compensation, but to give the Devil his due, Guillemot has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-is-taking-a-large-paycut">taken paycuts over poor company performance</a> in the past.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/15/valve-refutes-reports-of-a-steam-data-leak-this-was-not-a-breach-of-steam-systems/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following reports of a Steam data leak over the weekend, Valve has investigated the issue and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/533224478739530145?l=english">issued a statement</a> to firstly refute reports that this is a breach of their systems, and to reassure users that there is no need to change passwords or amend security settings.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/underdark-ai_cybersecurity-databreach-steam-activity-7327022917370703872-JqN3/">LinkedIn post</a> claimed that a trove of leaked data from Steam included over 89 million user records, but while this initially appeared concerning, fears were allayed somewhat when an update explained that this related to real-time TFA SMS logs – time-sensitive codes that are sent via text message for two factor authentication. This still suggested that a hacker had infiltrated the overarching security system, but had only gained “backend access to a vendor dashboard or API, not Steam directly.”</p>


<p>Valve has now issued a statement following their own analysis and confirmed that “was<strong> NOT</strong> a breach of Steam systems,” that details within the leak “did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data,”&nbsp;and that users “you do not need to change your passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event.”</p>
<p>What they do advise, however, is that users should set up the Steam Mobile Authenticator.</p>
<p>Using SMS messages for TFA is an outdated and less secure method of providing a time-sensitive code to users. SMS messages are not encrypted, so if a bad actor were able to intercept those authentication codes in time, they would be able to use them in conjunction with account details and passwords to gain access to an account.</p>

<p>Using an authenticator app with an automatically rotating and generated code from a secure key or that is reliant on encrypted push notifications is much more secure, as this requires access to a trusted device in addition to login and password. Furthermore, Steam now has a more automated login system where you can scan a QR code using the Steam Mobile Authenticator and not have to input account details at all.</p>
<p>Even with these security options, you do still need to be wary of unexpected emails and messages prompting you to login to personal accounts. There’s always more and more advanced attempts by naughty people to try and fool you into giving them your stuff.</p>
<p>But for now, if you’re happy and content with your Steam login set up, there’s nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Valve’s statement in full:</p>
<p><em>You may have seen reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers. We have examined the leak sample and have determined&nbsp;<b>this was NOT a breach of Steam systems.</b><wbr></em></p>

<p><em>We’re still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone.<wbr></em></p>

<p><em>The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to. <b>The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data.</b> Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>You do not need to change your passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event. It is a good reminder to treat any account security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious. We recommend regularly checking your Steam account security at any time at&nbsp;<wbr></em></p>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices?snr=1_2108_9__2107">https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices</a><wbr></em></p>

<p><em>We also recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if you haven’t already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about your account and your account’s safety.&nbsp;</em></p>

			<p>Following reports that Steam had suffered a security breach that might affect as many as 89 million users, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/533224478739530146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has set the record straight on the matter</a>, clarifying that the leak absolutely did not breach Steam systems, and users do not need to change their passwords.</p>
<p><em>We have examined the leak sample and have determined this was NOT a breach of Steam systems. We’re still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone.</em></p>

<p><em>We also recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if you haven’t already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about your account and your account’s safety.</em></p>
<p>The reports began when a hacker known as Machine1337 or EnergyWeapon started advertising the sale of user records for Valve's platforms on the dark web. They were attempting to sell the data for $5K, but according to Valve, nothing malicious could be done with them anyway.</p>

            <p>
Epic Games has withdrawn its initial submission for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> to return to the iPhone App Store in the US, after Apple failed to approve the game for launch this week. 
</p>
<p>
The Fortnite maker <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1920878504284975585">announced</a> last Friday, 9th May, that it had submitted Fortnite to Apple for review - a process that usually lasts just a day or two. Apple, however, doesn't appear to be in any hurry to see Fortnite return.
</p>
<p>
Now, due to the game's ever-updating nature, Epic has been forced to withdraw that submission and reapply using Fortnite's next game version - which had been due to go live on all platforms this morning, but has now been <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1922806111284924584">postponed</a> until tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
These developments follow the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">bombshell ruling of a US judge earlier this month</a> that blasted Apple for continuing to impede developers from offering their own in-app payment methods - the issue which kickstarted Fortnite's long-running feud with Apple and got the game booted from the App Store worldwide. Apple must now allow developers in the US to do this, the judge ruled - though the matter of approving individual apps is still at Apple's own discretion.
</p>
<p>
"No news from Apple yet," Epic Games boss <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922654805735952768">Tim Sweeney wrote on social media last night</a>. They've had it since last Friday. 
</p>
<p>
"We emailed yesterday but haven't heard back," he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922655523175862658">continued</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We need to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously," <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922724874264412295">Sweeney noted in another post</a>. "So we have pulled the previous Fortnite version submitted to Apple App Review last Friday, and we have submitted a new version for review."
</p>
<p>
After years of legal wrangling, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">Fortnite is back on iPhone in the European Union</a> - but currently nowhere else. Apple, meanwhile, has already filed to appeal the recent ruling over its US App Store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Friends, it is my sad duty to inform you that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/one-million-checkboxes">One Million Checkboxes</a> creator Neal Agarwal is up to more of his crowdgaming mischief. He’s published another online squabbling sim called Internet Roadtrip. It’s a roaming Google Streetview cam in which viewers vote on the direction of travel every 10 seconds. The thinking behind Saltybet applied to the experience of driving your kids to Disney Land, in short. It is possibly a commentary on self-piloting vehicles, but mostly, it is a celebration of the raucous magic of chatboxes. You can also vote to honk the horn.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
At the time of publication, the vehicle has travelled 573 miles and there are around 1000 drivers online. 1000 strangers, some of whom appear to be either pleasantly stoned or wildly over-caffeinated, screaming instructions at a phantom Tesla. Currently, we are coasting down Church Street in Gardiner, Maine, and there is a heated argument in chat about the politics of turning right or left of the church.</p>
<p>The leftists carry the debate, for once, and we sail down the highway past a crop of trees. #1 Eastern White Pine Fan takes a moment to grieve the plight of the majestic ash. “It’s so bittersweet,” they write. “i love them but they're almost all dead on the east coast now, since the emerald ash borer devastated all ash species native to north america.” Thank you, #1 Eastern White Pine Fan.
</p>
<p>
A contingent of viewers are obsessed with driving to Canada. “Can we get to Canada before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>,” asks user Crab, thus doing the SEO-minded news writers in the viewership a real solid. The Canada faction are opposed by a posse of staunch Agarwal fanbois who are hellbent on making the vehicle circle Neal Street forever.</p>
<p>User Pingu throws a spanner in the works by abruptly demanding that we head to Mexico. It’s clear that quite a lot of the commenters are locals. “EVERYBODY STAY ON 9,” insists Pothos, Leader Of The Pathists. Oh we’re on Maine Avenue now, crossing a bridge. There is a Dunkin’ Donuts. Can we stop for doughnuts? Alas no, but we can honk if we love doughnuts. Which we do.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://neal.fun/internet-roadtrip/">Find Internet Roadtrip here</a>. It's free, but Agarwal is accepting donations by way of that clickable coffee cup. As is the way of anonymous communications platforms, the chat is probably going to become a trashfire at some stage. I sense that Agarwal has applied automatic filters for slurs and hate speech, but as we have found when moderating RPS comments, bigots can be creative. If you’re just here to settle back and enjoy the ambience of, right now, Cheney Road in Chelsea, Agarwal has considerately built in an FM radio. You have to vote to change the station, mind.

            <p>
Valve has responded to reports of an alleged "massive" Steam data leak, insisting none of its systems have been breached and no account, password, payment, or personal data has been stolen. It has, however, confirmed hackers accessed a number of "older text messages" containing limited information.
</p>
<p>
Unsubstantiated reports of a Steam data breach first surfaced over the weekend, when a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/underdark-ai_cybersecurity-databreach-steam-activity-7327022917370703872-JqN3/">widely shared LinkedIn post</a> claimed a "threat actor" had appeared on a "well-known dark web forum claiming to have breached Steam" and was "offering a dataset of over 89m user records" for $5K USD. A later update claimed the breach was related to "real-time [two-factor authentication] SMS logs", and that analysis of the leaked data suggested the hacker had gained "backend access to a vendor dashboard or API, not Steam directly."
</p>
<p>
Valve has now responded to those claims, saying it has "examined the leak sample and... determined this was <em>not</em> a breach of Steam systems." The leak specifically relates to "older text messages", it added, and Steam users "do not need to change [their] passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event."
</p>
<p>
"You may have seen reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers," the company wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/533224478739530145?l=english">full message shared on Steam</a>. "We have examined the leak sample and have determined this was <em>not</em> a breach of Steam systems. We're still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone."
</p>
<p>
"The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to," it continued. "The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data. Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages"
</p>
<p>
"You do not need to change your passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event," Valve added. "It is a good reminder to treat any account security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious. We also recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if you haven't already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about your account and your account's safety."

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has released fresh screenshots of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, giving us our first look at the game in three years.</p>
<p>The last time the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">shown was back in 2022 for the series' 20th anniversary</a>, revealing Sora's return and the expansive metropolis of Quadratum.</p>
<p>Now, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-cancelled-but-kingdom-hearts-4-still-on-the-way">cancellation of mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link yesterday</a>, Square Enix is appeasing fans with a handful of screenshots.</p>

<p>"We're currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts 4 and will continue pouring ourselves into the game's development. We're dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations!" reads an official social media post.</p>
<p>"We've seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts. We are equally excited and can't wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts 4 when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience."</p>
<p>The screenshots show Sora mid-battle in Quadratum against a handful of Heartless, as well as close-ups of some character models and moments in the city.</p>
<p>One screenshot suggests Mickey Mouse will be playable in this game. Disney's lead character has always been a part of the series and has previously been playable in a limited capacity, but his inclusion here hints at a bigger playable role this time around.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>To our Kingdom Hearts community,</p><p>We’re currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the game’s development.

<p>Perhaps what's most interesting is what isn't shown in these screenshots. The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> games fuse together the worlds of Disney and Final Fantasy, but we're yet to see which Disney kingdoms will be featured in the new game, nor which Final Fantasy characters will make an appearance. I can certainly imagine Clive turning up at some point.</p>
<p>Also, where are longtime partners Donald and Goofy?</p>
<p>Kingdom Hearts 4 remains without a release date, but it's been in development for quite some time. It's been six years since the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a> on PS4 and Xbox One and fans are eagerly anticipating the next installment.</p>
<p>Last year, series director Tetsuya Nomura said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-will-lead-towards-a-series-conclusion-so-nomura-can-retire">Kingdom Hearts 4 will lead towards a series conclusion</a> as he looks to retire.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, during the company's quarterly financial report, Japanese game developer and publisher Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-development-3-year-reboot-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> some Kingdom Hearts news. They confirmed that development on the fourth mainline installment was going forward, but they also canceled the spin-off Missing Link, which was targeting a release on mobile devices. The reason was that they could not offer a satisfactory live service over an extended period. The game's story would have been set in the Scala ad Caelum world between the events seen in Union X and Dark Road.</p>
<p>Of course, most fans are really interested in Kingdom Hearts IV. After all, it's been over three years since <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's announcement</a>. Thankfully, earlier today, the official X account of the series <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a new message and screenshots.</p>
<p><em>To our Kingdom Hearts community,</em></p>
<p><em>We’re currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the game’s development. We’re dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations! We’ve seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts. We are equally excited and can’t wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience. Thank you for your continued support.</em></p>
<p>A few details of KHIV are already available. We know it's being made with Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and will be set in Quadratum, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-original-sora-tokyo-no-twewy-ties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a city loosely inspired by Japan's Tokyo</a>, featuring fictional versions of Shibuya and Minami-Aoyama. Quadratum will function as the game's hub world, while Sora and his allies travel to other worlds for the missions. Story-wise, Kingdom Hearts IV will introduce the brand new 'Lost Master' story arc.</p>
<p>When it comes to gameplay, the game will bring back the reaction commands seen in KHII while also using a 'Scrap and Build' mechanic. Nomura-san and his team also plan to show off more of Sora's daily life and routines.</p>

It will launch on November 13. <span id="more-965120"></span></p><p>In Japan, the physical edition for Switch will be priced at 7,480 yen (8,228 yen with tax), and includes a limited edition “<em>Beyblade X</em> CX-00 Leonfang T4-60A Red Ver.” Pricing for the digital version has yet to be announced.</p><p>While a western release was not officially announced, <em>Beyblade X: XONE</em> previously had a surprise day-date-date English release alongside its Japanese debut.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via FuRyu:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em> is a “Beyblade <a title="Genres > Action [2,723 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a>” based on the fourth generation of the <em>Beyblade</em> franchise, <em>Beyblade X</em>. By battling and customizing Beyblades, players can experience the excitement of actual bey battles in a form only a game can offer. This time, three further evolutions have been added.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features (Evolutions)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>EVOBATLE</strong> – <em>Beyblade X: XONE</em> was well-received for its “X (Extreme) Dash” and tactical yet action-packed bey battles in “X (Extreme) Line”-equipped stadiums. In <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em>, tactics and methods of attack and defense vary significantly depending on actual type affinities and characteristics, evolving into “ultra high-speed action” where instant command actions are the key to victory. Players can continue to battle online against bladers from around the world and challenge each other for the top spot.</li><li><strong>EVOSTORY</strong> – In single-player mode, players can enjoy an all-new original story featuring new characters such as Tenka Shiroboshi (voiced by Yuko Natsuyoshi), who has joined the protagonist’s team in the <em>Beyblade X</em> anime, along with a cast of unique, game-original characters. Compete with new allies and aim for victory in the “Bey <a title="Genres > Battle Royale [48 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/battle-royale">Battle Royale</a>.”</li><li><strong>EVOCUSTOMIZATION</strong> – In 2025, <em>Beyblade X</em> introduces the “CX (Custom Line),” expanding the possibilities for customization. In <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em>, players can enjoy this wider range of customization, as well as collect materials to coat their Beyblades in their favorite colors. Build a one-of-a-kind Beyblade to stand out from your rivals.</li></ul><p><strong>Save Data Bonus</strong></p><p>Players with save data from <em>Beyblade X: XONE</em> will receive “reward money” in <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em> based on their game progress. Use reward money to enhance your beys or buy your favorites in the shop. Additionally, players who purchased paid digital boosters can also carry over the “blades” of Beyblades they previously obtained into <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em>.</p><p><strong>Bundle Bonus: Leonfang T4-60A Red Ver.</strong></p><p>All physical editions of <em>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE</em> will include an actual “<em>Beyblade X</em> CX-00 Leonfang T4-60A Red Ver.” This is a new model in a limited edition color only available by purchasing the physical edition of the game.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a teaser trailer and video for the bundle bonus below.</p><h2><span>Teaser Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="『ベイブレードエックス エボバトル』ティザームービー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvigSv1NauM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Leonfang T4-60A Red Ver.</span></h2><p><iframe title="【ベイブレード開発者レビュー】レオンファングT4-60A レッドVer.【ベイブレードエックス エボバトル特典】" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIyxpYkYMdA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/14/kingdom-hearts-iv-development-update-new-screenshots-released-by-square-enix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Following its <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/10/kingdom-hearts-4-revealed-in-20th-anniversary-trailer">announcement in 2022</a>, official updates for Kingdom Hearts IV have been few and far between. Though franchise fans are no strangers to waiting for information and, subsequently, game launches, Square Enix wanted to update fans on how development is progressing and provide a few new screenshots.</p><p>The update came via the official Kingdom Hearts X accounts. Both the <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436">English</a> and <a href="https://x.com/_KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819279990251633">Japanese</a> accounts shared multiple screenshots combined into one image. The smaller screenshots are the same, but the large header screenshots differ depending on the account.</p>

<p>The screenshots were accompanied by a message from the development team. "To our Kingdom Hearts community," the post reads, "We're currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the game's development. We're dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations!"</p><p>"We've seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts," the account continues in <a href="https://x.com/kingdomhearts/status/1922819245030899902?s=46&amp;t=NQuiqRa_BGRV8b-BEm-aYw">a subsequent post</a>. "We are equally excited and can't wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience. Thank you for your continued support."</p><p>While the large screenshots are action shots of Sora in combat, the smaller visuals released by the Kingdom Hearts team tonight feature what appear to be cinematics and an enemy. However, one intriguing screen seems to indicate that Mickey could be playable, unless it's just an unconventional camera angle.</p>
