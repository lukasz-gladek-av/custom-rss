              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994"><em>Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</em></a> is more mature than your average Nintendo-published first-party game. So players were expecting some violence, sci-fi monsters, and guns. What they might not have been expecting was for so many of the puzzle game’s doors to look like, umm, well…</p> <p>As with past <em>Metroid</em> games from Nintendo, a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021"><em>Prime 4</em>‘</a>s presentation is inspired by H.R. Giger’s designs from the classic sci-fi movie <em>Alien</em>. This is especially evident in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s first large level, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657">Volt Forge</a>, which contains a lot of Giger-esque architecture and environmental details. But other parts of <em>Prime 4</em>, like the famous artist, seem inspired by other parts of human anatomy, like vaginas. What I’m trying to say is there are a lot of doors in this game that might make your more prudish grandparents uncomfortable.</p>    <p>“Lotta vaginas in this game,” bluntly, but accurately, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanmoher.com/post/3m7733nyj4k2a">declared critic Aidan Moher on Bluesky</a>. And he’s right! In the early portions of <em>Prime 4</em>‘s campaign, you’ll encounter a few different doors that seem inspired by vulvas.&nbsp; Fans online are now sharing screenshots of doors that look very vaginal online.&nbsp; Some are large, and some are small. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyvagina/comments/1pe7opb/the_doors_in_metroid_prime_4/">One of these doors</a> even popped up on a subreddit dedicated to highlighting objects and locations that look a bit like vaginas.</p>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why is all the discourse on Metroid Prime 4 about Miles and not how all the doors are extremely vaginal?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Wreckreation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">the open-world sandbox</a> driving game <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-release-date-open-world-sandbox-racing-game/">that lets you edit the world as you go</a>, which was developed by Three Fields Entertainment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">a studio made up of former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the Burnout series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandbox-racer-wreckreation-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series/">released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this past October</a>. Now, chief executive officer Fiona Sperry has announced that the entire staff at Three Fields Entertainment has been told they could potentially lose their jobs.</p>



<p>Wreckreation's launch has been marred by technical issues, though Sperry doesn't directly cite a lacklustre launch for the game as a reason for putting the entire staff at risk of redundancy. </p>



<p>"<em>Today I am having to share one of the hardest messages of my career. After twelve years of building and nurturing Three Fields Entertainment, I am forced into the situation of today placing our entire team on notice of redundancy</em>," Sperry <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fiona-sperry-601a0530_today-i-am-having-to-share-one-of-the-hardest-activity-7402348277788057600-slcG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">began in her post on LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Since the launch of Wreckreation, our small studio has worked incredibly hard — with heart and dedication — to update the game, listen to our community, and deliver the fixes and features players asked for. I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project. But the reality we now face is stark. As an independent studio, we will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future. We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful.</em>"</p>



<p>Sperry's post also includes a video featuring post-launch content the studio is adding to Wreckreation in the hopes that it will bolster the game's audience while the team also works to correct the technical problems players faced at launch.</p>



<p>"<em>My hope is that by showing this work publicly, someone out there might also see that potential and perhaps an opportunity could still emerge," </em>Sperry continued<em>. "But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team. I truly believe in the potential of this game and in the brilliance of the people who built it."<p>"To everyone who has supported us, played our games, or believed in our studio: thank you. Your support has meant the world -&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, again at our own cost, ensure the&nbsp;next update that includes a Crossplay feature does get published before Christmas and we hope you and your friends can enjoy the world that we have built together, whichever platform you play on.</p></em>"</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is the second major release from Three Fields Entertainment to miss its mark. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dangerous-driving-high-speed/">Dangerous Driving in 2019 earned a 5/10 from Wccftech</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dangerous-driving/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4">stands at a 62 on Metacritic</a>. At the time, Wccftech's Nathan Birch wrote, "<em>Dangerous Driving is, at best, a rough early prototype of a proper Burnout successor. The basic mechanics and sense of speed are there, but they’re badly undermined by bland track design, infuriating AI, a lack of features, and a host of other issues. Those feeling nostalgic for Burnout would be best served taking the classics out for another spin, rather than taking a chance on this lemon.</em>"</p>

              <p>Netflix’s co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, doesn’t believe that the streaming giant is a negative force in the film industry. Instead, the soon-to-be owner of Warner Bros.&nbsp; believes Netflix is more of a savior.</p> <p>Netflix announced its <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">$82 billion bid to gobble up Warner Bros</a>., the legendary film and media company, earlier today. If it clears regulatory hurdles, the deal will position the supreme ruler of streaming services as a God Emperor of a massive TV and film catalog, as well as the properties belonging to Warner Bros. Games, which include the Lego games, as well as DC adaptations like the <i>Arkham </i>series of <i>Batman</i> games, and the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> games.</p> <p>During an interview with <i>Time </i>magazine editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-movie-theaters-outdated-1236376565/">earlier this year</a>, Sarandos was asked point-blank: “Have you destroyed Hollywood?”</p> <p>“No,” Sarandos replied, “we’re saving Hollywood.”</p> <p>The CEO then casted doubt on the role of movie theaters moving forward. Though the streaming giant will need to premiere some films in theaters to be considered for certain awards, Sarandos doesn’t see the theater experience as something accessible for most folks. He said:</p>

 <blockquote><p>If you’re [fortunate enough to live in] Manhattan, and you can walk to a multiplex and see a movie, that’s fantastic. Most of the country cannot.</p></blockquote> <p>It’s a bit of an odd statement considering that cars exist. Still, Sarandos sees the industry’s reliance on theaters as an arbitrary limitation he’s happy to dispense with, much to the displeasure of Hollywood veterans <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-academy-awards-mean-nothing-to-me-if-they-dont-mean-theatrical-avatar-director-james-cameron-says-netflix-films-should-not-qualify-for-the-oscars-because-theyre-not-in-theaters">like <em>Avatar</em> creator James Cameron</a>.</p>

 <p>The industry remains concerned over the impact Netflix is likely to have should its purchase of Warner Bros. go through. <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">According to <i>A Shot</i></a>, the Director’s Guild of America, led by director Christopher Nolan, is going to meet with the streaming company to address “major concerns.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Directors Guild of America, led by president Christopher Nolan, plans to meet with Netflix to address major concerns regarding the streamer’s acquisition of Warner Bros. <a href="https://t.co/EcwdZ0A0Qz">pic.twitter.com/EcwdZ0A0Qz</a></p> <p>— A Shot (@ashotmagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashotmagazine/status/1996978975311364261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Theaters have been in a bit of a bind ever since the global pandemic made it hard to convince people to leave their homes to go see a movie. Should Netflix’s Warner Bros. acquisition go through, it’s all the more likely that even fewer movies may hit the literal big screen.</p> <p>And with that, let’s <a href="https://youtu.be/wKiIroiCvZ0">reflect on some wise words</a> about experiencing movies from one of the all-time greats.</p>

			<p>Russia is off the board for Roblox, as the country's media regulatory body, the Roskomnadzor, blocks the game from Russian citizens. Included in its reasons for the block is the safety of children with regard to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/texas-attorney-general-sues-roblox-claims-it-puts-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-of-children/">multiple reports</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">abuse and child predators</a> on the platform and the Roskomnadzor's concern that children will be exposed to what it defines as "<em>inappropriate content</em>," including in-game LGBTQ+ content.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://tass.ru/obschestvo/25806963">local Russian publication TASS</a> and spotted by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn41q11gy58o">BBC News</a>, the Roskomnadzor cited the platform being "<em>rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children</em>."</p>



<p>In response, a Roblox spokesperson said, "<em>We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We have a deep commitment to safety, and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform</em>."</p>



<p>Roblox may be one of the more high-profile titles to be blocked by the Roskomnadzor, but it is hardly the first. Just last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-accused-of-removing-games-from-steam-at-russia-request-flick-solitaire/">a solitaire game was banned on Steam in Russia for its LGBTQ+ content</a>. And while much of the world would not agree with Russia's assessment that LGBTQ+ content is negative for the moral development of children, the overwhelming amount of reports and litigation that Roblox has faced over its lacklustre protections for children, which have resulted in predators abusing and assaulting kids, is not an unfair reason to block the popular game.</p>



<p>Roblox has been trying to make the platform a safer place for kids, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-will-require-age-verification-with-facial-recognition-to-unlock-chat/"> just last month introduced age verification via facial recognition to unlock the ability to use in-game chat features</a>. Despite its issues and ongoing litigation, Robox continues to grow, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">recently set a peak concurrent users record that surpassed Steam's overall concurrent record</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/avengers-endgame-rerelease-movie-theater-tickets-doomsday-2000651023</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Marvel Studios has just announced it’s bringing the 2019 MCU finale </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> back to theaters next year.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“<i>Avengers: Endgame</i> — Back in theaters, September 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1997018384719020370">Marvel Studios announced on X</a> on Friday. It’s accompanied by a short video that begins with a black screen before Anthon</span><span>y Mackie’s iconic “on your left” line plays, revealing the <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> logo to what is presumably a recording of a theater audience’s hoots and hollers. “Avengers, assemble,” Chris Evans’ Captain America says, accompanied by more screaming. </span></p> <p><span>We have reached the stage in pop culture where we are nostalgic for something that happened six years ago.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Avengers: Endgame — Back in theaters, September 2026. <a href="https://t.co/PRmW9pEAxm">pic.twitter.com/PRmW9pEAxm</a></p> <p>— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1997018384719020370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>(Hilariously, an account called the Official Chicken Little Movie Account posted the entirety of&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Endgame</em> as a reply to the announcement.)</p>

 <p><span>Maybe this is a sign of how badly the COVID pandemic damaged our cultural psyche, but it’s more likely Marvel is trying to bring back some goodwill ahead of the release of </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i><span> next December. </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span>, part of the </span><i><span>Avengers</span></i><span> series that first kicked off in 2012, is also considered a part of the “Multiverse Saga,” which plays on the franchise’s recent focus on time travel and alternate realities (we’ve seen it play out in films like </span><i><span>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Spider-Man: No Way Home</span></i><span>).</span></p>

 <p><span>Thanks to the multiverse’s rule-bending logic, </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span> will star Robert Downey Jr., who played Iron Man in the first four </span><i><span>Avengers</span></i><span> films, but returns this time as Doctor Doom. It will also feature a massive, frankly absurd ensemble cast drawn in part from more than two decades of comic book movies. The roster is split into what appears to be teams, if this post claiming to showcase a video of a recent Disney Italia presentation is to be believed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Disney Italia presented 'AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY' at a conference in Sorrento</p> <p>(via <a href="https://t.co/My30rheaoK">https://t.co/My30rheaoK</a>)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/avengersdoomsday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#avengersdoomsday</a> <a href="https://t.co/mRwzyOYM9z">pic.twitter.com/mRwzyOYM9z</a></p> <p>— Nerd Al Quadrato (@nerdalquadrato) <a href="https://twitter.com/nerdalquadrato/status/1995901455585227173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The “teams” include actors from the original MCU flicks (Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki), the aughts </span><i><span>X-Men</span></i><span> movies (Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Rebecca Romijn as Mystique), the </span><i><span>Fantastic Four</span></i><span> reboot (Pedro Pascal as Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm), and the </span><i><span>Thunderbolts</span></i><span> crew AKA </span><i><span>The New Avengers</span></i><span> (Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova).</span></p>

 <p><span>If </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span> sticks to its December 2026 release date, it’ll hit theaters more than seven years after </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span>. Normally, you could argue Marvel is worried fans will have forgotten what’s going on, but nearly every movie released since 2019 has somehow tied into the larger MCU picture. Plus, </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span> was the </span><i><span>end</span></i><span> of many core Avengers’ stories, while <em>Doomsday</em> seems to be picking up threads from a menagerie of Marvel films.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The cynic in me thinks this is an attempt to recreate the magic that took place when </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span> released all those years ago, and bad people recording in the movie theater with their phones gave us </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAIzLj3mYTw"><span>real-time audience reactions</span></a><span> to the return of the Thanos-snapped heroes and Captain America wielding Thor’s hammer. (If you consider that a spoiler, you must have been trapped in ice for the last half-decade.) The screams, the cheers, the exclamations of surprise—aside from the most recent </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span> flick bringing back Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield to stand alongside Tom Holland in Spidey suits, Marvel hasn’t gotten a crowd pop like that since.</span></p> <p><span>There have been some serious stinkers since </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span>, including </span><i><span>Eternals</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Captain America: Brave New World, </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>Maybe Marvel hopes we’ll all step into a time machine and transport us back to a pre-COVID era when superhero movies could still stir something in our hearts. Nostalgia, remember, is a helluva drug.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</em></a> out now on Switch and Switch 2, is a game that, as I continue to play it, is winning me over more. But one part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Prime 4</em></a> annoyed me so much that I had to finally go into the settings, dig through some menus, and bypass a warning screen to fix it. I’m talking about the default jump button for the Morph Ball which is, inexplicably, different from the regular jump button.</p> <p>Look, I understand that this isn’t new to<em> Prime 4</em>. It was like this in <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-kotaku-review-1850124313"><em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em>,</a> too, and <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/960329-metroid-prime-trilogy/58099153">the Wii version of <em>Prime 2</em></a>. So for some folks, this might be second nature and not weird at all. But I haven’t played much <em>Metroid Prime </em>beyond the remaster of the first game, so when I discovered that jumping in Morph Ball mode used the X button instead of B, which is how you jump when controlling Samus on foot, I was perturbed.</p>

 <h2>How to change the jump controls in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em></h2> <p>I tried to play using the default controls for a bit, hoping I’d get used to it, but no luck. Thankfully, Nintendo and Retro Studios let you customize <em>Prime 4</em>‘s controls. The problem is that to do so, you have to dig through a few menus and alarm bells. It’s odd. But here’s how to change the Morph Ball jump button in<em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond:</em></p> <ol> <li> <blockquote><p>Pause the game and open up the settings menu.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Scroll down to the control scheme subsection and hit A.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now hit ZR to bring up the Morph Ball controls.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Select “Spring Ball” and hit A.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now highlight the B button slot and confirm the swap.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>If your B button slot contains question marks (???) you need to do another step</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>The game will ask you if you want to go into advanced mode. Hit Ok.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now you can swap the&nbsp;??? (which is later revealed to be the Spin Ball ability) and fix this silly control choice.</p></blockquote> </li> </ol> <p>This should work the same on Switch or Switch 2. Since making this change, I’ve had a lot more fun jumping around as the Morph Ball. I’m not sure why Nintendo buried this option in some menus and behind a warning, but I’m thankful they included the ability to remap controls at all. Not every developer does that, and it can be very annoying. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go hop around as a ball in <em>Metroid Prime 4.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-move-to-japan-kojima/</link>
            <guid>1374901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Eidos Montreal worked with Kojima Productions on the developer’s new game ‘OD’ for around a year before some of its developers were asked to move to Japan.</p>







<p>According to sources who added further context to our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past report on the current layoff situation</a> at Eidos Montreal, OD, which was previously known as Overdose, had been in development there for around a year in 2023. The game was internally known as P21, but development of the project at Eidos Montreal ceased after a request from Kojima Productions to have the developers move to Japan and cut ties with Eidos Montreal, said the people.</p>



<p>At the time of the request, around 20 developers were working on the project.</p>



<p>Kojima’s ‘Overdose’ title suffered a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-overdose-gameplay-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monumental leak in November 2022</a>, when gameplay footage obtained from the backend of YouTube by a leaker known as ‘The Snitch’ surfaced online. The two minutes of gameplay revealed that the game featured Death Stranding’s Mama (Margaret Qualley) in a blue dress and officially leaked the working name of the game as ‘Overdose’.</p>



<p>In 2023 at The Game Awards, Kojima officially announced with Jordan Peele that the game would be called ‘OD’, saying that people would “either love it or hate it”. In September 2025, a new teaser for the game, titled ‘Knock’, was released.</p>



<p>The game has seen several setbacks since its announcement, with filming for the game being delayed until 2026 due to the&nbsp;2024–2025 SAG-AFTRA video game strike. On November 23, 2025, Ubo Kier, who was set to star in the game died at the age of 81. </p>







<div><p>Kojima said in a statement on X,</p><p>“I’m at a loss for words. It all happened far too suddenly. Because of the strike, we weren’t able to shoot “<em>OD</em>” for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in Milan at the end of September, he told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year. He was full of energy then too, making me laugh with his usual “Udo-isms.” I still can’t believe this. Udo wasn’t just an actor. He was truly an “icon” of his time. We’ve lost a great “icon.” There will never be another like him. Udo, rest in peace. I will never forget you.”</p></div>



<p>It’s currently unknown when the game will officially be released, but it will be published by Xbox Game Studios.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon’s God of War May Have Cast Thor and Baldur]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-series-thor-baldur-cast-rumor/</link>
            <guid>1374880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A rumor from a reliable film insider may have revealed who’s cast as Thor and Baldur in Amazon’s God of War series. The show was recently given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a two-season greenlight</a>, with casting underway.</p>



<p>Ever since 2005, PlayStation and Santa Monica’s God of War series has delivered on the action front. With excellent drama, fun hack-and-slash gameplay, and gory godly kills, there’s a lot to love. The reboot series, consisting of God of War and God of War Ragnarok, put a more dramatic twist on the series, earning it huge praise. In 2022, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video would be making the reboots into a streaming show. Earlier last month, Emmy-winning director Frederick E.O. Toye was revealed to direct the first two episodes, with the casting ongoing. Now, it seems a new rumor says that actors for Thor and Baldur are close to being cast. </p>







<h2 id="h-boots-and-severance-stars-in-talks-to-play-baldur-and-thor-in-amazon-s-god-of-war-according-to-film-insider">Boots and Severance Stars In Talks to Play Baldur and Thor in Amazon’s God of War, According to Film Insider</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rumor comes from reliable film insider <strong>DanielRPK</strong>, who’s leaked details on several projects like Avengers and Spider-Man. In <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/145161885?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Patreon post</a>, it’s mentioned that <strong>antagonists Baldur and Thor have actors in talks to play them for Amazon’s God of War</strong>. For <strong>Baldur</strong>, <strong>Max Parker</strong>, who recently played the lead in Boots, is up for the role of the Norse immortal. Meanwhile, <strong>Olafur Darri Olafsson</strong>, known for his role as Mr. Drummond in season two of Severance, is in talks to play the drunken god of thunder from Ragnarok, <strong>Thor</strong>. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>these castings have not been confirmed</strong>, so <strong>take it with a big grain of salt</strong>. Even if not, both actors are pretty great choices for the roles in God of War. As of now, no official casting has been revealed. Filming is expected to start early next year, so it won’t be long until it’s known who Kratos and Atreus are.</p>

                <p>Entertainment giant Disney is hiring someone to join its Digital Entertainment team to work on an upcoming Star Wars game that has the ambitious goal of being a "groundbreaking game experience that will herald the next generation of Disney to the world."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.disneycareers.com/en/job/glendale/associate-art-director-franchise-creative/391/88321654624" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">job ad for an Associate Art Director</a> calls for someone who will work on the "ambitious and exciting new project."</p><p>"Working with top-class industry talent, this role is perfect for the seasoned visionary leader looking to create something epic--guiding and collaborating with a robust group of creative and production leaders focused around a wonderfully rich and cohesive product that is truly Disney," reads a line from the description.</p><p>The successful candidate will be the person who "inspires and informs our development teams to deliver the most authentic world-class Star Wars experiences."</p><p>This person will help "shape the overall visual direction, safeguard IP integrity, and foster creative collaboration across internal and external teams."</p><p>The person who gets the should will review art and visual design submissions with the aim of "ensuring all assets meet our brand and quality standards." The person will also give feedback and should have a "deep understanding of Star Wars lore."</p><p>Naturally, this person will also collaborate with the teams at Lucasfilm.</p><p>The job calls for someone with a lot of experience, including a minimum of seven years in gaming, film, or TV, and someone who has a "broad and deep" understanding of Star Wars. The person should also have "extensive game development experience" on "top-grossing, critically acclaimed AAA games on console and mobile."</p><p>What's more, the person who gets the job will be asked to travel globally to meet with partners spanning the world over.</p><p>The job requisition has lots of details about what the person will do and what credentials they should have, but it does not say much of anything about what the game actually is. From the sound of the job ad, the project will be developed externally, which makes sense given Disney doesn't do much internal game development and instead licenses its brands to external teams.</p><p>While this specific game remains a mystery, we do know about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/" data-ref-id="2900-3917">many in-development Star Wars games</a>, including Star Wars Eclipse, a remake of Knights of the Old Republic, a new game from Amy Hennig, Star Wars: Zero Company, and a third Star Wars Jedi game at Respawn. The latest rumor is that Creative Assembly is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-truly-special-new-total-war-game-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6536723/" data-ref-id="1100-6536723">making a Star Wars Total War game and that it may be revealed at The Game Awards.</a></p><p>The frontrunner to become the next Disney CEO, Josh D'Amaro, is a big fan of video games. He shepared the $1.5 billion investment into Epic Games for the upcoming Disney x Fortnite project, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disneys-possible-new-ceo-wants-to-do-more-with-gaming-report/1100-6536640/" data-ref-id="1100-6536640">wants to do more with gaming going forward.</a></p><p>Disney was at one time a bigger player in the world of video games, as the company had its own dedicated internal gaming division with Disney Interactive Studios. Disney also operated the once-popular Disney Infinity "toys-to-life" brand, but it also shuttered. Today, Disney's efforts in gaming mainly involve licensing its brands to other companies.

            <title><![CDATA[Fake Video Games Can Be Just As Interesting As Real Ones]]></title>

            <guid>1374853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>There’s a whole world of video games out there that even people who regularly read this very site have never heard of. The only issue? They’re not real – at least in the sense that you cannot plug in a controller and play them. But that doesn’t make them any less worthwhile and, in many ways, serves as a strength. On the latest <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/" rel="noreferrer">Aftermath Hours</a>, YouTuber extraordinaire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtGoikgbxP4F3rgI9PldI9g?ref=aftermath.site"><u>John “Eyepatch Wolf” Walsh</u></a> tells us why he’s become obsessed with fake video games.</p><p>Walsh recently released a book called <a href="https://hollow-press.net/products/the-bizarre-world-of-fake-video-games-by-super-eyepatch-wolf-u-d-w-f-g-essays-i?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Bizarre World Of Fake Video Games</u></em></a>, which is about exactly what it says: meticulously crafted settings and rule sets for games that don’t actually exist. Walsh explains his fixation with fake games and how, as he sees it, they broaden the landscape of who can imagine and create games in the first place. He also gives us a history lesson about proto-fake games like the almost unnervingly strange <em>Codex Seraphinianus</em>. Then we discuss more modern, regrettably AI-driven fake game trends like <em>Bird Game 3</em>, which has become <a href="https://www.polygon.com/play-bird-game-3-real-development-indie-ai-generated-unreal-5/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a bonafide TikTok sensation</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to the week’s biggest video game news: <em>Horses</em>, an otherwise off-the-beaten-path art game from a small indie studio, got <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/"><u>banned on Steam</u></a> for reasons that remain unclear, causing a series of cascading impacts on other stores like <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>Epic</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-santa-ragione-delisted-relisted-epic-steam/"><u>Humble</u></a>. What does it mean for a single storefront to essentially have sole say over what and what does not constitute acceptable art? And why is everyone losing their minds over a game that, according to Chris, is <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-indie-game-banned-steam-epic-review-impressions-santa-ragione/"><u>actually pretty tame</u></a>? Lastly, we share our wild animal horror stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can make an art game so messed up that it’ll get banned from Earth.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> We, on our podcast and site, talk about real games all the time. What makes a fake game compelling? What is it about them that made you say “I’ve gotta write a book about this, I’m gonna do multiple videos about this, this is gonna be my obsession, this is gonna be my whole personality”?</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Part of it is that people do go overboard talking about how video games are the most experiential medium. There’s so many different ways something can be experiential. A delicious plate of food can be experiential.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That’s the most experiential thing: eating food, right?</p><p><strong>John:</strong> But what games let you do is inhabit a fictional space. That’s fucking cool. And that’s why horror games are so distinct and interesting; they engage you in a way that a noninteractive medium can’t. I think what’s interesting about fake video games is the frameworks they build to make you feel like you are nearly interacting with the world.&nbsp;</p><p>So one of the games is this thing called <em>Bramble</em>. Imagine a <em>Dark Souls</em> game, but instead of fighting the different creatures you’re encountering, what you’re doing is building these little Amalgamoids, which are like fucked up little Pokemon, and they are fighting for you. It goes so in on the menus you create these little creatures with, how each specific one of them works and the rule sets they operate under, and the situations you can use them in – to the point that it’s very easy to imagine problem solving with these mechanics.&nbsp;</p><p>And then <em>Godhusk</em>, which is the follow up to <em>Vermis</em>, goes even harder on that. There’s this entire system about how you equip limbs and what different limb sets do to your body and help you navigate the world – in a way that would take so long to explain. You’ve just gotta read it. It’s incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>So that’s all kinda stuff video games can do. I think what’s interesting about fake video games – and why I always push back on this idea of, when I show people fake games, they’ll be like “I wish this was real” – is to me, this is more interesting because it’s not real. Because it’s collaborative. I think it’s Shigesato Itoi, the <em>Earthbound </em>guy, who was like “Video games are a collaboration between the player and the designer.” Because ultimately games happen in your head. Your console produces light, sound, and signal, but you’re the one who applies meaning to it. I feel like that is the same thing that happens with fake games.&nbsp;</p><p>But on top of that as well – and I say this with all the love and respect to anyone who has ever worked on a video game – fake games don’t have to go through the nightmare grinder of game development. Which means a different kind of person is able to create them. And so, not that there isn’t an infinite of interesting and weird indie games, but [fake games] let someone show you what they would do in a video game in a way that is so broad and strange and really, really out there – in a way that would be so much more difficult if these same people had to think about not even game design and light shaders and gameplay loops, but logistics like “How do you financially create a video game? How do you raise the money to make a video game and live on it?” And so, all of the sudden, the concept of a video game becomes something that so many more people can mess with.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/replaced-release-date-xbox-pc-march-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>REPLACED, the 2.5D pixel-art-based cyberpunk platformer that was first showcased at E3 2021 and was arguably one of the most exciting prospective Xbox exclusives at the time of its reveal, finally has a release date, and will arrive on PC via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store, and on Xbox Series X/S this coming March 12, 2026.</p>



<p>This announcement follows developer Sad Cat Studios' announcement in August 2025 that it could confirm, "<em>with confidence</em>," <a href="https://wccftech.com/replaced-release-date-spring-2026-cyberpunk-platformer/">that REPLACED would be out by Spring 2026</a>. That confidence has clearly not waned, and we now have a release date for a game that, by the looks of its release date trailer, hasn't lost any of the special quality players saw in that 2021 reveal.</p>



<p>The new trailer is the best look at the game we've gotten in the years since its initial announcement, and backed by an original song from the game's soundtrack titled "<em>Dusk</em>," it appears to be firing on all cylinders ahead of its March release.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REPLACED Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuUo7_VaboE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As to why Sad Cat Studios took as long as it did to get to this point, it wasn't because Sad Cat Studios was toiling away, working on the game non-stop and burning time. Development was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">interrupted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>, pushing it to the point we're at now, where a game that would have otherwise come out somewhere between 2021 and 2023 is out in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>We know that our community is incredibly excited to play REPLACED and it's no secret that it's taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all - we apologize for that,</em>" said game director Yura Zhdanovich in a press release back in August when the studio announced the release window. "<em>We've always tried to do what's right for the project,</em> <em>which in turn means delivering to you a truly special experience."</em></p>



<p>We'll see what Sad Cat Studios has for players when REPLACED launches on PC and Xbox Series X/S on March 12, 2026.</p>

  </picture><p>Referred to as the "original Mexican bingo," <em>Loteria</em> is rooted in generations of Mexican and Latin American heritage. The game holds a meaningful place in the lives of millions of families through shared symbols, traditions, and cultural storytelling. Now, with <em>Loteria Bilingual Edition</em>, Asmodee USA aims to bring this experience to English-speaking audiences in the United States, expanding its audience and reach.</p><blockquote><p>“Lotería is a bridge between generations and a cultural touchstone that has created memories for families for decades,” states Julien Sharp, Country Manager, asmodee USA. &nbsp;“We are proud to partner with Dreamstar Farms to support the continued growth and accessibility of this important title. This collaboration reflects our commitment to championing games that celebrate culture, community, and the universal joy of play.”</p><p><br>“Lotería is more than a game. It is a vibrant world of symbols, stories, and tradition, a living piece of cultural heritage shared across generations. Through our partnership with asmodee to bring and distribute Lotería to families across the U.S., we are excited for players to pull their first card, read the new rhymes in English or Spanish, and experience the richness of this beloved tradition together,” states Geoffrey Gray, Co-Founder of Dreamstar, a game studio based in Mexico City.</p></blockquote><p><em>Loterial Bilingual Edition</em> is available today on Amazon, Asmodee's web store, and specialty retailers. The game is being sold at an MSRP of $14.99. Retail releases at Target, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Walmart are planned for Spring 2026.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary industry veteran and <em>Fallout </em>creator Tim Cain has announced that he's made a return to Obsidian Entertainment, and it's the real deal; he's no contractor, but rather a "full-time employee".</p><p>In a video posted on his YouTube channel today, Cain explained that he's returned to the <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>and <em>Grounded </em>studio "in person" rather than remotely, and that this means he's no longer "working in other places", although there's at least one project on which Cain worked apart from Obsidian that has yet to be released.</p><p>Cain says that the period between 2020 and 2025 was "a weird time in the industry", and as such, there are games on which he's worked that he isn't sure will see the light of day, too.

<figcaption><em>Fallout </em>creator Tim Cain has returned to Obsidian Entertainment.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Cain also says he can't elaborate on the project on which he's currently working at Obsidian, but that "you're not gonna guess right" if you try to guess what it is, so it sounds like a novel idea, whatever it might be.</p><p>He also says he's "a lot less retired now than [he] was before", so his previous state of "semi-retirement" is no longer applicable. Additionally, Cain's YouTube channel will remain operational, since "no-one at Obsidian has even remotely suggested that [he has] to stop it".</p><p>Tim Cain first joined Obsidian in 2011, going on to work on the studio's successfully Kickstarted RPG <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, as well as serving as one of the directors for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2019's <em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>.

<p>It remains to be seen exactly what Tim Cain will do with Obsidian now he's back with the company; let's hope that Microsoft sees sense and opts to give the studio another chance at a <em>Fallout </em>game. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

Riva’s <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html">detailed accounting of the game’s multiple storefront bans</a> caught the attention of journalists, developers, and curious gamers eager to see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/05/horror-game-horses-has-been-banned-from-sale-but-is-it-as-controversial-as-youd-think">just what was so objectionable</a> that the game couldn’t be sold on Steam alongside the likes of <em>Sex Standing</em> or <em>Sex with Hitler 2</em>. That attention has made <em>Horses</em> the video game cause célèbre of the moment, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m73jkbnhxk2i">catapulting it to bestseller status on GOG.com</a>.</p></div><p>But while this all sounds like a happy ending, Riva isn’t ready to breathe easy just yet. “I’m relieved because with all this attention, I’m probably going to be able to give back most of the money [roughly half of $100,000] that I had to borrow,” he said. “But we’re not out of the [woods] yet, no.”</p><div><p><cite>Image: Santa Ragione Game Studio</cite></p></div><p><em>Horses</em> is a short, crunchy-looking game, boasting Dreamcast-era graphics with gameplay that’s no more involved than clicking things to put them in and take them out of your inventory. And while Santa Ragione has had success with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/saturnalia-review/"><em>Saturnalia</em></a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/milky-way-prince-the-vampire-star-review-an-artfully-told-oppressively-bleak-story"><em>Milky Way Prince</em></a> before the bans, it was largely a little-known developer. Riva is aware of how that looks, acknowledging that the bans have been instrumental in <em>Horses</em> punching through the noise.</p><p>“There is no way the same kind of interest would have happened,” he said. And despite that first difficult call, Riva says Borlera is quite pleased at what the bans have done for his game. “He’s extremely happy with the reception that the game is getting,” Riva said. “People are reading into the game and [...] engaging with it in a way that he hoped.”</p><div><p>“There is no way the same kind of interest would have happened.”</p></div><p>That engagement, though, isn’t enough to make up for the access Steam could have provided. While Riva is grateful for the support of gamers and storefronts like GOG, it’s not enough, and he’s still very much in fear of Santa Ragione’s future. “Even with all the publicity, all the reporting, all the reviews, everything else,” he said. “This still does not compare to the kind of audience we would have on Steam.”</p><p>Steam has an outsize influence on the PC video game market. The indie studios that cannot afford the costs of porting their games to consoles are at the mercy of Valve’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/18/16783394/you-must-be-18-or-older-to-enter-game-banned-porn-steam">vague</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17417790/steam-pornography-rules-guidelines-porn-visual-novels">capricious</a>, and often <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/15/24297364/steam-extremist-content-moderation-us-senator-warner-letter">inconsistent</a> moderation whims. Though <em>Horses </em>has found a roundabout way to relative success without it, Riva said that journey has been traumatic, affecting not just him and his team but his peers and future projects.</p><p>“I think there is going to be, in my case, and in other people’s case, a certain degree of self-censorship,” he said. “It’s terrifying, and it’s going to make people make safer and safer games, me included.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/839164/horses-interview-santa-ragione-steam-ban-censorship]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It’s after 5pm on a Friday, but no force on this Earth can stop me hurrying back to my desk to report on a large financial transaction. Also, we should have written this up earlier, but we were busy deciding which are the objectively correct <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-games-of-all-time">100 best PC games</a>. </p>
<p>I’m not… sure we put any Warner Bros games in that list. I’ve just done a CTRL-F for “Batman” and got zero results. I know, WTF - Arkham Asylum is amazing. Mark needs to stop driving things and think about capes for a change. I’m sure Warner Bros aren’t too bothered about this gross oversight right now, though. Netflix have just revealed plans to buy their entertainment business for $82.7 billion in stock and cash.</p><!--more-->
<p>The deal follows an announcement in June that Warner would split in two, with one “Streaming &amp; Studios” operation including Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios and HBO, while the other, “Global Networks”, encompasses sports and TV news such as TNT and CNN. Netflix want to buy the Streaming &amp; Studios part, pending regulatory approvals in the next 12-18 months, which includes several game studios: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> creators Avalanche, Lego devs TT Games, Mortal Kombat studio NetherRealm and Rocksteady of Batman Arkham fame, who also made Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. </p>
<p>As with any large corporate acquisition, it seems likely all this is going to lead to layoffs and cancellations as the acquiring company seek to recoup some of their outlay, and show the shareholders they're running a tight ship. Assuming the deal goes through, Netflix have said they hope "to realize at least $2-3 billion of cost savings per year" over three years.</p><p>Warner’s games division haven’t been doing well lately, and there have already been some major cuts. Suicide Squad was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">disaster</a>, leading to layoffs at Rocksteady this January. In February, Warner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">closed Monolith, Player First Games and Warner Bros Games San Diego</a>. In March, Bloomberg reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion">that a Hogwarts Legacy expansion had been cancelled</a>. In May, Warner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-and-dc-smash-em-up-multiversus-joins-the-pile-of-dead-live-service-games">pulled support for comicbook Smash ‘em up MultiVersus</a><a></a> while announcing the end of major updates for NetherRealm’s Mortal Kombat 1; they also revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">a 48% revenue drop for their most recent financial quarter</a>.</p>
<p>It’s naturally a bit worrisome in this context that Netflix’s press release announcing the proposed acquisition <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros">doesn’t really mention games</a>, save for Squid Game and Game Of Thrones. The focus is firmly on broader “entertainment”, streaming and Warner’s various intellectual properties. Netflix already have a videogame business, of course, but they’ve experienced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflixs-team-blue-of-halo-overwatch-and-god-of-war-vets-close-without-a-single-game-to-their-name">reversals of their own</a> in the past couple of years, and seem inclined to focus right now on TV and film.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>For one night in 2005, the Mojave Desert glowed green. Microsoft inexplicably launched its then-new console, the Xbox 360, with a release event in a hangar in the desert. A Microsoft executive told Gizmodo in 2005 </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/xbox-360-zero-hour-burning-man-as-interpreted-by-micro-138815"><span>that it was supposed to resemble Burning Man</span></a><span>, the art festival where Silicon Valley’s rich reenact the prelude to a </span><i><span>BioShock</span></i><span> game.. Another executive called it an “</span><a href="https://mashable.com/article/xbox-360-launch-event-zero-hour-photos"><span>Xbox 360 oasis</span><span>.</span></a><span>” Journalists and Xbox fans—it was both a press event and a player launch party—lounged on beanbags to play the hottest new console at one of dozens of stations. Microsoft served alcohol from paneled domes that are now synonymous with </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/31/950178368/yurts-igloos-and-pop-up-domes-how-safe-is-outside-restaurant-dining-this-winter"><span>covid-era outdoor dining</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>These sorts of big budget gaming events, where companies spared no expense on luring press and fans into weird places—all in the name of promoting new hardware or games—don’t exist much anymore. But 20 years later, an artifact channeling that bygone era has reemerged, once again, this time in the Colorado desert: a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-desert-statue-tga-diablo-4-2000649133"><span>mysterious demonic statue</span></a><span> with the bodies of the damned etched into its sides.</span></p>

 <h2>The Game Awards’ portal to hell</h2> <p><span>The Game Awards overseer Geoff Keighley posted a photo of the mysterious statue with a </span><a href="https://what3words.com/regal.inspiring.thickness"><span>geocode pointing people to an area of Joshua Tree National Park</span></a><span>, just off of Yucca Mesa Road. Tendrils glow red from the statue at night, illuminating the screaming skeletons of both humans and creatures. Several people who’ve visited the statue have posted about it on social media and Reddit. Apparently, a security guard watches over the relic—”cool dude,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pcvnhp/so_i_got_to_visit_the_statue/"><span>according to Reddit user TautSexyElfKing</span></a><span>—and the statue makes sounds. Another person instructed others to knock on the door, saying something else will knock back.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was very ambient and hellish sounding,” TautSexyElfKing said. “Almost like it was a doorway and on the other side was a large cavern with demons lurking about the other side. Maybe some light growling-ish sounds. There wasn’t anything I could make out in particular that would be a hint or anything”</span></p>

 <p><span>To the unaware, it looks like the kind of thing you might find at Burning Man, or maybe an altar for worshipping the devil. But Keighley’s post is a signal to gamers that this is an Easter egg—a marketing stunt. It’s working, not because it’s hyping people up for any specific game or console, but because it’s pushing people toward Keighley’s pride and joy: an end of year bash produced, owned, and hosted by the man himself.</span></p>

 <p><span>The statue itself is ambiguous enough that spectators can map it onto whatever’s at the top of their Game Awards World Premier wishlist. It’s off Yucca Mesa Road, so it must be for </span><i><span>Half-Life 3</span></i><span>. The demonic symbols are an obvious reference to </span><i><span>Diablo 4</span></i><span>‘s next expansion. No, wait—</span><a href="https://x.com/BT_BlackThunder/status/1994865924206452744"><span>maybe that’s </span><i><span>God of War</span></i></a><span>. It’s essentially a hell portal, which clearly means </span><i><span>Doom</span></i><span>. I don’t know, maybe </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>? Or, perhaps, </span><a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995954970626326556"><span>Keighley is simply himself opening a portal to hell</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pdt9n9/what_if_its_not_teasing_a_game_at_all_and_geoff/"><span>intends to destroy the whole dang world</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">no one is considering that Geoff is simply opening a hell portal <a href="https://t.co/XKEgj6N3e6">https://t.co/XKEgj6N3e6</a></p> <p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1995954970626326556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Apparently everyone is wrong, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1pcf4dp/jason_schreier_says_that_the_game_awards_statue/"><span>according to</span><i><span> Bloomberg</span></i><span> reporter Jason Schreier</span></a><span>, who said it’s not </span><i><span>Diablo 4</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>. “</span><span>I don’t currently plan on reporting what it is, sorry, but it’s a good one,” he wrote </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-keighley-posts-cryptic-image-with-the-caption-regal-inspiring-thickness-up-not-diablo-up2-new-message-from-tga-account.1368046/page-7#post-148323163"><span>on a gaming forum</span></a><span>. </span><span>” Regardless of the answer, The Game Awards wins—the statue has gotten enough buzz that people will, certainly, tune in to see what the statue is teasing.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s a little more easily digestible than, say, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-two-year-mystery-is-over-this-is-frog-fractions-2-1790505179"><span>the </span><i><span>Frog Fractions 2</span></i><span> ARG</span></a><span> that went unsolved for literally two years spanning nearly two dozen games on Steam and a book in a California library. Then there’s the </span><i><span>Halo 2</span></i><span> ARG called I Love Bees, which spanned three months, jars of honey, and several pay phones,&nbsp; or when Electronic Arts launched copies of </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3 </span></i><span>into space using weather balloons. (</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/early-mass-effect-3-winners-may-have-jumped-into-legal-5888619"><span>The people who found the copies</span></a><span>, inevitably plummeting back to earth, could play the game early.)</span></p> <p><span>Keighley’s Game Awards statue doesn’t seem to necessarily be an alternate reality game. It’s hard to say if it’s really leaving any clues for gamers to decode or just there to power the hype cycle. It feels more aligned with the chaotic churn of algorithmic virality that everyone’s seeking these days—a weird thing in a weird place, easily photographed or videotaped and circulated on TikTok, Reddit, and elsewhere. </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=game%20awards%20statue&amp;t=1764954890852"><span>It’s working</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The new AAA realty</h2> <p><span>Companies have done these sorts of things for highly-anticipated, big budget games like </span><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2GpQl"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a> <span>(big action figures in big boxes), </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/10p0i4x/giant_leviathan_axe_appeared_in_london/"><i><span>God of War</span></i></a><span> (big axe in London), and </span><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/life-size-horizon-forbidden-west-clawstrider-statues-could-win-you-a-ps5"><i><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></i></a><span> (big mechanical monsters). The difference, of course, is that it’s obvious what these installations were promoting. The danger in the Game Awards statue is that people will end up let down by whatever game it’s tied to.</span></p>

 <p><span>Events like The Game Awards were born to market AAA games; Keighley fills the show with commercials for the latest and greatest big-budget blockbusters from the industry’s mega-companies, backed by a booming voice boasting a world premiere announcement or new gameplay trailer. The biggest of these, games like </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Marvel’s Wolverine</span></i><span>, barely need the extra eye-balls while everything else gets lost in the shuffle. Homegrown debut hits like </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Expedition 33: Clair Obscure</span></i><span>, meanwhile, come out of nowhere and dominate the zeitgeist without the help of giant marketing machines. While some companies hope to manufacture a fraction of that cachet with big showcase moments, it’s no longer obvious that they’re for sale. To hear some tell it, the old AAA gaming model has reached “</span><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-man-who-signed-arc-raiders-the"><span>the end of days</span></a><span>.” We’re a long way from cosplaying Area 51 for a midnight console launch.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But I suppose that’s not Keighley’s problem. People might not remember whatever the statue ends up being for but they’ll tune into The Game Award to find out. He gets to hype his show either way.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994</link>
            <guid>1374781</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-graphics-comparison-switch-2-ugly-2000650585"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> technically isn’t the first Nintendo-published Switch 2 game to offer 120FPS support, but I don’t count that weird paid tech demo known as <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-worst-games-nintendo-metacritic-drag-x-drive-welcome-tour-2000617517"><em>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em></a> that launched with the system. No, <em>Prime 4</em> is Nintendo’s first 120FPS Switch 2 experience, and it’s amazing. It is also a bit odd coming from Nintendo, but it makes me really hope this is an option in future games from the <em>Mario</em> company.</p> <p>Out now on Switch 2 and the OG Switch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> is the next entry in the popular sci-fi shooter series that is itself a spin-off of the 2D <em>Metroid</em> games.<a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657"> And while I found the opening hour to be a bit meh</a>, the game really picks up once you reach Volt Forge. But one thing that was great and remained excellent from the very start was <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s performance mode on Switch 2, which offers up 120 buttery smooth frames per second if your TV can handle it. Gunplay, platforming, driving, and even puzzle solving are just so much nicer at the higher framerate.</p>

 <p>And this isn’t some hidden mode. No, the moment you first boot up <em>Prime 4</em>, it asks you to select between two modes: a 4K/60FPS option and a 1080p/120FPS option. I’ve played the game both ways, and while the 60FPS option is great and looks a tad sharper, I’ve primarily played Prime 4 in the 120FPS mode because it feels so nice and smooth. At first, I was worried that the Switch 2 would struggle to maintain that high framerate. But in my hours with the game so far, I’ve only seen one or two dips, and that was only in the open world desert portions of <em>Prime 4.</em></p>

  <p>It’s tricky to share 120FPS videos on the internet. Even using YouTube is challenging, as the ability to watch 120FPS content depends on the video, your device, etc. So unfortunately, I can’t show you how good <em>Prime 4</em> looks running at a high framerate. <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-is-switch-2s-first-true-120hz-3d-showcase">But trust me, it’s great and totally worth the small trade-off</a> of the image looking a little softer compared to the 4K/60FPS mode. And yeah, it’s weird to even be talking about modes like this in a Nintendo first-party release. I’m not upset about it at all, though, as I’ve long wanted Nintendo’s visuals and tech to catch up with the rest of the industry, and this is a big step in that direction.</p> <p>Now all I can do is think about how great it would be for the next mainline 3D <em>Mario</em> to offer a 120FPS mode. <a href="https://kotaku.com/let-us-all-remember-the-great-f-zero-gx-5920082">Can you imagine a new <em>F-Zero</em> running at 120FPS</a>? Or what about a <em>Smash Bros</em> sequel offering a high framerate mode? I know not all Nintendo-published games moving forward will support 120FPS, but I hope we get a few more every year as the company’s games often look and feel better than usual when you have all those extra frames.</p>
