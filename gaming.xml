<p>It's showtime in 'Uncaged Fury'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Mortal Kombat II movie hype train is about to leave the station, with Warner Bros. today releasing a teaser tied to the upcoming action movie, which is arriving in cinemas on <strong>24th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It's actually an "in-universe film trailer" for 'Uncaged Fury' starring Johnny Cage, who is played by The Boys superstar Karl Urban. Here's the description <a href="https://youtu.be/Sccu5MKUfuA">via IGN</a>. And just a word of warning, there is some swearing and a rude gesture (Johnny flipping the bird) in the video above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Uncaged Fury sees the legendary Johnny Cage take on a band of goons with ease, making use of pipes, fast-paced combat skills, and an aura unlike any other."</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The battle between <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/704606/subnautica-2-delay-krafton-unknown-worlds-bonus"><em>Subnautica 2 </em>publisher Krafton and the three former executives</a> at its developer Unknown Worlds continues. Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire — the three executives who Krafton terminated earlier this year — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/704956/subnautica-2s-fired-bosses-are-suing-krafton">have filed a lawsuit</a> detailing the alleged attempts by Krafton to torpedo the early access release of <em>Subnautica 2</em> with the express purpose of avoiding paying a promised earnout bonus of $250 million.</p><p>“Krafton’s actions have already severely damaged fan anticipation and undermined the potential release of Subnautica 2,” the lawsuit says.</p><p>That earnout was promised by Krafton to the former executives and roughly 100 developers and was to be paid should Unknown Worlds hit revenue goals by the end of 2025. <em>Subnautica 2</em>, slated for early access release sometime in late 2025, would have all but assured those goals were met.</p><p>According to the lawsuit filed today in a Delaware chancery court, Krafton also knew <em>Subnautica 2</em> was on track to meet if not exceed the revenue target to trigger the payout and began to take steps to essentially prevent that. The original <em>Subnautica</em>, an underwater survival adventure game, was a critical and commercial success, and its sequel has become the second most wishlisted game ever on Steam.</p><p>The lawsuit details a meeting between Krafton’s US and Korean employees concerning the marketing strategy for<em> Subnautica 2</em>. After that meeting, Krafton’s US employees, who worked closely with the<em> Subnautica 2</em> team, reported that Kafton’s attitude about the game had changed.</p><p>“Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.”</p><p>The lawsuit additionally states that Krafton’s US employees explicitly revealed to the Unknown Worlds founders that “Krafton’s legal team was combing through the agreements looking for any opening to terminate the Founders if they proceeded with the planned release.”</p><p>The lawsuit provided the details of the deal in which Krafton purchased Unknown Worlds back in 2021. The lawsuit says that part of that deal was an agreement that the founders would maintain control of the company and the release schedule of <em>Subnautica 2</em>, while Krafton could not impede the game’s development nor fire Unknown Worlds’ founders without cause.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Krafton launched a campaign to do both. Krafton allegedly failed to follow through on several of its development responsibilities for <em>Subnautica 2</em> including pulling marketing and localization support. “Indeed, one of Krafton’s El Segundo publishing employees reported to Gill that Krafton Headquarters told all Krafton teams to stop all creative tasks related</p><p>to Subnautica 2.”</p><p>The lawsuit claims that Krafton took these obstructionist actions to delay the game to explicitly avoid the $250 million payout. At a meeting between Krafton CEO Changhan Kim and Charlie Cleveland, Kim allegedly stated that, “if Unknown Worlds released the game on its planned timeline [...], it could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton.” Krafton declined to comment.</p><p>After the initial story broke regarding the alleged reason for <em>Subnautica</em>’s delay, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that Krafton <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707905/some-potentially-good-news-for-subnautica-2s-developers%E2%80%99">agreed to extend the timeline for the earnout</a> to account for <em>Subnautica 2’</em>s later release. Previously, the company denied that it delayed <em>Subnautica 2</em> for any other reason but to polish the game. Earlier this week, an internal document regarding <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s development <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">were leaked on Reddit.</a> The document, consisting of two pictures taken of a computer screen, outlined the content originally planned for the game’s early access launch and how some material had to be changed or removed to meet the release date.<br>Krafton acknowledged the veracity of those documents saying, “Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document,” possibly to bolster its argument that <em>Subnautica 2</em> was not ready for its early access release.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/708676/subnautica-2-former-ceo-lawsuit-krafton-sabotage]]></content:encoded>

They also say they tried to negotiate for developers who had joined the team later and were not currently eligible for bonuses to receive them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The former leaders claim that upon learning this, Krafton began to suggest the game be delayed, allegedly combing through contracts to determine if they had a legal standing to force a delay, despite the contract saying the decision lay with Unknown Worlds. They say that Krafton even went so far as to take action to make it difficult or impossible for it to release on time. Krafton began offering feedback that the game was not ready for its early access launch, pulled marketing materials, and refusing to follow through on certain pre-launch commitments. Ultimately, the founders say this culminated in Krafton letting the three of them go earlier this month and officially delaying Subnautica 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Krafton has since extended the bonus period for the remaining employees to receive their earnout if targets are hit, notably Krafton has claimed that the former leadership was eligible for 90% of the bonuses, meaning Krafton would only have to pay a maximum of $25 million if targets are met, not $250 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The founders' lawsuit accuses Krafton of breach of contract and demands payout of the full bonus promised as well as damages and other costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The drama around Subnautica 2 kicked off earlier this month when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">Krafton announced suddenly</a> that it was replacing the three founders with former Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis effectively immediately, which Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-developer-breaks-silence-after-shock-removal-to-find-that-im-no-longer-able-to-work-at-the-company-i-started-stings">claimed was a "shock" to them</a>. In the following weeks, reports have emerged regarding the $250 million bonus promised to staff, and Krafton has made statements accusing the former leaders of neglecting their duties and saying that Subnautica 2 was not in an acceptable state for launch. In particular, Krafton alleged that Cleveland was told to stop devoting time to a personal project and focus on his duties at the studio. The lawsuit, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-leadership-files-lawsuit-against-parent-company-krafton-as-row-over-250m-bonus-gets-personal">filed last week</a>, counters that this personal project was a Subnautica film, and was worked on at the explicit request of Krafton.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The readiness of Subnautica 2 remains an open question. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leaked documents</a> since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-drama-gets-even-messier-as-krafton-confirms-internal-document-leak-is-real">verified by Krafton</a> confirm that Unknown Worlds was receiving feedback from the publisher that the game was not ready for early access launch.

The raid happened on April 15, and police allegedly even took the YouTuber’s personal phone and didn’t return it until June. <br></p><p>According to Salicini’s video explaining the entire situation, law enforcement in Italy is apparently not required to disclose what he is being charged with or who specifically brought the charges against him until the initial investigation is finished. At that point, a judge would decide to dismiss the case or take it to trial.</p><p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Salicini about his legal issues. </p><p> The complaint Salicini received from Guardia di Finanza cites him violating Article 171ter of Italian Copyright Law. That same complaint also lists Sony and Nintendo, but it’s possible that Italy’s Ministry of Economy and Finance was responsible for bringing forward the charges against the YouTuber. Salicini believes this is because he has reviewed retro handhelds from companies like Anbernic, which sometimes come pre-loaded with classic game ROMs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-valve-pc-dolphin-emulator-piracy-copyright-1850658946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-valve-pc-dolphin-emulator-piracy-copyright-1850658946">While emulation is legal</a></span>, ROMs exist in a weird, murky grey area.<br></p><p> The law that Salicini might have violated was written in 1941 and comes with a maximum punishment of €15,000 and up to three years of jail time. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/un-aiuto-per-chi-vorra-e-potra-ad-un-semplice-nerd-onesto&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/un-aiuto-per-chi-vorra-e-potra-ad-un-semplice-nerd-onesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salicini has started a GoFundMe to help cover his legal fees</a></span>. On the fundraiser page, he explained that the Guardia di Finanza is now taking “precautionary measures to block all my social media channels.” He also says he has already contacted a defense attorney and expects that he will have to go to trial.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/youtuber-retro-gaming-jail-time-italy-once-were-nerd-1851786451]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The MCU's version of the Fantastic Four is finally making its debut on July 25, and it will come as absolutely no surprise whatsoever that it looks like Marvel's First Family <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1945175707698499656" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will receive Fortnite skins</a> to mark the occasion. But it also appears they're bringing with them something a little more unusual skins for this sort of collaboration: a set of four pairs of Nike kicks, with each pair themed after a member of the Fantastic Four.</p><p>The shoes were added to the files with Tuesday's patch and decrypted when the shop updated on Tuesday evening. The set includes a pair of <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19012" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Harbor Blue Air Max 90s</a> for Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19009" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clear Air Force 1s with a blue swoosh</a> to represent Sue Storm/the Invisible Woman, <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19011" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">red and orange Air Max 95s</a> for Johnny Storm/the Human Torch, and <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19010" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">orange Dunks</a> for Ben Grimm/The Thing. The set <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1945272679033929884" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will apparently have a bundle</a>, which would make this the first Kicks bundle to come with more than three pairs. We don't know when these shoes will land in the item shop, but it will likely be during the week before Fantastic Four: First Steps hits theaters on July 25.</p><p>What's particularly interesting about these shoes is that, like all Nike kicks in Fortnite, all four of these pairs are real shoes that were available to purchase. These Fantastic Four Nikes were originally released in 2006 as a tie-in with Fox's Fantastic Four movies, which hit theaters in 2005 and 2007, and you can read more about them over at <a href="https://sneakernews.com/2012/07/10/classics-revisited-nike-fantastic-four-pack-2006/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sneaker News</a>.</p><p>The best part of this set is that the clear Air Force 1s are a major new novelty for Fortnite kicks, as you can see the color of the sock that a skin is wearing with the shoes. That marks the third pair of novelty Air Force 1s, after the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=18299" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">solid white</a> and <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=18301" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">solid black</a> pairs released in May that give off unique trails as you run.</p><p>This isn't the first time Fortnite has imported some tie-in kicks to the item shop. During Star Wars season in May, the shop offered three pairs of Crocs and three pairs of Nikes that were themed after Star Wars characters.</p>

This is the first release window <a href="https://www.sega.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-faq" rel="nofollow ">Sega has provided</a> for the Switch 2 version, adding that Switch players who pay the $10 upgrade fee for Switch 2 will carry over their progression. That also means the Switch 2 edition of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will cost $70 (the same as PS5 and Xbox Series X) instead of Switch's price point of $60. Last but not least, cross-platform matchmaking is a go on Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unknown-worlds-lawsuit-claims-krafton-intentionally-delayed-subnautica-2-to-avoid-250m-payout.1245591/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill filed a lawsuit last week alleging that publisher Krafton intentionally obstructed and delayed the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em> in what they describe in the complaint, which was unsealed to the public and reviewed by Aftermath on Wednesday, as the company's "desperate efforts to avoid paying the earnout, and its flagrant contractual breaches in pursuit of that goal."</p><p>Unknown Worlds is responsible for <em>Subnautica</em>, the 2018 underwater survival game that, by all measures, was a hit. Krafton, the major South Korean publisher known for <em>PUBG Battlegrounds</em>, acquired Unknown Worlds in 2021 for $250 million, plus a bonus of $250 million that would be paid out by meeting certain milestones. Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill were fired in July before Krafton delayed the game into 2026, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thereby putting the bonus payout in jeopardy</a>. Bloomberg reported last week that Unknown Worlds leadership intended to share the money with the studio's roughly 100 employees, which would have earned staff "hundreds of thousands of dollars to seven figures" each, per Bloomberg's report. Krafton, <a href="https://krafton.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement published on its website</a>, said the fired executives "abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them."</p><p>Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill disputed that, and announced they were filing a lawsuit, the details of which are now public. In it, the executives lay out the timeline that claims Krafton was worried about <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s projected success and how much money the company would have to pay out. "As momentum for <em>Subnautica 2</em> was building, the reality of what this would mean for the earnout hit Krafton. When that happened, everything changed," lawyers wrote in the complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>Several Unknown Worlds' "publishing colleagues" from Krafton's El Segundo office met with Krafton in South Korea to "finalize the marketing and advertising strategy" in April, and when they returned to the United States, told Gill that "Krafton leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game," per the complaint.</p><p>"The El Segundo colleagues informed Gill that Krafton’s legal team was combing through the agreements looking for any opening to terminate the Founders if they proceeded with the planned [redacted] release," lawyers wrote. "The El Segundo colleagues told Gill it was clear that Krafton was aiming to avoid paying the earnout."</p><p>Lawyers write that Krafton “engaged in a months-long campaign to delay <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s release,” including that the company “pulled key marketing materials, refused to follow through with crucial partnerships, and reneged on long-standing commitments to handle important prelaunch tasks.” The 58-page lawsuit, filed in early July in the Delaware Chancery Court, goes into detail on what the fired executives call an “obstructist agenda” — Krafton allegedly stopped paying vendors, which impacted Krafton’s marketing support, like trailers and a PC Gamer magazine cover; pulled localization help, back-end services like “analytics and server infrastructure,” legal support for contract review, and policy review for the game’s terms of use. The executives claim, via one Krafton employee in the El Segundo, California, office, that Krafton employees were instructed to stop “<em>all</em> creative tasks related to <em>Subnautica 2</em>” and to stop communicating with Unknown Worlds.</p><p>In May, the executives allege, Krafton “advanced the new company line” that “<em>Subnautica 2</em> was not ready.” That included a milestone review, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which has since leaked online</a>, in which Krafton described the game as lacking polish and “market impact.” It showed biomes being removed, fewer creatures, and cut content — signifying “the need to reassess the timeline and roadmap,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the leaked documents that Krafton has since confirmed as real</a>. The executives, in the lawsuit, characterize this review as Krafton’s “obstructionist tactics,” saying that the people who did the review were not experts in survival games nor releasing early access games. The executives pushed back the feedback, according to the lawsuit, and showed that playtest data from community members “unequivocally confirmed that the game was ready to go.” (Earlier in the lawsuit, lawyers call out Krafton’s previous early access game, <em>inZOI</em>, as launching with “less content and being less developed than <em>Subnautica 2</em>; allegedly, Krafton executives expected <em>Subnautica 2</em> would “easily double” <em>inZOI</em>’s 1.1 million sold copies “with proper publishing support.”)</p><p>Krafton began sending letters — “an intimidation campaign,” per the complaint — to the founders on June 10, “falsely accus[ing] the Founders of failing to fulfill their contractual responsibilities and violating their fiduciary duties.” On June 18, according to the document, a Krafton executive met with Gill to “attempt to get the Founders to accept a lower earnout.” The executives claim the offer “did not allow them to share the earnout with the full team, so the Founders declined.” Negotiation continued through late June before Krafton fired the three executives and removed them from the Unknown Worlds board of directors. Steve Papoutsis was named CEO of Unknown Worlds and Krafton announced the game would be delayed until 2026.</p><p>“Krafton flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds,” lawyers wrote. “It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without Cause. Promise broken.”</p><p>The lawsuit also details continues in detailing what it describes as Krafton’s attempt in “harming Unknown Worlds’ relationship with its fan community” by posting on the game and studio websites “a statement apologizing for Subnautica taking ‘far longer than any of us ever intended’ and making allegations about Cleveland and McGuire’s alleged roles.” It also includes the community response to the public dispute, including headlines, YouTube screenshots, social media posts, and Reddit threads commenting on — and worrying about — the executive firings and subsequent delay.</p><p>The executives say Krafton breached their purchase agreement contract and want the court to order the company to pay up the earnout fee, reinstate the founders’ jobs and board of directors seats, and pay other damages. The purchase agreement signed by both the fired executives and Krafton allegedly made it so the founders would “maintain operational control of the Group companies in all material respects, including (for both existing and new products) product roadmap, launch, planning, partnering, budgeting and employee matters,’ so long as at least one of the three of them was still employed.”</p><p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reported</a> that Krafton intends to “extend the schedule for a potential bonus payout” for Unknown Worlds. Forty or so Unknown Worlds employees will be “eligible to share a $25 million bonus” if revenue goals are met by the end of 2025, “with a possible short-term expansion,” per the report. Bloomberg sources said the schedule for that $25 million bonus has been extended a year, and that Krafton will “advance a portion of the studio’s projected 2026 profit-sharing bonus pool,” something separate from the $25 million bonus, to all employees in 2025.</p><p>In a comment to Aftermath, Krafton said that the company's "decisions were made to ensure <em>Subnautica 2</em> is the best possible game and lives up to fan expectations. Releasing the game prematurely with insufficient content,&nbsp;falling short of what fans expect in a sequel, would have both disappointed the players — who are at the heart of everything Krafton does — and damaged the reputations of both the Subnautica and Unknown Worlds brands. While we are disappointed that Charlie, Max, and Ted have filed a lawsuit seeking a huge payout, we look forward to defending ourselves in court. In the meantime, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game as quickly as possible to Subnautica’s fans."</p><p>You can read the lawsuit below:</p><p><em>This story has been updated with more details from the lawsuit and a statement from Krafton.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick"><h3>The Penny Farthing Is Alive And Well In 2025</h3></a><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race takes place every summer in Frederick, Maryland</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/unknown-worlds-lawsuit-subnautica-2]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Nostalgia is only going to get you so far, when revisiting something from your youth. Sometimes it'll get you too far, and as a critic, it's important to be aware of those instances, so you're not ignoring the faults in a game or product to the detriment of your work. Thankfully, that's not something I had to worry about at all with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 when I sat down to begin playing it for my review.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I have practically no nostalgic love for the series. I was the right age to play them growing up, I had the right console with a PlayStation 2 that still works to this day, and yet the four titans of video game history that are the four Pro Skater games, missed me as I was growing up in my gamer youth. </p>



<p>My skateboarding video game journey didn't begin until EA's Skate games. A fact that I'm slightly regretting ahead of what's sure to be a microtransaction-filled Skate 4 that might play the way I prefer, but I'm dreading will be ruined inch by inch with each monetization update that threatens to take all the fun out of just skating around and doing some sick tricks.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>That's why I've had so much fun playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4. It's not a perfect remaster, but for the most part, it accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is to be a fun return to two classic skateboarding games. Some of the new maps don't stand out as much as old classics, and I do wish that the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 half of the game was more of a faithful remaster to the original game, instead of the entire setup being changed, but it cannot be denied that these games are pure skateboarding fun. </p>



<p>All of my early interactions with the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series came from playing them at friends' houses, so this is the first time I've gotten the chance to sit with games in this series for hours. I have fond memories of playing Tony Hawk games at friends' houses, and that's where the nostalgia kicks in the most for me. Ironically, a game published by Activision is making me nostalgic for a time when you weren't chasing anything in a game beyond high scores and wacky characters, and you could unlock the full breadth of available options just through playing the game for hours. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, that's where the reality of the video game industry in 2025 kicked in for me, as I saw the two deluxe edition-exclusive characters, DOOM Guy and Revenant, on the roster of skaters. At least Bam Magera is included and unlockable through in-game progress, but I also would have personally liked to see more special characters not within the Tony Hawk universe beyond DOOM Guy, Revenant, and Michelangelo.</p>



<p>That aside, this remaster, and the time I've been spending just getting on my board and running through Foundry, the Zoo, Alcatraz, or the Airport, has honestly made me feel like I was escaping the real world in a way that few other games are able to achieve. Part of this can be chalked up to the nostalgia of it all. Another part, I recognize, comes from my real-world experience of heading out on my longboard to get out of my own head when I've needed to take some time and not think about life for a while. Riding has always been a special kind of flow state for me that I've always felt to be distinct to what I experience when I get deep into a game. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 was the closest I can remember a video game has come to getting me into that specific flow state. The gameplay gets me there, every time, and I just wish the soundtrack played a meaningful role. Your mileage may vary on the soundtrack, but the more than 50 songs featured in this remaster fail to do anything for me more often than not. I don't dislike all of the songs, but I've found that I'd rather listen to my own music library when playing, which is a tad disappointing, considering how the soundtracks to these games have been recognized as a key part of the experience. </p>



<p>Only 10 of the songs on the soundtrack are from the original game, while the rest of the 50+ titles are new. As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/less-than-20-of-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4s-soundtrack-is-made-up-of-songs-from-the-original-games/">VGC</a>, Tony Hawk himself claimed to have made a few decisions on the soundtrack and opted to change things up this time around, featuring newer or different songs from artists featured in the original games. Maybe if Tony Hawk could put some boygenius on the soundtrack, we'd have some more common musical ground.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Out of the new parks, Pinball is the standout, though most of the parks feel very new to me, since, as I've said before, this has been my first time really sitting with these parks and spending a lot of time with them. The only problem with that is that the new parks, save Pinball, negatively stand out compared to the original levels that made these games so famous in the first place. It's not that they're bad; they're just not close to the same quality as the original parks. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ultimately, my time playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 has been a much-needed break from the world. Setting my mind's clock back to a time before generative AI tools threatened everyone's jobs, before I had to worry about next month's rent, and before I spent every day watching some new atrocity pop up on my timeline. It's excellent, flowing gameplay that feeds into the kind of platforming challenges I can't get enough of is enough to have anyone daydreaming about the days of their youth.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is a successful remaster for anyone wanting to shut out the world and grind away your problems for a while, and remember simpler times. The classic Tony Hawk gameplay only seems to have gotten better with age, and the custom parks are sure to keep you skating for hours after you've washed the career mode. Even though it's not a faithful remaster of THPS 4, and your mileage may vary on the soundtrack, any fan of the series would do themselves a disservice to skip out on grabbing this remaster bundle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/valve-we-want-to-allow-everything-on-steam-including-something-that-you-hate/">famously permissive</a> rules for what games are and are not allowed on Steam got a little less permissive this week, seemingly in response to outside pressure from some of its partner companies. In <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/commit/fddd59b5395cc3c1c74574650dbf5784612d0521">a Tuesday update</a> to the "Rules and Guidelines" section of <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding">Steam's Onboarding Documentation</a>, the company added a new rule prohibiting "Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or Internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content."</p>
<p>On its own, the new rule seems rather vague, with no details on which of the many kinds of "adult only content" would belong in the "certain" subset prohibited by these unnamed payment processors and ISPs. But the trackers over at SteamDB <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27">noticed</a> that the publication of the new rule coincides with <a href="https://steamdb.info/history/events/?before=64657809">the removal of dozens of Steam games</a> whose titles make reference to incest, along with a handful of sex games referencing "slave" or "prison" imagery.</p>
<h2>Holding the keys to the bank</h2>
<p>Valve isn't alone in having de facto restrictions on content imposed on it by outside payment processors. In 2022, for instance, Visa <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/visa-pauses-pornhub-ad-payments-ahead-of-child-sexual-abuse-trial/">suspended all payments to Pornhub's ad network</a> after the adult video site was accused of profiting from child sexual abuse materials. And PayPal has routinely disallowed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/07/paypal-sets-down-stricter-regulations-for-file-sharing-sites/">payments to file-sharing sites</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/paypal-blocks-vpn-smartdns-providers-payments-over-copyright-violations/">VPN providers</a> over concerns surrounding piracy of copyrighted materials.</p>
