		<p>One of the most welcome surprises of the last six months was Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This turn-based RPG, managed to out-JRPG the Japanese, with French team Sandfall Interactive putting together an exquisitely-crafted turn-based adventure with the kind of production values and storytelling normally reserved for Square Enix and Final Fantasy. It’s fair to say that it hit home with plenty of players too, and the team have just announced the incredible milestone of 5 million players, worldwide, who’ve set out on that thirty-third expedition. As a ‘thank you’ to all those players, Sandfall Interactive have announced today that they’ll be releasing a massive new DLC package, bringing new areas, content and brand-new boss battles to the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-gEg-jBjPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As one of the best games of the year, it’s such good news that we’re going to be getting even more Clair Obscur, especially when it’s not just the game that’s been a massive hit, with the orechestral soundtrack racking up a huge 333 million listens as well! We loved it here at TSA Towers, and Gamoc scored it an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">insane 10/10</a>, saying “Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a beautiful experience that excels in almost every area – the combat and character skill customisation is some of the most intricate I’ve seen, the storyline is routinely surprising and emotional, characterisation and performances are immaculate, and it both looks and sounds absolutely stunning all the time. It’s a stunning accomplishment for Sandfall Interactive’s first game, and with a core team of around 30 (with outsourced help). It’s sure to be in contention for Game of the Year awards, and anyone not playing it is seriously missing out.”</p>
<ul>
<li>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover.</li>
<li>Challenging, new boss battles for late-game players to overcome.</li>
<li>New costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving even more customization options for players throughout their adventure.</li>
<li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19.</li>
<li>Plus, even more surprises fans can look forward to!</li>
</ul>
<p>“The response to our game has been nothing short of incredible,” says Guillaume Broche, Creative Director of Expedition 33 at Sandfall Interactive. “We spent years working on our dream project, and to know it has resonated with fans around the world in such a powerful way is both wonderful and overwhelming. We’re so grateful to our fans for their love of the world we created, for sharing their own fan art and music covers, for wearing their best Baguette cosplays to conventions, and for being incredibly supportive of our game. We hope the update we’re working on will act as a ‘thank you’ to those fans for their support – please be patient while our team work hard on bringing you something worth the wait.”</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is available now for PS5, Xbox Series consoles and PC. If you hurry, it’s currently on offer on PS5 too, bringing its price in line with the PC version.</p>

<p>Trinket Studios (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_chef_brigade">Battle Chef Brigade</a>) and Outersloth revealed their brand new and rather tasty-looking card-battler, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_suit_aces">Battle Suit Aces</a>, a little while back, and it's out right this very moment on the Nintendo Switch Entertainment System.</p>
<p>Now, if you're feeling in any way like this particular writer, you may have just thought, <em>'No, no more card-battling games - I reckon I'm all good for now, folks.'</em> But judging from what we've seen of this one, it may well be worth your time, especially if you're into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona</a>-styled storylines threaded throughout battles that feature things like massive robots and gigantic monsters. Y'know, all the best things.</p>
<p>We've already seen in the past how a good story can bring a card game to life in all-new ways, thanks to the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inscryption">Inscryption</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/slay_the_spire">Slay the Spire</a>, and, with the press release describing a "heartfelt hunt for alien superweapons", Battle Suit Aces has certainly got our attention.</p>
<p>Here are some more story details from the folks over at Trinket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embark on a heartfelt journey through the stars on the USS Zephyr, joining Captain Heathcliff and his ragtag crew as they search the galaxy for fabled Relic Suits. Sojourn through monster-infested galactic wilds, leading your crew through danger, tragedy, and comedic sci-fi shenanigans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Battle Suit Aces is currently available on the eShop at a launch discount price of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/battle-suit-aces-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOor3WyIV2HocHJ_LHTM8XWAAhu72zeNcxMM0NOkpNARSi5Frg9uO">£19.88/$22.49</a> (or whatever that is where you are).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-close-to-you-short-pikmin-super-mario-galaxy-movie-tease-speculation/">released an animated short titled "<em>Close to You</em>"</a> with absolutely no explanation as to what it could be referring to. There were definite hints, like a blurry Pikmin seen in the background of a shot and the music coming from Pikmin 4, but we couldn't say for certain that it was anything Pikmin-related, or if it potentially had something to do with the Super Mario Galaxy movie, or if it was something else entirely.</p>



<p>Well, today Nintendo answered one of those questions for us. On its Nintendo Today app, the company released a new version of the "<em>Close to You</em>" video, though this time, instead of the little baby's toys and soother appearing to move around by magic, we can see clearly that there were invisible little Pikmin all around the room.</p>



<p>So it is a Pikmin-related project, that much we can say. What that project is, however, is still another question entirely. It could, of course, be the beginning of a marketing campaign that will lead into the release of Pikmin 5. It could also be our first look at a new project from Nintendo's new Nintendo Pictures arm, which would explain why there's been no sign of Illumination or Universal in either of the videos.</p>



<p>If that's the case, then this could potentially be a new film or a new TV series based on Pikmin. At the time of this writing, just like the original version of the video that was posted to Nintendo's social accounts, the Nintendo Today app, and Nintendo's YouTube channels simultaneously, this new version comes with no added explanation as to what it is. It's also still only available to watch on the Nintendo Today app, and has yet to be shared to the aforementioned verticals so far.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll learn even more about whatever this project is soon. Perhaps we just need to wait another day for the full reveal to arrive tomorrow morning.</p>

            <p>Amid continued concerns about Steam and Itch's changing of their approach to adult games earlier this year, the UK government have stated they've got "no plans to intervene" in the decisions of payment processors who opt to withdraw support over certain content.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">Itch</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-point-to-mastercard-restrictions-as-the-payment-firm-deny-influencing-adult-game-removals">Valve</a> changed their rules regarding adult content in games a few months ago. That prompted a number of delistings and takedowns, as well as concerns about censorship. The storefronts pointed to pressure from credit card companies who process their purchases, with Australian protest group Collective Shout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">taking credit</a> for nudging those payment processors into action.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In response, <a href="https://stop-paypros.neocities.org/">counter-campaigners</a> have been making various efforts to push for a reverse in course, by mass calling companies like Visa and Mastercard, as well as petitioning governments to intervene. Enter a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/734441">petition to the UK government</a> urging politicians to "ban payment processors stopping services based on objections to legal content", which has just gotten a response.</p>
<p>"Decisions regarding which businesses payment processors contract with are a commercial matter, taking into account the relevant requirements on the firm," reads the UK treasury statement in question. "These decisions will be influenced by a variety of factors, and the Government has no plans to intervene in those commercial decisions."</p>

<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>It's not a hugely surprising outcome, especially given this petition follows <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/722903">another one</a> which currently has over 540,000 signatures and attempts to convince the government to repeal the Online Safety Act, which came into force in the UK earlier this year and requires adult media sites to use age verification. That petition also received a firm no.</p><p>This latest appeal, which has so far amassed 12,355 signees, cited "reports that payment processing companies have recently placed pressure on companies that rely on their services, pressuring them to remove legitimate content" and called for payment processors to be made to "remunerate platforms and individuals for lost income until service is restored".</p>
<p>From my perspective, I'd say the wording opted for might have made the petition easier to dismiss, since it doesn't specify the legal adult games that are allegedly being targeted. To be clear, that's solely based on the view that it'd potentially be easier for politicians to wave away the petition or plead ignorance of its context if the question's more vague, assuming they're also likely predisposed not to want to be seen to mess with business/the processors unless presented with an undeniable reason for doing so. That said, it's impossible to tell from the page whether those who submitted the petition have or were given the chance to offer specific examples that could fill in any gaps.</p>
<p>If you want a much more thorough rundown of both the role payment processors play in defining or influencing definitions of what's permissible in terms of adult content, it's well worth checking out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">Edwin's full report on the subject</a>. In that report, former Stripe software engineer and acadmic Dr David L. Stearns said that he does believe it's possible the pushback from game developers could result in governments opting to amend or clarify laws or regulations, but this would likely require "significant leverage" in the form of pressure from voters or lobbyists.</p>
<p>Another potential solution is game storefronts seeking out alternative payment processors for adult content, something Itch.io have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">previously indicated they're looking into</a>, but that one isn't a guaranteed win, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, Nintendo released an animated short called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-animated-close-to-you-mario-pikmin-theory-2000632576"><span>“Close to You”</span></a><span> on its YouTube and social media channels. The video was posted with no context, no description, and even its comments were turned off, so no one could speculate about its meaning in the comments. Today, Nintendo uploaded an updated version of the short on the Nintendo Today app that sheds some light on the mystery by revealing Pikmin, the titular little plant-like creatures from Nintendo’s strategy game series, were behind the original video’s shenanigans all along.</span></p> <p><span>Some fans clocked this yesterday, as the video had some </span><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>musical motifs in its score, and it looked like one of these plant guys was carrying items in the background of one shot. But there was also a fair bit of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-shared-a-4-minute-pixar-like-animated-short-with-no-explanation-2000632524"><span>speculation that it could have been a clip from the upcoming </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i></a><span>, depicting what could have been a baby Rosalina taking her first steps. But now we know for sure, because the updated video shows all the weird floating items in the baby’s room were actually being moved by Pikmin the whole time. The video hasn’t been uploaded outside of the Nintendo Today app at the moment, but the updated version is almost exactly the same, but it’s like someone flipped a switch and enabled a whole other layer in the rendering process, showing dozens of Pikmin crawling around the baby’s room. We’ll update this story when the video is uploaded on YouTube or any platform we can actually embed.</span></p> <p><span>The question remains, however: what is this teasing? Is it a new </span><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>game? A movie? The return of the </span><a href="https://pikmin.nintendo.com/en/short-movies/"><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>short movies</span></a><span>? Maybe we’ll find out more tomorrow if a third version drops? Or maybe it’s just a fun one-off thing some animators wanted to put together? Whatever the case, it’s a cute short. I hope to be able to watch it on something other than my phone before the day’s end.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-is-going-all-in-its-iconic-hair-dryer-is-now-selling-for-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000633160</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-is-going-all-in-its-iconic-hair-dryer-is-now-selling-for-a-new-record-low-on-amazon.1319665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hair dryers have existed for decades without meaningful innovation, essentially just blowing hot air at varying intensities until your hair eventually dries. Dyson revolutionized this category by applying aerospace engineering principles to airflow dynamics, and created a dryer that uses intelligent heat control and concentrated air velocity rather than extreme temperatures to dry hair faster.</p>
<p>The <em>Supersonic</em> and its sibling the <em>Airwrap</em> (hair dryer and styler) never see discounts throughout the year, with price drops limited exclusively to Prime Day and Black Friday events. Right now, on the final day of Prime Big Deal Day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">the Supersonic Origin has hit a record low at $299, down from its standard $419 price</a>. This 29% discount represents the <strong>best pricing Prime members will see</strong> on Dyson’s hair dryer until Black Friday arrives months from now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tech that Changes the Functionality of Drying the Hair</h2>
<p>The Dyson Supersonic addresses the root issue with ordinary dryers: they use intensive heat to break down the water quickly and damage the cuticles on the hair and causing the brittle and fried quality that results from everyday heat styling. Dyson’s design is focused on the V9 digital motor, a very tiny, very powerful motor found in the handle – not the head. It <strong>rotates at as many as 110,000 rpm and creates high-velocity airflow reaching as high as 13 liters per second</strong>. This focused stream of air works through the exterior layers of the hair down into the interior to dry from the inside out, saving time that the hair is exposed to heat.</p>
<p>The air multiplier technology boosts this flow by <strong>sucking up ambient air into the stream, tripling the initial amount</strong> without the need for increased motor power. This produces a high-pressure and high-velocity stream of air that’s robust enough to instantly dry hair and stable enough to style accurately. It is quite a distinct experience compared to the typical dryers that blow out the hot air everywhere on the surface of your skull.</p>



<p>Intelligent heat control is the biggest technological break-through in the history of healthy-looking hair: A glass bead thermistor is located in the airflow stream and senses the temperature of the air every 40 times per second and reporting back to the microprocessor. Heating element output is varied continuously by the system as needed to hold the desired temperature under very tight tolerances and suppresses the temperature glitches that occur in ordinary dryers when airflow diminishes or ceases.</p>



<p>The magnetic attachments also feature a styling concentrator, producing a narrow, focused blade of air that is ideal for precise styling, such as smoothng out areas when blow-drying or making sleek styles. The diffuser gently disperses airflow all around the curls to dry them without breaking curl patterns or causing frizz. They attach magnetically and spin 360 degrees, angling airflow precisely where you want, without the uncomfortable wrist work needed on dryers with stationary attachments.</p>
<p><strong>Three speed settings and four heat settings</strong> provide flexibility for different hair types and styling needs. The cold shot button delivers unheated air to set styles or cool down after drying. Fast drying mode combines maximum airflow with high heat for thick hair that takes forever to dry, while regular drying balances speed with gentler treatment. Styling mode reduces both airflow and heat for detailed work on specific sections.</p>
<p>For just $299, you’re saving $120 on technology that seriously takes care of the health of your hair and still gives you professional-level drying. Deals like these on Prime Big Deal Day are gone after tonight.</p>

              <p>Running out of battery in the middle of your day is one of those modern frustrations that can derail plans or leave you anxiously watching your phone percentage tick down. A portable charger solves that anxiety but most options are bulky bricks that take up valuable bag space. The <em>INIU</em> 10,000mAh power bank breaks that mold as one of the smallest portable chargers on the market and makes it easy to slip into any pocket or bag compartment. During Amazon’s <strong>Prime Big Deal Days</strong>, this model dropped to $21 on day one, but now on the final day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/">there’s an additional coupon bringing it down to $19, down from the original $29</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The true innovation is INIU’s TinyCell which is <strong>high-density battery cells that cram 10,000mAh of capability into a package that is just 30% smaller and 15% lighter than rival packages</strong> that deliver the same output. That translates to shouldering serious charging capability without the weight and mass that all too frequently accompanies high-capability power banks.</p>

<h2>Speed That Really Saves Your Day</h2>
<p>The 45W Power Delivery chip on board provides truly fast charging times. INIU can <strong>get an iPhone 17 up to 60% in a mere 25 minutes</strong>, the difference between sitting at home waiting on your phone to charge versus walking out the door with enough power left over to get the rest of your day done. That 45W output also translates to being able to support the <strong>more power-hungry devices like iPads or be able, in a pinch, to charge some laptops</strong>, putting this power bank above the abilities of typical 18W or 20W portable chargers.</p>
<p>The <strong>twin USB-C port design</strong> distinguishes this from virtually all other power banks available. Both the USB-C ports are dual-purpose as you can charge the power bank itself via either one and as a second output charge devices via either one as well. This is convenient when one is dealing with multiple USB-C device and doesn’t need separate cables that have separate uses. With the <strong>addition of the USB-A port</strong>, one ends up with three combined outputs that are able to charge the phone, the earbuds, and the smartwatch all at the same time when one is needed.</p>



<p>That <strong>10,000mAh battery is equivalent to approximately two full charges on most smartphones</strong> or one full charge on the larger phones with some juice left over. For tablets such as iPads, you can expect about 70-80% of a full charge on the model dependent. The size is balanced between being portable and useful, enough to get through prolonged airplane days or multiple days away from outlets without being too much on everyday carry.</p>
<p>INIU arrives with protection like <strong>temperature control, surge protection, and short-circuit protection</strong>, aided by their three-year warranty and lifetime tech support. Included is the USB-C to USB-C cable with lanyard, which makes it easy to clip the power bank on packs or have the power bank easily kept close at hand. At $19 after the coupon, this power bank is less expensive than two movie tickets but solves an issue you face every day.</p>

<p>It may have only launched with two days left in the month, but NBA 2K26 was the best-selling game in the United States (US) for August 2025. According to the latest data from Circana, which looks at sales information from August 3-30, NBA 2K26 only had two days’ worth of data yet still came out on top.</p>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m2op7adeyc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Following the latest</a> from 2K Sports was Madden 26 at number two. Rounding out the top five were Mafia: The Old Country, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and EA Sports College Football 26.</p>

Aside from the four new games mentioned above, Gears of War: Reloaded, the EA Sports Kickoff Bundle that included both Madden 26 and College Football 26, and Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar all joined the list.  Even games like Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba: The Hinokami Chronicles 2, Helldivers 2, and Hogwarts Legacy re-entered the top 20 after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-26-was-julys-best-selling-video-game-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling out in July</a>.</p>



<p>Games that fell out of the top 20 include Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, F1 25, MLB The Show 25, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC 25, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Elden Ring, and Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>

Now, Epic is suing two UEFN devs, Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser, and accused the pair of using bots to artificially create engagement on their creations.</p><p>As laid out <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/929543657/Epic-Games-suing-two-Fortnite-Island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in the lawsuit</a>, Nahdi and Nasser allegedly created over 20,000 fake bot accounts and programed them to visit each others' Fortnite islands to inflate the engagement metric Epic uses to compensate creators. Epic paid the pair for the month of December 2024, and then noticed that the bots they created were only engaged with the 10 islands created by the plaintiffs.</p><p>The lawsuit contends that over 80% of the engagement on the plaintiffs' Islands was artificial, and in some cases, "over 99% of the engagement ... was artificial." Epic is attempting to claw back the tens of thousands of dollars" it paid to the pair for December 2024 in addition to asking the court to set additional fees for damages incurred while also legally barring Nahdi and Nasser from ever using Fortnite or any Epic Games server ever again.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome of this case, Epic has laid out ambitious plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-creators-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items-pay-for-visibility/1100-6534859/" data-ref-id="1100-6534859">Fortnite creators to sell in-game items</a> and potentially earn real money for their creations.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Fear is fundamentally different when you’re alone. The creeping shiver up your spine, the thump and thud of far-off noises, and the sense of loneliness and danger are all heightened if there’s no one else with you. That presents a particular problem for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</a>. This is the first game in the series to introduce co-operative play, and that means the fear is shared. Crucially, though, it’s not halved, moulding the terror into a new experience that doesn’t dull the expertly crafted atmosphere that the series is known for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares III - 'Alone' Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEXxEH8NQe0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s two new characters to choose from in Little Nightmares 3: Low, the slight, bird-skull wearing boy who carries a simple bow and arrow, and Alone, the orange-haired mechanic girl, her patched-up overalls tying perfectly with the metallic wrench slung on her back. This tiny pair are tied together, and the eagle-eyed might realise we’re joining them mid-way through their journey into The Spiral, a loose collection of different disturbing delusions. They have a map, they’ve come through a mirror, and they’re together. Little Nightmares 3 doesn’t need to give you any more narrative impetus than that.</p>


<p>Little Nightmares 3 looks incredible. The sense of desolation and decay permeates every element of the different settings, and the atmosphere remains impeccable, driven by the atonal soundtrack, the creaking, cracking, and groaning of mechanisms, and the haunting calls of crows and creatures.</p>
<p>There are two visual settings on PS5, and Beauty really does make each moment look like a living diorama, with dust motes drifting through the air, and gallons of guts shimmering sickly in the light. The frame rate does occasionally struggle in this mode, but I personally found it worth putting up with for the sake of the visuals. Performance, meanwhile, is silky smooth, but you’re getting a much-simplified lighting model in return. For a game like this, I know which I prefer.</p>


<p>One of the most interesting things about playing Little Nightmares in co-op, is the way the atmosphere permeates your experience of the game. You’ll talk in hushed tones, you’ll call out at the same time, you’ll skulk in silence together, waiting for the right moment to dash across a decaying room, or run from the suddenly-frantic monster at your tail. It definitely alters how the game feels, but the tension, the pressure and grim visual design work as well as they ever have done.</p>
<p>Despite the extremely curated pathway through the game, Supermassive Games (taking over from original series developers Tarsier Studios) manage to bring enough variation and new ideas to present some significant hurdles to your progress. It’s not hard, per se, barring a few unexpectedly cheap deaths or surprisingly harsh moments of combat, but there’s environmental puzzles to sort out, and the way forward isn’t always clear. Communication is key, and if you’re playing as a pair, working together to find the way through is suitably satisfying.</p>
<p>Playing solo is a different experience again. Like in its predecessor, whichever character you don’t pick will be controlled by the AI. Here, you become the leader, with the largely silent follower simply mimicking your actions. Overall, the AI is smart enough to prevent frustration, though occasionally you have to call them over with a hushed “Hey” to get them to engage with what you want them to. Once or twice they also proved just a spot too slow during combat, but they were still more reliable than a human counterpart.</p>

<p>The companionship of the two characters is gently touching. The way they reach for each other, or lift each other up, brings the game some much-needed humanity amidst the otherworldly decay and corruption. Their diminutive frames are unbelievably weak and small, but they have no option but to move forward. That indomitable spirit gives you strength and purpose through Little Nightmares 3, because you want to save them, you want to free them from this horrific dream.</p>
<p>As before, each chapter of Little Nightmares 3 shifts through a different area and a primary antagonist, and how effective they are as nightmare-fuel may rely on your own personal fears. The first section sees you evading a giant doll-baby, plucked scalp and baleful eyes a terrifying contrast to the chubby arms and hands reaching through the side of buildings, seeking out giant rattles, bringing the roof down or grabbing at a tolling bell.</p>

<p>The DualSense is also used to fantastic effect to heighten the imposing stature of this horrible thing, and even when the monster is stomping away in the distance, you can feel its presence through your hands. I think, as a parent, this felt like a particularly hard-hitting start, but later creations ramp up the cold creepiness and ghastly, gruesome atmosphere even further. Is it the best the series has ever been? I think it falls short of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares 2</a>, though whether that’s also partly due to the change in atmosphere from playing in co-op, it’s hard to say.</p>
<p>The slight mechanical clunkiness of its predecessors remains in Little Nightmares 3, and that is, if anything, amplified by the inclusion of two players. It’s easy to get stuck, for one player to knock the other out of step just before a jump, or to be unable to quite find the space next to them, and it will lead to a few frustrating deaths. Each save point is normally just a doorway back though, and those light frustrations are ironed out and soon forgotten as you continue ever further into these grotesque imaginings.</p>

<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159420/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>11 (!) years ago, a bunch of ex-Rare staff formed a studio called Playtonic to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, a spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> that promised to skillfully carry the 3D platforming torch. Yet when the actual game launched in 2017, following an incredibly successful Kickstarter campaign, it didn’t <em>fully</em> deliver on that promise.</p>
<p>Players were met with a passionately crafted, but somewhat janky experience that some (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">like me</a>) loved and others hated, and the cool reception resulted in the titular duo having a mixed reputation. Now, Playtonic has decided to make things right with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, and I’m happy to report that the team has done an excellent job of delivering on that original promise.</p>
<p>First off, what exactly <em>is</em> Yooka-Replaylee? Though it’s debatable whether this qualifies as a full-blown remake of the original, it’s immediately apparent that this goes far beyond a mere remaster that simply improves performance and visuals.</p>
<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159438/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yooka-Laylee was the epitome of a flawed gem, and Playtonic clearly took to heart the criticism the initial release received and used it to make this second pass a much stronger showing. Things like tighter controls, fast travel, a map, and loads more collectibles change up the gameplay experience in some important and very positive ways, rounding off those rougher edges that caused some players to bounce off the original.</p>
<p>The overall structure remains unchanged, as the titular duo explores the central hub and its five worlds in search of dozens of Pagies, a certain number of which is needed to unlock the next world in the progression. Once you drop into a world, there are around 50 Pagies scattered around the environment to collect, which can be picked up in whatever order you want.</p>
<p>Exploration is expedited and a lot smoother this time around because our heroes have not only had their moveset retooled to feel much smoother, but also have all their abilities unlocked from the beginning. The devs also more than doubled the Pagie count for this release, which has gone a <em>long</em> way towards making the worlds feel less empty. The environments are still pretty spacious, however, especially given that they’re now by default in their ‘expanded’ state.</p>

<p>To make them feel less daunting, Playtonic added a cute bookmark NPC named Mark who you can not only fast travel to at various points on the map, but also pay to reveal the location of Pagies you haven’t found yet. I wasn’t exactly disappointed by the design and depth of the worlds in the initial release, but the work Playtonic has done here to streamline traversal and progression through them has absolutely changed them for the better.</p>
<p>In addition to Pagies, there are also oodles of coins and quills scattered in each level. The former can be traded to Vendi in exchange for equippable Tonics that modify difficulty settings and myriad cosmetic changes, while the latter can be traded to Trowser for things like energy and Tonic slot upgrades to make the protagonists a bit more durable.</p>
<p>Overall, I was really pleased at how thoughtfully they balanced the economy here - even finding these ‘currency’ collectibles feels exciting due to the sheer variety of stuff you can purchase.</p>
<p>Taking a step back and seeing all these gameplay changes really puts into perspective how much effort Playtonic put in to polish and improve their debut release. Yooka-Laylee was never a bad game, but it had some quirks and flaws that occasionally got in the way of the fun, and just about every one of those drawbacks has been modified or addressed in some way here.</p>
<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159434/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve seen it argued that Playtonic would’ve been better served putting such effort into a true sequel, but I’d say that the changes here bring this duo’s first 3D entry up to par (in terms of quality) with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yooka-laylee_and_the_impossible_lair">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>. A lush, real-life orchestral recording of the original soundtrack only adds to that feeling of quality.</p>
<p>As far as the visuals are concerned, Yooka-Replaylee is a clear improvement on its predecessor but a little less so with this Switch 2 port. The good news is that the environments feature much richer detail and better lighting, giving them a far more vibrant and alluring atmosphere compared to the occasionally flat presentation of the original.</p>
<p>The bad news? The frame rate is capped at a disappointing (but stable) 30fps, which can make the action look a little bit choppy at times. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/yooka-replaylee-runs-at-30fps-on-switch-2-team-investigating-performance-mode">The devs have said</a> they’re looking into a potential post-launch performance boost after "limited time" with the Switch 2 dev kits restricted their ability to design for it, but right now it's still up in the air whether that patch will ever materialise.</p>
<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159428/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I also encountered a few bugs on my playthrough that ranged from amusing to annoying. After leaving the Switch 2 in sleep mode for a few hours, I returned to the game to find that there was no sound and after about 10 minutes of playing without it, the game simply crashed and I was booted back to the Home Screen. In another instance, whacking a treasure chest next to a wall caused my duo to clip through the level geometry and tumble into a formless black void, never to return.</p>
<p>Hiccups like this weren’t <em>too</em> common in my experience, but they also weren’t exactly uncommon, either. I'm hoping the team will address these at some point after launch.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yooka-Replaylee, in most ways, feels like the game that Yooka-Laylee was always meant to be. The core experience has remained the same, but much has been added or tweaked to make for a significantly more confident and streamlined experience.</p>
<p>Though the technical issues hold it back a bit, at least on Switch 2 at launch, this is still a clear improvement over the original and a game that no fan of the 3D platforming genre should miss out on. Even if you played the original to completion, I’d say Yooka-Replaylee is still very much worth your time and money.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supermassive has managed to create a fascinating formula with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c664edc7-8576-46a3-bd42-ad55b04b4321" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-nightmares-review-very-unpleasant-dream" rel="nofollow"><em>Little Nightmares</em></a>&nbsp;and iterate upon it in the sequel. Now in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="82b2b92a-8a97-466d-b41e-9ad000d7e88d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/little-nightmares-iii-preview-co-op-nightmares" rel="nofollow"><em>Little Nightmares III</em></a>, players are invited back into a familiar yet new unsettling territory, while being joined by a co-op companion for puzzle solving, exploration, and running away from a variety of terrifying sights.</p>

<p><em>Little Nightmares III </em>introduces two new protagonists: Low and Alone. Low is a masked boy armed with a bow and arrow, while Alone is a red-headed girl in a green jumpsuit who wields a wrench. Beginning in front of a shattered mirror, the duo is trying to make their way through the Spiral. A variety of themed hellscapes where the horrors are larger than life, and there's very little you can do to influence the world but run, jump, and hide.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-low-and-alone.jpg?itok=RI0_t5dy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-low-and-alone.jpg?itok=tH1TiiJj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On the surface, <em>Little Nightmares III</em> is about these two characters and their desire to escape. They'll make it through the world of china dolls and building blocks, spider orderlies and paperwork, and a creepy carnival where it seems everyone has lost themselves to their indulgences. It's enough to know that you want to leave… so that's what you'll do to escape.</p>

<h2>A Story About A Boy And A Girl</h2>

<p>Just as with all <em>Little Nightmares</em> games, though, there's a deeper story going on. There's a subtle narrative that weaves through the different areas that you visit, and some cutscenes tell of times outside of the event of the game, too, that help to clarify the image. By the end of the game, there are also some things that you learn outright, but there's far more to be left to the imagination of the player.</p>

<p>This is a difficult way to tell a narrative. For someone who is just here for the gameplay, they'll be able to have a good time. For a different player who likes to read between the lines, there's certainly more to uncover here. In my single playthrough of the game, I think I have some idea of the journey that I've taken… but I also wouldn't be surprised if the next person to pick up the controller gets a totally different message.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-creepy-lady.jpg?itok=HKt8uwVd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-creepy-lady.jpg?itok=lezy9x1X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That much unsorted paperwork is also my nightmare...</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay is what will be most familiar to returning players. As Low or Alone, you'll be exploring each of these worlds, trying to find your way out. There isn't a large amount of exploration, as for the most par,t you'll be trying to make your way to the right like a classic sidescroller.</p>

<p>Your characters are far too small for the scale of the world, you won't be opening doors but sliding through cracks or vents. It's the creepy humanoid denizens of the world that you'll see acting as you normally would, while you're forced to shelter like weak vermin.</p>

<h2>Traditional <em>Little Nightmares</em> Puzzles</h2>

<p>You'll run, jump, and climb as Low or Alone, making your way through untraditional puzzles to inch closer to escape. An early puzzle had you trying not to draw the ire of a giant baby doll by avoiding the light cast by its gaze, moving from shadow to shadow while it looked away. Other puzzles might have you moving crates or trolleys around to use as a ladder to reach new locations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-light.jpg?itok=q5chXagd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-light.jpg?itok=LNnK4zbP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bugs are scared of light, makes sense to me</figcaption></figure><p>My favorite puzzles were those where you had to trick or defeat the strange creatures of the world to steal a key from them to progress to the next room. While it was a short adventure, any chance you had to really stick it in the faces of those who were hunting you down was an incredibly satisfying victory.</p>

<p>For the most part, the puzzles weren't very difficult, and any time I was stuck, it would only be 5-10 minutes before I'd find the path forward. There were a number of times, especially when walking into rooms where enemies were preparing to grab me, that I did feel like the gameplay was somewhat unfair. Patterns needed to be understood, and you'd normally have to move in a specific path to not be caught. If you've never seen this pattern before, you're likely going to fail, get grabbed or killed, and then respawn at your last checkpoint.</p>

<p>These rooms didn't feel like I was 'solving' anything; it just felt like I had repeated the section enough to know the pattern.</p>

<h2>Co-Op Nightmares</h2>

<p>The major change for <em>Little Nightmares III</em> is in the co-op gameplay. For the most part, Low and Alone will stay together, but there are times when one character might need to stay behind to open a door while the other forges ahead to find another way to get their companion through.</p>

<p>The times that this gameplay worked, it was an incredible amount of fun, even in single-player. Flipping a lever as Alone and then asking Low to shoot arrows to solve a button puzzle was great, and the ventriloquism dummies that need to have their heads shot off by Low before Alone crushes them with her wrench were a blast.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-co-op-puzzle.jpg?itok=rQUY8OX3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-co-op-puzzle.jpg?itok=wWtKj07J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Reveal a diagram and then shoot your way to victory</figcaption></figure><p>As a solo player, there was also the benefit when it came to chase sequences that my AI partner would not only be ahead of me, but also follow the perfect line to escape any danger. Unlike the enemy rooms, where I felt like I needed to learn the hard way to succeed, this felt like I was being handed the answers.</p>

<p>The downside of this co-op gameplay is the number of rooms and checks that require both characters to be pulling up a grate, both holding a lever, or both pushing a door. There is probably a not-insignificant amount of time that consisted of Alone just waiting for Low to catch up so they could progress forward.</p>

<p>This dependence on the other character being present, and no way to force a reset, also caused me issues at two points in my game where the AI got left behind, and I needed to reset myself to a checkpoint to have Low respawn so that I could progress through the game.</p>

<h2>Look And Feel Just As Eerie As Ever</h2>

<p>Supermassive have absolutely outdone themselves again in the creation of the different worlds that you'll venture through, how similar and yet darkly twisted it all is, and then filling it with all kinds of creepy creatures and sounds.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-baby-doll.jpg?itok=SOa1DnC8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-baby-doll.jpg?itok=tiSO3Z4z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No thank you</figcaption></figure><p>From the very get-go of the game, getting hunted through buildings by a giant baby doll throws you into a state of unease. As you move through the twisted settings of what seems to be an office building of some kind, or a carnival where the disgusting and distorted humans seem to be visitors as much as they are the attraction, you just have to settle into an afternoon of unsettling sights and sounds to make it through <em>Little Nightmares III.</em></p>

<h2><em>Little Nightmares III</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Little Nightmares III </em>is an enjoyable little puzzle platforming adventure to play through alone or with a friend this October season.</p>

<p>The story is enjoyable on the surface, while leaving good food for thought as the credits roll and you ponder a bit more about the adventure you went on. For a game where so much is left up to interpretation, it also doesn't overstay its welcome. I felt that the time for rolling credits was exactly where it should have been in the narrative.</p>

<p>The co-op aspect, I think, does well to elevate and make some of the gameplay more unique without explicitly overcomplicating it, but there is some level of drawback in having to create a world that's specifically designed for two people to play in instead of one.</p>

<p>Building on the creepy aesthetics of the previous titles, Supermassive has managed to once again create a surreal and gross world to experience from start to finish, where you'll just want to get out of it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you're up for a quick and off-putting adventure and you've got an afternoon to spend and a friend or partner to share it with, I couldn't recommend picking up <em>Little Nightmares III</em>&nbsp;enough. If what you're after is an engaging story, or you already know you're <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="17bd91ca-0fd9-4759-a16e-2ee29e6d762c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/little-nightmares-2" rel="nofollow">not a fan of the previous <em>Little Nightmares</em> titles</a>, then chances are this isn't the title for you.</p>

When it arrives, the mini-expansion will add new locations and bosses, giving players fresh targets for their increasingly broken builds.</p> <p>Sandfall hasn’t announced a release date yet for the new<em> Clair Obscur</em> content but confirmed it won’t be paid and should be available to players across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC at the same time.&nbsp;Here’s everything fans can expect from the free update:</p>

 <blockquote> <ul> <li>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of<em>&nbsp;Expedition 33</em>&nbsp;to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover.</li> <li>Challenging, new boss battles for late-game players to overcome.</li> <li>New costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving even more customization options for players throughout their adventure.</li> <li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19.</li> <li>Plus, even more surprises fans can look forward to.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>“The response to our game has been nothing short of incredible,” creative director Guillaume Broche said in a press release. “We spent years working on our dream project, and to know it has resonated with fans around the world in such a powerful way is both wonderful and overwhelming. We’re so grateful to our fans for their love of the world we created, for sharing their own fan art and music covers, for wearing their best Baguette cosplays to conventions, and for being incredibly supportive of our game. We hope the update we’re working on will act as a ‘thank you’ to those fans for their support–please be patient while our team work hard on bringing you something worth the wait.”</p> <p>On many people’s shortlist for GOTY, <em>Clair Obscur</em> arrived with little fanfare back near the start of 2025 and quickly made waves thanks to its great storytelling and excellent twist on traditional turn-based combat. Sandfall Interactive’s developers have been on a victory tour ever since, including visiting a number of top game companies in Japan <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-clair-obscure-expeidition-33-turn-based-1851786927">like Square Enix</a>. In addition to the update, we already know the team is <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688">planning to work on a sequel</a>. Now all we need is confirmation that it’ll come to Switch 2 at some point.</p>

<p>For the third consecutive month since its release, the Nintendo Switch 2 led the way in sales in the United States (US) for August 2025.</p>



<p>According to the latest data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m2op7exr2426">Circana</a>, released on Wednesday, the Switch 2 was the top system in both units sold and dollars for the month. The system’s strong sales were <strong>“able to able to offset double-digit percentage declines across each of PlayStation 5, Xbox Series and Switch.”</strong></p>



<p>Looking at the numbers, video game hardware sales rose by 32% year-over-year for August to $312M. In year-to-date numbers, sales have reached $2.9 billion, a 20% jump from last year’s numbers at this time. </p>



<p>Sticking with the Switch 2, Nintendo’s latest console has passed 2.4 million units sold in the US as of August 30. That puts it 5% ahead of the pace of the PlayStation 4’s 2.2 million sold in its first three months. Comparing it to the original Switch, which launched for just $299 in 2017, unit sales are currently 77% ahead of pace for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>Moving to accessories, spending there fell by 6% year-over-year to $169 million. That said, the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller was, once again, the best-selling accessory in terms of both units sold and total dollars. One area that did increase, however, was in racing accessories. Sales increased by 7% year-over-year while total year-to-date sales rose 3% to $78M.</p>

<p>Fans of Little Nightmares 1 and 2 will love Little Nightmares 3. That tells you a lot about the nature of the game’s contents, setting, unsettling atmosphere, and flaws. Supermassive Games has taken over from Tarsier Games, but has remained faithful to the franchise to a teeth-chattering T.</p>



<p>There’s a perverse enjoyment in playing Little Nightmares games. After all, you’re basically forcing children to live out their nightmares and worst dreams come to life. But the cathartic conclusions make each journey memorable. Little Nightmares 2’s improvement over the first was incremental. I’d go as far as saying that’s the case for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> as well.</p>



<p>While the game’s air is thick with dread, the stench lingering in the air is recognizable. We’ve inhaled this scent before. This is Supermassive Games’ first attempt to awaken a new nightmare, and there’s a lot to love.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> follows in the footsteps of its predecessors: It’s a new game, a new world, with new unfortunate characters. This time around, we’re focusing on Low and Alone. The former wears a raven mask and sports a bow, whereas Alone looks like a perfect Sid Wilson Slipknot cosplayer with a full green jumpsuit, goggles, and a mean wrench.</p>



<p>The second game in the series introduced an AI ally to help you along the way. In Little Nightmares 3, you can either go this Alone, or, Low and behold, you can now team up to tackle the terror in co-op. However, it’s <em>online co-op</em> only. This means you can’t have a person join you on the couch to immerse yourselves and absorb the action on-screen together. </p>



<p>I played Little Nightmares 3 in single-player, so I only have the experience of my reasonably competent AI partner to call upon, but while the addition of co-op is much-needed, the decision to leave out couch co-op is a headscratcher, as it’s an obvious inclusion. On the plus side, the Friends Pass system—popularized by A Way Out and Split Fiction—is used, meaning two people can play together with only one copy of the game.</p>



<p>The AI has the odd moments of madness. I controlled Alone, and Low would occasionally ignore me—stopping me from getting a collectible or interacting with the environment—they would get in the way and block my path, and randomly not move, forcing me to restart the checkpoint. Otherwise, it was a fairly coherent experience, just one I wish I could’ve had with someone sitting next to me.</p>



<p>Little Nightmares 3 is split into four juicy chapters, with each biome proving to be as distinct as the last: From a crazy carnival to a madhouse. The goal to escape ‘The Nowhere’ took me around 7-8 hours—making it the deepest entry yet—and the signature blend of platforming and puzzles makes Little Nightmares 3 a scarily fun proposition.</p>



<h2 id="h-highs-and-lows-and-alones">Highs And Lows (And Alones)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Light the way forward. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The end goal is to make it through each level’s series of treacherous traps, chase sequences, and puzzles. Admittedly, these aren’t the hardest brainteasers, and I can count on one hand how many times I genuinely had to take a second to figure out what to do next. There are plenty of fun concepts sprinkled throughout the game, from a special doll that changes the world around you and opens up new avenues to thinking outside the box to get around deaf enemies.</p>



<p>Hidden trap doors, environmental obstacles, and remembering your character’s abilities are all required to push forward. Low’s bow triggers buttons, cuts ropes, and immobilizes enemies; on the other hand, Alone’s wrench breaks glass to open new paths, bulldozes holes through walls, and also finishes off the aforementioned enemies.</p>



<p>Even though you have weapons, the rare combat skirmish you encounter is awkward. The timing of strikes and the proximity of your characters to enemies feel off. I think it also takes away from the game’s defence mechanism when you can fight back, and the franchise benefits from the fear of helplessness.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the chase sequences remain as exhilarating as ever, and the platforming never lets up. It feels tight and responsive, and even in scenarios where your perspective is horribly warped or your depth perception is challenged, the game does a great job of assisting you.</p>



<p>It does feel a bit repetitive towards the end of its runtime, and its biggest weakness is the same gameplay styling that has existed since day one: Trial and error. Sometimes you have to relive excessive passages of gameplay multiple times, which can greatly eat up time. While many can tolerate the intended nature of this loop, I found it frustrating in Little Nightmares 1, and it’s just as gratuitous and oppressive now.</p>



<h2 id="h-little-nightmares-3-review-verdict">Little Nightmares 3 Review Verdict</h2>



<p>The addition of co-op (albeit limiting) and the use of a free Friends Pass system is a win-win. If you have played a Little Nightmares game before, though, don’t expect a wildly different experience, but it’s still different enough to help Little Nightmares 3 stand on its own four feet. Supermassive Games has more than demonstrated its expertise in horror and flexed its chops here, while adding in new mechanics and madness along the way. The franchise is in safe hands, and I look forward to the next installment of Tim Burton-esque horror.</p>

                <p>EA is in the process of selling itself to an investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to the tune of $55 billion. Should the sale go through, it would likely result in cutbacks, possible layoffs, and EA selling "non-essential assets," according to DFC Intelligence. There could be upsides, too, DFC Intelligence president David Cole said in a new interview.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ea-deal-predictions-sports-bioware-sims/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> that, if the deal happens and on a long-term basis, the EA sale could allow the company to "focus on more creative, risky ventures."</p><p>This is because, Cole said, EA would no longer be a public company and would not be beholden to the mission of driving up the stock price and focusing more on safer bets. However, in the short term, that's exactly what Cole predicts will happen. "Short term, we expect them to focus more on core money generators and look to get top dollar for 'secondary' IP/products," he said.</p><p>The EA sale to the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners includes $20 billion in debt for EA, and many experts have theorized that EA will implement a cost-reduction plan to pay it off.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall Interactive has teased a new update to the game is on the way, as a "thank you" to fans.</p>
<p>While story details remain slim, game director Guillaume Broche told Eurogamer: "You can expect a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well". His hints suggest it'll focus on adorable mount Esquie, who's become a bit of a meme within the game's community.</p>
<p>News of the update arrives as the game reaches a new sales milestone: it's now sold over 5m copies worldwide across all formats.</p>

<p>"We are working on a big 'thank you' update for the game actively, that we will release when it's ready," said Broche. "We want to prepare an update to say a big thank you to our players, because it's thanks to our players that we are in such a comfortable situation now. They brought us so much emotion and gave us so much love in return for the game that we want to address that and make a big thank you update with new content, new enemies, new stuff to do for every type of player."</p><p>He continued: "It's not a super big DLC extension with hours of content. It's more a thank you gift from us. You will have quite a few things to do and collect…[and] some quality of life [additions] that are very highly requested by the community."</p>

<p>If it's more than two, you're in the minority</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fdc468f0f0474"><a title="Misc. Switch Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fdc468f0f0474/misc-switch-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're a die-hard Nintendo fan (and, if you find yourself here, then you probably are), you've more than likely questioned whether you're buying too many games. It's a thought that's crossed all of our minds, and new <a href="https://www.circana.com/">Circana</a> data suggests that if it's any more than two a year, then you're in the minority (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-buy-more-than-two-new-games-a-year-youre-in-the-minority-new-report-reveals">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>The analyst firm's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">Mat Piscatella</a> recently took to Bluesky with the findings of the Q3 2025 Future of Games survey, which shows that 33% of gamers in the US pick up a new video game less than once a year. 12% of voters stated that they buy one roughly once a year, and 18% claimed to buy about one every six months.</p>
<p>What that means is that roughly 63% of gamers in the US buy less than two new games every year, so if you tend to buy more than that, you're in the minority.</p>
<p>"Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non f2p gaming space", Piscatella noted of the findings. Interestingly, only 4% of voters said they buy more than one new game a month, with 10% opting for the 'once a month' slot, and 22% landing in 'About once every three months'.</p>

<p>Of course, the tendency to buy fewer games is hardly surprising. Since the Switch 2 launched, we've seen first-party titles get up into the reaches of £74.99 / $79.99, and with the price of <em>everything</em> on the rise, it makes sense that monthly pick-ups would take a step back. Throw in the rise of free-to-play titles and it's not hard to see how a trend could start.</p>
<p>But it got us thinking, where do you fall in this bracket? Are you like the majority of players in the US, where new game pick-ups are a rarity, or are you one of the ""Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players" that Piscatella mentions, for whom new purchases are commonplace?</p>
<p>We'd imagine that most of us would sit closer to the latter (you've made it to the bottom of a post on <em>Nintendo</em> Life, so more than a passing interest in games seems likely), but there's only one way to find out... a poll! You can let us know your game purchasing habits below.</p>

              <p><span>Last night on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-jimmy-fallon-game-show-host-nbc-savannah-guthrie-2000632667"><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i></a><span>, the singing voices of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>performed together for the first time. Ejae, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami’s voices have been heard by millions of people in the musical and its soundtrack, but other than a brief cameo on last weekend’s </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span>, we hadn’t heard them perform together outside of the studio. While I would have loved for it to be on a stage that wasn’t in proximity to Jimmy “We don’t know what fascism is on this show” Fallon, hearing the voices of Huntr/x absolutely nail the anthemic “Golden” on stage was delightful. What a victory lap.</span></p> <p><span>The performance was set to footage from the movie, including both of the major scenes in which the group sings “Golden” in the musical. It starts with footage from the music video premiere that debuts the song to the public, and ends with Huntr/x’s performance of the song at the Idol Awards in the film’s third act. Catch me feeling sentimental seeing this performance, as it echoes the movie itself, in which fans had to wait for quite some time to hear Huntr/x perform the song live because of all the demon-hunting drama going on behind the scenes. But also, as many fans point out in the comments, this is the first time Ejae, the voice of lead singer Rumi, has performed live in many years. She has primarily worked behind the scenes in the music industry, and now she’s finally getting to sing her #1 song to an audience of millions.</span></p>   <p><span>Elsewhere in the show, Fallon revealed to the group that the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack has gone platinum, having sold one million copies in the U.S. alone. What a special night, and hopefully there are more to come. It would be great to hear more songs from the movie down the line. I’m crossing my fingers for a performance of “What It Sounds Like” with a choir backing the girls up.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO is one of those brands that pretty much anyone can enjoy. Doesn’t matter if you’re just a kid or a kid at heart in an adult-sized body. Building a LEGO set piece by piece is fun, peaceful, and rewarding all at the same time. Plus at the end, you have some sick Marvel or Star Wars toy to play with or display. The only problem is LEGO can be crazy expensive, and the rare times they do go on sale, it’s not that hefty of a discount or sells out in minutes. We’ve been greeted with a rare exception though thanks to Prime Big Deals Days. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4616/">Amazon has the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Ghost and Phantom II spaceships for 30% off. The set is normally priced at $160, but that discount brings it down to just $112</a>. You’ll end up saving a whole $48.</p>
<p>The Ghost is the main spaceship helmed by the heroes of the <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> animated series in the Spectres rebel cell’s long fight against the forced of the Galactic Empire. Later, when Disney announced an Ahsoka series, we all knew that would mean seeing more characters and iconography from the animated Star Wars canon. Sure enough, we got the Ghost in live action. And now, in LEGO.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4616/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>2 LEGO Star Wars Ship</h2>
<p>This 1,394-piece set contains both the modified VCX-100 light freighter known as the Ghost and its auxiliary vessel the Phantom II (first one was destroyed at Reklam Station so it does not come in LEGO form).</p>
<p>The Ghost included two lever-activated spring-loaded shooters, a cockpit with a removable front which can fit two minifigure pilots, two hatches that open up, plus a turret with a hood that can fit a minifigure working the gun.</p>
<p>The Phantom II shuttle also has an opening LEGO minifigure cockpit plus a storage compartment. I can even connect to the Ghost freighter.</p>



<p>The full build measures in at over 4.5 inches high, 13.5 inches long ,and 10.5 inches wide. It’s not ginormous like some of the Death Star or Star Destroyer builds but it’s no Happy Meal toy either.</p>
<p>The build becomes easier when using the LEGO Builder app. You can view each step with a 3D digital version to see all those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet, allowing you to zoom in and rotate the model around. You can even save your progress if you need to walk away from your build partway through.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4616/">For Prime Big Deals Day, save $48 on the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Ghost and Phantom II spaceships.</a></p>
