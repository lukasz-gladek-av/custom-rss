			<p>Amidst several announcements of new handhelds powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-apus-gaming-handhelds-z2-extreme-strix-z2-hawk-z2-go-rembrandt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's Ryzen Z2 processor</a>, Microsoft also talked about its upcoming highly anticipated Xbox handheld at CES 2025.</p>
<p>The Verge was able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discuss the subject with Jason Ronald</a>, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem at Microsoft. Ronald, who previously led the development of the Xbox One X and Xbox Series S|X console launches, promised that the Xbox handheld would offer users the best of console and PC put together.</p>
<p><em>We’ve been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it’s really about how do we bring those innovations that we’ve incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space.</em></p>
<p><em>I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together,because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console. What we’re doing is we’re really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re focused on really simplifying that and making it much more like a console experience. Our goal is to put the player and their library at the center of the experience and not all the Windows work that you have to do today.</em></p>
<p>The launch of the Xbox handheld isn't quite imminent, but Ronald teased that Microsoft would share a lot more later this year.</p>
<p>There have been rumors about Microsoft's handheld projects for years. Head of gaming Phil Spencer finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed it</a> with his recent comments but also said the handheld is still 'a few years' out. Putting two and two together, it sounds like late 2026 could be a likely release window. The new Xbox home console is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to debut in late 2026</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-lands-later-this-month-beta-28-out-now.1076997/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bay 12 Games and publisher Kitfox Games have announced that the&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>Adventure Mode will be launching out of beta later this month.</p>

<p>In an update on Steam, Bay 12's Tarn Adams and Kitfox's Alexandra Orlando reveal that Adventure Mode will arrive on January 23rd, having been available as part of <i>Dwarf Fortress</i>' beta branch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/4186734162819864096" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">since April</a> last year.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not aware of Adventure Mode, it's effectively a roguelike-style RPG gameplay mode in which you can explore the worlds you've generated as part of&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em>' main colony management gameplay, taking on quests and discovering all manner of exciting things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date-exploration.jpg?itok=yKUTx2CM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date-exploration.jpg?itok=rEgyJLzA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adventure Mode officially lands in&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>on January 23rd.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Adams and Orlando say that focus will shift "back to Fortress Mode very soon", they also promise that Adventure Mode's full release is "not the end" of development for the feature.</p>

<p>Rather, there will be "many updates" for both Fortress Mode and Adventure Mode in future, and the two say there's "more to add" to the roguelike mode as well, so you'll be getting extra features in the months to come.</p>

<p>As well as the Adventure Mode release date announcement, a new&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>beta update has also arrived today. Beta 28 adds tons of new features including new graphics, changes to character creation, and tons of gameplay tweaks.</p>

<p>If you want to read the beta update's full patch notes, then you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/530961267633946651" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here via Steam</a>. It's well worth checking them out if you want to see some of the super-granular changes Kitfox and Bay 12 have made to the game's beta branch.</p>




<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, it's a colony management sim in which you must oversee a colony of dwarves attempting to survive in a hostile procedurally-generated world.</p>

<p>The game is well-known for its emergent gameplay; the procedural generation and multiple interlocking systems of&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>often allow amusing things to happen, many of which will be unique to each player's playthrough.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>was released all the way back in 2006, but the version being updated today is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-steam-release-date-unleashes-chaos" rel="nofollow">the 2022 paid version</a>, which updates the game's presentation and makes various other quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

If you’re among the new PlayStation VR2 owners, you might feel overwhelmed looking at the over 300 games that are compatible with it. Where should you start?</p><p>There are many gems available via PlayStation VR2, ranging from VR-exclusive games to regular games with immersive VR modes. We could sit here all day listing everything worth playing on the console, but for people who just want to see what Sony’s headset can do, these eight games will offer you some of the best experiences the system has to offer. </p></div></div><div><p>It is literally impossible to make a list of the best VR games without starting with <em>Beat Saber</em>. It is the <em>Wii Sports </em>of VR gaming; it’s easy to learn, hard to master, and is a perfect use of motion-controlled technology. Even those who normally don’t take to VR games can enjoy <em>Beat Saber</em>’s straightforward gameplay, and it’s a surprisingly good workout to boot. I mean, it’s dancing with swords, what’s not to like?</p><p>Alternatively, if you like the idea of <em>Beat Saber </em>but don’t have cash to spend now, <strong>Synth Riders offers a similar rhythm game experience</strong> and is included with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. So if you have Sony’s subscription service and need something to tide you over, be sure to give that game a look.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-call-the-mountain-review-ps5-ps-vr2-forbidden-1850121501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-call-the-mountain-review-ps5-ps-vr2-forbidden-1850121501"><em>Horizon Call Of The Mountain</em></a></span><em> </em>honestly feels like a PlayStation VR2 tech demo, but it’s still really fun to play. As the name suggests, this is more a mountain climbing simulator than a VR-ified version of Sony’s flagship <em>Horizon </em>franchise. However, mountain climbing works <em>very </em>well in VR, especially since you can take in all the beautiful AAA-quality sights and get those tingles in your feet when you look down. I’m deathly afraid of heights and still enjoyed my time with this one.</p><p>It’s not a game that’s worth the standalone price of $60, in my opinion. However, since many Sony PlayStation VR2 headsets currently include this game as a pack-in at no additional cost, you’d be silly to pass it by. I liked it a heck of a lot for free.</p></div><div><p>Look, I get it, not everyone is necessarily chomping at the bit to play racing games unless there are red turtle shells involved. Despite that, you really have to give <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> a try if you’re looking for an immersive VR experience. It’s exhilarating to feel yourself in the driver’s seat as you race at 100+ MPH, and the Dualsense controller makes for a great motion-controlled steering wheel with its haptic feedback.</p><p>There’s never been a better time to try <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstations-gran-turismo-7-is-basically-getting-a-free-1851713486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstations-gran-turismo-7-is-basically-getting-a-free-1851713486">Sony recently released a free VR2-compatible demo of the game called <em>My First Gran Turismo</em></a></span>. Even if you just play it for ten minutes for the sheer novelty, you’ll enjoy your time.</p></div><div><p><strong>Currently available with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription</strong></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401"><em>Before Your Eyes</em></a></span><em> </em>is more of an interactive movie than a game, but it’s a journey well-worth taking. Controlled entirely with your eyes and head movements, <em>Before Your Eyes</em> is both a celebration of life and a somber reflection about how we move forward in the face of tragedy. All I’ll say is that I had to clean the tears off my headset’s lens after I was finished.</p><p>It’s a good experience worth its asking price, but if you can get it for free via PlayStation Plus, this is a no-brainer.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a></span><em> </em>is already an incredible audio and visual feast for the senses, so you’re doing yourself a disservice if you haven’t played this one in VR. Also, I mean…it’s <em>Tetris</em>. You know you like <em>Tetris</em>, I know you like <em>Tetris</em>, so trying to explain why <em>Tetris </em>is great is like trying to explain why sunrises are great. <br></p></div><div><p><strong>Currently available with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription</strong></p><p><em>Synapse </em>asks the question “what’s the most fun thing someone can do in VR” and lands on the answer “do cool telekinesis stuff with one hand while you shoot bad guys with the other.” It’s an incredibly playful use of the technology, and it innovates with its motion controls beyond the usual point-and-shoot antics of other games. This one’s a roguelike too, so even if you have a rough time getting the hang of it, you’ll at least enter your next run stronger.</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Synapse </em>lacks a bit in content. That might make this one a tough sell for $34.99, but it’s a perfect grab for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers.</p></div><div><p><em>Resident Evil 4 </em>is one of the most replayable games ever made, so it was no surprise that 2023’s <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> would go down as one of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">the year’s best games</a></span>. And now, thanks to a free downloadable update that reimagines the game in VR, you can experience this all-time classic horror adventure in a brand new way. The motion-controlled aiming made me recall fond memories of playing <em>Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition</em>, and parrying attacks with your knife is so, <em>so </em>satisfying in VR.</p><p>You will be regularly reminded that <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> was not originally designed for a first-person perspective. Cutscenes will play out as they did in the original flat screen version of the game, and actions like melee attacks will occur in third person (which is probably for the better, just thinking about Leon’s roundhouse kick in first person makes me motion sick). Regardless, if you need a reason to dive back into the world of survival horror, this is it.</p></div><div><p>I typically don’t double-up on games in the same franchise on lists like this, but <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a></span> are both so uniquely good as VR experiences that it’d be an injustice to not include both. Especially in this case, because <em>Resident Evil Village </em>actually <em>was</em> designed with a first-person perspective in mind. Key cutscenes will play out in VR, the combat feels simultaneously scary and enthralling, and the interface looks surprisingly natural. I’ve actually never seriously played <em>Resident Evil Village </em>until I tried it in VR, and even people watching me playing asked if the game was VR exclusive. It’s that good!</p><p>I will say the VR mode isn’t a perfect conversion. For example, you can twist your head around during cutscenes and view character models floating around that the player clearly was never meant to see. Still, <em>Resident Evil Village </em>reigns as my favorite experience with the PlayStation VR2, and it’s an incredibly easy recommendation if you want a bonafide adventure in the virtual world. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-devs-reveal-new-parkour-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has just released a new blog post detailing the parkour systems for Assassin’s Creed Shadows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parkour has always been an integral system for every Assassin’s Creed title, and it seems to be a handy tool in Shadows. Parkour will be an excellent feature for exploration and a key tool for stealth and combat. Naoe is the parkour master, and she can quickly scale castles, leap across rooftops and surf the crowds in the streets of Kyoto thanks to her speed and agility. Check out how parkour works in Assassin’s Creed Shadows below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-parkour-inputs-for-assassin-s-creed-shadows-nbsp">New Parkour Inputs for Assassin’s Creed Shadows&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The upcoming game has changed specific inputs to add more mechanics. The crouch and dodge buttons have switched places to add the ability to go prone and let dodge mechanics lead directly to parkour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players will see that dodge and parkour down mechanics have merged thanks to the new input mapping. The new mapping will also disable the stance switch so that you can use any stance when going down from a rooftop. Players will also see new moves with the dodge button, such as acrobatic dodges over railings, jumping out of windows, or new silent drop-downs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-parkour-moves-nbsp">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Parkour Moves&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-parkour-up">Parkour Up</h3>



<p>Players who have played previous Assassin’s Creed games will know that this mechanic lets players hold a button to scale any building or structure they want, and the same parkour system will make its way to Shadows, too. The mechanic works while running up walls, jumping across gaps and leaping into the void. Naoe is better at jumping further and reaching higher than Yasuke.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-recovery-roll-nbsp">Recovery Roll&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When jumping from a distance, players can use the Igan Recovery Roll by pressing the dodge/parkour down button, considerably softening the blow and reducing the noise.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Parkour Up &amp; Recovery Roll" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/33Yq6RcLE8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down">Parkour Down</h3>



<p>Here’s where the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows parkour system comes into play. As dodge and parkour mechanics have blended, players can press dodge near a ledge to transition into a parkour down traversal. Naoe will have acrobatic descents, while Yasuke will have heavy drops. Parkour down will let you access the safest lowest point below your character and avoid the player needlessly jumping into the void.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Dodge to Drop Down" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZMKe8NZBTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-sprint-mechanics-nbsp">Sprint Mechanics&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A new system unique to Naoe, the fastest assassin in the franchise, has been introduced. This mechanic allows players to trigger an extended dive roll over smaller objects such as fences, crates, rails, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows also includes two more systems: automated passovers and shoulder tackles. Automated Passovers allow the characters to jump over smaller objects acrobatically. On the other hand, automated shoulder tackle is exclusive to Yasuke, allowing him to bash through enemies or destructive objects while sprinting. If there are non-destructible objects, Yasuke will use automated passover, but it won’t be as clean as Naoe.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-grappling-mechanics">Grappling Mechanics</h2>



<p>Apart from sprinting and parkour, Assassin’s Creed Shadows players can also access a grappling hook. With this tool, players can perform vertical ascents and hook swings. Naoe can also scale unclimbable walls by wall running and using the grappling hook on a ledge.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Wall Run to Grappling Hook" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/obO-PMO1Tfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-advanced-parkour-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Advanced Parkour in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<h3 id="h-stance-dodges">Stance dodges</h3>



<p>There are three types of stances: standing, crouching, and prone, and each stance has its own way of dodging for Naoe. Yasuke can dodge directionally while standing and crouching; however, only Naoe can dodge directionally while prone. This prone dodge will allow her to move side-to-side, roll forward, or slide backwards.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Prone Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-wall-run-eject">Wall Run Eject</h3>



<p>Thanks to her acrobatic skills, Naoe can run up any wall. The Wall Eject tool allows her to perform an incredible jump off the wall by pressing the parkour button at the top of the run. If her hands and feet are connected to a surface, Naoe can also use this move while climbing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down-backward-dodge-and-high-structure-safety-nbsp">Parkour Down Backward Dodge and High Structure Safety&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Parkour Down Backward Dodge is a new move that allows the character to move while their back is facing the edge. In this position, the player can tap the parkour down button without directional input to cause their character to perform a backward dodge, rolling over the edge and down on the ground with a “muffled landing.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parkour Down High Structure Safety is a new system that provides safety for the character at heights where fall damage could occur. In this situation, using parkour-down transitions would cause the character to hold on to the edge and hang there. You must press an additional button to make the character drop-down or climb up.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-unclimbable-surfaces">Unclimbable Surfaces</h2>



<p>Lastly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have surfaces that Yasuke and Naoe <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd/assassins-creed-shadows-parkour-system-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cannot climb</a> with the help of parkour, as they do not have any physical handholds to grab on. The associate game director, Simon, shared that this move is a big deal for them as they must be “more thoughtful about creating interesting parkour highways.” Additionally, this allows them to have “more control about where Naoe can go and where Yasuke can’t,” adding more contrast to the play style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the developers have assured that most Assassin’s Creed Shadows areas are “very much climbable,” and even more so with the grappling hook. Players must look for “valid entry points from time to time.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>AT CES 2025, Microsoft VP of Next Generation Jason Ronald teased a refreshed user experience for Windows handheld gaming PCs: one that could combine the best aspects of its operating system and Xbox. While Windows 11 allows for more choice--users can access Steam, Epic Games Store, and several other marketplaces--it can be a chore to use because it is natively designed for PCs and laptops--not handheld systems with much smaller screens.</p><p>"We've been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it's really about how do we bring those innovations that we've incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space," Ronald said an AMD and Lenovo event (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>). "I would say it's bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together, because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it's really locked to the console. What we're doing is we're really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem."</p><p>Ronald explained that Microsoft aims to bring a console-like experience to handhelds and "make Windows great for gaming" on any device. Microsoft will have more details to share later in the year, Ronald said, adding that the idea is to move away from a Windows desktop setup on handhelds and toward a "gaming-centric" experience.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox chief Phil Spencer has candidly spoken about the idea of a Xbox handheld device for several month, and it has been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-working-on-xbox-handheld-prototypes-report/1100-6522128/" data-ref-id="1100-6522128">Microsoft is currently working on a prototype</a> that is still years away from being released.

                <p>Final Fantasy VII is among the most beloved entries in the series, but could there one day be another film adaptation? Final Fantasy producer Yoshinori Kitase said in an interview recently that, although nothing is "officially planned," he's aware of the game's appeal in Hollywood.</p><p>Kitase told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFpVyK1mOF0&amp;list=PL6131eG2y0-DzWByPNNy2G8sLe2EL12os&amp;index=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Danny Pena</a> that he's "seen and heard about various Hollywood directors and actors playing Final Fantasy VII, and many creators respect the title."</p><p>Kitase added: "I've been hearing things about creators out there who are very interested in the property who love the Final Fantasy 7 universe. And so, yeah, personally, I would love to see something come out of these creators in terms of a cinematic or some kind of visual piece."</p><p>However, he confirmed "no talks have been had" about making Final Fantasy VII into a Hollywood movie.</p><p>Square Enix has already launched a Final Fantasy VII movie, having released the 2005 anime Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Directed by veteran artist Tetsuya Nomura, the straight-to-DVD film takes place a couple years after the events of the game.</p><p>Before this, actor Robert Pattinson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tenet-stars-robert-pattinson-john-david-washington/1100-6481355/" data-ref-id="1100-6481355">Final Fantasy VII was one of his favorite video games, pointing out how it made him cry</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/arcanes-story-continues-in-this-five-minute-league-of-legends-animated-cinematic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Arcane fans have a five-minute animated treat to enjoy today, in the shape of a new story cinematic released by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> maker Riot Games. 
</p>
<p>
The video is primarily designed to showcase Noxus, the setting for League of Legends' new season which begins tomorrow, and the home of prominent character Mel Medarda.
</p>
<p>
But the video is simultaneously also a continuation of Mel's storyline from Arcane itself, and seems to set up what we may see next in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-cinematic-universe-to-expand-with-three-more-league-of-legends-animated-series">Arcane's upcoming Noxus-based continuation</a>. And if you need further reason to watch, the cinematic was created in partnership with Fortiche, the talented French animation house behind Arcane. Here it is:
</p>

<p>
First off, we can tell this is absolutely set after Arcane's second season due to Mel's new golden tattoos she acquires during its storyline. 
</p>
<p>
Here, we also get a proper look at LeBlanc, leader of the Black Rose group, who popped up within Arcane's second season but stayed largely disguised. She's seen here chatting with Vladimir, another League of Legends champion, about some unscrupulous-sounding plans for the Noxian empire.
</p><p>Following the conclusion of Arcane, showrunner Christian Linke confirmed the series would be followed by three additional shows featuring other locations within the League of Legends world. The first, set in Noxus, began production a year ago - and today's cinematic almost feels like a first trailer for that. Other series will then feature the regions of Demacia and Ionia.
</p>
<p>"We're really going wide, we're looking at every region and we really now have the ability to build a slate to tell many more stories - and continue some of them," Linke said previously.</p>
<p>If you haven't watched Arcane yet, it remains one of the best video game adaptations of all time and requires zero prior knowledge regarding League of Legends itself. Its first season is flawless, while its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">second was marred slightly from pacing issues due it cramming so many story threads in</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-film-gets-positive-update-more-than-10-years-after-its-director-was-first-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>10 years after he was first attached to the project, It and The Flash director Andrés Muschietti says he still has plans for Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> film adaptation.</p>
<p>The Shadow of the Colossus film has been, it is fair to say, a long time coming. We first got wind of an adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-in-works">all the way back in 2009</a>, when it was suggested that creator Fumito Ueda would be involved in some capacity. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-developing-shadow-of-the-colossus-movie">Chronicle director Josh Trank then joined the project in 2012</a>, but this still didn't seem to kick the film into any sort of gear. The following year, Sony then hired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-hires-hanna-writer-for-shadow-of-the-colossus-film">Hanna writer Seth Lochhead to pen the script for the adaptation</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014, it was then revealed Trank had left the project to head to a galaxy far, far away instead (nothing sinister, just Star Wars). At this time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-now-helmed-by-mama-director">Muschietti was announced to be taking over the reins from Trank</a>. But, like I said, that was in 2014. So, it has been over a decade since Muschietti was first brought on to direct the still non-existent Shadow of the Colossus film.</p>

</figure>
<p>And yet there is still hope, despite a very long period of absolutely no news whatsoever. Muschietti has now said he still has plans for the adaptation, and there is a script. In a conversation with programme <a href="https://youtu.be/Tugk5mzMHqM?t=2670">"La Baulera del Coso"</a> on Radio TU, Muschietti assured listeners the film was not "an abandoned project by any means" (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-is-alive-and-has-a-script/">TheGamer</a>).</p><p>"I'm not a big gamer, but Shadow of the Colossus seems to me a masterpiece and I played it several times," Muschietti said. "The film has been in development for 10 years and now the possibility of making it is opening up."</p>
<p>Muschietti stated he likes the project's script "very much", but admitted there were still a number of hurdles that needed to be sorted before the film could really get going. Namely, the financial side of things.</p>
<p>"Shadow of the Colossus is a cult game, but to make a good film, there is a studio that puts the numbers and says how much it is worth to give the director $200m, $150m, or $100m," he said. "There are different versions of the film, and obviously, I want them to give me $200m, but this is another factor to take into account."</p>
<p>So, I guess with this update, it is now a case of once again waiting to see if Muschietti gets the funds he hopes for, and then perhaps the Shadow of the Colossus adaptation will finally begin filming.</p>
<p>Shadow of the Colossus is not the only PlayStation IP currently slated for a film release. Just yesterday, the company announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">adaptations of both Helldivers 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn</a>. Meanwhile, its Until Dawn film is set to release this April, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">new cast of characters taking center stage in a brand new story</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first open beta <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">took place in November</a>&nbsp;and was so popular that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke Steam player count records</a> for the series, despite essentially being a playable demo. No wonder Capcom wants to hold a second beta test.</p>

<p>According to Capcom, this second beta is for players who "were unable to participate the first time or simply wish to play again", so if you did miss the first open beta, now's your chance to check it out once more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-second-open-beta-burning-room.jpg?itok=v8VFE1IO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-second-open-beta-burning-room.jpg?itok=c45ccVbn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A second&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta is coming in February.</figcaption></figure><p>As before, the beta will be held across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and it'll take place across two three-day periods. The first starts on February 7th and ends on the 10th, while the second runs between February 14th and 17th.</p>

<p>This second beta will contain all of the content featured in the first test, as well as the chance to take down the returning Gypceros monster, which made its last mainline appearance in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Generations</em>.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to create your character, remake it "as many times as you like", and even design your Palico companion. Naturally, character creation data will also carry over into the full version of the game, and you can use the character you made in the first beta as well.</p>

            <p>Last year’s annual CPU tug-of-war was cleanly won by AMD, its obscenely fast <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ryzen-9000x3d-processors-with-their-fancy-pants-cache-are-launching-november-7th">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> almost singlehandedly leaving Intel and their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-bets-on-efficiency-with-the-power-sipping-core-ultra-200s-series">Core Ultra</a> chips in a heap of mud and P.E.-spec rope. Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2025">CES 2025</a> hardware announcements.</p>
<p>No pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t bet against the Ryzen 9 9950X3D nabbing the Ryzen 7 9800X3D’s crown as the king of gaming CPUs, though whether it (and the Ryzen 9 9900X3D) are actually worth buying will surely come down to price. The 9800X3D is already a super-duper-premium part, and won’t stop bossing games just because something with 24MB more cache comes along, so it could feasibly remain the one to upgrade to if you don’t do the kind of multitasking or media work that would benefit from the added threads.</p><p>AMD’s new handheld processors, also unveiled at CES, are a more diverse bunch. In addition to the Ryzen Z2 and Ryzen Z2 Extreme – direct replacements for the Z1 chips powering handhelds like the Asus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">ROG Ally</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> – there’s also a Ryzen Z2 Go designed for cheaper portables. It’s this modest, 4 core/8 thread part that forms the brain of the $599 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-the-steamos-handheld-pc-that-isnt-a-steam-deck">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> that also got a CES reveal yesterday.</p>

<p>Curiously, these are a mishmash of various generations of AMD Zen CPU and RDNA graphics tech: the Ryzen Z2 Extreme combines Zen 3 and Zen 5c cores, as well as RDNA 3.5 integrated graphics, while the standard Z2 is built around RDNA 3. The Z2 Go relies on the even older RDNA 2, much like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>’s custom AMD APU, so it’ll be interesting to see how the three compare when actually running games. Just don’t expect that to happen on a new Deck version, as Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lf36y66ggs2b">Bluesky</a> to shut down rumours of a Z2-powered Steam Deck successor.</p>

<p>Also curious was the lack of detail AMD gave their other 'big' announcement, the first RDNA 4 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">GPUs</a>: the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. No specs, price, release window, nada. They exist. That’s your lot. It took a since-deleted Asus post (well caught, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amd-might-have-told-us-little-about-its-rdna-4-graphics-cards-but-at-least-we-know-the-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-have-16-gb-of-vram/">PCG</a>) to even let slip that they’d come with 16GB of VRAM.</p><p>And yet, this dearth of info didn’t stop AMD from letting our Ziff cousins at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-9070-benchmark">IGN</a> from testing out the RX 9070 on the show floor. In an Extreme-quality <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> benchmark at native 4K, it averaged 99fps, which IGN reckon puts it roughly on par with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review">GeForce RTX 4080 Super</a>. Not bad going, except the latter is being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-1999-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-makes-the-rest-of-the-rtx-50-series-look-suspiciously-sensible">replaced by the RTX 5080</a> at the end of this month, seemingly without significant price bump. As with pretty much of all of AMD’s CES reveals – interesting on paper yet light on performance specifics – we’ll have to wait and see how they do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Though available already in other regions prior to the film's release in December, in the UK the meals will be available from today until 18th February.</p>
<p>The included toy also differs. In the US the meals include a plastic character figure in a rolling wheel, while in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHenBg5IGyg">UK it's fabric balls with character faces</a>.</p>

			<p>At CES 2025, we learned that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-soc-priced-lower-than-legion-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> PC handheld will be the first officially licensed SteamOS-powered device not manufactured by Valve. There has been much speculation about whether and when SteamOS would officially move beyond the Steam Deck, and it's finally happening.</p>
<p>Valve itself&nbsp;<span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the subject in</span> a blog post, explaining that this will be the exact same version of SteamOS available on their own Steam Deck. A team is working to ensure everything will work just as well when the device ships. Moreover, Valve said that this work to support the Lenovo Legion Go S will also improve compatibility with other handhelds. Before this handheld ships on the market, Valve plans to ship a beta version of SteamOS that will improve the experience on other handhelds for users to download and test for themselves. The work will continue after the device's launch, too, as you would expect from Valve.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it seems like the Lenovo Legion Go S will have two variants, one without SteamOS and one with Valve's operating system. The former will be available later this month with the regular Windows, priced at $729.99 initially, although a configuration priced at $599.99 is expected to be available in May. That's also when the SteamOS version of the handheld is due to launch at an even cheaper of $499.99.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go S Windows Variant</figcaption></figure>
<p>The $729.99 version is the one equipped with the AMD RDNA 3-based Ryzen Z1 Extreme, which likely explains the higher price. The other two versions, either Windows or SteamOS, will feature the Lenovo-exclusive AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor, based on the old RDNA 2 GPU architecture. The price difference between Windows and SteamOS is likely due to licensing fees.</p>
<p>Other than that, the specifications should be the same: 8” WUXGA 16:10 120Hz PureSight touch display with Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support, up to 32GB of 7500Mhz LPDDR5X RAM, 3-cell 55.5Whr battery, two USB 4 ports, a microSD card reader, and WiFi6e support.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-does-the-blank-voucher-do-in-balatro.1076907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-the-blank-voucher-do-in-balatro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro’s Blank Voucher is a classic roguelike example of asking players to enter the unknown. The item appears to do nothing, offers zilch to a run, and wants to sap you of precious Store currency. So we’re here to dig into what the Blank Voucher is, what it does, and the real purpose behind its existence.</p>



<p>The beauty of a roguelike gameplay loop is each run differs—some more so than others. Balatro joins this <em>club</em>, shows <em>heart</em>, and is ultimately a <em>diamond </em>in the rough. Its endless array of Jokers and gameplay modifiers are why the indie title is our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Indie Game of 2024</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Community’s pick</a>.</p>



<p>Curiosity is a big aspect of your first few hours in Balatro. You add cards you don’t know the purpose of, and choose items that seem innocuous now but could be the difference between a failed run and a victory. The Blank Voucher epitomizes these traits, and I’ve got everything you need to know about the expensive Shop voucher.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-blank-voucher-in-balatro">What is the Blank Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So why should I buy it then? Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Blank Voucher is a $10 consumable added to your redeemed Vouchers once you purchase it from Balatro’s midround Shop.</strong></p>



<p>Complete any Small, Big, or Boss Blind in Balatro, and you’re taken to the Shop. You can spend your accumulated money on Jokers, Booster Packs, standalone cards, and Vouchers here. We’re taking a closer look at Vouchers, in particular, the Blank Voucher.</p>



<p>On its own, the Blank Voucher “Does nothing?” and is a little disconcerting as the eye-watering $10 fee could be better spent elsewhere. Balatro has a trick or two up its sleeve though to make the purchase worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-blank-voucher-do-in-balatro">What Does the Blank Voucher do in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>The Blank Voucher on its own has zero effects and offers nothing to a run</strong>, but if you <strong>buy it 10 times</strong> during different playthroughs, <strong>you unlock the Antimatter Voucher.</strong></p>



<p>You need to suffer for 10 runs buying the Blank Voucher knowing it provides no bonuses. It’s a meaningless, stagnant consumable designed to look pretty. Purchase it on 10 unique occasions, and you unlock the Antimatter Voucher.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-buy-blank-voucher-in-balatro">Should You Buy Blank Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>You should buy the Blank Voucher whenever you get the opportunity—unless you’re struggling on a run—as the Antimatter Voucher is an incredible item.</strong></p>



<p>I can tell you now the <strong>Antimatter Voucher is one of my favorites in the game</strong>. It gives you an <strong>extra, free Joker slot</strong> to use however you wish—with zero consequences. Whereas a Negative Joker gives you an extra slot in exchange for requiring the Negative Joker to remain in your possession, Antimatter is more liberating.</p>



<p>I don’t need to tell you how beneficial this is, but I will anyway. How many runs have you had where an additional Joker could help you beat the Ante 8 Boss Blind? You’ve got a couple of scaling Jokers, a plus-mult Joker, a times-mult Joker, and a Chip-boosting Joker, but the shop is offering another Rare Joker to push your score potential over the edge.</p>



<p>Antimatter gives you a lot more flexibility and firepower to stack Chips on Mults—or add Blind-beating modifiers. <strong>Always buy a Blank Voucher</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<p>Balatro’s addictiveness continues to consume me as the months go by. Are you still enjoying it? Also, what are your favorite Jokers to use?</p>

                <p>It's official: Valve's SteamOS will be available on more platforms soon, and the first handheld PC gaming device to adopt the operating system will be the new Lenovo Legion Go S. At CES 2025, it was revealed that the slim Lenovo unit will run on the Linux-based OS--, the same one used on Valve's Steam Deck.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4424121" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4424121"></a><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go S</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg"></figure><p>The big draw here is that SteamOS is more intuitive to use and better suited for smaller screens when compared to its Windows 11 counterparts. While you are losing out on the flexibility of being able to load games from multiple storefronts, SteamOS makes up for it by being quick and easy to use thanks to its design. Essentially, if you're looking for a pick-up-and-play handheld gaming PC that isn't a chore to use and you don't mind sticking to Steam, these new Lenovo devices could be perfect for you.</p><p>As for the new Lenovo model, the Legion Go S looks like it'll be a direct competitor to the Steam Deck thanks to several hardware changes. Most notable is that it won't offer Switch-like removable controllers, but it will keep the small trackpad found underneath the face buttons. These handhelds will be flexing some impressive power thanks to the new AMD Z2 Go chip. These will also be equipped with a 120Hz variable-refresh-rate display and customizable levers on the rear.</p><p>Lenovo will launch a $730 model equipped with a Windows OS, a 1TB SSD, and 32GB of RAM first, and another Windows OS version with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for $600 in May. The SteamOS Legion Go S is also planned to launch in May, and while exact hardware specs haven't been confirmed yet, we do know that it'll be priced at $500. Additionally, Valve will support it with SteamOS updates.</p>

            <p>Classic FM is launching a new video game music radio series presented by Minecraft YouTuber DanTDM.</p>
<p>Next Level with DanTDM launches on Saturday 11th January at 9pm for an hour, and will run each week until Easter.</p>
<p>The first episode will focus on legendary soundtracks from games such as The Legend of Zelda, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, The Elder Scrolls, and of course Minecraft.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/dantdm-next-level-video-game-music-series/">Classic FM</a> has championed video game music for quite some time, with entries in its Hall of Fame from 2012. It then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-fms-video-game-music-show-is-back-for-a-second-series-in-november">launched High Score in 2017</a>, a radio series presented by BAFTA-award-winning composer Jessica Curry, who also co-founded Everybody's Gone to the Rapture studio The Chinese Room.</p>
<p>It seems clear, though, the radio service is aiming for a younger audience with the hiring of Daniel Middleton, aka DanTDM.</p>
<p>The YouTuber has 29 million subscribers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5Oz6CHmeoF7vSad0qqXfw">his channel</a>, with more than 20bn views across his online content.</p>
<p>"Teenage me wouldn't be able to believe I have my own radio show!" he said. "Having studied music production at university and then worked in video games for the past 15 years, being given a show that celebrates the meeting of these two worlds feels totally surreal.</p>
<p>"Classic FM is such an iconic station and I'm really grateful and excited to have been given this opportunity."</p> <div>

<p>"Across three months, he will not only showcase the greatest video game music to our loyal listeners, but with Dan at the controls, we're looking forward to welcoming VGM fans to Classic FM for the first time too," added Classic FM managing editor Philip Noyce. "We have always championed new forms of classical music, from film scores to gaming soundtracks, so I'm pleased to announce this next chapter in our support of video game music."</p><p>DanTDM has recently been involved with charity work, <a href="https://x.com/dantdm/status/1859288096098898244">donating gaming carts to Great Ormond Street Hospital</a> for Children. Additionally, he's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV-DiKWne8s">admitted he was invited to see the set of the Minecraft film</a>, with some fans speculating he has some form of cameo.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-second-trailer-brings-deep-steve-lore-tree-punching-square-bee">Minecraft film's second trailer</a> released in November, with the full film launching on 4th April this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-us-just-added-worlds-biggest-games-publisher-tencent-to-their-list-of-chinese-military-companies">reported</a> that the US federal government had placed Chinese video game publisher Tencent - owner of League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear and much more besides - on a list of Chinese military companies. The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.</p>
<p>At the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a "misunderstanding". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.</p><!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf">statement in full</a> is rather robotic, and mostly just fleshes out the spokesperson's previous argument that Tencent is not, in fact, involved with anything military. It further argues that Tencent is not a "military-civil fusion", in response to the US defence department's <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4023145/dod-releases-list-of-chinese-military-companies-in-accordance-with-section-1260/">standing claim</a> that China's armed forces rely on "technology and expertise" provided by Chinese "companies, universities and research programs" that "appear to be civilian entities".</p>
<p>"As the Company is neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base, it believes that its inclusion in the [Chinese Military Company] List is a mistake," the statement reads. "Unlike other lists maintained by the U.S. Government for sanctions or export control measures, inclusion in the CMC List relates only to U.S. defense procurement, which does not affect the business of the Group."</p><p>The statement also specifies that the "CMC list" - which was introduced under the first Trump presidency, and is known inside the US government as the Section 1260H list - is distinct from another document, the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex List, maintained by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control. The point being that "inclusion in the CMC List will not prohibit any persons (other than the Department of Defense) from business dealings with the Company, including transacting in the securities of the Company".</p>
<p>Tencent are about "to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake", during which they "will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the Company from the CMC List."</p>
<p>If it comes to a lawsuit, Tencent won't be the first Chinese company to go to court over their inclusion on the US federal government's list of "military-civil fusions". As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-adds-tencent-catl-list-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military-2025-01-06/">Reuters</a>, drone maker DJI and Lidar maker Hesai Technologies sued the Pentagon last year over their designations, though they're still on the list for the moment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony's upcoming Until Dawn film adaptation will feature both a new cast of characters and a new story.</p>
<p>This titbit was shared during a presentation at CES by Sony's president of film division Screen Gems Ashley Brucks, who stated that while the film would - clearly - be different in some ways to the original Until Dawn game, it would still respect the series' source material.</p>
<p>"The key to [successfully] adapting these games comes down to one thing: respecting the source material," Brucks said (transcribed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-features-a-new-story-and-cast-of-characters">IGN</a>). "Our close collaboration with PlayStation Productions gives us and our filmmakers the advantage of working directly with the creators of the game."</p>
<p>The Sony exec said it was a "careful balance of trying to identify and incorporate what the fans love about the game and the experience as well as offering something fresh and exciting to entice newcomers".</p>
<p>"In adapting Until Dawn, filmmaker David F. Sandberg, who is a big fan of the widely acclaimed game, took the essence of what makes the game great and selected elements we think are the most important to the fans and paid homage to it in the right way," Brucks continued. "We then built out Until Dawn's universe, using the core premise of a group of friends who encounter a variety of terrifying threats to tell a new story that is truly visceral and horrifying."</p>

<p>Actor Peter Stromare, who is said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-sees-peter-stormare-reprise-his-role-as-dr-hill">reprising his role as psychiatrist Dr Hill in Until Dawn's adaptation (so, perhaps there is at least one returning character after all)</a>, added the film will "honour the spirit of the game".</p><p>"I have been lucky to be part of Until Dawn since the original, incredible, super terrifying game, and what's why I'm so excited to be part of this film, because the whole thing is a love letter to horror, and it completely honours the spirit of the game," Stormare said.</p>
<p>"The movie is going to be full of fresh characters and victims in a brand new story loaded with twists, so whether you're a longtime fan or discovering it for the first time, get ready for Until Dawn like you've never seen it before."</p>
<p>The Until Dawn film is set to arrive later this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-horror-until-dawns-live-action-movie-adaptation-arrives-next-april">on 25th April</a>.</p>
<p>As for the game itself, the recently released PS5 remake introduced a new ending for Until Dawn, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel">which hints towards a sequel</a> (please be aware of story spoilers for Until Dawn if you follow the link).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-games-can-expect-to-lose-80-of-their-expected-premium-sales-on-xbox-consoles.1076868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Games available on the Xbox Game Pass can expect to lose around 80% of their expected premium sales on Xbox consoles, although being available as part of the subscription can be beneficial for some of them.</p>
<p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A session hosted on the <a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/news-publisher/industry-q-a-christopher-dring-answers-your-questions.37/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Install Base forums</a>, former head of GamesIndustry.biz Chris Dring revealed some interesting tidbits on sales of games available on Xbox Game Pass, saying that any game can expect to lose around 80% of its expected premium sales on Xbox, less if it is a big mainstream release. How low Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, and even Starfield have charted makes it clear how Game Pass hurt the sales of these games on Xbox consoles. Being available on Xbox Game Pass, however, can also be beneficial for multiplatform games, as a surge of players on Xbox can have a strong impact on sales on PlayStation.</p>
<p>While a game being available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library can lead to lost sales, it can also make it easier for developers to get people to try out their game. Chris Dring highlighted that, from data, it is known that a lot of people only play the Call of Duty series, and if some of them got the game via the Xbox Game Pass this year, they might have tried another game available on the subscription service they may otherwise never have played. Unfortunately, this may be a best-case scenario, as the limited growth of subscription services and the existence of big free games that are hundreds of hours long makes it unlikely.</p>
<p>While Microsoft never made it clear, it's evident from the company's marketing messaging and some of its latest decisions, such as the first major changes introduced to the service <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">last year </a>since its launch, that the Xbox Game Pass is impacting their console business. According to well-known analyst Mat Piscatella, the company's approach to its subscription service needs to be balanced with its other services, and the aforementioned changes introduced last year suggest that this is what Microsoft is attempting to do. Balancing the service and further expanding on other systems, according to the analyst, could make Xbox's future <a href="https://wccftech.com/analyst-reckons-xbox-has-a-bright-future-according-to-sales-data/">bright.</a></p>

            <p>God-wrecking MOBA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite-2">Smite 2</a> is going free-to-play next week after four months of paid early access. The game of omniscient deities scrapping over lanes and minions has been playable since September last year by early bird "founders" willing to pay some bucks (it had plenty of closed alphas since May too) but now it's finally opening up to the rest of us mere mortals. And it's throwing in a new "god" too, the genie-toting thief Aladdin. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It'll be free-to-play from Jan 14th, say developers Hi-Rez in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2437170/view/525331314946081986">a Steam post</a>. There'll be 45 playable gods, including the fresh addition of the thief from One Thousand And One Nights. Aladdin can trap enemy players in his lamp where they'll have to fight both the pilferer and his genie (you can read <a href="https://www.smite2.com/news/aladdin-closer-look/">more about his skills here</a> if you like). Other characters to be added in the free-to-play update include Mulan, Geb, Ullr, and Agni - all gods returning from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite">Smite</a>.</p>
<p>The usual many-laned Conquest mode will be there to induce many a teamfuss. But it'll also be adding a few extra game modes. Joust is a 3v3 single lane mode, for example, while Duel mode is a one-on-one scenario. Assault mode is also returning from the previous game, and is "similar to the regular conquest mode, but instead features a single lane and no jungle."</p>
<p>Lacking in Smite wisdom, we placed freelance offerings at the shrine of Matt Cox (RPS in peace) and he blessed us with his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/smite-2-early-access-review">early access Smite 2 review</a>. He thought it was okay, but noted that the supreme beings of Hi-Rez' pantheon have to compete with the agile and exciting heroes of Valve's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>. And the comparison does not make Thor et al look as godly as they might like to think. </p>
<blockquote>I haven’t spent a single second wishing I wasn’t playing Deadlock instead. Valve’s third-person MOBA shooter has emerged with wildly unfortunate timing for Hi-Rez, rendering me incapable of not dwelling on how it innovates where Smite stagnates. Smite sells itself as the MOBA where every shot’s a skillshot, but Deadlock is the MOBA where every shot is an actual shot, comboed with a sprinting dodge-jump into a powerslide.</blockquote>
<p>It's god eat god out there in the MOBA realms, my friends. Meanwhile, Hi-Rez are not shutting down Smite 1, they say, but their attention has shifted heavily to the sequel. In October, the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-rez-studios-lay-off-unknown-number-of-workers-to-give-smite-2-a-sustainable-future">laid off a number of workers</a>, leaving only small teams to work on "light updates" for both Smite 1 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paladins">Paladins</a>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has responded to a damning report of mental and physical abuse at Indonesian support studio Brandoville.</p>
<p>The studio provided assistance to Ubisoft on the forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, though it closed in August last year, after which reports of abuse emerged.</p>

<p>Yesterday a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horrific-abuse-of-workers-at-indonesian-external-development-studio-revealed-in-new-report">report from People Make Games detailed allegations of abuse by Brandoville commissioner Kwan Cherry Lai</a>, who ran day-to-day operations of the studio.</p>
<p>Before its closure, the studio provided art and animation support for games like Assassin's Creed Shadows and Age of Empires 4.</p>
<p>However, reports allege from 2019 to the studio's closure in 2024, Lai abused multiple employees. This ranged from imposing a strict work schedule and daily Christian worship, to forcing an employee to write lines like a schoolchild, humiliating her in front of colleagues, and demanding a video of her slapping herself a hundred times as punishment.</p>
<p>Other abuse includes controlling the finances of employees and overworking a pregnant employee, whose prematurely born son sadly died after four months in intensive care.</p>
<p>You can watch the full report in the video above, though be aware it contains harrowing content and footage.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has also contacted Age of Empires publisher Microsoft, though a response is yet to be issued.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch next month, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">delay in November</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While Nintendo seems content to wait some more before announcing the Nintendo Switch 2, accessories manufacturers aren't pleased about the system still being kept under wraps, and some have started revealing more about the highly anticipated console.</p>
<p>Accessories manufacturer Genki is showcasing its Nintendo Switch 2 accessories lineup at CES 2025, and reputable French publication <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1877968-la-nintendo-switch-2-se-devoile-en-avant-premiere-au-ces-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Numerama</a> had the chance to check out a mock-up of the system reportedly based on a real system the manufacturer owns and how the new magnetic Joy-Con controllers work. The new mock-up also confirms a bigger size over the original console and a second USB-C port on the top of the console.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="fr">VIDEO — La Nintendo Switch 2 en avant-première au <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2025</a>.</p>
<p>L'accessoiriste Genki indique posséder la vraie console et expose une maquette 3D + des accessoires.</p>
<p>Les détails ici : <a href="https://t.co/5LDlnR2zC1">https://t.co/5LDlnR2zC1</a> <a href="https://t.co/IJ6taQggIQ">pic.twitter.com/IJ6taQggIQ</a></p>
<p>— Numerama (@Numerama) <a href="https://twitter.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Following the report from Numerama, Genki decided to go all-in with the early Nintendo Switch 2 reveal by adding a short video on its <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/pages/ns2_accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> showcasing the full unit and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-dock-60w-charger/">dock</a>. While there's no way to verify if everything is indeed based on the real system or on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">other mock-ups</a>, there's a solid chance the video is showing the real console, given how pretty much everything about it is leaking online.</p>
<p>Genki isn't the only Nintendo Switch 2 accessories manufacturer showing its upcoming products during CES 2025, and Numerama spoke with some of them, who all seem to agree that the system will launch in April. According to some of these manufacturers, it is possible to even purchase the console already on the black market, which, as Numerama highlights, sounds like a bold claim considering nothing has leaked regarding software.</p>
<p>With new leaks and rumors sprouting like mushrooms almost daily, the only thing that is left is for Nintendo to finally announce the Nintendo Switch 2. When the reveal will happen not even these chatty manufacturers know, but with all these daily leaks, it shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>In a fairly exciting case of two major industry stories meeting in the middle, former members of downfallen indie publisher Annapurna Interactive have reportedly joined forces to take control of several game projects previously published by Take-Two Interactive's label Private Division, which has itself been sold off amid layoffs. The game projects in question include the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> series and an unannounced project from Pokémon developer Game Freak.</p>
<p>That's from a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division">Bloomberg</a> article (paywall), helpfully summarised by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-annapurna-interactive-staff-acquire-take-two-s-private-division-label">Game Developer</a>. To give you the backstory here, Annapurna Interactive are a division of fancy-dan auteur-driven media company Annapurna Pictures, known for films like Zero Dark Thirty and American Hustle. Founded in 2016, the Interactive label are the publishers of such acclaimed smaller game projects as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kentucky-route-zero">Kentucky Route Zero</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sayonara-wild-hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>. Notwithstanding the critical success of these projects, there have long been tensions between Annapurna Pictures leadership and the gaming division. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resign-following-dispute-with-owner">entire staff of Annapurna Interactive resigned in September 2024</a>, after the failure of negotiations to spin the label off as a separate company.</p>
<p>Then, in November, Take-Two announced that they would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/take-two-are-selling-private-division-and-closing-roll7-and-intercept-because-theyre-in-the-business-of-making-great-big-hits">sell Private Division</a>, while also confirming the closure of OlliOlli World devs Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 devs Intercept Games. Private Division are comparable to Annapurna Interactive in publishing "mid-tier" games like Rollerdrome and After Us, that have a particular combination of artsy-experimental and blockbuster polish - the broad idea being to enhance Take-Two's prestige as a publisher of innovative work and establish revenue streams beyond the vast empires of Rockstar and 2K Games. Or at least, that's my impression, based on years of preview events.</p>
<p>It's the kind of venture that gets chopped when the old "economic headwinds" are a-blowing and investors aren't seeing desired returns, even when the operation is making money. "The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well," Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick observed back in November. "However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we're in the business of making great big hits."</p><p>Which brings us to today. According to Bloomberg, a new, currently unnamed team of former Annapurna Interactive staff have struck a deal with private equity firm Haveli, the new owners of Private Division, to take control of several Private Division projects and franchises.</p>
<p>The deal doesn't cover everything Private Division were working on at the time of their sale. For example, it doesn't include two new projects from Yellow Brick Games and Bloober Team, which Private Division were to publish: Yellow Brick will self-publish their game, while Bloober's deal with Private Division has been fully dissolved. As for what remains of Annapurna Interactive, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactive-has-splintered-into-two-groups-both-of-which-are-now-working-to-pick-up-the-pieces-says-new-report">Annapurna executives are now hiring staff</a> so they can follow through on existing obligations.</p>
<p>I have a lot of love for Annapurna Interactive's line-up, particularly The Outer Wilds, and am happy to see a few of the people involved with those projects striking up afresh under a different banner. I hope the former Private Division members who've lost their jobs as part of the sale have similar success elsewhere. I am also curious to hear about the new Game Freak game, though given Game Freak's heavy association with Nintendo, I wouldn't be surprised if it was exclusively for consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>There’s a good bit for Xbox fans in this set of five Most Wanted 2025 games, with a pair of exclusives that are coming from Compulsion Games and Playground Games respectively. Sure, we might have doubts about whether they’ll stay as exclusives for very long, these days, but they should be a good reason to pick up an asymmetrical gamepad… or boot up your gaming PC.</p>
<h2>20 – Dying Light: The Beast</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>Morphing out of the DLC plans for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-2/">Dying Light 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> has grown into a standalone game, bringing back the fan favourite protagonist from the original game, Kyle Crane. It’s been thirteen years since we last saw him, and he’s now exploring the post-apocalyptic Castor Woods, a region filled with both human factions and monsters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azIBRaiB05I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Kyle himself is no longer truly human, the zombie DNA fully merging with his own to provide some major new powers – he is the titular Beast, if you hadn’t guessed.</p>

<p>We got to go hands on back at Gamescom 2024, and you can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane/">check out our preview impressions here</a>.</p>
<h2>19 – Two Point Museum</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 4th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Having revolutionised healthcare and teaching across Two Point County, where to next for this tongue-in-cheek management sim series? Well, why not dust some old bones and tomes in the museums of this world? Also… ghosts?</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum Preview – We played the&nbsp;Prehistory, Marine Life &amp; Supernatural museums" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLbM27hYcsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Two Point Museum is bringing plenty of new ideas to the table, as you build out museums around each theme, soak in all of the pun-laden artefacts and beings that you can exhibit, and curate entertaining tours to inform and enlighten your visitors… and convince them to toss a coin into your donation pitcher.</p>
<p>We’ve played the opening few levels and had a grand time digging into the new setting. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/03/two-point-museum-preview-dino-bones-funny-fishies-spooky-spectres/">Read our Two Point Museum preview here</a>.</p>
<h2>18 – South of Midnight</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Coming from Compulsion Games, the makers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/09/we-happy-few-review/">We Happy Few</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a> looks to be something rather different, whisking us away to the fantasy world of Prospero and confronting our heroine Hazel with giant sea monsters.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Weaving Hazel's Journey: A South of Midnight Documentary" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLBOyKqw58A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game features an almost claymation visual style, blending together action adventure exploration with Bayonetta-style combat. The world blends together vibes of the deep south of America with giant, island-sized alligators and more, which you’ll come across after a hurricane has ripped across this world.</p>
<h2>17 – Civilization VII</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, NSW, PC – 11th February 2025</em></p>
<p>There’s been a good few pretenders to the throne emerging over the last few years, but Civilization VII is arriving in just over a month to firmly put its stamp on the historical 4X genre once more.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game will tackle the concept of shifting ages, just as the genre as a whole has been. Split into three distinct ages – Antiquity, Exploration and Modern – each civ is restricted to a particular time period and then has to grow and morph into another through a point of crisis. Rome will eventually fall, but that can provide the historical and gameplay foundations to become any number of medieval empires – the Holy Roman Empire, perhaps? – and from there lead into modern European nations.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/hands-on-civilization-vii-preview-one-for-the-ages/">hands on with Civ VII back at Gamescom 2024</a>, as well as having the opportunity to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/interview-ed-beach-on-civilization-vii-ages-diplomacy-security-blankets/">speak with Creative Director Ed Beach</a> about this major new direction for the series.</p>
<h2>16 – Fable</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>We’re putting a lot of trust in Playground Games and Xbox with this one. It’s been years since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/23/fable-xbox-series-x-pc-announce-reveal/">the formal announcement of Fable in 2020</a>, which had already been long-rumoured to be in the works, and every occasional reappearance at Xbox showcases has been heavily reliant on lusciously produced cinematics and an understated British sense of humour, rather than gameplay. Still, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fable">Fable</a> is supposedly on track for release in 2025.</p>

<p>To be charitable, the most recent trailer from last June does state that it’s “in-game footage” and shift between clips that could be representative of in-game dialogue scenes and wandering through the environments, building up to some quick shots of combat. It does look very, very pretty, as the baton is passed from the now retired hero Humphry to a new hero.</p>
<p>One we want to see much, much more of, and which we’d expect is coming later, rather than sooner. There’s other big first party Xbox games expected before then!</p>

<p><em>That’s not the half of it for Xbox and PC gamers this year, with more exclusives still to come as we approach the top 10.</em></p>
