Once there, the team splits into two groups as they make their way through the mission. Rook leads one group while you have to make the call between whether Davrin or Harding will lead the second team. This will take them out of your party selection for the duration of the mission and you’ll see them throughout the assault guiding the rest of your party and helping you from time to time. All of this culminates in a final fight with the elven god <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chappell-roan-saturday-night-live-snl-outfit-dragon-age-1851687610&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chappell-roan-saturday-night-live-snl-outfit-dragon-age-1851687610">Ghilan’nain</a></span>, who nearly kills Rook in the scrap. However, the leader of the second team will create an opening to deal a killing blow to the god, only to be impaled by her and left to fall seemingly to their death.</p><p><strong>If you came here looking for a way to save Harding or Davrin, I’m sorry to report that it’s impossible</strong>. This isn’t a <em>Mass Effect 2</em> Suicide Mission moment, it’s an original <em>Mass Effect </em>Virmire decision. Harding and Davrin’s lives are mutually exclusive and whichever one you choose to lead the team will die by the end of the assault…presumably. When you return to the Lighthouse base, you can go to their respective rooms and examine some of their belongings. Rook will mention that there was “no trace” of whoever sacrificed themself for the cause, which could give BioWare an out to bring either character back in a future game. But whatever <em>Dragon Age </em>does in the future, <strong>you will lose Harding or Davrin for the remainder of the game</strong>, and if you romanced them you won’t see the culmination of that relationship.</p><p>There’s also another similar decision you make between Bellara and Neve that results in the character you choose getting captured by the elven gods. To be as spoiler-light as I can, I’ll just say you will be able to save them later in the game, but they will not rejoin your active party. So it’s not all bad!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s only fitting that NieR: Automata, one of the titles that inspired Stellar Blade initially, would enjoy a crossover with the action-packed PlayStation 5 exclusive. Directors Kim Hyung Tae and Yoko Tara, two long-time video game developers with deep respect for each other, join forces to bring console fans a collaboration unlike any other.</p>



<p>How does the NieR: Automata DLC work in Stellar Blade? According to the recent announcement, Emil from Emil’s Shop in NieR appears in Stellar Blade, selling eleven collab-specific items that somehow help combine both game worlds. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On top of the NieR: Automata DLC, Stellar Blade also receives a photo mode on November 20. The game’s upcoming photo mode allows you to pause the action at any point, snapping screenshots of Eve in various poses, expressions, landscapes, and even battle scenes for the ultimate action shot.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There seems to be a brand-new side quest in the game that teaches you how to utilize the photo mode and rewards you with money and items upon completion. It’s an excellent way to introduce the mechanic and spark creativity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, on the same day as the photo mode and NieR: Automata DLC—November 20—a patch will launch simultaneously that includes additional appearance cosmetics, lip-sync language support, additional songs for camp, character customization, new battle mechanics, like auto-targeting and ballistics correction, and more!</p>

Set against the cold, industrial backdrop of the City of Ge’shan—a place echoing the faded glory of once-thriving industrial towns—the narrative unfolds as a romantic yet serious story infused with dark undertones and surreal twists. Using a delicate, richly-detailed pixel art style, the game brings every shadowed alley and forgotten corner of Ge’shan to life, as the protagonist unravel its strange mysteries one clue at a time.</p><p>The story revolves around a complex missing person case. Meet a cast of characters as diverse and worn as the city itself, and chase down leads that blurs the boundaries between reality and the paranormal. Uncover urban legends, and maybe even dive into some absurd extraterrestrial tales. Original music, vivid animations, and nostalgic mini-games enrich the journey across a decaying town on the brink of change. Along the way, witness the struggles of the townsfolk, catching glimpses of transformation—and perhaps even redemption.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>
The Rise of the Golden Idol - the standalone sequel to 2022's widely acclaimed deductive adventure The Case of the Golden Idol - launches tomorrow, 12th November (14th November on Switch, due to an "unexpected delay"), and ahead of its arrival, developer Color Gray Games has shared a post-launch roadmap promising four bits of paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
The Rise of the Golden Idol, if you're unfamiliar, takes the murder-mystery sleuthing formula of its predecessor and shifts it from the 18th Century to the 1970s. Here, players must solve 20 cases of "crime, death and depravity", all somehow connected by the now-lost Idol of the title, in an "age of hallucinogens, disco, fax machines and parapsychology".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Katharine Castle called The Rise of the Golden Idol a "compelling modern mystery thriller that's bigger, better and more ambitious than its already brilliant predecessor" in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review">four star review</a>, praising some "wonderfully devised puzzles that really give your brain a good runaround before you're able to prise open its hard-won secrets". And Color Gray Games has now revealed there's even more to look forward to following its release.

<p>
As detailed by the studio <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2716400/view/4478360632965464065?l=english">on Steam</a>, The Rise of the Golden Idol will receive four self-contained DLC Investigations throughout 2025, each telling a standalone story featuring "at least" four cases. "These are optional side content and are not required to conclude the story in The Rise of the Golden Idol," it explains in its announcement. "Rather, these are for fans who want more puzzles, more characters, and more mysteries to solve." 
</p><p>
The first of these Investigations, titled The Sins of New Wells, launches in "Q1" next year, and sees players following Detective Roy Samson through four new cases as he deals with an organised crime syndicate plaguing the city. "Drugs, death, and ancient Lemurian magic will make the headlines," teases Color Grey Games. Two more DLC releases are scheduled for "Q2" 2025, with a fourth and final on due in "Q3".
</p>
<p>
The Rise of the Golden Idol is set to cost $19.99 USD (with a 10 percent launch discount) when it arrives for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and Steam this week, but mobile users can play as part of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> subscription. Each DLC release will be priced at $5.99, and all four post-launch chapters are included in a $17.99 Detective Pass, which also throws in the complete Golden Idol soundtrack. Color Gray Games notes there's also a permanent stacking discount for The Case of the Golden Idol owners, meaning they'll be able to get the follow-up and all future content "even cheaper". And if you're the try before you buy sort, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2716400/The_Rise_of_the_Golden_Idol/">Steam demo's available now</a>.

			<p>Today, Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1856003986601496823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Spyro Reignited Trilogy will be available on Game Pass starting tomorrow across all tiers, including the base Game Pass Standard (previously known as Xbox Live Gold).</p>
<p>Insider extas1s <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a rumor that the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy would join Game Pass in August. We're three months later, but the little dragon's remastered adventures are finally here. The game collection was originally released six years ago for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and our Francesco De Meo showered it with praise, except for some technical issues:</p>
<p><em>The Spyro Reignited Trilogy doesn't just play great but also looks great. Graphics have been redone from scratch, and they make the game almost look like a Pixar movie, with excellent animations and colorful, detailed locations. Sadly, performance isn't as great. The game runs at 30 FPS on the original PlayStation 4 model, and there are some evident frame pacing issues. The frame rate also drops here and there, so the experience isn't always too smooth. The soundtrack can also be a bit hit and miss, especially the dynamic soundtrack, but it's also possible to play through the game with the original music from the PlayStation games. Voice acting, on the other hand, is spot on at all times.</em></p>
<p><em>With the&nbsp;Spyro Reignited Trilogy, Toys for Bob and Activision have shown how a proper remaster should be developed. All three games are incredibly faithful to the original releases, and the few additions make everything here and better. If it weren't for the technical issues plaguing the collection, the&nbsp;Spyro Reignited Trilogy would probably be the best remaster ever released so far.</em></p>
<p>Those problems shouldn't be too prevalent on the way more powerful Xbox Series S|X and PC hardware where Game Pass users will check out the trilogy, though.</p>

This will also include a return to the 6v6 rule set, two-tank role queue player compositions, and the no-limit mode that lets you play whatever characters you want without any restriction. This will also bring some old maps like the two-point capture maps Hanamura, Temple of Anubis, and Volskaya Industries back into rotation. Check out the trailer below:</p><p>According to Blizzard’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post on the event</a></span>, this is “separate” from the team’s broader 6v6 plans, as it will focus primarily on the original hero roster, rather than all the characters who have been added since. I didn’t start playing <em>Overwatch </em>until 2019, so some of this will be new to me, such as there being four roles instead of the current three. Some of the abilities seen in the trailer, like Symettra having six turrets, are things I only know by reputation, so this will be a way to fill a hole in my <em>Overwatch </em>experience.</p><p>Admittedly, I don’t think this does much for me, given that my big problems with <em>Overwatch 2 </em>are largely about its failure to deliver things like the story missions and generate any plot momentum, rather than about pining for the <em>Overwatch </em>of old. But if this gives me a reason to play the game with some regularity over the next few weeks and brings friends who won’t play <em>Overwatch 2 </em>with me back, that’s a net win, I suppose.</p><p><em>Overwatch 2</em> is currently in its 13th season, which features a Halloween-themed battle pass and a Widowmaker mythic skin. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-gets-a-new-gameplay-deep-dive-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>MachineGames has released a new deep dive gameplay trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, with the archeological adventure set to launch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-is-coming-to-ps5-but-only-after-xbox-and-pc-december-release/">3rd December, and on PS5 in spring 2025</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gameplay Deep Dive - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ik6WEckZKh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>MachineGames Audio Director, Pete Ward, guides us on this tour through the first person action adventure. While there’s some new clips and things to see, it’s fair to say that this video covers a fair bit of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview-action-puzzles-exploration-disguises/">familiar ground from previous trailers,</a> including the figure of Tony Todd as a mysterious and very imposing antagonist right at the start of the game – who sadly passed away age 69 last week, making this game a posthumous appearance – and the companion character, photojournalist Gina, who teams up with Indy on the chase after Emmerich Voss who’s on a global hunt for otherworldly artefacts.</p>
<p>Indy has a camera of his own, using it to take photos of the world as you adventure, potentially getting clues from Indy as you do so. This fills in Indy’s journal, which will track the adventure so far and all the clips. You might also have to get your Agent 47 on with some disguises to get into restricted areas.</p>

<p>I got to go hands on with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle last month, and had a rather good time. Playing in first person (with a few snippets of third person) might be different from what you’d expect, given that Indiana Jones inspired the likes of Tomb Raider and Uncharted, but it works. I said, “I’m rather keen to see how this full adventure comes together. MachineGames are taking a less obvious path, but that’s going to lead to a much more individual and distinctive game and journey. And if you’re going to trust anyone to make a game that’s a lot to do with beating up fascists, it’s probably them!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-vote-charizard-ex-best-card-in-the-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> players have voted Charizard ex the best card in the game, with his meta game rival Mewtwo ex coming in a close second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An IGN poll asked players which of 10 popular cards was the most popular and, with 20.8% of more than 1,000 votes, Charizard ex took the crown. This Stage 2 Pokémon has the highest damage attack in the game, with Crimson Storm's 200 power able to take down any other card in a single shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex is extra powerful because of fellow fire type Moltres ex though. This card lets the player flip three coins and add a fire energy to a bench Pokémon for every heads, so players use it to overload a Charmander, Charmeleon, and eventually Charizard on the bench so it's not impacted by the loss of two energy when using Crimson Storm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second best card in Pokémon TCG Pocket, as per our player poll, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">the biggest rival of Charizard ex at the top of the meta</a>: Mewtwo ex. It came in at just a touch below with 20.1% of votes, so the two are practically neck and neck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewtwo ex works in a similar way as Charizard ex, though as a basic Pokémon itself, players will often put it directly into the active Pokémon slot. It also has a two energy, 50 damage attack, and 150 hit points to keep it around and doing damage, meaning players have enough time to set up a Gardevoir on the bench.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Stage 2 Pokémon takes some time to set up, with Ralts and Kirlia coming before it, but once it's on the bench, players can use its Psy Shadow ability to add one energy to the active Pokémon. This again counters the discard two energy cost of Mewtwo's 150 damage attack, as the standard energy joins the Gardevoir energy each turn to add two at a time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex came Pikachu ex in third place, with 17% of votes, and in fourth place, but way below, came Starmie ex.

<p>Australia is looking to pass legislation that could have a major impact as to who has access to what video games and online services in the near future. </p>



<p>The country’s government is working on a plan to ban access to social media for anyone under the age of 16. While it’s targeted to social media, the new law could severely impact access to online video games and gaming networks. </p>



<p>The act doesn’t specifically call out online gaming services, the definition of what constitutes social media could allow for that implication. According to the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2021A00076/latest/text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Online Safety Act</a>, social media service is defined as a an “electronic service” that meets these conditions:</p>



<ul>
<li>The sole or primary purpose of the service is to enable online social interaction between two or more end users</li>



<li>The service allows end users to link to, or interact with, some or all of the other end users</li>



<li>The service allows end users to post material on the service.</li>
</ul>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed that services like Xbox, Steam, PlayStation Network, Roblox, Fortnite, and others would be caught up in the litigation, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-08/how-the-age-minimum-for-social-media-will-work/104571790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it’s obvious that they could</a> fall into the category based on the definition provided. </p>



<p>The enforcement of this new legislation wouldn’t begin for at least another year as traditional social media companies and any others involved work to create a way to enforce the limit on their platforms. According to the Australian government, the companies would be help responsible for underage users on their platform, not the end users themselves.</p>



<p>It’s worth nothing that Australia hasn’t specifically mentioned video games as being a part of the restrictions. It does say, however, that other conditions can be set to determine what qualifies as a “social media service”. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, this is a situation to keep an eye on, especially for those in Australia.</p>

		<p>Crowbar Collective, the creative team behind the Half Life remake Black Mesa, has announced with Team 17 its new rogue-lite tactical co-op shooter. This new game is called Rogue Point, and it is set in a word where the world conglomerates wage war against each other after the passing of the world’s richest CEO.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rogue Point | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFQvOaxl6lk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In this corporate war, players are not one of the many groups employed by these conglomerates. Instead, players form up a team of independent vigilantes who go after these mercenary groups, known as MERX, in attempt to bring an end the power struggle between the corporations.</p>
<p>Ann Hurley, General Manager, Team17 Digital, said, “<em>Team17 has had amazing success in the shooter genre and we’re delighted to offer another incredible title in that space by teaming up with FPS veterans,</em><em>&nbsp;Crowbar Collective. We’ve seen the high quality they brought to Black Mesa and together we know Rogue Point will take things to the next level.”</em></p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;CEO and Project Lead Adam Engels said, “<em>We’re very excited to share that we have partnered with Team 17 for our upcoming co-op shooter,&nbsp;Rogue&nbsp;Point. We cannot wait to go in depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new IP (as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full time development studio). We can’t thank Team 17 enough for their support and expertise. Just like Black Mesa, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of&nbsp;Black Mesa&nbsp;and having Team 17 as a partner for&nbsp;Rogue Point&nbsp;helps us focus on development and community feedback!</em>”</p>

<p>Rogue Point’s campaign will be dynamic so no playthrough will be the same, due to how the mission structures and designs change. The missions themselves are set in four different locations. Players will be able to equip various types of weapons and equipment, along with campaign modifiers which all add to the dynamism of Rogue Point. Changing weapons and equipment will be necessary as different MERX groups are divided into classes with their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>At the moment, it appears Rogue Point is on PC via Steam only and a release date is to be confirmed.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-unreal-engine-5-better/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-can-handle-unreal-engine-5-way-better-than-base-model-new-video-highlights.1032660/</guid>

			<p>The PS5 Pro seems way more capable of handling the demanding Unreal Engine 5 than the base model, as the system runs the demo that first showed what sort of visuals the engine can deliver much better than any other console currently on the market.</p>
<p>As shown in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cycu1</a>, The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5 demo runs considerably better on the newly released system than on the base system without a dedicated patch that would allow the demo to take full advantage of the PS5 Pro's power and features. Resolution changing to keep performance steady is rather noticeable in some sequences, but it is still impressive how the console handles this demanding demo, which uses the very first version of Unreal Engine 5 that lacks many of the improvements that have been introduced over the years.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Matrix Awakens - Can PS5 Pro handle this Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKnW095Kpys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It would be quite interesting to see how the PS5 Pro would run The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5 demo if it were updated to the latest version of the engine. As showcased in a video <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-the-matrix-awakens-cpu-gpu-performance-improvements/">last month</a>, the improvements introduced to the engine since its very first version make quite a difference in terms of image quality and performance.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the mid-generation refresh system by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crowbar-collective-rogue-point</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-mesa-dev-and-team17-announce-roguelite-shooter-rogue-point.1032657/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crowbar-collective-rogue-point<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Mesa&nbsp;</em>developer Crowbar Collective has announced&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point</em>, a co-operative multiplayer roguelite shooter that the studio says will offer "hundreds of ways to play". It'll be published by British veteran studio Team17.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world where the mysteriously-named "CEO", the richest man in the game's world, has died. Using an app called MERX, corporations are attempting to carve up his empire by hiring mercenary teams to fight one another.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might believe, it doesn't seem like you're playing as one of these armies. Rather, you'll play as members of the titular Rogue Point, an "elite, independent vigilante squad" aiming to put an end to MERX and save the day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rogue-point-crowbar-collective-shootout.jpg?itok=hnXDYDkR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rogue-point-crowbar-collective-shootout.jpg?itok=pRQ6C-RW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>pits you against armies of merciless mercenaries.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with up to three friends, you'll take part in what Crowbar Collective and Team17 call "challenging missions", making your way through a campaign in which "no two playthroughs are alike", which is, of course, the standard roguelite boast.</p>

<p>As you play, you'll unlock gameplay modifiers and gear that will help you create "loadouts specific to the needs of the mission", and you'll also come up against MERX classes which will "challenge you in new and surprising ways".</p>

<p>The two studios are also talking up what they call the "Parametric Design System", which they say contributes to "new strategies and challenges with every play" across four "diverse" locations.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point</em>, which shows off some of the tactical gameplay you can expect from the co-op shooter, right here.</p>




<p><em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>will serve as developer Crowbar Collective's second game, following on from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/black-mesa" rel="nofollow"><em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>remake&nbsp;<em>Black Mesa</em></a>, which was finally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-mesa-release-date-finally-set-for-march-2020" rel="nofollow">released back in 2020</a> after enjoying a rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-mesa-finally-adds-xen-levels-roadmap-to-10" rel="nofollow">protracted development cycle</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, unlike&nbsp;<em>Black Mesa</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>isn't a remake, so it'll be interesting to see how Crowbar Collective handles its first original IP. There's no release date yet, but&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on PC via Steam when it does launch.</p>

Since then, the franchise has remained a bright spot in Nintendo’s RPG lineup, with new titles and remakes of previous ones showing up throughout the years to the delight of fans. The newest outing for the duo comes by way of <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, promising to take us on an exciting journey with our two favorite plumbers once again.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195273" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Releasing Beyond Pikmin 4" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="92" data-playlist="195273,196805,195905" data-current="195273"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Releasing Beyond Pikmin 4</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195273/195273_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195273/195273_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195273/195273_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195273/195273_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20737.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’re considering picking up <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> and have a few lingering questions about what to expect, here’s what you need to know about this role-playing adventure.</p><h2 id="h483865"><a id="sequel"></a>Is <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> a direct sequel?</h2><p>The <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> franchise often features returning themes and characters, but you don’t need to have played the previous entries to understand the newest. </p><figure id="" data-id="7348a6e62367c450ac7838e8ecaec72a" data-recommend-id="image://7348a6e62367c450ac7838e8ecaec72a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="842" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and Luigi explore a colorful fantasy world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario and Luigi explore a colorful fantasy world." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7348a6e62367c450ac7838e8ecaec72a" data-recommend-id="image://7348a6e62367c450ac7838e8ecaec72a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="842" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and Luigi explore a colorful fantasy world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The altest games takes players to a brand-new world called Concordia, which is located far from the Mushroom Kingdom the brothers are used to saving. Here, they meet an entirely new cast of characters, such as their new flying pig-like companion Snoutlet, and set off on an adventure across multiple islands to restore the shattered world of Concordia.</p><p>You spend your time sailing across Concordia on Shipshape Island—an island that functions as, well, a ship. This acts as your main hub, where you’ll send the brothers out to explore other islands in the sea by firing them out of cannons. It’s a unique system that helps the game feel much more expansive than previous titles in the series.</p><h2 id="h483866"><a id="genre"></a>What kind of game is <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>?</h2><p>As with all of the other games in the Mario &amp; Luigi series, <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> is a role-playing game that features turn-based combat akin to games like <em>Final Fantasy</em> or <em>Dragon Quest</em>—albeit a bit more family-friendly and accessible. The game’s battle system allows you to assign specific attacks to Mario and Luigi separately, such as hammer smashes and jumps, as well as combine the brothers for attack combos that can deal devastating damage.</p><figure id="" data-id="0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-recommend-id="image://0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1178" data-height="664" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and Luigi face off against hostile creatures." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario and Luigi face off against hostile creatures." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-recommend-id="image://0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1178" data-height="664" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and Luigi face off against hostile creatures." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you’re not in battle, you explore Concordia’s various islands where you engage with NPCs to expand upon the world-building and complete side quests. This entry in the series even includes Bros. Moves, which helps you solve environmental puzzles you encounter by letting the brothers use fire and ice spells or even roll into a ball.</p><h2 id="h483867"><a id="long"></a>How long is <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>?</h2><p><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> is the longest game in the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi </em>series, spanning around <strong>30 hours for an average playthrough</strong>. This would include pushing through the main campaign while casually dabbling in a bit of the optional content on offer.</p><p>Those looking to see everything in <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, however, can easily squeeze another 10-20 hours out of the RPG doing all of its side quests and supplementary mini-games for a total of <strong>50 or more hours of total playtime</strong>.</p><h2 id="h483868"><a id="reviews"></a>What do the reviews say about <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>?</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> has received mixed reviews</a></span>. Most reviewers have praised its enjoyable combat and generally likable cast of characters. However, many have bemoaned the overabundance of dialogue, endlessly repetitive jokes, and excessive hand-holding. Perhaps most importantly, some critics say the game feels much more geared toward a younger audience than previous titles in the series. As such, Nintendo may have overcorrected toward that demographic just a bit too much.</p><figure id="" data-id="094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-recommend-id="image://094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="833" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-recommend-id="image://094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="833" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>’s somewhat polarizing reception, I’d recommend watching or reading a variety of reviews to weigh how these various pros and cons might affect your enjoyment of the game before you spend your hard-earned money on it. Everyone’s different, of course, and what bothers some folks might not bother you at all.</p><h2 id="h483869"><a id="coop"></a>Is <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> co-op?</h2><p>Though <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> teases the idea of co-op by name alone,<strong> you may be disappointed to hear that this role-playing outing provides no multiplayer functionality whatsoever</strong>. This is an entirely solo experience wherein you control the two plumber brothers with a single controller.</p><p><br>If you’re looking for a <em>Mario </em>title with some multiplayer fun, though, you can always hop into the new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-party-jamboree-switch-reviews-metacritic-1851673386&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-party-jamboree-switch-reviews-metacritic-1851673386">Mario Party Jamboree</a></span> with some pals.
