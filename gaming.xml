            <p>
Geography of Robots - the developer behind 2022's acclaimed narrative adventure Norco - has revealed its new project, Silenus, and there's an "experimental" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927440/Silenus/">Steam demo</a> to try right now.
</p>
<p>
Silenus is described as a "micro-adventure" - lasting 2-2.5 hours - set on a Gulf Flow oil refinery recently acquired by Rubens Link, an "enigmatic company with an unclear agenda". Cast as an android called Titian, players must investigate the company's true motives - which seems to go beyond installing automation tech as it claims - by solving puzzles, deciphering clues, conversing with characters, and poking around the remains of vanished workers.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927440/Silenus/">newly released demo version of Silenus</a> is officially known as the Umbilical Pre-Release demo, and it's been created in collaboration with Baton Rouge doom metal band Thou to help promote its new album. "Thou composed material for our 2022 release Norco," Geography of Robots explains in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2927440/view/6009568738060250964?l=english">FAQ accompanying the demo</a>, "and we decided to extend this collaboration to help draw attention to their upcoming album release Umbilical."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A demo of our short adventure game Silenus is OUT NOW on Steam. Investigate a refinery operated by an obscure organization. Unlock all tracks from Thou's upcoming album Umbilical. This is a very small taste with more to come, so be sure to wishlist! üîó below. <a href="https://t.co/oyymxEXfWw">pic.twitter.com/oyymxEXfWw</a></p>‚Äî geographyofrobots (@roboticgeo) <a href="https://twitter.com/roboticgeo/status/1792555607175598587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
In the portion of Silenus available in the demo, players can unlock and listen to all the tracks from Umbilical, but the studio notes the game itself is "likely to change [a lot]" between now and release. "Many elements of the demo were designed with the Umbilical listening feature in mind," it explains. "These will likely be removed or reworked. Some narrative details will remain the same while others will change. However, the overall themes, aesthetics, and gameplay will be largely the same."
</p>
<p>
Silenus' demo is compatible with Mac, Steam Deck, and controllers but is only available for a limited time. Thou's album launches on 31st May, and Geography of Robots plans to keep the demo available "for 2 - 3 weeks following this release."
</p>
<p>
The developer say it hopes to complete the full version of Silenus "by the end of 2024". And if you've yet to experience the studio's previous project, Norco - which Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell called a "beautiful, surprising, human, and utterly magnetic debut" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/norco-review">his Recommended review</a> - it's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221250/NORCO/">discounted by 60 percent</a> on Steam.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24160895/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-explained-interpretation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="QdE6vB"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> has the kind of ending that sends people running to the internet looking for explainers and conversation ‚Äî not because they didn‚Äôt understand it, exactly, but because they don‚Äôt necessarily believe what they just saw. Jane Schoenbrun‚Äôs follow-up to 2022‚Äôs <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23027388/were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair-review"><em>We‚Äôre All Going to the World‚Äôs Fair</em></a> is a dark movie: dark in the visuals, since so much of it takes place in queasy late-night spaces and dim, muddy interiors, and dark in the narrative specifics, which are not designed to comfort or coddle the viewers. This is not a feel-good film with a pat, heartwarming ending.</p>
<p id="WXJu9A">But it is a film that seems designed to get under viewers‚Äô skins, and leave them examining their lives and their choices. Schoenbrun invites people to take any lingering discomfort that comes out of the end of the movie, and go do something with it. It‚Äôs a call to action, though what exactly ‚Äúaction‚Äù means is left wide open. Schoenbrun has a specific intention in mind, but the metaphor here is also broad enough that anyone watching this movie can wrap it tightly around their own lives and their own bodies until it fits for them.</p>

<p id="P1GVcB">The movie follows many years in the life of Owen (Ian Foreman in his younger years, Justice Smith thereafter), a hesitant, socially awkward kid who clearly struggles to relate to other people, at school and at home. When he meets hostile, disconnected Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), he manages a tentative connection with her by sharing her fandom for a late-night TV show about teenagers Isabel and Tara, who fight the world‚Äôs darkest, most evil forces with their powerful psychic connection. (The show, <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, was inspired in part by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153069/i-saw-tv-glow-amber-benson-cameo-fixing-buffy-vampire-slayer">Schoenbrun‚Äôs childhood obsession with <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></a>.)</p>
<p id="NVDj3w">Eventually, Maddy runs away from home and disappears without a trace, while Owen trudges from high school to early adulthood without shedding any of his adolescent awkwardness. Maddy returns eight years later to tell him she‚Äôs been inside the show ‚Äî from her perspective, Owen and Maddy <em>are</em> Isabel and Tara in <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, but they were captured by their enemies and buried alive, their hearts cut out and stuffed in a refrigerator. </p>
<p id="74cb0h">Maddy says she escaped and rediscovered her true identity as Tara, but back in the real world, where time runs differently, Isabel is still buried, and the vision she‚Äôs been forced into ‚Äî the false identity as Owen ‚Äî will soon end when they both die. Maddy wants Owen to accept this, and go through the dangerous, deadly-sounding ritual she endured to wake herself up.</p>

<p id="4rldBS">For viewers, Maddy‚Äôs version of reality is likely to sound much more compelling than Owen‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a classic escapist fantasy: ‚ÄúThis boring life we‚Äôre living isn‚Äôt real. We‚Äôre actually heroes from another world, with superpowers, and a mission to save the world.‚Äù But the route to get there is so dark and frightening ‚Äî Maddy literally wants Owen to let her seal him in a coffin and bury him alive ‚Äî that he rejects it and resists her. And that‚Äôs understandable, too. Maddy‚Äôs story could also be interpreted as a dangerous, paranoid delusion, and her solution sounds potentially fatal. Schoenbrun doesn‚Äôt pull punches about this particular call to adventure: There‚Äôs no clear evidence that Maddy isn‚Äôt unintentionally luring Owen into joint suicide. There‚Äôs no overt evidence that anything she‚Äôs saying is true.</p>
<p id="gukTwo">Schoenbrun has been clear about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">seeing all of this as a trans coming-out story</a>. Within the <em>Pink Opaque</em> narrative, Owen‚Äôs authentic self is female. He has periodic visions or dreams, quick flashes where he‚Äôs in the <em>Pink Opaque</em> setting as himself, but wearing Isabel‚Äôs dress. Maddy wants to take him on a journey to find his real body and his true identity as Isabel, but the path to get there will be painful and take real commitment.</p>
<p id="M3Ffwk">Owen recoils from it, refuses to accept Maddy‚Äôs revelations, and chooses to stay in his old life. Even though the <em>Pink Opaque </em>narrative haunts him, he takes the passive route, muddling through his existing life and claiming that it‚Äôs gratifying, that he‚Äôs found peace, family, and contentment there.</p>
<p id="17U07Q">Ahead of the movie‚Äôs wide release, Schoenbrun <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">talked to Polygon about that kind of passivity</a>, and about feeling it‚Äôs a familiar part of the trans experience:</p>
<blockquote><p id="2hPfen">I think that kind of ‚Äúpassivity‚Äù feels inherently tied to an experience that I ‚Äî and I think many other trans folks ‚Äî can relate to on a deeply visceral level. It indicates exactly how our ideas about what proper narrative or progress is is not only woefully limited in the experiences it‚Äôs showing, but also like maybe by definition, masculine and cis. [It‚Äôs] reflective of an idea of agency and individual agency that doesn‚Äôt resonate with other experiences, like my own. And so I am trying to rewrite or call into question or challenge or simply just like, exist within alternative ideas of narrative structure, to express something that feels emotionally truthful to my experience in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p id="reStUX">Schoenbrun clearly feels sympathy for Owen‚Äôs dilemma, and for his uncertainty about redefining himself as someone else. At the same time, though, the director repeatedly suggests that Owen is lying to himself. While he defends himself to the audience by saying he built a family of his own and that he loves them, we never see them or hear any details about them. They never seem real, and even their existence might be a hallucination or an outright lie. As Owen continues to reject Maddy‚Äôs version of the truth, years blur by for him, with no sense of grounding or connection in the reality he‚Äôs chosen.</p>

<p id="PlvtXr">Toward the end of the movie, he‚Äôs clearly stuck in an unsatisfying place in life, surrounded by unpleasant people and working at an unfulfilling job. In two of the movie‚Äôs most vividly painful moments, he screams that he‚Äôs dying and he pleads for help, but no one around him hears him or sees his distress. Then he cuts his own chest open, and sees the staticky glow of the TV screen inside. As Schoenbrun <a href="https://ew.com/i-saw-the-tv-glow-director-jane-schoenbrun-explains-ending-justice-smith-brigette-lundy-paine-8643442">explained it to Entertainment Weekly</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="hgRVEB">After half a lifetime of resistance, when Owen finally sees that glow inside himself ‚Äî and to do so, he literally has to open himself up and see the heart that‚Äôs been taken from him, and see that it‚Äôs been replaced by this signal that could be something beautiful, but also carries the ambivalence and sinister nature of the emptiness of glow; the thing that it is representing what isn‚Äôt there inside him. This was my attempt to capture the ambivalence and overwhelming joy and possibility, but also things that feel sinister and terrifying about an egg crack ‚Äî the moment when, as a queer or trans person, you understand that you aren‚Äôt yourself and that you need to become something else to conjure that magic that was maybe there in childhood and maybe there in these other moments in life.</p></blockquote>
<p id="2aj3SK">Even faced with this visible, obvious sign that his chosen mundane reality has cracks in it, though, Owen still doesn‚Äôt take that next step. He closes up his chest and goes back to his work in a shrill, dark, oppressive arcade ‚Äî and he humbly apologizes to everyone he encounters, embarrassed about that outburst that no one else saw, remembers, or cares about.</p>
<p id="OLaMCA">It‚Äôs a horrifying sequence: He‚Äôs living out a series of intense private agonies and doubts, and instead of giving those doubts space, he‚Äôs muffling them for the sake of all the utterly indifferent people around him. Instead of examining the source of his terror and trying to find a solution, he begs for forgiveness from absolute strangers, out of anxiety that his impending death might have impinged on their fun. It‚Äôs hard to say which is more horrifying: his humility and humiliation, or everyone else‚Äôs apathy and inability to even see his pain. </p>

<p id="xNccXd">It‚Äôs a dark, sad ending ‚Äî there is no rescue coming for Owen, no sudden breakthrough where Maddy saves him in spite of himself, or where the world of <em>The Pink Opaque </em>sends him even clearer proof that he‚Äôs on the wrong track and needs to reverse course. The message is clear enough: No one can force Owen to find his own identity or his own satisfaction in life. No one can make his choices for him, or tell him who he really is.</p>
<p id="nsFT6o">But while the ending is heavy and painful for Owen ‚Äî and, if we accept Maddy‚Äôs version of events, for Isabel ‚Äî it has a clear purpose beyond scaring, startling, and saddening viewers. It‚Äôs a reminder that not making choices is a form of choice ‚Äî one we have to live with, one that has consequences. It‚Äôs a vibrant call to action, and a warning about how passivity and fear can be their own kind of living death. Watching Owen ‚Äúdecay,‚Äù <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23922584">as Schoenbrun puts it</a>, is tragic and alarming ‚Äî and seemingly meant to show viewers the repercussions of holding still in their lives, of refusing to confront or examine their own questions about themselves. Owen isn‚Äôt a classic hero, he‚Äôs a cautionary tale about self-repression.</p>
<p id="9Yz1u5">Does that mean <em>The Pink Opaque</em> is real, Isabel is real, Owen is trans, and there‚Äôs only one possible way forward for him that doesn‚Äôt lead to suffocation and death? Not necessarily. Schoenbrun doesn‚Äôt leave him another obvious way out of his oppressive life, but given that he never seems to seek one, or to discuss his feelings of unreality and emptiness with anyone but Maddy, it seems that his inertia and willingness to live in apologetic misery are the problems, not just his refusal to be buried alive. He‚Äôs afraid to even explore his feelings with Maddy herself, both as a young man and an old one. He finds it safer to be stuck ‚Äî and to be baffled, sad, and lonely ‚Äî than to take action. And Schoenbrun shows us all the consequences of that decision. </p>
<p id="AKdrLz">That metaphor certainly isn‚Äôt limited to coming out as queer, or trans. Schoenbrun is reflecting a personal experience and a personal feeling, one that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24132301/trans-movies-2024-i-saw-tv-glow-peoples-joker-t-blockers-essay">some trans viewers certainly identify with</a>. But Owen‚Äôs withering, shrinking life is a memorable image for anyone facing similar questions about who they are, who they want to be, and whether they can find a way to that future by exploring their options and choosing change. His story doesn‚Äôt ever find a happy ending. But it‚Äôs an emotional, heartfelt plea to anyone watching <em>I Saw the TV Glow </em>to go do the frightening work of seeking out one for themselves. </p>

Season 4 begins on May 29 but there are no concrete details on when the <em>Gundam</em> bundles will become available in game. When they do arrive, they will come in the form of three special packs. Combined, the packs give players access to Operator Skins for three iconic suits from the franchise: the RX-78-2, MS-06S Zaku II, and XVX-016 Gundam Aerial. It‚Äôs a nice collection of old and new models from the franchise, but I think they should‚Äôve gone wild and made an Operator Skin for iconic antagonist Char Aznable. He‚Äôs just a guy in a funny outfit and I want to see him go wild with a machine gun. </p><figure id="" data-id="d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-recommend-id="image://d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1695" data-height="954" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three giant robots pose over Earth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three giant robots pose over Earth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-recommend-id="image://d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1695" data-height="954" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three giant robots pose over Earth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The packs will also include special death effects, emblems, charms, decals, and more goodies.

<p>Microsoft held its major Surface and AI event on Monday. While it wasn‚Äôt livestreamed for people to watch, there <a href="https://x.com/richontech/status/1792603950186959309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is information coming out</a> that pertains to Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot and video games.</p>



<p>Microsoft revealed that it will begin working to add Copilot directly into its games. The game shown as an example was Minecraft that will let players use AI to ask if you have the right materials to craft an item. In this instance, the item was a sword.</p>



<p>Copilot then searches the inventory for the materials and tells you if you can make your sword or not.</p>



<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got some sticks, perfect for the sword‚Äôs handle,‚Äù the Copilot said. ‚ÄúBut it looks like you‚Äôre missing the material for the blade. You can use wood, stone, iron, gold, or diamond.‚Äù</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While it‚Äôs unknown when these features will be added to games like Minecraft or what other games will take advantage of the ability, it‚Äôs clear that Microsoft has its sight set on guides and tutorials for gamers. This implementation could go a long way in making the ways of looking up walkthroughs a thing of the past.</p>



<p>How much it‚Äôll be adopted, however, we‚Äôll have to wait and see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/what-a-community-led-shift-to-independent-fan-wikis-means-for-game-developers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since the game industry‚Äôs early days, players have long relied on guides to help them progress in their favorite games. Developers do everything possible to deliver the needed information in a game itself, but many players inevitably turn to third-party resources.&nbsp;Publishers like Penguin Random House subsidiary Prima Games sold game guides sometimes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/10-things-you-didn-t-know-about-the-star-wars-x-wing-series">in collaboration with the developers themselves</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company couldn‚Äôt overcome the growth of the online guides ecosystem, which has grown from the player-created guides of GameFAQs to a host of websites and wikis answering every possible question a player might need after a quick Google search. It folded in 2018.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But online guides are beginning to eat themselves alive too. Content farms with loose plagiarism policies have gamed search engine optimization methods to supersede reliable sites in the search results of platforms like Google. Some use sponsored listings to make money, not reliability, as the means of attracting advertising eyeballs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even worse, some turn to generative AI tools to just spam seemingly useful information, accuracy be damned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The degrading resources are beginning to have an impact on game communities. Some‚Äîlike the organizers of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Wiki hosted on Fandom‚Äîare taking dramatic steps to preserve these vital player-led resources. It‚Äôs a noteworthy shift that could change the future of video game communities, and how developers interact with them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is driving players to form independent wikis?">What is driving players to form independent wikis?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fandom hosts more than a quarter million Wikis, which are walkthroughs or guides to help players get through or get the most out of games. Because of its size, it holds a large amount of influence over pop culture and is often first in a google search for the given game or property.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wikis, also known as FAQs, are public pages, fully editable by anyone with an account. As Maws, a wiki writer, put it, ‚ÄúIf I write a section for Dream Nail (an ability in Hollow Knight‚Äôs wiki page) I‚Äôm not entitled to it. Anyone could walk in, wipe the slate, and write something better than that afterwards.‚Äù</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It‚Äôs a communal process that ensures a competent end result, but like many passion projects that garner enough attention, the site the wiki writers had spent so much time on changed irrevocably when it was bought up by a private equity firm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fandom was first formed as Wikicities in 2004, and took on its current name in 2016 after being acquired by former AOL CEO Jon Miller, backed by private equity firm TPG Capital.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The for-profit model under private equity led to some very unpopular decisions for many community creators. Some, like the organizers of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Terraria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Legend of Zelda, Fallout and Minecraft wikis left the platform and changed domains.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After TPG Capital took over, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wiki contributors saw their wiki‚Äôs quality decline as new restrictions were put in place, limiting their ability to fix issues the site itself was creating. ‚ÄúWe tolerated it for so long because initially there was listening and feedback,‚Äù said ‚ÄúZigmatism,‚Äù a wiki writer for the Hollow Knight community who asked to be referred to by their nickname.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúBefore all of this, [Fandom] was *the* place for hosting a wiki if you didn‚Äôt have the resources to go independent.‚Äù</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many community editors decamped from the site after the unusually-named ‚Äú</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-grimace-wiki-ad-happy-meal-fandom-history-1850552640">The Grimace Incident</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">‚Äù where Fandom removed an entire community-generated page on McDonald‚Äôs B-tier mascot Grimace and replaced it with an ad for its Grimace-themed milkshake, ‚Äúthe Grimace Shake,‚Äù which had a brief viral moment in 2023.</span></p><p>Image via Fandom.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúI can add [the content] back, but what‚Äôs the point if they‚Äôre paying a dude to undo it?‚Äù contributor Nathan Steinmetz said on X (formerly Twitter). His work had been wiped away by the advertising campaign. ‚ÄúIt sets a bad precedent when any IP holder can approach Fandom and have user content suppressed and released with an ad.‚Äù</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The ">The <span>Hollow Knight</span> wiki editors departed after an AI invasion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> community decided to join the exodus. Their complaints included a poor user interface and aggressive ads. In a post titled ‚Äú</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Hollow_Knight_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom">Moving from Fandom</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,‚Äù the Hollow Knight contributors stated that the last straw was the ‚ÄúQuick Answers‚Äù feature, which used generative AI to ask and answer user questions. The tool was reportedly full of grammatical errors and pulled answers from unrelated pages. Community editors were initially unable to edit or remove the tool if they so desired.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The feature was pulled within 24 hours due to the backlash and is now optional for editors to use, instead of mandatory. But the damage was done.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Youtube creator Mossbag spotlighted the turmoil in his video, ‚Äú</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qcfuA_UAz3I?si=SDjXZ2BK3h25-krm">Stop Using Fandom</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,‚Äù documenting that readers would be interrupted by links to articles from Fandom sibling organizations GameSpot and ScreenJunkies and be asked to take part in surveys, ‚Äúcreating a distracting, frustrating and slow experience for editors and readers alike.‚Äù</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zigmatism was sour on how companies like Fandom intend to use AI tools, saying they seemed designed to replace artists and writers instead of automating backbreaking labor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maws noted that it‚Äôs the reason for Quick Answers that bothers him: ‚Äú(It was created) for Fandom to get additional revenue. It‚Äôs not just that the human element in ‚Äúwriting‚Äù is erased. It‚Äôs seemingly as if the only human element is from the guy who turns that feature on, and that‚Äôs that.‚Äù</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="‚ÄúForking away‚Äù from Fandom">‚ÄúForking away‚Äù from Fandom</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With all this going on, it's no surprise that many communities would want to "fork away" from Fandom, migrating all their work to alternate platforms. In the aforementioned explanatory post, the Hollow Knight contributors wrote that they felt very little control over the content they created, stating, "Fandom does not care about the effort put into content, and will erase hours of work without a second thought."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The situation has improved, ‚Äúraising the satisfaction level to what it should be,‚Äù according to Zigmatism, who also noted that would not have been possible without the immediate outrage and the threat to the company‚Äôs bottom line.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúI know [after multiple Wikis branched], Fandom went into a kind of all-hands-on-deck mode, listening to [and polling] editors and making some good changes overall,‚Äù he said. But he still believes independent, fan-hosted wikis are a better fit for developers looking to get involved, which tend to be a little more flexible and less profit-oriented.</span></p><p>Image via Team Cherry.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Any time a passionate group working on a project gains enough traction, there‚Äôs the possibility of it being bought up or monetized. That, in turn, carries the risk of degrading whatever made the original special, and in worst-case scenarios, key parts can get chopped off to be sold later.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I love archiving knowledge, and I love promoting people's hard work," Zigmatism said, when discussing the new </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Hollow_Knight_Wiki">Hollow Knight wiki</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Wikis are a perfect mix of those two drives."&nbsp; "You can tell people actually care about what they're doing in (the new Hollow Knight) Wiki," added Maws.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There‚Äôs good reason for developers to be aware of this growing shift. Josh Zimmerman, a professor and community engagement consultant from the University of Arizona, explained to Game Developer via email that accurate, well-functioning, fan-hosted Wikis reinforce player loyalty in games through what he described as ‚Äúfannish performance.‚Äù</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He added that such projects can also serve as archives for games no longer in circulation or who are not playable in their original states thanks to years of bugfixes and content additions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experience of poor wiki tech on larger sites may drive away fans who are otherwise passionate about learning the intricacies of a game. Given the depth of work that goes into chronicling the ins and outs of a title, developers should be aware that players are becoming so frustrated they jump ship for a homebrewed platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It could get worse. If maintaining fan wikis becomes too arduous, fans might abandon the communities around their favorite games entirely.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="210" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>players have plenty to be excited about for the upcoming season, as the update introduces new maps, modes, killstreaks, and equipment items. Here is everything you need to know about Season 4. </p> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">Sledgehammer Games has consistently delivered a healthy dose of content for each seasonal update. After launching with 20 6v6 maps in November 2023, that count is now up to 33, with three more coming throughout Season 4. On top of that, a consistent offering of new game modes, events, and features makes it a great time to be a multiplayer fan. Season 4 is no different, as the devs offer up a package that will give players plenty to sink their teeth into. </p>
 <h2 id="h-mw3-season-4-patch-notes" data-injectable="false">MW3 Season 4 patch notes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision </figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">Two new 6v6 maps</h3> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Tokyo</strong>: Experience Tokyo nightlife in this mid-sized Multiplayer map featuring late night shopping, entertainment, and accommodations for the weary traveler. Battle for the map‚Äôs major power positions, the Hotel and Manga buildings facing one another over the main road. Except for these two locations, the fight stays on ground level.</li> <li><strong>Paris: </strong>Head to the City of Lights for a rendezvous with the enemy, fighting across this mid-sized map dominated by the central Police Station and Gallery. Navigate the surrounding streets to remain on ground level or take the battle to either of the two main buildings. Don‚Äôt underestimate the map‚Äôs smaller interior spaces, the Bookstore and Shop. These areas provide overhead cover in a pinch and are generally less conspicuous than the large center buildings.</li> </ul> <h3 data-injectable="false">Season 4 new game modes </h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Demolition</strong>: One of the finest tactical game modes in Call of Duty is finally back! Appearing for the first time since Season 3 of&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare</em>&nbsp;(2019) this round-based objective mode has similarities to Search &amp; Destroy, with teams alternating between attacking and defending two bomb sites. However, unlike S&amp;D, respawns are enabled and attacking players always spawn with a bomb, and defuses ‚Äì ninja or otherwise ‚Äì don‚Äôt end the round. This leads to highly tactical engagements ‚Äì and pandemonium ‚Äì as teams converge on bomb sites and pressure the opposition.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Hyper Cranked</strong>: This twisted spin on traditional Team Deathmatch gets even more frantic with this ‚ÄúHyper‚Äù variant. For the uninitiated, Cranked pressures you into chaining kills, eliminating enemy opponents as often as you wish, but within a specific amount of time before a countdown reaches zero, or you‚Äôll explode. Expect a faster reload, weapon swap, and quicker movement speed after your first kill. Points are awarded for every kill, meaning getting kills, staying alive longer, earning more points, and finally claiming victory with your team is the plan in Cranked.</li> <li><strong>&nbsp;Havoc</strong>: The action begins with the Team Deathmatch ruleset in effect, with the first team to reach 75 points awarded the win. However, Killstreaks (except those awarded with a modifier) are disabled, and a variety of match-changing modifiers come into play!</li> <li><strong>Headshots only:</strong> This team mode, played on a small moshpit of maps, is for skilled players who can demonstrate impressive aim. Using Team Deathmatch rules, augmented by the fact that only headshots count when eliminating other players; no damage is dealt, and no team score progression is possible unless your cranium-aiming is true.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Playlist modifers </h3> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Looping Killstreaks:&nbsp;</strong>Streaks reset fully once you reach the upper end of your current streaks, allowing you to earn unlimited streaks in one life.</li> <li><strong>Earning Killstreaks:&nbsp;</strong>You receive points added to your streak if you slay an enemy player with your Killstreak, or Assist in killing a player with your Killstreak.</li> <li><strong>Killstreak Cache:&nbsp;</strong>When a player is eliminated, they drop a cache containing a percentage of their earned Killstreak progress. Grab the cache and add it to your own progress!</li> </ul> <h3 data-injectable="false">New killstreaks </h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>&nbsp;Intelligent Munitions Systems</strong>: The Intelligent Munitions System is loaded with smart explosives that eliminate enemy personnel and vehicles within range. When triggered, it will eject an explosive upwards, which then locks onto its target and propels it towards them.</li> <li><strong>Loitering Munition</strong>: An unmanned rocket-equipped drone loiters over the targeted areas. On each activation, the drone selects the targeted location with the largest number of viable targets to bombard with rockets. It can be activated up to three times.</li> <li><strong>Missile Drone</strong>: A small, piloted drone controlled by the player that fires guided missiles.</li> <li><strong>DNA Bomb</strong>: The discovery of a DNA Bomb Popov Power in Urzikstan is a taste of the tremendous power this brings to a Multiplayer match. The tremendous explosion can be triggered provided you‚Äôve acquired enough consecutive kills without dying. Once you‚Äôre granted the DNA Bomb you can detonate it, eliminating all players on the opposing team. Unlike the MGB, the DNA Bomb does not conclude the match.</li> </ul> <h3 data-injectable="false">New perks and equipment</h3> <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false"><strong>Compression Plate </strong></p> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">Immediately regenerate health after a Primary, Secondary, or Throwing Knife/ Throwing Star kill.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/try-this-devious-dnd-pact-of-the-chain-warlock-build/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=try-this-devious-dnd-pact-of-the-chain-warlock-build<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h4 id="h-friendship-is-magic" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Friendship is magic!</h4> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Warlocks are one of the most customizable <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>classes, with a patron at level 1 and the actual subclass (the all-important Pact) at level 3. While patron choice has a huge impact on the flavor of your warlock, the mechanical meat of this layered and rewarding class lies in your choice of Pact.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">I‚Äôve been using this Pact of the Chain build in my own game, and I can thoroughly recommend it! The Pacts all have their own playstyles to recommend them, and the Pact of the Chain might seem underwhelming at first glance, as wizards already get the find familiar spell. However, the warlock familiar is an entirely different animal. Quite literally.</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">The Pact of the Chain allows the warlock to cast the find familiar spell as any run-of-the-mill wizard can, but while most find familiar spells can only summon a fairly ordinary creature, albeit a magical version, Pact of the Chain warlocks can choose their familiar from imps, pseudodragons, quasits, and sprites instead. My personal favorite is the psuedodragon, for reasons I‚Äôll come to soon.</p>
 <p data-characters="553" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true">All familiars have their own initiative and can take a move and an action (such as the Help action to give the caster an advantage on their attacks against that target).&nbsp;Pact of the Chain familiars, unlike other familiars, can be commanded to attack by their pacted warlock, but the warlock must give up their own action to give their familiar an attack on the warlock‚Äôs initiative. Luckily, the Investment of the Chain Master invocation from Tasha‚Äôs Cauldron of Everything, allows you to use your bonus action to attack with your familiar.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Tasha‚Äôs Cauldron of Everything includes exciting new invocation options for budding warlocks. Image provided by Wizards of the Coast.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="646" data-current-count="946" data-injectable="true">The other key part of this build is that the Investment of the Chain Master means that whenever your familiar forces an enemy to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC instead of its usual saving throw. This is where the pseudodragon shines compared to the other familiars: its sting attack has very limited damage but forces its victim to make a Constitution saving throw using the warlock‚Äôs spell save DC for the saving throw. If the target fails the saving throw, they become poisoned for an hour, which imposes a disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks, and if they fail by 5 or more, they immediately fall unconscious.</p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">What this means in practice is that the familiar can move within 5 feet of an enemy on its turn and use the help action to give the warlock an advantage on their next attack against the target. The warlock can use their bonus action to command the pseudodragon to attack the target. The warlock then has their own standard action free to make an attack with an advantage on the target from the help action or cast another spell.</p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">This has some potential weaknesses: if the pseudodragon gets taken out (which did happen to my warlock‚Äôs familiar during an early adventure), your combat ability is somewhat hampered, though you still always have your spells. Luckily, Pact of the Chain warlocks can use their reaction to give their familiar resistance to the damage it just took. Look after your familiar and it will look after you!</p>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">You can also use any familiar to deliver touch-range spell attacks on your turn with your attack modifier rather than theirs, so you may wish to consider taking the Magic Initiate feat for the Sorcerer and gain the Shocking Grasp cantrip, as Sorcerers use Charisma for their spell attacks.</p> <h4 id="h-warlock-pact-of-the-chain-build" data-injectable="false">Warlock Pact of the Chain Build</h4> <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><strong>Attributes:</strong> High Charisma (vital for any Warlock ‚Äî put your highest attribute score in Charisma and ideally take a species bonus to Charisma). Other attributes are very much up to you.</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false"><strong>Patron:</strong> Patrons that provide access to spell attacks such as Scorching Ray from the Fiend or the Genie, or the Tentacle of the Deep from the Fathomless, or touch spells such as Cure Wounds from the Celestial, have slightly better synergy with this build.</p> <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false"><strong>Invocations (level 2):</strong> Agonizing Blast and another invocation that you will replace at level 3 with Investment of the Chain Master.</p> <p data-characters="56" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true"><strong>Pact (level 3):</strong> Pact of the Chain with the pseudodragon.</p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false"><strong>Spells:</strong> Eldritch Blast is the real favorite here, as it is a ranged spell attack that you can use in conjunction with your familiar‚Äôs help action. For your other cantrip, Mind Sliver subtracts 1d4 from the target‚Äôs next saving throw, making them more vulnerable to your pseudodragon‚Äôs poison.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-anima-weapons-guide-every-quest-item-and-duty-required-for-heavensward-relic/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ffxiv-anima-weapons-guide-every-quest-item-and-duty-required-for-heavensward-relic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="234" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Anima relic weapons are, arguably, the nicest relic weapons available in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. However, they do take one hell of a grind to acquire, and there are a lot of steps you need to go through in order to get your hands on one.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">That said, there are some things you can do to make life easier for yourself and this far past the <em>Heavensward</em> expansion, during which these relics became available, some of the steps can pretty much be steamrollered relatively quickly.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">To complete your first Anima relic weapon, you‚Äôll need to complete a total of 11 quests. We‚Äôll go over each of these in more detail later, but for now, here‚Äôs the checklist of Anima quests:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"> <li>An Unexpected Proposal</li> <li>Soul Without Life</li> <li>Toughening Up</li> <li>Coming Into Its Own</li> <li>Finding Your Voice</li> <li>A Dream Fulfilled</li> <li>Future Proof</li> <li>Born Again Anima</li> <li>Body and Soul</li> <li>Words of Wisdom</li> <li>Best Friends Forever</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false">Some of these quests are much easier to complete than others, but the overwhelming majority of them come with their own variety of grind. On the plus side, you‚Äôll at least have an epic weapon once you‚Äôve completed the final step.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true">If you‚Äôre wanting to work on multiple Anima relics at one time, this is entirely possible. However, you cannot be working on the same quest for multiple relics at the same time, so you‚Äôll need to progress one of the weapons at least one step before starting the grind for another Job.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-an-unexpected-proposal-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete An Unexpected Proposal in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Before you can get to actually beginning your Anima weapon journey, you‚Äôll need to meet a couple of requirements:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li>Complete the level 60 MSQ quest ‚ÄúHeavensward‚Äù</li> <li>Reach at least level 60 on the Job you want to get an Anima relic for</li> </ul> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">If you‚Äôve done this, head to Idyllshire and go straight to Rowena (X:5.0, Y:5.1). After talking to her, she‚Äôll send you off to Azys Lla, where you‚Äôll need to find and talk to Ardashir (X:7.1, Y:10.9). Ardashir will be your go-to guy for all things Anima related, so you‚Äôll soon get familiar with where to find him.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-soul-without-life-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Soul Without Life in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Animated&nbsp;</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">Speak to Ardashir in Azys Lla, and he‚Äôll send you off to Mor Dhona to talk to Rowena. In order to complete the first ‚Äòproper‚Äô Anima weapon quest, you need to get your hands on one Astral Nodule and one Umbral Nodule. You‚Äôve got a choice of which way you go about this. Both options require a bit of a grind, but let‚Äôs look at each option in detail.</p>
 <h3 id="h-complete-fates" data-injectable="false"><strong>Complete FATEs</strong></h3> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Before you can get an Astral or Umbral Nodule, you‚Äôll need to gather up six different types of Luminous Crystals. Each Crystal has a corresponding element, and each can be gained through completing FATEs in a specific <em>Heavensward</em> zone. You don‚Äôt need to complete these FATEs as the Job you‚Äôre aiming to get an Anima weapon for.</p> <p data-characters="79" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true"><strong>The Crystals you need to create an Astral Nodule come from the following zones:</strong></p>
 <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Crystal</strong></td><td><strong>Heavensward zone</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Wind Crystal</td><td>The Sea of Clouds</td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Fire Crystal</td><td>Azys Lla</td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Lightning Crystal</td><td>The Churning Mists</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="79" data-current-count="79" data-injectable="false"><strong>The Crystals you need to create an Umbral Nodule come from the following zones:</strong></p> <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Crystal</strong></td><td><strong>Heavensward zone</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Ice Crystal</td><td>Coerthas Western Highlands</td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Earth Crystal</td><td>The Dravanian Forelands</td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Water Crystal</td><td>The Dravanian Hinterlands</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">It‚Äôs worth noting that you need to complete a FATE with a gold rating to be in with a chance of gaining a Crystal and even then, it‚Äôs far from guaranteed. You‚Äôre likely to complete a lot of FATEs before you have all of the Crystals you need.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">Once you‚Äôve gathered all of your elemental Crystals, you can take them to Syndony in Mor Dhona (X:22.5, Y:5.9) and exchange them for the two Nodules.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="h-trade-in-a-completed-zodiac-zeta-weapon" data-injectable="false"><strong>Trade in a completed Zodiac Zeta weapon</strong></h3> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">If you‚Äôve previously been through the mammoth grind required to get a Zodiac Zeta weapon, you do have the option to trade this in for the Astral and Umbral Nodules. To do this, simply talk to Sydony and select the option to trade a Zodiac Zeta weapon.</p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">I know this seems like a massive sacrifice after all of the hard work you put into getting the Zeta weapon, considering you‚Äôll lose the weapon itself, but doing so will allow you to purchase replicas of every Zodiac stage weapon from Drake in North Shroud (X:30.3, Y:20.1).&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">You‚Äôre unlikely to be using the weapon itself, as it‚Äôs a level 50 weapon with a low iLvl, so if you‚Äôre only using it as a glamour then this option may be worthwhile to speed through this first step of your Anima weapon.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">Regardless of how you gained your Nodules, once you‚Äôve got them, head back to Azys Lla and hand them over to Ardashir to complete this quest, rewarding you with your Animated Anima weapon and allowing you to pick up the next quest.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-toughening-up-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Toughening Up in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="19" data-current-count="19" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Awoken</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true">Speak to Ardashir in Azys Lla again to begin the next step in the Anims journey. This stage of the Relic grind requires you to complete a long list of Dungeons with your first-stage relic equipped. Thankfully, the rest of your gear can be any iLvl and you can run the dungeons unsynced, so if you‚Äôre going back to this with a job at level 90, you‚Äôre going to speed through these dungeons without a problem.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">These dungeons come in three ‚Äòwaves‚Äô, with you needing to talk to Ardashir in between the ‚Äòwaves‚Äô in order to update him on your progress. Here‚Äôs the full list of steps needed in order to complete this quest:</p> <ul data-found-items="12" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0">Complete Snowcloak (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="1">Complete Sastasha (Hard) (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="2">Complete The Sunken Temple of Qarn (Hard) (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="3"><strong>Talk to Ardashir in Southern Thanalan (X:25.0, Y:12.1)</strong></li> <li data-index="4">Complete The Keeper of the Lake (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="5">Complete The Wanderer‚Äôs Palace (Hard) (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="6">Complete Amdapor Keep (Hard) (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="7"><strong>Speak to Ardashir in South Shroud (X:24.9, Y:24.1)</strong></li> <li data-index="8">Complete The Dusk Vigil (Level 51)</li> <li data-index="9">Complete Sohm Al (Level 53)</li> <li data-index="10">Complete The Aery (Level 55)</li> <li data-index="11">Complete the Vault (Level 57)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">Once you‚Äôve completed these steps, equip any other weapon for your chosen Job and make sure that your Animated weapon is in your inventory before heading back to Azys Lla. Talk to Ardashir in his usual location to complete this quest and gain the Awoken stage of your Anima relic.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-coming-into-its-own-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Coming into Its Own in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Anima</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Talk to Ardashir in Azys Lla and, if this is your first Anima weapon grind, he‚Äôll send you off to Mor Dhona to talk to Cristiana (X:21.4, Y5.4). If this isn‚Äôt your first Anima rodeo, you don‚Äôt need to talk to her again and can simply begin to hand in the items needed, which we‚Äôll get into now.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="57" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">To complete this quest, you‚Äôll need to get four things:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true"> <li>1 Enchanted Rubber</li> <li>1 Fast-drying Carboncoat</li> <li>1 Divine Water</li> <li>1 Fast-acting Allagan Catalyst</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, getting them is far from simple and this stage is guaranteed to take you a little while, because you need to get multiple other items to trade in for these final ones:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Final item</strong></td><td><strong>Unidentifiable items</strong></td><td><strong>Crafted items</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Enchanted Rubber</td><td>10 Unidentifiable Bone</td><td>4 Adamantite Francesca</td></tr><tr><td>Fast-drying Carboncoat</td><td>10 Unidentifiable Shell</td><td>4 Titanium Alloy Mirror</td></tr><tr><td>Divine Water</td><td>10 Unidentifiable Ore</td><td>4 Dispelling Arrow</td></tr><tr><td>Fast-acting Allagan Catalyst</td><td>10 Unidentifiable Seeds</td><td>4 Kingcake</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h3 id="h-unidentifiable-items" data-injectable="false"><strong>Unidentifiable items</strong></h3> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, to get your hands on Unidentifiable items, you have a few options; but you‚Äôre unlikely to be able to purchase all of them in one spending spree and you‚Äôre probably going to have to grind at least a few duties to complete the set.</p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">Unidentifiable items can be purchased for 150 Tomestones of Poetics each from Auriana in Mor Dhona (X:22.0, Y:6.0) or Hismena in Idyllshire (X:5.0, Y:5.0). If you‚Äôre wanting to buy all of these Unidentifiable items with Poetics, you‚Äôll need a total of 6,000 Poetics.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="70" data-current-count="70" data-injectable="false">Otherwise, Unidentifiable items can be obtained in the following ways:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Item</strong></td><td><strong>Methods to obtain</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Unidentifiable Bone</td><td>-Tribal Quest tokens:<br>3 Steel Amalj‚Äôok (Amalj‚Äôaa)<br>6 Vanu Whitebone (Vanu Vanu)<br>6 Black Copper Gil (Vath)<br>18 Carved Kupo Nut (Moogle)<br>-3 Precision Gordian Bolts (Alexander ‚Äì The Fist of the Father)<br>-300 Allied Seals</td></tr><tr><td>Unidentifiable Shell</td><td>-Tribal Quest tokens:<br>3 Rainbowtide Psashp (Sahagin)<br>6 Vanu Whitebone (Vanu Vanu)<br>6 Black Copper Gil (Vath)<br>18 Carved Kupo Nut (Moogle)<br>-3 Precision Gordian Lens (Alexander ‚Äì The Cuff of the Father)<br>-Obtained from Timeworn Wyvernskin Map</td></tr><tr><td>Unidentifiable Ore</td><td>-Tribal Quest tokens:<br>3 Titan Cobaltpiece (Kobold)<br>6 Vanu Whitebone (Vanu Vanu)<br>6 Black Copper Gil (Vath)<br>18 Carved Kupo Nut (Moogle)<br>-3 Precision Gordian Spring (Alexander ‚Äì The Arm of the Father)<br>-Obtained from Timeworn Dragonskin Map</td></tr><tr><td>Unidentifiable Seeds</td><td>Tribal Quest tokens:<br>3 Sylphic Goldleaf (Sylphs)<br>6 Vanu Whitebone (Vanu Vanu)<br>6 Black Copper Gil (Vath)<br>18 Carved Kupo Nut (Moogle)<br>-3 Precision Gordian Shaft (Alexander ‚Äì The Burden of the Father)<br>-300 Allied Seals</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="202" data-injectable="false">Perhaps the easiest and most time effective way to get these items is through completing the required Alexander duties ten times each, especially if you have the option to unsync them at level 90.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-crafted-items" data-injectable="false"><strong>Crafted items</strong></h3> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">If you don‚Äôt have a required crafting Jobs available to you, don‚Äôt panic. You can still complete this step. These items can also be purchased using Grand Company Seals, but they‚Äôre pretty expensive. Each item costs 5,000 GC Seals, so you‚Äôll need 80,000 Seals in total. Alternatively, if you‚Äôve got the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-gil-without-crafting-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">spare Gil</a>, you can purchase all of these items on the Marketboard at varying prices.</p>
 <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="64" data-injectable="false">If you want to craft these items yourself, here are the recipes:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Item</strong></td><td><strong>Crafting Class</strong></td><td><strong>Recipe</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Adamantite Francesca</td><td>Blacksmith</td><td>2 Fire Clusters<br>1 Earth Cluster<br>1 Birch Lumber<br>1 Adamantite Nugget<br>1 Pterodactyl Strap</td></tr><tr><td>Titanium Alloy Mirror</td><td>Alchemist</td><td>2 Water Clusters<br>1 Lightning Cluster<br>1 Titanium Alloy Square<br>1 Holy Water<br>1 Hardsilver Sand<br>1 Vitriol</td></tr><tr><td>Dispelling Arrow</td><td>Carpenter</td><td>2 Wind Clusters<br>1 Ice Cluster<br>1 Blessed Fletchings<br>1 Hallowed Chestnut Lumber<br>1 Hardsilver Nugget</td></tr><tr><td>Kingcake</td><td>Culinarian</td><td>2 Fire Clusters<br>1 Water Cluster<br>1 Moogle Miniature<br>1 Highland Flour<br>1 Yak Milk<br>1 Okeanis Egg<br>1 Birch Syrup<br>1 Tiny Crown</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">Once you‚Äôve gathered up this collection of items, you can head back to Cristiana in Mor Dhona and exchange them for the four items you need to complete this quest. Once you‚Äôve got them, make sure the Awoken weapon is in your inventory and go back to Azys Lla. Talk to Gerolt (X:7.0, Y:11.0) to upgrade your weapon to its Anima stage and complete this step.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-finding-your-voice-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Finding Your Voice in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="34" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Hyperconductive Anima</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">After the grind of the previous two quests, this one isn‚Äôt actually all that bad, though you will need a rather large pile of Poetics in order to complete it. You‚Äôll also need to complete this quest with the Anima weapon equipped. Switching Jobs will prevent you from proceeding.</p> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">After speaking to Ardashir again, you‚Äôll need to get 5 Aether Oils, which can be purchased from Hismena in Idyllshire (X:5.7, Y:5.2). Each Aether Oil costs 350 Tomestones of Poetics, so you‚Äôll need 1,750 Poetics in total.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">And that‚Äôs it for this quest. Once you‚Äôve got the Aether Oils, make sure your Anima weapon is in your inventory and head back to Azys Lla. Talk to Ardashir to finish this quest and pick up your Hyperconductive Anima weapon.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-a-dream-fulfilled-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete A Dream Fulfilled in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="32" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Reconditioned Anima</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">After talking to Ardashir, head to Idyllshire to meet Ulan (X:6.4, Y:4.7), who will be your main contact during this quest. In order to help you enhance the stats (such as Critical Hit and Determination) of your weapon, Ulan needs two things ‚Äì Umbrite and Crystal Sand ‚Äì which can be combined to create Treated Crystal Sand. You‚Äôll need roughly 60 of each item in order to create the 180 required Treated Crystal Sand.</p>
 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false">The first of these items, Umbrite, can only be obtained by purchasing it from Hismena for 75 Tomestones of Poetics each. To get the required 60 Umbrite, you‚Äôll need a total of 4,500 Poetics.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="151" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">Crystal Sand, on the other hand, can be obtained through exchanging items with Ulan. Each item (or group of items) can be exchanged for 2 Crystal Sand:</p> <figure data-found-rows="12" data-current-count="1129" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Exchangeable item(s)</strong></td><td><strong>How to get</strong></td></tr><tr><td>5 Blue Crafters‚Äô Scrip Tokens</td><td>25 White Crafters‚Äô Scrips each (125 total)</td></tr><tr><td>5 Blue Gatherers‚Äô Scrip Tokens</td><td>25 White Gatherers‚Äô Scrips each (125 total)</td></tr><tr><td>1 Garlond Steel<br>1 Celestine<br>1 High Allagan Chimera Leather</td><td>‚Äì Crafted (Blacksmith, Goldsmith and Leatherworker respectively)<br>‚Äì Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Amber-encased Vilekin</td><td>Heavensward Levequests</td></tr><tr><td>3 Battlecraft Demimateria I<br>2 Battlecraft Demimateria II<br>3 Fieldcraft Demimateria I<br>2 Fieldcraft Demimateria II</td><td>‚Äì Desynthesis<br>‚Äì Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>5 Moonstone</td><td>‚Äì Deliverance (Ixali daily quest)<br>‚Äì 4,000 GC Seals each (20,000 total)<br>‚Äì Timeworn Goatskin Map<br>‚Äì Timeworn Leather Map<br>‚Äì Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Inferno Horn<br>1 Crag Heart<br>1 Diamond Tear</td><td>‚Äì Level 50 Extreme Trial drops (Bowl of Embers, Navel and Akh Afah Amphitheatre)<br>‚Äì Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Vortex Feather<br>1 Barb of the Whorl<br>1 Large Levin Orb</td><td>‚Äì Level 50 Extreme Trials drops (Howling Eye, Whorleater, Striking Tree)<br>‚Äì Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>5 Superior Enchanted Ink<br>5 Thavnairian Mist</td><td>25 Tomestones of Poetics each (125 total)<br>20 Tomestones of Poetics each (100 total)</td></tr><tr><td>5 Allagan Catalyst</td><td>‚Äì The Labyrinth of the Ancients<br>‚Äì Syrcus Tower</td></tr><tr><td>1 Unidentifiable Bone<br>1 Unidentifiable Shell<br>1 Unidentifiable Ore<br>1 Unidentifiable Seeds</td><td>Any of the methods used in the ‚ÄúComing into It‚Äôs Own‚Äù quest</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">Once you‚Äôve gathered all of the items (or periodically in stages, if that‚Äôs how you want to do it) talk to Ulan to create Treated Crystal Sand. You can then use this Treated Crystal Sand to modify the Stats of your weapon. Once all 180 points have been allocated, make sure your Hyperconductive Anima weapon is in your inventory and return to Azys Lla to talk to Ardashir. This will complete this quest and reward you with a Reconditioned Anima weapon.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-future-proof-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Future Proof in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="28" data-current-count="28" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Sharpened Anima</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="328" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">Talk to Ardashir, who will tell you that you need to gather 50 Singing Clusters. This quest is pretty straightforward, and thankfully there are multiple ways to get Singing Clusters.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">The first way is by purchasing them from Hismena in Idyllshire for 40 Tomestones of Poetics each. In order to get all 50 this way, you‚Äôd need 2,000 Poetics. However, to cut the cost (and the grind) there are a couple of quests which can be repeated weekly to gain Singing Clusters:</p> <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Quest name</strong></td><td><strong>Quest giver &amp; location</strong></td><td><strong>Information</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cut from a Different Cloth</td><td>Angelet<br>Idyllshire<br>(X:7.9, Y:5.8)</td><td>Complete Duty Roulette: Level 50/60/70/80 Dungeons to receive one Singing Cluster</td></tr><tr><td>Seeking Inspiration</td><td>Amphelice<br>Idyllshire<br>(X:7.9, Y:5.8)</td><td>Complete Duty Roulette: Leveling three times in order to receive 18 Singing Clusters</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">Once you‚Äôve got all 50 Singing Clusters, deliver them to Blamprest in Idyllshire (X:7.9, Y:6.0), and then return to Ardashir in Azys Lla to receive your Sharpened Anima and complete this quest.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-born-again-anima-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Born Again Anima in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Complete Anima</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">After talking to Ardashir, he‚Äôll send you off to complete three dungeons. You do not need your Sharpened Anima weapon equipped as you complete these dungeons, but you do need to complete them as the Job which you‚Äôre getting the weapon for:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false"> <li>Sohm Al (Hard)</li> <li>The Great Gubal Library (Hard)</li> <li>The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">Once you‚Äôve done this, you‚Äôll need to complete a side quest called ‚ÄúSome Assembly Required‚Äù. To do this, you‚Äôll need to collect 15 Pneumite, which can be purchased for either 4,000 GC Seals or 100 Tomestones of Poetics each. Once you‚Äôve done that, we can move on to the main part of this quest ‚Äî Aetheric Density collection.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">Talk to the Verification Node and you‚Äôll be given an Enhanced Anima Glass. You can use this at any time to check the Aetheric Density of your weapon. When you use the Glass, you‚Äôll see a sprite surrounded by 10 glyphs and completing certain duties will reward Aetheric Density, slowly filling these glyphs and making them glow.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-aetheric-density-gathering" data-injectable="false"><strong>Aetheric Density gathering</strong></h3> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">Every duty that was introduced as part of the <em>Heavensward</em> expansion rewards Density, as long as it is completed while the Sharpened Anima weapon is equipped, but some offer more than others. Occasionally, you may receive a bonus amount of Density, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend hoping for this. You‚Äôll need to get a total of 2,000 Density in order to complete this quest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="71" data-current-count="71" data-injectable="false">Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of all duties and how much Density they offer:</p> <figure data-found-rows="8" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Density rewarded</strong></td><td><strong>Duties</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Vague (4)</td><td>Heavensward FATEs</td></tr><tr><td>Meager (8)</td><td>The Limitless Blue (Hard or Extreme)<br>Thok ast Thok (Hard or Extreme)</td></tr><tr><td>Vigorous (16)</td><td>Containment Bay S1T7 (Extreme)<br>The Minstrel‚Äôs Ballad: Nidhogg‚Äôs Rage<br>Alexander Raids</td></tr><tr><td>Robust (32)</td><td>Heavensward Dungeons<br>A Realm Reborn level 50 Dungeons (Excluding Pratorium and Castrum Meridianum)<br>Alexander Raids (Savage 1-4)<br>Containment Bay Z1T9 (Extreme)</td></tr><tr><td>Sturdy (64)</td><td>Heavensward Alliance Raids<br>Possible bonus from anything which offers Robust Density</td></tr><tr><td>Hardened (96)</td><td>Alexander Raids (Savage 9-12)</td></tr><tr><td>Stalwart (128)</td><td>Possible bonus from Alexander Raids (Savage 9-12)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">The easiest and quickest way to gather Density is through completing Alexander ‚Äì The Eyes of the Creator (Savage), also called A9S, 21 times (or less if you‚Äôre lucky enough to get a Stalwart bonus).</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">Once you‚Äôve completed this step, head back to Azys Lla and talk to Gerolt to complete this quest and obtain your Complete Anima weapon. But don‚Äôt celebrate yet. You‚Äôre not finished. Yes, you have the ‚Äòcomplete‚Äô Anima weapon, but there‚Äôs one more stage which turns your weapon into the Lux variant. Does it help if I tell you that you get a cute minion, too?</p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">To unlock the next stage, you have to complete two one-time quests. The first is called ‚Äú<strong>Body and Soul</strong>‚Äù, which is pretty straightforward and, when completed, will unlock the quest which allows you to upgrade your weapon to the Lux version. You only have to complete this quest for your first Anima weapon.</p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">The second is ‚Äú<strong>Words of Wisdom</strong>‚Äù. You need to complete this quest before you can upgrade to the Lux variant of your first weapon, but on the plus side, you won‚Äôt ever have to do it again. It‚Äôs a simple back and forth quest between Ardashir in Azys Lla and Rowena in Idyllshire. Once completed, you can move on to the final quest.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-best-friends-forever-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Best Friends Forever in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="16" data-current-count="16" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Lux</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">After the grind that you‚Äôve already gone through to get here, this will be easy. Speak to Ardashir and he‚Äôll tell you that you need to complete 12 Trials. These 12 Trials come in sets of three and can be completed in any order, but must be completed with your Complete Anima weapon equipped, and the first three must be completed before moving on to the next three, and so on:</p>
 <p data-characters="5" data-current-count="5" data-injectable="false"><strong>Set 1</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="125" data-injectable="false"> <li>The Bowl of Embers (Hard)</li> <li>The Howling Eye (Hard)</li> <li>The Navel (Hard)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="5" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false"><strong>Set 2</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false"> <li>Thornmarch (Hard)</li> <li>The Whorleater (Hard)</li> <li>The Striking Tree (Hard)</li> <li>The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="5" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false"><strong>Set 3</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false"> <li>Thok ast Thok (Hard)</li> <li>The Limitless Blue (Hard)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="5" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"><strong>Set 4</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li>Containment Bay S1T7</li> <li>Containment Bay P1T6</li> <li>Containment Bay Z1T9</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">Once you‚Äôve completed these Trials with your Complete Anima weapon in hand, head to Hismena in Idyllshire (or any Sundry Splendor) and pick up one bottle of Archaic Enchanted Ink for 500 Tomestones of Poetics.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="false">With that in your inventory, drag yourself back to Azys Lla for the final time, talk to Ardashir once more, and pick up your very pretty Lux weapon before deciding not to do another relic for a while ‚Äì at least until you‚Äôve mentally blocked out how much of a grind this actually was and another weapon makes you go ‚Äúooh, that‚Äôs pretty‚Äù.&nbsp;</p>

"And I truly hope that when you play the 2nd chapter of Senua's story, you will find that familiar connection once again, and so many more people will find their way to Senua and her world too." </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A message from Studio Head Dom Matthews ahead of our launch tomorrow. <a href="https://t.co/IH98qP9evv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IH98qP9evv</a></p>‚Äî Ninja Theory (@NinjaTheory) <a href="https://twitter.com/NinjaTheory/status/1792601275550302264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Matthews' message points out how many fans have reached out to Ninja Theory to express how important Senua means to them and how much their faith has inspired Ninja Theory to continue her story. Ninja Theory's first chapter in the series, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, was released in 2017, and both fans and critics praised it for its visuals, story, and depiction of psychosis, which many have said was the most remarkable thing about the original Hellblade. </p><p>"Its incredibly smart use of audio and visual distortion and trickery to convey the frightening effects of psychosis, hallucinations, and delusion, are married with the gameplay elements for an experience that rarely ever grapples over whether it's a game or a story," we <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/08/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review">wrote</a> in our review of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. </p><p>During the 2019 Game Awards, Ninja Theory announced that it was working on Hellblade 2. Some fans were disappointed with a few revelations ahead of its release, such as Hellblade 2 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-is-a-digital-only-release">not receiving a physical release</a> and the console version being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellblade-2-confirmed-to-run-at-30-fps-on-xbox-no-performance-mode-available">locked at 30 frames per second (FPS)</a>. </p><p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is out tomorrow on PC and Xbox.

This event runs from May 29 until June 26, and players will be tasked with collecting DNA samples to earn rewards and uncover the details about Season 4's DNA storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-and-modern-warfare-3-season-4-will-see-a-gundam-crossover/1100-6523564/" data-ref-id="1100-6523564">IP crossover is with Gundam</a>, which includes new shop bundles themed around the franchise. The Mobile Suit Gundam Legends event runs from June 5 until June 19, and earning XP during this time will unlock Gundam-themed rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Lasty, two other events are vaguely teased. One doesn't give a date or any details, with all information listed as "most secret," while a second "top secret" event is bookmarked for June 19 until June 26. One of these could be related to the secret collaboration teased on the roadmap, which could be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-4-release-date-and-details/1100-6523547/">rumored crossover with Fallout</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4305559-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305559" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4305559-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305559"></a><figcaption>Call of Duty Season 4 roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4305559-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Modern_Warfare_3">Modern Warfare 3</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 4 introduces three new 6v6 core multiplayer maps. Tokyo and Paris maps arrive at launch, with Tokyo being a nighttime city setting and Paris being a daytime map that gives players a view of the Eiffel Tower. The midseason update will add Incline, which is a snowy outpost in the mountains of Warzone's Urzikstan.</p><p dir="ltr">New game modes include Demolition and Hyper Cranked at launch, while a Headshots Only playlist and other new game modes will arrive at launch.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also includes new perks and killstreaks. Players can unlock a new Mission Control Vest perk that helps them earn killstreaks faster and a Compression Plate perk to aid in health regeneration. Four new killstreaks include the return of Call of Duty's I.M.S, missile drone, DNA Bomb, as well as the new Loitering Munition streak that allows players to leave an unmanned rocket drone in the sky.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">While Season 4 doesn't provide any new maps, it does make a change to Urzikstan by adding a mysterious DNA Bomb at Popov Power. The update also teases that the bunkers on the map will be accessible once players discover how to open them.</p><p dir="ltr">The gulag will receive four random 1v1 silo variants. Each silo has a slightly different map layout, so players will have a bit of variety when fighting for their second chance.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also brings the return of Warzone's Buy Back Royale Solo playlist for Urzikstan. Additional modes are teased as being "redacted," and possibly related to upcoming IP crossovers and the reveal of Call of Duty 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to new daily and weekly challenges, Season 4 introduces new Warzone Reward challenges.

The game also includes its own special events and new content.</p><p dir="ltr">The iconic Crash map from 2007's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is joining the game's small selection of multiplayer maps.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, there is a crash taking place on Verdansk, and players will want to investigate the site of the helicopter crash. The roadmap teases this area will have top-secret cargo, but the area may contain "toxic debris" with unnatural elements.</p><p dir="ltr">Rebirth Island will also have toxic elements, with green gas-filled barrels littered around the map. These are flammable, but destroying them will earn players special event points in an upcoming event.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty's next big season kicks off soon, and that means Activision is releasing another BlackCell DLC pack. The new BlackCell DLC for Season 4 once again delivers the good, as it includes multiple new operators, weapon blueprints with special tracers and death effects, and an impressive-sounding new finishing move.</p><p>The finishing move is called "Identity Theft," and it does just that. This finishing move kills your foe and then copies and equips their skin to yours. This stays in effect until your next death. This is seemingly a brand-new type of finishing move that's never been seen in Call of Duty before.</p>

<p>Of note, this new finishing move can only be equipped to Dupe or Copy, which are the two new operators included with the Season 4 BlackCell DLC.</p><p>The BlackCell DLC bundle also comes with the Ailed Caress BlackCell weapon blueprint for the Holger 556 assault rifle. This includes the Cellular Corruption tracers and the Necrosis death effects. Activision has not released any imagery or video of the death effects, but given the name--Necrosis--it sounds extreme.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4305551-screenshot2024-05-20at1.58.25pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4305551" data-ratio="0.56472491909385" data-width="618" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4305551-screenshot2024-05-20at1.58.25pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4305551"></a><figcaption>The newest BlackCell DLC bundle is out soon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4305551-screenshot2024-05-20at1.58.25pm.png"></figure><p>Everyone who buys the BlackCell DLC gets all of this, plus 1,100 COD points and access to the exclusive BlackCell sector of the battle pass map for Season 4.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> - aka Warner Smash Bros, or The Game Where Scooby-Doo‚Äôs Velma Punches Batman While LeBron James Decks The Iron Giant - hasn‚Äôt quite returned from its self-imposed exile after ending its open beta last year, but it‚Äôs already adding more Iconic Characters(‚Ñ¢) to its already teetering pile of familiar Licensed IP.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighter</a> already had the likes of (take a breath) Looney Tunes like Bugs Bunny, Taz and Marvin the Martian; Rick &amp; Morty (of Rick &amp; Morty); Tom &amp; Jerry (of Tom &amp; Jerry); Scooby-Doo‚Äôs Velma and Shaggy; Adventure Time‚Äôs Finn, Jake and, uh, a random Banana Guard; The Iron Giant‚Äôs Iron Giant; Game of Thrones‚Äô Arya Stark; Steven Universe‚Äôs Steven Universe and Garnet; and even a couple of Gremlins in Gizmo and Stripe. Oh, plus LeBron James - apparently appearing here due to his role in the new Space Jam - and a whole host of DC comics superheroes and villains like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Harley Quinn, Black Adam and The Joker, with Mark Hamill returning after an absence from Suicide Squad. Phew.</p>
<p>Warner Bros isn‚Äôt done chucking familiar faces from film and TV on the list, though, revealing that Friday the 13th‚Äôs Jason Voorhees and The Matrix‚Äôs Agent Smith - no Neo, yet - will also be finding their way into the platform fighter when it returns on May 28th. Jason will be in from the word go, while Agent Smith will pop up sometime during MultiVersus‚Äô first season of unlockables, which is titled Puns &amp; Villainy.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure whether to be impressive or exhausted by the sheer number of licensed characters crammed into MultiVersus, but I‚Äôll at least admit that it‚Äôs almost certainly the best shot at doing a Smash Bros-like with recognisable characters since Nintendo threw all their video game stars onto the Nintendo 64 25 years ago. (The less said about PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, the better.) Still, it‚Äôs hard not to cast a cynical eye on Warner Bros in particular, given their treatment of other video games and creators in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-leave-developers-feeling-sick-and-dizzy-as-more-adult-swim-games-are-being-delisted">the very recent past</a>.</p>

<p>Misgivings with the publisher aside, I do admire the commitment of developers Player First Games to take almost a full year to bring MultiVersus back, having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-open-beta-shutting-down-in-june-relaunching-in-2024">pulled it from sale and turned off the servers</a> after running an open beta from the summer of 2022 to last June. It was a contentious choice - not least because people had already paid real money to unlock stuff during its open beta - but hopefully the results will speak for themselves, having already impressed with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-lacks-that-nintendo-polish-but-its-still-a-slick-smash-bros-like-in-open-beta">a pretty slick offering in its pre-release form</a>.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve only got about a wait to week before we find out if the wait has finally been worth it, as MultiVersus arrives - with Jason and Agent Smith in tow - in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/almost-a-year-after-ending-its-open-beta-multiversus-will-return-on-may-28th">just over a week on May 28th</a>.</p>

			<p>Stellar Blade is certainly one of the most successful games released this year. The PlayStation 5 action game developed by South Korean developer Shift Up garnered widespread acclaim from critics and users alike when it launched last month. Our Kai Tatsumoto rated the game 9 out of 10 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his review</a>:</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta‚Äôs release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you‚Äôll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>
<p><em>Taking a step back from Kim Hung Tae's character designs for a moment, Stellar Blade is a phenomenal action RPG that evolves from the framework of NieR Replicant and NieR Automata to become one of the next cult classics.</em></p>
<p>It's no big surprise, then, that Shift Up has big plans for this IP. The South Korean studio is preparing its initial public offering (IPO) and <a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20240520000263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the documentation</a> includes some juicy information, including upcoming DLC, a PC port, and a sequel.</p>
<p><em>Our Stellar Blade showed early signs of success as an original IP, with the highest user score on Metacritic (9.3 out of 10) among PS5 games in its first week of release. This figure is higher than recognized AAA titles such as God of War: Ragnarok, Elden Ring, and Ghost of Tsushima.</em></p>
<p><em>Stellar Blade seeks to encourage participation from not only existing users but also new users by introducing new play elements such as DLC release, PC version release, and new IP collaboration.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the document, they wrote:</p>
<p><em>We are considering producing a PC version and sequel to Stellar Blade.</em></p>
<p>Shift Up isn't putting all its eggs in one basket, anyway. They are also making Project Witches, which they believe will be a big hit:</p>
<p><em>We have very high expectations for Project Witches as the next-generation mega subculture IP that will surpass Goddess of Victory: Nike.</em></p>
<p>Did you play Stellar Blade yet and if so, what did you think? Let us know in the comments.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's upcoming tactical shooter XDefiant is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-competitor-xdefiant-launches-on-may-21/1100-6523136/">set to launch</a> this week, and the publisher detailed the game's "in-game purchase philosophy" in a recent <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/1Xg1YrL6SEcqcuTDNIYSGz">blog post</a>. Most notably, the post says that XDefiant will allow players to unlock all purchasable "gameplay-impacting" content through challenges--or, as Ubisoft puts it, the game will lack "pay-to-win" mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post offers an example in the form of the DedSec faction, which players can either purchase or earn via an in-game challenge by collecting 700,000 XP. It also details how the game will reward the player's time through traditional live game mechanics such as free battle pass rewards, daily and weekly challenges, weapon mastery, and more. Ubisoft ends the post by listing the various content types in XDefiant, including the expected premium battle pass and a variety of character and weapon cosmetics.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> XDefiant - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Often described as Ubisoft's answer to the Call of Duty series, XDefiant will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-competitor-xdefiant-launches-on-may-21/1100-6523136/">launch</a> May 21 in preseason. The publisher recently revealed that the free-to-play shooter will not have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-continues-attracting-skill-based-matchmaking-complaints-xdefiant-goes-in-a-different-direction/1100-6523492/">skill-based matchmaking</a> in its casual play mode, a major contrast to Call of Duty. However, it will not feature ranked play at launch, with Ubisoft stating that the feature will come in a later season. In other Ubisoft news, the publisher recently canceled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/">The Division Heartland</a> to put more resources into XDefiant and the Rainbow Six series.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In 2011, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/" data-ref-id="5000-75614">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> concluded Infinity Ward's original Modern Warfare trilogy, with Captain Price emerging victorious over the terrorist Vladimir Makarov after a dramatic helicopter crash and rooftop battle. But a newly surfaced post-credits scene allegedly cut from the final product completely recontextualizes the ending to one of the greatest FPS trilogies of all time.</p><p dir="ltr">The cut scene is similar to the ending seen in the original game, but takes what is a clear victory in the finished scene and instead adds a layer of tragedy to it. In the original ending, after crashing through a rooftop window and seeing Makarov strangled to death, Captain Price lights up a celebratory cigar as the scene fades to black.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De7Axarv12E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/De7Axarv12E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">However, a post-credits scene allegedly found within the game's original files that has surfaced online (via Call of Duty modder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ruvlad/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vlad Lokitonov on YouTube</a>, with the scene in question restored by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-86Tufa0HFAUre1UBoEdw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yoyo1love</a>) continues to play out the ending. A slumped over Price wakes up to the sound of footsteps, and looks up to see a mysterious stranger off in the distance. The man briefly surveys Price's work and then turns around to leave. As he walks away, Price slumps over, his lit cigar falling from his hand and rolling away. The camera fades to black before an old image of his fallen comrades appears on screen.</p><p dir="ltr">In this ending, Price to succumbs to his wounds and dies from his encounter with Makarov. The identity of the unknown man who appears is said to be labeled as "shadowman" or "ominous stranger" in the game's files. His true identity will likely remain a mystery, but some fans have interpreted the stranger as representing death, having come to finally claim Price.</p><p dir="ltr">Had this cut post-credits scene made its way into the final game, it would have given a much different tone and ending to Infinity Ward's original Modern Warfare trilogy, with its hero dying in the end. With that in mind, it's easy to see why Infinity Ward maybe didn't want to end the trilogy on a bittersweet note, and instead opted to more definitively leave open the possibility of Price returning in a potential sequel. </p><p dir="ltr">That is, of course, if this cut ending is legitimate. As of now, it's impossible to know if this ending was actually found tucked away in the game's files for more than a decade or if this is a fan creation. Either way, it does add an interesting wrinkle to what would otherwise be a fairly standard ending to one of the greatest game trilogies ever made.</p><p dir="ltr">Infinity Ward is currently retelling and reimagining the story of its original Modern Warfare trilogy in last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-597446">Modern Warfare III</a>. Microsoft, which now owns Activision and its various studios, including Infinity Ward, will reportedly be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-rumored-to-be-black-ops-5-is-coming-to-game-pass-report/1100-6523538/" data-ref-id="1100-6523538">adding the next installment in the Call of Duty franchise to Game Pass</a> later this year. The game, which has not yet been officially unveiled, is rumored to be a new entry in the Black Ops subseries.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuthering-waves-%E2%80%93-all-confirmed-1-0-launch-rewards.876489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-all-confirmed-launch-rewards/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wuthering-waves-all-confirmed-launch-rewards<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The official launch of <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is finally upon us, and with it, comes a whole slew of rewards you‚Äôll get for playing the release. If you‚Äôre curious about what kinds of goodies you‚Äôll be getting, here‚Äôs a list of all the confirmed rewards for the 1.0 launch.</p> <h2 id="h-all-official-wuthering-waves-launch-rewards-for-1-0" data-injectable="false">All Official <em>Wuthering Waves</em> Launch Rewards for 1.0</h2> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">The following set of rewards are what you‚Äôll have access to once you load up the game for the first time. Some of the rewards will take a bit of time to unlock, but are available nonetheless. I‚Äôll provide a bit of context for each as well, in case you‚Äôre out of the loop.</p> <h3 id="h-five-star-character-selector" data-injectable="false">Five-Star Character Selector</h3> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="721" data-injectable="true">Players will have the opportunity to choose which of the five-star standard characters they wish to guarantee when starting <em>Wuthering Waves. </em>The way this works is a bit strange, but stick with me and you‚Äôll get it. First, you‚Äôll need to <strong>pull a random five-star character</strong> from the <strong>Beginner‚Äôs Banner</strong> to access the selector. From here, you‚Äôll be given the option to select which five-star you want to focus on. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true">However, the selected character <strong>is not given for free</strong>, so you‚Äôll potentially still need to reach the pity to get your selected character. This is more like selecting which character banner you want to focus on, rather than selecting the character itself. Even so, this is a fantastic launch reward as it means that most people will have at least one five-star character of their choice and two five-stars overall, on day one.</p>
 <h3 id="h-20-pulls-milestone-reward" data-injectable="false">20 Pulls Milestone Reward</h3> <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">Thanks to the combined effort of the entire global community around <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, all players, <strong>regardless of whether you are pre-registered or not</strong>, will be getting 20 free banner pulls right at release. This is huge, as it means we‚Äôre all that much closer to getting a five-star character. This addition comes as the milestone reward for Wuthering Waves reaching 30 million pre-registrations, an absolutely colossal number that proves that there‚Äôs a ton of interest and hype surrounding the game.</p>
 <h3 id="h-four-star-weapon-selector" data-injectable="false">Four-Star Weapon Selector</h3> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">All players will be given the ability to select their four-star weapon of choice at the launch of <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. While we don‚Äôt know the hard specifics of when exactly we‚Äôll be able to make the selection, expect it to be very soon after getting started in the game, as four-star weapons are not exactly premium items like five-star weapons are. Personally, I‚Äôm planning to use my four-star selector on a gauntlet weapon type, as I‚Äôm planning to choose Jianxin as my five-star character of choice.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-200-astrite" data-injectable="false">200 Astrite</h3> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">In addition to all of the above, players will be getting a bit of extra help when it comes to pulling in the form of 200 Astrite. If you‚Äôre not aware of what Astrite is, it is the premium currency you‚Äôll be actively hunting the game world for, for extra pulls on premium banners. Even though 200 is not much, it is still a nice addition considering everything else we‚Äôre all getting.</p>
 <h3 id="h-40-pulls-from-union-levels" data-injectable="false">40 Pulls from Union Levels</h3> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Though technically not a launch reward, I figured it would be important to include this tidbit of information for those planning to use their pulls strategically. Your account level in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is called <strong>Union Level</strong>, and as you progress through the game, locating chests, completing quests, and exploring the world, your Union Level will increase over time. </p> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">At certain points, you‚Äôll get access to additional Pulls for a total count of <strong>40 Pulls</strong> upon reaching the max level. This undoubtedly going to take some time to accomplish as, like all gacha games, account progression is time-gated by a Stamina system. So, don‚Äôt expect to get all 40 of these pulls right at release.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-a-5-star-weapon-selector-from-union-level" data-injectable="false">A 5-Star Weapon Selector from Union Level</h3> <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="770" data-injectable="true"> All players can expect to have at least one five-star weapon on their account via the free five-star weapon selector obtained through Union Level progression. This was actually available in the final CBT2 test for <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, and was obtainable at either Union Level 35 or 45 (I don‚Äôt recall which). Despite this, I fully expect this selector to obtained around the same Union Level. If it is, then know that it will take a week or two to reach this reward. </p>
 <h3 id="h-20-more-pulls-from-appreciation-of-support" data-injectable="false">20 more Pulls from Appreciation of Support</h3> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Thanks to all the hype and support shown by the community surrounding <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, Kuro Games has decided to give all players an additional 20 extra Pulls as a gesture of appreciation. Coupled with all the additional pulls obtained from the above rewards, and all the Astrite available for harvest at launch, I fully expect most players to be swimming in five stars early on.</p> <h3 id="h-gifts-of-thawing-frost-event" data-injectable="false">Gifts of Thawing Frost Event</h3> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">At release, logging into <em>Wuthering Waves</em> consecutively will earn you eight additional pulls over seven days, and even the four-star character, Sanhua, on day five. A full character as a reward is always a good thing. I can especially vouch for Sanhua, as she was my main DPS during the CBT2 beta.</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false"><em>Wuthering Waves </em>is officially slated to release on <strong>May 22, 2024</strong>, on <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Mobile</strong> platforms. If you‚Äôre looking to reap the benefits of these rewards as soon as possible, then I recommend jumping in. After personally playing CBT2, I know I will be.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vecna-eve-of-ruin-d-d-5e-review-a-culmination-of-years-of-work.876468/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vecna-eve-of-ruin-dd-5e-review-culmination-of-years-of-work<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2024 is the big year of the<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 50th Anniversary, and for such a big year it only makes sense that we're getting some pretty big releases. This includes&nbsp;<em>The Making Of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> a new set of Core Rulebooks, and their capstone adventure for 5th Edition,&nbsp;<em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em>. And while it's filled with massive set pieces, cameos, and high stakes, just how well does <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em> fare as a cataclysmic show-stopping adventure?</p>

<h2>What is <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em>?</h2>

<p>Before we get into the content of the book I want to first talk about what it actually is.&nbsp;<em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em> is a level 10-20 adventure for 4-6 characters written for the 5th Edition of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. While this year will see a new Core Rules update/release, the name is expected to remain 5th Edition -- so it's important to note which came before or after.</p>



<p>The adventure itself takes place over 186 pages - added to that page count is further information on about 33 new Monsters, as well as detailed dossier pages on 11 important characters. The dossier pages are intended to be 'cheat sheets' for DMs so that you don't need to scrounge around online to learn just why Kas the Betrayer or Miska the Wolf-Spider are important and where their allegiances may lie. More on how useful that is later though...</p>

<h2>Danger To The Multiverse</h2>

<p>In <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin </em>the players begin their adventure by being hired by the Lord of Neverwinter to investigate the disappearances of a few high-profile members of Neverwinter society. Through Chapter 1 the party rescues these residents but also get themselves entwined in the activity of various Cults of Vecna.</p>

<p>Having become connected to Vecna through a misfiring ritual the party is informed by powerful spellcasters - Lady Alustriel Silverhand, Mordenkainen, and Tasha - that they're the only ones who have the ability to collect the different segments of the Rod of Seven Parts and use it to track down and seal away Vecna.</p>



<p>It's a classic setup, there's a big bad rising to power and it's up to the party to collect Macguffins and then face the final foe. Interestingly, the premise is not that dissimilar from the major call to action and collection of themed magical items as <em>D&amp;D 5th Edition'</em>s first adventures <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen </em>and <em>The Rise of Tiamat</em>, which has since been re-bundled as <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em>.</p>

<p>While I say the setup is classic that is in no way to say that's it's dull or that anything about being a classic takes away from it's presentation or execution.</p>

<p>As I continued to read through the adventure, learning of the different locations of hidden pieces of the Rod it was exciting to read how the book was doubling down into high-fantasy tropes and really reveling in the history of<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</em></p>



<p>The Party gets to spend time with the famous spellcasters I mentioned earlier, face off against the biggest of the big bads of <em>D&amp;D</em>, and there are even a number of important cameos like Strahd Von Zarovich. It's not just the important people that get highlighted either as this adventure will begin in the Forgotten Realms but very quickly travel to the <a>Shadowfell</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/planescape-adventures-in-multiverse-review-player-options-still-disappoint">Sigil</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/van-richtens-guide-to-ravenloft-review">Barovia</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/spelljammer-adventures-in-space-review">the Astral Plane</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dragonlance-shadow-of-dragon-queen-review">Krynn</a>, and more.</p>

<p>Having watched the 5th Edition release cycle get each of these locations in the minds of players over the past five years an adventure like this does feel like "The Avengers" of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</em></p>

<h2>High-Level Combat Slowing The Adventure</h2>

<p>Being a high-level adventure there is a lot of dungeon crawling, you won't spend as much time in an 'overworld' state looking for clues or interacting with the world.</p>



<p>This is definitely a side-effect of having crammed so many locations into a single adventure, but also when you start as Level 10 and end the campaign as walking deities a stroll between villages is likely going to detract from your adventure as opposed to enhancing it.</p>

<p>Spending time in these dungeon crawls will lead to a lot of combat. I don't have many issues with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> combat, but there were times in the early half of this campaign that a lot of combat felt more like a speed bump than anything to enhance the experience.</p>

<p>I understand the need to have combat, but fewer and more complex combat encounters will always be my preference over larger but trivial combat.</p>



<p>Within Chapter 1, traditionally used to deliver a plot hook and get the players involved, the story opens with a dungeon crawl that includes eight combat encounters. Some encounters offer a refreshing battle against a Water Elemental or Balgura, while the rest are Wights or various levels of Cultists/Necromancers.</p>

<p>The reprieve from a lot of this combat comes in the back half of the book. The party will delve into the trapped Tomb of Wayward Souls or infiltration of the Red Belvedere casino. While combat is not totally absent the balance between roleplay and combat is much better.</p>

<h2>Secrets As A Currency</h2>

<p>A new mechanic introduced is that the party will be able to collect currencies as secrets throughout their adventure. This skill is one granted to them by their strange connection with Vecna.</p>

<p>There are seventeen secrets that can be collected and they can be spent to grant the party advantage on all rolls for the next minute. Obviously, a massive boon to have in the midst of battle but could also be used in a dire moment to clutch a successful persuasion roll in combat.</p>



<p>The flip side of this very valuable and limited currency is how secrets can be used in the final conflict with Vecna aka The God of Secrets. With each collected secret the players can go from having inspiration at the start of the battle, all the way up to having permanent advantage on any Constitution Saving Throws.</p>

<p>I know from my own players that when I hand them powerful objects they tend to save them for paramount battles, a mechanic like this is the ultimate 'save the big weapon for the end of the game' to reward players for their months of exploration for secrets and their unwillingness to let those secrets go.</p>

<h2>Character Dossiers Are More Like Paragraphs</h2>

<p>One of the aspects that was emphasized during pre-release was the inclusion of character dossiers to better help DMs who might not be familiar with 50 years of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> lore but want to understand more about characters like Kas the Betrayer and Lolth the Spider Queen. Some characters do get a sizable amount of fleshed-out information, like Lolth, but Lord Soth only gets four sentences and Tasha only gets two paragraphs.</p>



<p>Realistically this won't have the greatest impact as with most NPCs a DM will add their own shine to it and create a performance in their own way, but for such important characters with plot integral to the adventure these dossiers are more than likely just going to prompt those running the game to start looking through Wikis as they would with other important NPC.</p>

<h2><em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em>&nbsp;Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There is a lot going on throughout <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em>. You can see the dedication to create a grand adventure, hitting up some of <em>D&amp;D</em> history's most important characters and visiting the most interesting locations, but there's also some places where it stumbles or loses pace.</p>

<p>If you're a DM ready to lead a party all the way to level 20 then it's good that there's a book that will take you there, and that it's an adventure of the highest caliber.</p>

<p>I am afraid for many players the adventure will start sluggish, with combat for the sake of combat, and it might not feel like much progression is being made, but once they reach the back half of the adventure they'll get a much better balance.</p>

<p>Overall this is a very high-fantasy adventure that really doubles down on what it is to be that classic take on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, ultimately for better or worse. If that's your bag then you're going to have a grand time.</p>

                            While Vecna: Eve of Ruin starts off slow with exposition and dungeon crawls filled with boring combat that very quickly changes as you progress to the back half of the campaign. Players will then get to truly flex all of their D&amp;D abilities engaging with famous NPC in many known regions of the D&amp;D world.

Comedy-wise you can pick up with <em>Mulligan</em> season 2 on Netflix, or else usher in the summer season with the season 3 finale of <em>Abbott Elementary</em>. If you‚Äôre in for reality, there‚Äôs two flavors: <em>The Kardashians</em>, who are off to conquer fashion week, or the conclusion of <em>Jeopardy! Masters</em>, to see who‚Äôs the best Jeopardy of them all (I‚Äôm kidding, I know that‚Äôs now what you call the <em>Jeopardy!</em> champions). </p>
<p id="x1Trr4">For sweet and sappy (non-derogatory) there‚Äôs <em>Trying</em> season 4 on Apple TV Plus, while headier drama comes to a head in <em>The Sympathizer</em>‚Äôs finale on Sunday.

Halloween in May? <em>Evil</em>‚Äôs back! </p>

It was biting, bittersweet, and bitchily hilarious.<br></p><p><em>Kotaku</em> reached out to the team behind <em>Drag Her!</em> to learn more about what they wanted the game to be, what they learned about developing a game in a still mostly homogenous industry that‚Äôs hemorrhaging talent, and their gratitude for their community. </p><figure id="" data-id="0d30f79765a526224c4aaabce44ad733" data-recommend-id="image://0d30f79765a526224c4aaabce44ad733" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A picture of a gay bar with &quot;Drag Her&quot; emblazoned on it and spotlights emanating from it.

Drag queens are visually iconic‚Äîthey often have their own unique ways of ‚Äúpainting‚Äù (doing their makeup) or ‚Äúpadding‚Äù (creating a feminine figure), and are always dressed to impress in bold colors, sequins, and mile-high wigs. They already <em>look</em> like video game characters, and they‚Äôd be instantaneously recognizable in a fighting game lineup. Plus they are notoriously catty, frequently ‚Äúreading‚Äù (dissing) each other and throwing barbs about each other‚Äôs style, personality, or ‚Äúmugs‚Äù (faces). That their reading sessions could eventually devolve into a slap fest isn‚Äôt just believable, it‚Äôs surprising it hasn‚Äôt happened on TV yet.<br></p><p><em>Drag Her!‚Äô</em>s small dev team put together a demo, which got them a grant from the International Game Developers Association, and then they launched a Kickstarter. They had signed several iconic drag performers, including Alaska 5000, Kim Chi, Laganja Estranja, and drag king Landon Cider to be a part of the game‚Äôs roster. ‚ÄúSo many of them were gamers and eager to see this brought to life,‚Äù Ramsay said. ‚ÄúWhen we set out to make this, we wanted to ensure the queens &amp; kings came as equal partners in the project. They were paid for their voice and likeness, as well as providing feedback and having final say on their character‚Äôs design. We were fans first, and ultimately wanted them to feel happy with their project. Fun fact: every drag star wants to be taller than one other!‚Äù<br></p><p>And though the team‚Äôs Kickstarter and its nearly 1,000 backers helped ‚Äúmoved the needle significantly,‚Äù they ran into serious problems when it came time to find a publisher.</p><figure id="" data-id="018fe5b8761bf572b7d5ed16bbc8b0f0" data-recommend-id="image://018fe5b8761bf572b7d5ed16bbc8b0f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alaska tries to use her long tongue to attack Kim Chi, who blocks it with a donut.

In their quest to find a company willing to shell out cash to help scale up production and eventually get the game on storefronts, Ramsay told <em>Kotaku</em> that they got some ‚Äúwild and hilarious‚Äù feedback.<br></p><p>‚ÄúWe had a Polish publisher state that gay people don‚Äôt play games, and he knew that because he went to a gay bar in Krakow once,‚Äù Ramsay said. ‚ÄúBut the only real consistent and poignant feedback was a wariness of the fighting game genre; one which is dominated by a few big players with few indie successes to point to‚Ä¶I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt think the femme-forward cast and overt LGBT+ themes didn‚Äôt invite further scrutiny.‚Äù<br></p><p>Ramsay continued:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We were at an unfortunate nexus of market pressure and need to drive shareholder val‚Äîlol no, really we were just too gay. It‚Äôs well-known where the most capital is concentrated, and we were a developer and audience demographic that existed well outside of the norm.</p><p>Despite signing deals with Sony and Xbox, sweeping first place at awards shows like AT&amp;T Unlocked, despite curating a killer audience, and earning darling indie status at game festivals, no amount of legitimacy would ever broach the divide between us and the people who hold the pursestrings.</p><p>We spent many years educating very boring men on the commercial and cultural impact of drag, but very often we were just stared at as if we grew a third head. While people in power were rooting for us, they weren‚Äôt supporting us materially, and so eventually, we fell.</p></blockquote><p>The team‚Äôs announcement of the game‚Äôs ‚Äúfailure to launch‚Äù spoke of their plans to ‚Äúshowcase the sheer joy of queer culture,‚Äù something that is far too often either obfuscated or forced to the margins in this industry. Queer characters in games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lifeweaver-overwatch-2-pansexual-season-4-support-hero-1850294521&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lifeweaver-overwatch-2-pansexual-season-4-support-hero-1850294521"><em>Overwatch</em> aren‚Äôt all that noticeably queer</a></span> when you play them, you‚Äôd only know they were if you were into the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-baptiste-bisexual-pride-event-lifeweaver-1850493499&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-baptiste-bisexual-pride-event-lifeweaver-1850493499">lore that exists outside of matchmaking</a></span>. <em>Drag Her! </em>was a bold attempt to take a very masculine space‚Äîfighting games‚Äîand unabashedly queer it. It‚Äôs a shame that we didn‚Äôt get a chance to see it in its most gagworthy, divalicious form, but Ramsay and the team are ‚Äúgrateful for the outpouring of love and support.‚Äù<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.5337058171.6710/raf,360x360,075,t,fafafa:ca443f4786.jpg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.5337058171.6710/raf,360x360,075,t,fafafa:ca443f4786.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diva down</a></span>, but not for long.<br></p><p>‚ÄúWhile the industry is experiencing some of its most painful attrition in years, indies are still out there releasing some of the most well-received games on Steam.

I have hope that there continues to be a nascent market for queer indie titles, and I need other LGBT+ folk to continue to thrive, survive, and flourish.‚Äù<br></p><p><strong>Update, 05/20/2024, 2:40 p.m. ET: </strong>Removed reference to <em>Apex Legends</em>,&nbsp;its queer representation is pretty decent.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-64-unopenable-door-opened-cool-mountain-1851481734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-64-unopenable-door-opened-cool-mountain-1851481734"><em>Super Mario 64</em></a></span> mod that basically turns the classic platformer into <em>Super</em> <em>Mari0 64 Maker. </em></p><p>On May 19, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Rovertronic/status/1792208591442825268&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Rovertronic/status/1792208591442825268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modder and fan developer Rovertronic</a></span> released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://romhacking.com/hack/mario-builder-64&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://romhacking.com/hack/mario-builder-64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mario Builder 64</em></a></span>, a new mod for the original <em>Super Mario 64 </em>game that lets you build your own levels using easy-to-use menus and controls. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/MUFL5ObkxCY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/MUFL5ObkxCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watching the mod in action</a></span>, it looks as good as something officially made by Nintendo. </p><p>Setting up <em>Mario Builder 64</em> isn‚Äôt as easy as just putting <em>Mario Maker 2</em>'s cart into your Switch and hitting play, but luckily <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rentry.co/mb64-setup-guide&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://rentry.co/mb64-setup-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there is a full guide</a></span> on getting the mod up and running that will walk you through the steps.

<p>Paradox‚Äôs Sims competitor Life By You will no longer be releasing in Early Access on June 4. The studio made the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-life-by-you-release-date.1680458/">announcement via a forum post</a> on Monday afternoon.</p>



<p>‚ÄúAfter much consideration, we regret to announce that we have decided to retract Life by You‚Äôs Early Access release date, previously set for June 4th,‚Äù Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja said. </p>



<p>‚ÄúThis was not an easy decision, especially since we understand the anticipation and excitement that many players have for the game. However, we believe that additional development time is needed.‚Äù</p>



<p>As far as a new release date for Life By You Early Access, Lilja didn‚Äôt reveal what it would be. Instead, he said the company decided to hold off on setting a new date.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWhile we would have preferred to commit to a new release window, we believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead, rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe will provide more information as soon as possible, until then we want to sincerely thank you for your continued support and patience.‚Äù</p>



<p>When it releases, Life By You will be available on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/10-best-anime-to-watch-for-gamers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Venn diagram of gamers and anime fans seems to be inching closer to a circle every year. Which makes sense as both art forms have similarly niche origins and are now both more mainstream and accessible to a global audience than any prior point in their histories. Just as there are a wealth of games today that are chock full of anime vibes, there are loads of anime with a connection to the gaming space. </p><p>Whether they be surprisingly great adaptations of a video game, about the experience of being a gamer/game creator, or make playing a game central to their plot; these are the best anime about video games that you can watch today. </p><h2><strong>Remake Our Life!</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/remake-our-life-14342-1-1716222376857.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Feel, Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Remake our Life! opens with 28-year-old Kyouya Hashiba completely burnt out on his life and career. The game development studio he worked for went bankrupt and the liferaft of a project he scrambled to join was canceled shortly after he came aboard. This leaves Kyouya with little choice but to move back in with his parents and question all of his major life decisions. Magically, he wakes up ten years in the past just as he‚Äôs about to enter college, and vows to make a better future for himself. </p><p>Layoffs, studio closures, and general career instability are fixtures of the gaming industry in 2024, and it‚Äôs cathartic to see Remake Our Life! address the realities of working in this industry from the get go. What follows this first episode is a cozy exploration of young, passionate people learning first hand about the highs and lows of working in creative fields like game development. If you work in any industry in the digital media bubble and feel the dread that‚Äôs related to that bubble deflating over the past half a year, this anime is a heartwarming reminder of why we got into this line of work and how the highs more than make up for the lows. </p><p>Remake Our Life!<em> </em>is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GKEH2GZX9/remake-our-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a>. </p><h2><strong>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/07/untitled-1-1654597014758.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Netflix, Trigger, Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Is an anime that‚Äôs functionally a commercial for a video game that was so broken at launch that it was delisted from storefronts arguably the least punk thing ever? Yes, but even the haters have to admit that studio Trigger‚Äôs Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is a lavishly produced spectacle that serves as a solid entryway to the broader anime landscape. It‚Äôs also a fantastic example of the looser approach to adaptation that makes so many anime based on video games feel like a delightful expansion of those universes. </p><p>Taking place in Night City, the principal location of both Cyberpunk: 2077 and the Cyberpunk tabletop game, this anime follows David Martinez, a young man who becomes an augmented mercenary, or edgerunner, after a drive-by shooting kills his mother. What follows is a gripping story about people trying to have any semblance of comfort or security under late stage capitalism, and that system beating them back down at every possible opportunity. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is a great anime if you‚Äôre in the mood for a cool looking, feel-bad time. </p><p>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is streaming on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81054853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>. </p><h2><strong>Pok√©mon</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/02/27/ash-ketchum-194535-1280x0-1519756985354.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Pokemon</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>With how ubiquitous the franchise is to both American and global audiences, it‚Äôs both weird and necessary to point out that the Pok√©mon anime is, in fact, an anime! Before Pok√©mon was a multimedia juggernaut, it was a couple of video games that sold well enough to adapt the games into an anime. What would follow is a decades spanning television show with over 1,200 episodes that proved integral to making Pok√©mon the cultural institution it is today. </p><p>While we would get some more direct anime versions of the Pok√©mon<em> </em>Red and Blue games in the form of Pok√©mon Origins, the mainline Pok√©mon anime decides to follow a new character, Ash Ketchum, as he explores the world of Pok√©mon on his journey to become a Pok√©mon Master. This direction for the anime plays into the greatest strength of the Pok√©mon games; the terrific worldbuilding that inspires a player to imagine their own adventure in this world. Seeing a fleshed out version of this new trainer's journey fed into the fantasy and and created countless lifelong video game and anime fans. </p><p>Use this <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/animation/where-to-watch-pokemon-episodes-movies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official guide</a> to figure out where you can watch the many iterations of the Pok√©mon anime.</p><h2><strong>Castlevania</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/05/05/csv4-401-master-v01-01-03-18-10-still014-1620250560786.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Frederator Studios, Netflix</figcaption></figure></output><p>Though developed by Frederator Studios and Powerhouse Animation Studios, two US based production companies, the Castlevania show is simply too sick to not count as an honorary anime! Loosely following the events of the games, the Castlevania anime follows Trevor Belmont, and later his descendent, as he and his vampire hunting contemporaries battle Dracula and his demonic horde.</p><p>Castlevania excels at nailing the tone and ambience of the games it's based on better than any of the other video game adaptations on this list. While the exploration elements of the Castlevania games would prove foundational in developing game design ‚Äî hence the metroidvania genre ‚Äî people were coming to Castlevania games for the vibes! The<em> </em>Castlevania anime perfectly captures the gothic action that the games invoke and the absolute thrill of charging in against an untold number of monstrosities in a battle against a legendary fiend. </p><p>Castlevania is streaming on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80095241" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Netflix</u></a>. </p><h2><strong>All the Persona Anime</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/02/05/screen-shot-2015-02-05-at-135153png-ac4ac1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Atlus</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>As one might guess from their overtly anime artstyle, there are a host of anime adaptations of the most recent Persona games! There are a total of four Persona 3 movies, a loose sequel to Persona 3 titled Persona -trinity soul-, two different anime series adapting Persona 4, a Persona 5: The Animation series, and several other Persona 5 one-shot anime episodes. These adaptations are more straightforward than the other adaptations of video games on this list, generally being closer to retellings of the games they are based on. </p><p>Considering those games are 80+ hours of some of the more difficult and demanding turn based gameplay in the genre, these direct adaptations are more than welcome! The <em>Persona</em> series is more popular than it's ever been, and these anime are a great way to see what all the fuss is about without committing a good chunk of your time and money to them.</p><p>The Persona 3 movies are available for purchase on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PERSONA3-Movie-1-Spring-Birth/dp/B07K2J9HFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, the Persona 4: Golden anime is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GR9P3GND6/persona4-the-golden-animation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a>, and Persona 5: The Animation is streaming on <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/6507e2ba-9faf-49e9-978f-6718a365c4fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hulu </a>and <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G6VDWKM76/persona5-the-animation?utm_campaign=media_actions&amp;utm_medium=deep_link&amp;utm_source=google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a>. Persona -trinity soul- is unlicensed in the US.   </p><h2><strong>Sword Art Online</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/aaaabzurbgy43kufxe0mze0pykgszvpf-1716222658601.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: A-1 Pictures</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>The 2010s mega-hit Sword Art Online is the reason why there are so many anime today that take place in fantasy worlds incorporating video game mechanics. Trapped in a brand new virtual reality MMORPG, also titled Sword Art Online, our protagonist Kirito has to fight for his life as he can only escape by beating the game and will die in real life if he dies while playing. </p><p>This anime is first and foremost a power fantasy for its presumed young, male audience; but its blending of the game of death and sci-fi genres is still novel and appealing today. Video games are better than any other artistic medium at making a player feel great for engaging with the art form and slowly mastering a game's systems and mechanics. Sword Art Online<em> </em>does an amazing job of translating that feeling into an anime and the first half of its first season is a rock solid experience that anime fans new and old should check out.</p><p>Sword Art Online is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GR49G9VP6/sword-art-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Crunchyroll</u></a> and <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/e95d9367-ee0f-425c-b8c7-472962669b58" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Hulu</u></a>. </p><h2><strong>Welcome to the N.H.K. </strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/0wxl-mqrqj4wo-9yd-1716222819998.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Gonzo K.K.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In many ways the polar opposite of Remake Our Life!, Welcome to the N.H.K. is an anime about how passions around media, and possibly creating media like video games, are sometimes the only things that keep people going. This anime follows Tatsuhiro Sato, a hikikomori ‚Äî a social recluse who refuses to or is unable to engage with society or even leave their home or bedroom ‚Äî who‚Äôs turned to conspiracy theories to explain his unhappiness and niche, often problematic, media to dull his depression. To try to better himself, Sato helps his more socially attuned neighbor develop an eroge game and is forced by a good samaritan to go outside for more than just food. This anime spends most of its runtime, though, exploring Sato‚Äôs deeply misanthropic mentalities. </p><p>Welcome to the N.H.K.<em> </em>is a weird anime that‚Äôs as critical of its main character and subject matter as it is through in its exploration of the real-life beliefs and ideologies that its protagonist embodies. To offer a point of comparison, if you liked the tone and politics of the No More Heroes games, Welcome to the N.H.K.<em> </em>is more than worth checking out.</p><p>Welcome to the N.H.K. is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G6MGNDGW6/welcome-to-the-n-h-k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Crunchyroll</u></a>. </p><h2><strong>Dragon Quest: Adventures of Dai</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/dqdai-1716222972285.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Toei Animation Co., Ltd.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>Unless this is your first time reading an article on a video game website ‚Äî in which case, welcome and thanks for choosing this one ‚Äî you‚Äôve probably heard of the monumental Dragon Quest gaming franchise. What you might not know, though, is that these games inspired the quietly seminal shonen manga series Dragon Quest: Adventures of Dai, and that this manga was recently adapted into an anime! Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai<em> </em>follows a young boy raised by monsters named Dai, who turns out to be a legendary hero and, in typical Dragon Quest fashion, has to save the world from the Demon Lord. </p><p>Adventures of Dai is a solid, all ages watch and a great way to learn about the origins of many storytelling conventions in the shonen anime genre. The manga it's based on ran in the iconic Shonen Jump magazine right after Fist of the North Star<em> </em>wrapped, and released alongside more overtly influential genre staples like Dragon Ball and JoJo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure. Especially with Dragon Quest character designer Akira Toriyama‚Äôs recent passing, there‚Äôs never been a better time to check out this anime and see how games have been quietly influential on the anime medium for decades. </p><p>Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai<em> </em>is streaming on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81374392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GYXM79M56/dragon-quest-the-adventure-of-dai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a>, and <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/33732b5e-eac3-4c6e-a467-8ae8b9a393cf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hulu</a>. </p><h2><strong>My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/yamada9999-1716223032885.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Madhouse, Inc., Prime Video</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>One of the most grounded anime about video games, My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999<em> </em>focuses on the lives and relationships of the gamers who make up its main cast. Following a breakup with an ex who cheated on her, Akane Kinoshita ends up meeting the standoffish Akito Yamada while playing the MMO that her ex got her into. What follows is a cozy, slice of life romance that‚Äôs a great watch for anyone looking for a new comfort show. </p><p>For as popular as gaming is today, it‚Äôs strange that there are so few stories that show how casually games fit into people‚Äôs lives. My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999<em> </em>is a great depiction of gaming as a hobby and how meaningful the relationships formed thanks to that hobby are to people. </p><p>My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999<em> </em>is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GNVHKNPQ7/my-love-story-with-yamada-kun-at-lv999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll.</a></p><h2><strong>Log Horizon</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/log-horizon-1716223152371.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Satelight</figcaption></figure></output><p>If Sword Art Online is the anime that popularized the ‚Äútrapped in a game‚Äù sub-genre, then Log Horizon is the anime that perfected that kind of storytelling. For as strong an opening as SAO has, it doesn‚Äôt really ground itself in the mechanics and unique tensions that any seasoned MMO player knows all too well. After all, MMO players know that there‚Äôs plenty of story material to be mined from the gameplay and social dimensions of this kind of game; like the process of researching a dungeon, planning a raid, and then convincing guild or party members to go along to with the plan and stick to their assigned roles. </p><p>Log Horizon<em> </em>faithfully brings these situations and processes to life. It also helps that<em> Log Horizon‚Äôs</em> protagonist, Shiroe, plays as a dedicated support class and is less of a vehicle for audience projection than Kirito is in SAO. Log Horizon<em> </em>understands the unique drama and experiences that video games can provide, and is easily one of the best anime about video games. </p><p>Log Horizon<em> </em>is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRVNMG93Y/log-horizon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a>. </p><p><em>Lucas de Ruyter is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

While players will explore a tale of honor, justice, and belonging as Yasuke, Naoe will serve as a stealthy option who is inspired by the roots of the Assassin's Creed series. The fictional daughter of historical figure Fujibayashi Nagato, Naoe operates from the shadows with her ninja skills.</p><h3>Story and setting</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305513-acshadows%2826%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305513" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305513-acshadows%2826%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305513"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows will let you explore central Japan.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305513-acshadows%2826%29.jpg"></figure><p>Starting in 1579, Assassin's Creed Shadows is kicks off during a pivotal moment of history for Japan. The Azuchi-Momoyama period saw a transition from the brutal wars of the Sengoku era to the more peaceful times of the Edo period as the influence of the samurai began to wane. Portuguese merchants and Jesuit missionaries began to appear more frequently, and players can expect to encounter real-life people like Oda Nobunaga and the Iga clan's ninja master Fujibayashi Nagato.</p><p>While Ubisoft isn't ready to spill the beans yet on the story, it has confirmed that the game has a non-linear campaign focused on eliminating targets. You'll be able to take them out in any order, and the challenge of assassinating them varies from target to target. Some of your marks might be encountered while you're exploring Japan, while others will require you to plan an infiltration mission to take them out from inside their strongholds.</p><p>Most of the quests can be completed as either Yasuke or Naoe, although both characters will have unique missions.</p><h3>Stealth</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305514-acshadows%2825%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305514" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305514-acshadows%2825%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305514"></a><figcaption>Naoe is a master of stealth</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305514-acshadows%2825%29.jpg"></figure><p>Yasuke and Naoe play very differently from each other when it comes to stealth. Naoe can use her ninja skills to infiltrate enemy strongholds, whereas Yasuke's bigger build and heavy armor makes him better suited for briefly hiding from foes and then ambushing them. Ubisoft says that the game makes use of a new global illumination system to create dynamic light and shadows, which in turn affect enemy vision. You'll be able to hide in the darkness, eliminate sources of light, and a light meter will show just how hidden you really are.</p><p>Other stealth options include the ability to knock out foes instead of killing them, crawling along the ground when in a prone position, and Eagle Vision returns. This special ability once again lets you spot enemies through walls and identify them, as Shadows will not feature the eagle reconnaissance system that was used to mark foes in Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla.</p><p>Naoe also has a grappling hook that can be used to quickly get out of harm's way by climbing into the ceiling space above corridors. This also puts her in a prime position to ambush enemies, and the tool can be used to climb up to the roofs of buildings when outside.</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305515-acshadows%2827%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305515" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305515-acshadows%2827%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305515"></a><figcaption>Yasuke has a diverse arsenal to master</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305515-acshadows%2827%29.jpg"></figure><p>If Naoe is a master of stealth, then Yasuke is the warrior you want in your corner when sneaking around isn't an option. Combat in Assassin's Creed Shadows places an emphasis on dodging and positioning, and as a samurai, Yasuke can block or parry incoming attacks. Naoe cannot block, but she can deflect attacks. Ubisoft hasn't explained the exact differences between these abilities yet.</p><p>For your arsenal, you'll have access to katanas, spears, and shurikens, while more exotic weapons include the kanabo war club and the kusarigama. Enemy armor can be broken in combat, and Ubisoft says every prop in the game can be damaged by your weapons. Yasuke can also make use of more modern weaponry like rifles, and each weapon has its own skill-tree. The more you invest in that weapon, the better you'll become with it.</p><p>Active combat skills will also be available in the game, and these can be unlocked by finding ninja scrolls--not the anime DVD--hidden throughout the world. Yasuke and Naoe will also share XP, resources, and weapons, but they have their own individual skill-trees and gear.</p><h3>Seasons</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305516-acshadows%2831%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305516" data-ratio="0.425" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305516-acshadows%2831%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305516"></a><figcaption>Yasuke during a more introspective moment</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305516-acshadows%2831%29.jpg"></figure><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will have its own season system that cycles through spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The length of each season is dictated by your progress through the campaign and each one has unique features linked to gameplay. Spring and summer will have more long bushes to hide in, while winter weather makes the game more challenging as these hiding spots are removed and environmental hazards appear. A dynamic weather system adds to the authenticity of the world around you, creating a living ecosystem.</p><h3>Map size</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305517-acshadows%2812%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305517" data-ratio="0.45703125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305517-acshadows%2812%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305517"></a><figcaption>It's not as big as previous games, but Assassin's Creed Shadows is still pretty big</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305517-acshadows%2812%29.jpg"></figure><p>Ubisoft says the map size for Shadows will be similar to the size of ancient Egypt in Origins and it replicates the central region of Japan. You'll explore real historical provinces like Iga, Arima, and Omi, but with a twist.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-is-ditching-an-iconic-franchise-feature/1100-6523485/" data-ref-id="1100-6523485">Synchronization points will not reveal icons</a> on your map--or have a cool spinning drone shot around you--and instead you'll see points of interest highlighted. Ubisoft is aiming to create a more organic world to explore with fewer icons on your map, but synchronization locations can still be used as fast-travel points.</p><h3>Preorders</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305520-acshadowsce.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4305520" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305520-acshadowsce.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4305520"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows Collector's Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305520-acshadowsce.jpeg"></figure><p>Several different editions of Assassin's Creed Shadows will be available for preorder, and all of them come with bonus in-game content. For the fancy collector's edition, you'll get a ton of DLC, a steelbook cover, a hardcover art book, and a cool statue of Yasuke and Naoe.</p><p>For more details, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">Assassin's Creed Shadows preorder guide</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="135" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Several missteps caused delays for <em>XDefiant</em>, but Ubisoft finally applied the final touches ahead of a highly anticipated release date. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false"><em>XDefiant</em> goes live on May 21 at 1 PM EST for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Before the floodgates open and servers go live, Ubisoft revealed a day-one patch that makes a few net code adjustments and fixes a few bugs that wreaked havoc during the open test sessions. </p> <h2 id="h-xdefiant-preseason-patch-notes" data-injectable="false"><em>XDefiant</em> Preseason patch notes </h2> <figure data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft </figcaption></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-find-trogs-in-fallout-76/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=where-to-find-trogs-in-fallout-76<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="374" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Similar to how the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV) mutated humans into an unrecognizable foe, the Troglodyte Degeneration Contagion (TDC) spread throughout Pittsburgh to create feral, deformed humans known as Trogs. Not to be confused with Trogdor the dragon, Trogs are humans degenerated by the TDC which puts them somewhere in between feral ghouls and super mutants.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">Trogs are an enemy that was first introduced in <em>The Pitt</em>, a <em>Fallout 3</em> DLC. They‚Äôre hairless, crawl on all fours, and share similar attack patterns with feral ghouls. The most disturbing part about a Trog is that they are capable of partial speech. Hearing their voice lines as a pack of them gallop around you can quickly turn <em>Fallout 76</em> into a horror game. This guide will help you find Trogs so that you can lay them to rest, either for a weekly challenge or out of the kindness of your heart.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-where-to-find-trogs-in-fallout-76" data-injectable="false">Where to find Trogs in <em>Fallout 76</em></h2> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">Trogs are currently only found in either of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-76s-new-massive-the-pitt-update-details-launch-patch-notes/">two Expeditions to The Pitt</a>. ‚Äú<strong>From Ashes to Fire</strong>‚Äù is an Expedition where you can find many Trogs throughout your journey in the Trench. This Expedition is best if you‚Äôd like to immediately hunt Trogs and respawn the area by leaving and rejoining the session.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">The other Expedition to The Pitt known as ‚Äú<strong>Union Dues</strong>‚Äù brings the Trogs directly to you. Towards the end of the Expedition, waves of Trogs will swarm players, saving you the trouble of hunting them down yourself. But unlike ‚Äú<strong>From Ashes to Fire</strong>,‚Äù players will only be able to find Trogs during these waves.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Both of the Expeditions include a high number of Trogs. So even though there are only two sources of the enemy within Fallout 76, you shouldn‚Äôt have trouble knocking out your weekly 50-kill challenge with one to two runs of the Expeditions.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">All Trog variants in <em>Fallout 76</em></h2> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">Like many creatures in <em>Fallout 76</em>, Trogs have various forms that make every encounter dangerous in their own way. Unlike most types of enemies, these variants aren‚Äôt simply higher-level versions with an increase of stats.&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Trog</strong>: The base variant. While considered weak, they aren‚Äôt anything to underestimate when in a pack. They have a ranged attack in the form of a toxic spit, but their swarming tactics make them deadly.</li> <li><strong>Trog Devourer</strong>: These Trogs are more durable than their normal variant and gain a howl attack which can disorient players. A well-timed howl from a Devourer can spell the end for even the most prepared players.</li> <li><strong>Trog Fledgling</strong>: Small but not to be underestimated, Fledglings have a toxic spit similar to the other variants but tend to spawn in higher numbers. Their barrage of bile isn‚Äôt to be taken lightly.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Trog Striker</strong>: Nearly identical to a devourer, the striker appears if the player finds all four Striker‚Äôs Logs in the ‚Äú<strong>Union Dues</strong>‚Äù Expedition.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Trog Superior</strong>: While not as powerful as a Devourer, the Superior gets its name from being the most dominant variant throughout the Pitt.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Glowing Trog</strong>: It wouldn‚Äôt be a <em>Fallout</em> enemy if it didn‚Äôt have a Glowing variant. These are only found in the final phase of ‚Äú<strong>From Ashes to Fire</strong>‚Äù within the Radstorms.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="223" data-injectable="false">Every Trog is agile and rarely found alone. Consider using flamers or automatic weapons to answer their swarming tactics with a stream of fire and lead. Staying on the move is key to fighting <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-find-insects-in-fallout-76-all-locations/">many of the foes in <em>Fallout 76</em></a>.</p>
