			<p>FromSoftware has elected to postpone the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-coming-next-week/">Elden Ring Nightreign update 1.02</a>, which would have added the highly-requested duos mode to the game, due to tsunami warnings following a major earthquake on Russia's coast. An earthquake that hit the Kamchatka Peninsula off the coast of Russia earlier Wednesday morning has sent tsunami waves towards Russia, Japan, and Hawaii, with each region on alert. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/article/88-magnitude-earthquake-sends-tsunami-into-coasts-of-russia-japan-and-hawaii/">CTV News</a>, the earthquake was one of the strongest ever recorded at an 8.8 magnitude, and sent at least one tsunami wave of up to 13 feet to the shore of Japan's northern island of Hokkaido. Though it's been several hours since the initial earthquake, Japan has kept its northern regions at high alert, while the alert has been lowered to an advisory in its more southern regions.</p>



<p>"<em>Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula, we have decided to postpone the distribution of the 'ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN' Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST | 1:00 PDT</em>,<em>"</em> FromSoftware wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1950415325264031884">post on X</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Additionally, the second cycle of Everdark Sovereign, which was scheduled to start at 03:00 CEST | 18:00 PDT (7/30) tomorrow, will also be delayed until after the update file has been distributed.</em> <em>Thank you for understanding</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula, we have decided to postpone the distribution of the 'ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN' Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST | 1:00 PDT.</p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1950415325264031884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>While players who are looking forward to the update might be upset to learn that they'll have to wait a little longer to play Nightreign in an official duos mode, a tsunami is a more than reasonable reason to delay anything. Hopefully, the warnings and alerts pass with the waves causing minimal or better yet, no damage, and no one is hurt. We'll update you when FromSoftware confirms the new release window for the update.</p>

But for those of us who’ve spent tens or hundreds of hours in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em>, tackling the same side quests repeatedly for cash becomes downright gruesome—more so than the mutants we fight. Thankfully, update 1.5 introduces a new money-making method: Hunting! Now you can hunt and skin mutants for rare resources, like fangs, tusks, and tentacles, that you can sell off to earn a buck. You might think it’s pretty straightforward: Just get out there and start hunting.

Instead, players must log into Call of Duty HQ, find their game of choice via a Netflix-style launcher, then load the app. At the time, Call of Duty HQ was required to play either Modern Warfare 3, 2, or Warzone, and unlike parts of those games, Call of Duty HQ itself cannot be deleted if you want to play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Activision said Call of Duty HQ "was developed to bring players benefits like Carry Forward, easier file size management, and more seamless switching between Call of Duty: Warzone and the latest annual releases," but that wasn't the reality many players reported, as getting to a selected game or mode could be really time-consuming, particularly with endless prompts to "update to restart." It also takes up a tremendous amount of space on console. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision didn't give a reason for the change, and it doesn't seem HQ haters are going to be relinquished of the launcher any time soon, but it's fair to suggest this is just a way of tidying up HQ ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</u></a>'s release later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the next Call of Duty game?

Matt Cox, General Manager of Call of Duty, insisted that “as a team, our vision from the start was to create a back-to-back series experience for our players that embraced the uniqueness of the Black Ops sub-franchise.” It's set to star Milo Ventimiglia, Kiernan Shipka, and Michael Rooker, with Ventimiglia portraying David Mason, Shipka as new character Emma Kagen, and Rooker reprising his Black Ops 2 role of Mike Harper.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Call of Duty Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We know it'll feature the Skirmish and Overload multiplayer modes as well a 20v20 wingsuit option as details of a developer-only Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 playtest were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-developer-accidentally-posts-private-playtest-details-to-public-cod-app"><u>accidentally released to all fans on the Call of Duty app</u></a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-was-transformed-into-a-festival-feature-film</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-was-transformed-into-a-festival-feature-film.1257090/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve put down your controller this year to go touch a very particular patch of grass, you might have noticed that something strange is going on at the world’s major film festivals. It started in May, when a film adaptation of virally-successful Japanese indie game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-exit-8">Exit 8</a> premiered at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival – the first videogame movie to do so. The film’s director, Genki Kawamura, gives his source material a compelling structural spin, appealing equally to the arthouse crowd and to game fans. But live-action adaptations of video games are, of course, nothing new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s why <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> Cinematic Cut is so interesting. It is not a live-action adaptation of developer Warhorse Studios’ critically-acclaimed RPG. Instead, it is an abridged and reformatted version of Act One of the game itself, presenting a newly-edited blend of the open-world game’s cutscenes and gameplay in a two-hour linear form. It was perhaps the strangest Special Presentation at this month’s Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic – a unique cross-format experiment. One that wasn’t Warhorse’s idea. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It all happened at the official launch of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2,” explains KVIFF artistic director, Karel Och. “The first contact was made through a mutual friend, and Warhorse and KVIFF made each other understand that they wanted to collaborate at some point. During the following months, it was exciting to have a glimpse of what Warhorse represents – and I dare to say the same goes for our friends from the top of the gaming business.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhorse’s communications director, Tobias Stolz-Zwilling, concurs. “They wanted to make the festival more modern and interesting – to offer something new”. The largest film festival in Eastern Europe, KVIFF attracts a younger, more adventurous audience than its contemporaries. The studio saw the film festival’s strange idea as a chance to give video games greater cultural relevancy in the broader mainstream. Besides – much of the game’s cinematics team were already speaking the festival’s language.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s cinematic director, Petr Pekař, studied film editing and directing with the intention of becoming a traditional filmmaker, but he found his calling in video games. “There are a lot of filmmakers in the Czech Republic, but the market is not that big, so it's a bit overcrowded.” says Pekař. “Thankfully, there are multiple studios creating cutscenes, which are basically animated movies”. Pekar learned on the job creating cutscenes for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>, then joined Warhorse – first as a cinematic designer on the original Kingdom Come, then as director on its sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bringing Deliverance 2’s cutscenes to the big screen invites comparison with conventional cinema, an arena far from the cinematics’ original purpose. “If you're a player, you’re mainly looking forward to playing the game,” says Pekař. “The cutscenes are more like dessert for the game – not necessary – but when it's good and it clicks, it really helps the game, the story, and the overall feel”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Cinematic Cut opens, naturally, on the game’s first cutscene. As it happens, you can’t help but feel like you’re settling in for a YouTube video titled ‘Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 – All Cutscenes’ (“I don’t think anybody actually watches those in full” Pekař quips). The team’s cinematic direction is confident, but familiar – steeped in high fantasy tropes. A fiery siege on the castle is highly reminiscent of Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy – a major influence on Warhorse’s stylistic approach. Transported to the cinema screen, the scene serves as a striking reminder of how video games have traded in pastiche since their inception, responding to our desire to live out the fantasy ourselves whenever we see something cool on screen. But, of course, Cinematic Cut doesn’t deliver on this pivotal fantasy like its source material does – it’s non-playable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think this is an experiment that somebody can pick up and do better than we did.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When the cutscene footage ends, something curious happens. Father Godwin readies his crossbow and the scene transitions into first-person. But this is no Let’s Play. Smart, quick cuts establish a new, more cinematic editing language for first-person gameplay.  Godwin heads towards the stairs – cut – now he’s halfway up them – cut – now he’s atop the ramparts, plunging his sword into an enemy. It’s remarkably thrilling. “[The gameplay] was mostly recorded by Vítek Mičke, our marketing specialist,” explains Pekař. “He also made the trailers, and he's got a good sense of timing and aesthetics. He knows how to control the camera with the controller to properly set the scene and set the mood – so it looks cool.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A couple of awkward transitions disrupt this otherwise ‘cinematic’ tempo. A sudden cut to a ladder lowering, for example, has the distinct feel of a gameplay segment ending and a cutscene beginning, and reminds you of the objective-based game that birthed the footage. But these moments are few and far between, and they accentuate how much Warhorse has otherwise succeeded in their first attempt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think this is an experiment that somebody can pick up and do better than we did – or maybe we can do it again in the future with our future projects, and learn from our mistakes.” reflects Pekař. “It’s a really interesting experience to see it on the big screen – and I was surprised that it held up. It’s odd, but it somewhat works. It’s not some kind of new cinematic media that will sit next to the movies, but for festivals and conventions, for fans – I think it’s a format that others will be doing as well”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team at KVIFF are equally pleased with the results. “Storytelling has many faces,” says Och. “We’re proud that a new chapter in the festival’s modern history was written in collaboration with people that we respect a great deal who follow the same goal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think this format builds a bridge,” concludes Pekař. “Gamers can come to appreciate aesthetics and cinematography, the color palettes and moods in games more, and – in the same way – movie fans can understand how movies have different functions when they’re working with interactivity. When these two mediums collaborate, sometimes it creates really strange and cool ideas. When people go out of their bubble to see something different, it helps us to understand each other’s mediums.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Cinematic Cut is available to watch on the <a href="https://kviff.tv/catalog/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-cinematic-cut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KVIFF.TV</a> website for a small fee (approx. $6) until July 31, 2027. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blake Simons is a journalist with a taste for the self-reflexive, sentimental and surreal. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-was-transformed-into-a-festival-feature-film]]></content:encoded>

Within the deep and mysterious confines of each dungeon, the players must pay attention to their environment in order to orient themselves and figure out how to overcome the many obstacles they face.  Each dungeon has its own distinct flavor and memorable moments, culminating in a real sense of achievement once completed.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>The story of <em>Hell is Us</em> takes place in Hadea, a fictional country ravaged by a deadly civil war. This hermit nation hides a mysterious past and is home to ancient, forgotten dungeons that players must explore to advance their quest and unravel the secrets of the strange events taking place in the region.</p><p>Far from delivering side content, the dungeons are an integral part of the adventure, providing players with keys to understanding the deep history of Hadea and offering memorable gameplay sequences and challenges.</p><p>Each dungeon is unique in its atmosphere, challenges and meaning. They require players to use different types of skills: interacting and carefully observing their surroundings, using their sense of logic, and above all fighting the many enemies that stand in their way.  What’s more, each of the different dungeons culminates in a final, intense confrontation, leading to revelations that shed light on the tortuous past of this remote corner of the world.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Last week, the typically indie digital-games storefront Itch.io deindexed a majority of not safe for work (NSFW) or adult content. Deindexing doesn't mean that the games are all no longer available, but it does mean you can no longer find them through searching on the site. This came after the organisation <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow ">Collective Shout</a> launched a campaign against both Itch.io and Steam demanding that payment processors prevent the sale of particular forms of content. Now, in an <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq" rel="nofollow ">updated FAQ from Itch.io</a>, the storefront has shared that it's looking to work with other payment processors that do allow NSFW and adult content.</p><p dir="ltr">Explaining the timeline for these changes, Itch.io wrote, "The situation is evolving as we await final determinations from our current payment processors, Stripe and PayPal. There are still unknowns that prevent us from providing a fixed timeline.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the meantime, we are actively reaching out to other payment processors that are more willing to work with this kind of content. We have suspended the ability to pay with Stripe for 18+ content for the foreseeable future. Our immediate focus has been on content classification reviews and implementing stricter age-gating on the site."</p><p dir="ltr">The expanded FAQ also explained why so many more games have been removed from Itch.io as opposed to Steam: "The difference in our responses stems from the difference in our platforms. Steam is a “closed” platform where every product page is approved before it appears on the store. Because they were generally aware of the content they host, they could identify and act on specific pages.</p><p dir="ltr">"Itch.io is an open, “UGC” (User-Generated Content) platform. With over 2 million product pages, anyone can publish content at any time with minimal barriers. We could not rely on user-provided tagging to be accurate enough for a targeted approach, so a broader review was necessary to be thorough."</p><p dir="ltr">Since the changes took place, payment processors like Visa and Mastercard have also been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games" rel="nofollow ">inundated with emails and phone calls</a> in an effort to push back against the banning of adult content. The International Game Developers Association has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/international-game-developers-association-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-delisting-of-games/1100-6533536/">released a statement condemning the move</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After plenty of rumours and build up, Nintendo has confirmed that a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase will take place tomorrow, 31st July, at 2PM BST / 3PM CEST / 9AM EST / 6AM PDT.</p>
<p>Watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase – 31/07/2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-9mHP826oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Nintendo Direct will be around 25 minutes long and, as it’s a Partner Showcase, it will put the focus on third party titles from publishing partners, with games for both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Naturally there’s an awful lot of speculation about what could be included, with games like Hollow Knight: Silkson, Hades 2 (which will be a timed console exclusive), Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Professor Layton and The New World of Steam, Two Point Museum and more all already announced for 2025.</p>

<p>We also wouldn’t put it past Nintendo to sneak in a first party announcement or two as well. Everyone is desperately keen to know when Metroid Prime 4 will release, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is also expected this year. Actually, the perfect announcement would be an Age of Imprisonment release date, and a Switch 2 update for Age of Calamity to lift its 30fps cap.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>VOID Interactive's Ready or Not arrived on consoles <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-drops-on-consoles-on-july-15/">15 days ago</a> from the time of this writing. In its first four days on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S shelves, it sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-past-1-million-copies-sold-consoles-10-million-total-copies-sold/">1 million copies</a>, bringing the game's total sales to 10 million between consoles and PC. In the remaining 11 days, it sold another million copies, marking another huge milestone for the tactical shooter by hitting 2 million copies in just two weeks, and 11 million copies sold since its initial PC launch.</p>



<p>"<em>First, thank you to the players - for showing up, playing hard, and bringing order to chaos</em>," VOID Interactive's chief executive officer, Julio Rodriguez, wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/julio-rodriguez-2591bb10_readyornot-consolelaunch-2million-activity-7356271625538846720-imwP?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn</a> announcing the milestone. "<em>Next, to the VOID dev team for building what we believe is the quintessential tactical FPS of our era — and to our friends and partners for helping us bring RON to console.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption>Ready or Not hits 2M copies sold on console. Image credit: VOID Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ready or Not's console launch is clearly going well, but its success on PS5 and Xbox Series devices hasn't diminished how upset its PC player base has been since the console update, which brought a number of changes that didn't sit well with PC players.</p>



<p>Players have called out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337?l=english">changes </a>to certain aspects of the game censorship, and while it's clear from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/#app_reviews_hash">review bombing on Steam</a> that a good chunk of the player base agrees, another element to this that players on PC are upset with is what players are calling a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadyOrNotGame/comments/1md3lai/i_have_some_questions_regarding_the_recent/">"<em>downgrade</em>"</a> in the graphics to align with the console versions.</p>



<p>We'll see how VOID Interactive responds in the coming weeks, and if there are any meaningful retractions from the studio to appease the players it has upset.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-paragon-antiquary-ritualist/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-unveils-paragon-antiquary-and-ritualist-elite-specs.1257069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet unveiled the second trio of elite specializations that will be introduced in the upcoming expansion Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity. Following the Troubadour, the Galeshot, and the Luminary, <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-three-elite-specializations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed last week</a>, this time it's all about the Paragon, Antiquary, and Ritualist.</p>



<p>The Ritualist is an elite specialization for the Necromancer. It's inspired by the original Guild Wars Ritualist profession, and it summons weapon spells that affect nearby allies. It also summons the spirits of Anguish, Wanderlust, and Preservation to attack foes.</p>



<p>The Antiquary is the new elite specialization for the Thief. As purveyors of rare artifacts, Antiquaries use their Pilfer skill to call upon the thieving inclination of their Skritt companions. They steal from enemies to create random improvised weapons. The Antiquary can use its unique skills while on cooldown, but doing so may cause detrimental effects, making it a risky proposition.</p>



<p>Last but certainly not least, there's the Paragon, a new elite specialization for the Warrior. With spear and shield in hand, these protectors of Elona build up their motivation resource by using burst skills. They can channel this motivation into vocal shouts, such as chants, refrains, commands, and echoes. These affect the surrounding area, either punishing enemies or supporting allies of the Paragon.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Presumably, ArenaNet will share the final three elite specializations for the remaining classes (Revenant, Engineer, and Elementalist) at some point next week. As a reminder, Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-next-expansion-october-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released on October 28</a>; beyond the new elite specializations, it'll offer brand new zones, new raid encounters, a new Fractal, a new Convergence, a new Homestead map, three new Mastery tracks for the Skimmer aquatic mount and various new armor, weapons, legendaries, and relics. The story itself centers around the Inquest's nefarious plan for the island of Castora.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-announced-for-tomorrow.1257066/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase for tomorrow, so while we won't be getting info on first-party Nintendo titles, we will get to learn what third-party publishers are cooking up for the gaming giant's ecosystem.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1950541896012493166" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the Partner Direct showcase for July 2025 will air tomorrow, July 31st, at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern. That's around 2pm BST and about 3pm CEST, so make sure to set your alarm accordingly.</p>

<p>According to Nintendo, you can expect "roughly 25 minutes" of info about upcoming Switch 2 and Switch games from the company's "publishing partners", although none of those partners are mentioned by name in Nintendo's post.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-star-wars.jpg?itok=au-Yq94W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-star-wars.jpg?itok=I76n2xBt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>could get another, erm, outing during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>We already know that games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2" rel="nofollow">set to arrive on the Switch 2 in the near future</a>, so Ubisoft could choose to show off some more gameplay footage of its open-world adventure running on Nintendo's new hardware.</p>

<p>It could also be time for some third-party publishers to reveal ports of some of their most popular games for the Switch 2; Capcom could choose to bring more&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games to the platform, for instance, or EA could reveal that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">the recently-revealed&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>&nbsp;</em>is, in fact, also making its way to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a third-party showcase, one game is likely to be on everyone's mind, namely Team Cherry's&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Will we finally get to hear about a release date during this Direct?</p>

<p>I'd say there's a non-zero chance of that happening. Xbox recently announced that&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo" rel="nofollow">will be playable at its booth</a> during this year's Gamescom, so that might line up pretty nicely with a Direct release date announcement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.jpg?itok=54K-Wd15 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.jpg?itok=RiUxOJy7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Come on, Nintendo. Please? For us?</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, since Team Cherry is sort of hitching its wagon to Xbox (what with the game landing on Game Pass on day one and its inclusion as part of Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">new ROG Ally reveal this summer</a>),&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>might be a no-show during tomorrow's Direct as well.</p>

<p>Either way, you can check the show out tomorrow, July 31st, at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern. Join us here tomorrow for all of the reveals and news from that show as well!</p>

(Sorry, y’all are gonna have to wait a little longer for more news on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630255/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>.)</p><p>A handful of older games are finding new life (and new audiences) on the Switch 2 like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and I expect there will be many more announcements of studios bringing their backlogs to the console. And for new games, <em>Silksong</em>, the long, <em>long</em> awaited sequel to Team Cherry’s <em>Hollow Knight</em> might <em>finally</em> get to see the light of day.</p><p>Last month, rumors from prominent insiders and leakers swirled that a Direct would be announced for the end of the month. They also speculated about what games would be shown which included a<em> Persona 3 Reload</em> port and, of all things, a new <em>Animal Crossing</em>. But we’ll find out for sure what Nintendo will give us next when the presentation airs tomorrow at 9 AM.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/715733/nintendo-direct-annoucement-july-2025-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The next Switch 2 exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/drag-x-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-671279">Drag x Drive</a>, arrives soon on August 14. Ahead of its release, Nintendo has uploaded a new gameplay trailer revealing more details and reminding players of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-try-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-drag-x-drive-next-month-but-theres-a-catch/1100-6533193/" data-ref-id="1100-6533193">upcoming Global Jam demo</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ls_NtQ0s8k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-Ls_NtQ0s8k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This will kick off on August 9 and runs through August 10, but the catch here is that you'll need an active Switch Online membership to access it. If you're interested, the demo will be available to download later today and the sessions will take place at the following times:</p><h2>Drag x Drive Global Jam playtest times</h2><h3>August 9</h3><ul><li>3 AM - 7 AM PT / 6 AM ET - 10 AM ET</li><li>5 PM - 9 PM PT / 8 PM ET - 12 AM ET</li></ul><h3>August 10</h3><ul><li>9 AM - 1 PM PT / 12 PM ET - 4 PM ET</li></ul><p>As mentioned above, the new overview trailer also provided plenty of details on how to play Drag x Drive. The Joy-Con 2 controllers are used to control each wheel on the wheelchair via mouse controls, and you can swipe forward or backward to control your momentum and direction. While a table is probably best for using these controls, Nintendo added that "most" flat surfaces--like your legs--will do just fine in a pinch. I've also tried the mouse controls on my oblivious cat as he naps on my bed next to me, and his squishy body worked surprisingly well as an impromptu mousepad while creating art in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p>Drag x Drive is one of two big releases for the Switch 2 in August. An upgraded version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land launches on August 28, and it'll include a brand-new expansion alongside updated graphics.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-in-october-nintendo-switch-2-edition-detailed/1100-6531855/" data-ref-id="1100-6531855">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is also out in October, and Nintendo announced a new Direct livestream for July 31. The company says there'll be "roughly 25 minutes of information" on upcoming games to expect here, so it'll be interesting to see if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> gets a proper release-date confirmation.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has announced a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase for tomorrow, July 31, 2025. It'll be a 25-minute-long presentation of games from Nintendo's publishing partners, so it's unlikely that we'll get announcements like the release date for Metroid Prime 4. But it could be the kind of place where we see the release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, but it's the kind of news to expect instead of any news about Nintendo's first-party titles, as those are the kinds of announcements Nintendo would likely hold for a dedicated 'Nintendo Direct.'</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There have been <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/">rumors circulating </a>about a Nintendo Direct happening before the end of July, as a follow-up to the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, to let players know what's coming next for the console. Those rumors were seemingly correct, though not about it being a full-fat Nintendo Direct that would include first-party announcements.</p>



<p>Which could, of course, mean indie titles like Silksong and Hades II show up. Though it could also, and potentially even more likely, mean that we see more ports of games that are already available on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series devices that the Nintendo Switch wasn't capable of running, but the Switch 2 can run perfectly well. </p>



<p>Games like Assassin's Creed Shadows, Hi-Fi Rush, Assassin's Creed Mirage, or news of a release date for some of the major ports already announced, like Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whatever's there, thankfully we won't have long to wait to find out, as the direct will kick off tomorrow morning at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST.</p>

Are we finally getting <em>Sea of Thieves </em>or <em>Diablo IV</em> on Switch 2?</p><p>Some personal predictions for the event include finally getting a release date for <em>Hades 2</em> (a timed-console exclusive for both Switch 1 and 2) and a mention of Call of Duty’s future on Nintendo’s platform, which Microsoft promised to support with the multiplayer military shooter following for the first time in years. <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, one of this year’s best selling coop games and a cross-gen one to boot, also feels like an obvious pickup. </p><p>The mention of the OG Switch suggests players who haven’t upgraded will have some fresh games to look forward to this fall as well. With over 150 million units sold, it wouldn’t be surprising if Nintendo continues to support the older platform for a little while longer. </p><p>At 25 minutes, this won’t be the big Nintendo Direct fans are really waiting for. That’s more likely to come in September. But it should help fill in some of the question marks still outstanding in the Switch 2's first year. And with more powerful specs in tow, this fall could be one of the biggest for a Nintendo console in quite some time.</p><p> If <em>Borderlands 4 </em>can sneak its way onto the handheld hybrid, even at 30fps, who knows what other current-gen games can make the leap. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-elden-ring-ff7-time-date-1851787326]]></content:encoded>

It has to show up some time soon… right? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong">Xbox has a playable demo for Silksong at Gamescom this year</a>, but we know that Team Cherry's sought after Metroidvania is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">also primed for both Switch consoles</a>, so it could happen…</p>
<p>Personally, I would also love to hear or see more from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5's Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a>. This chap was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">announced during a Nintendo Direct back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we could perhaps hear about a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> on Switch 2. FromSoftware's incredibly successful game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">announced for Switch 2 back in April</a>, though with no date attached to it. The edition coming to Switch 2 will be the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">which includes the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>, as well as new armour and a new Torrent appearance customisation feature. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-to-include-two-new-classes">Two new classes are also on the way as part of Elden Ring's Tarnished Edition</a>.</p>
<p>We also may hear more from Supergiant Games, which in April announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">Hades 2 would be a timed console exclusive on Switch and Switch 2</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is still in early access on PC, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-one-final-early-access-patch-before-full-10-release">developer is gearing up for its full fat release (hopefully) very soon</a>.</p>
<p>There have also been hints of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">Switch 2 port of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>We here at Eurogamer will be watching along to bring you the news as it happens. What do you hope to see during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-announced-for-tomorrow-3]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview.1256985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s fitting that as Summer continues to blaze its way towards Autumn, we’re being treated to another entry in the Story of Seasons franchise. While the influence of early Harvest Moon and Story of Seasons games have been felt through the cosy gaming genre for decades, the farming and relationship-focused series has continued to plough its own furrow. This time, it’s a remaster of the classic DS outing, Harvest Moon: Grand Bazaar, sprucing it up for the modern day, while bringing it to Nintendo’s brand-new Switch 2 platform, with a flurry of exclusive improvements in tow.</p>
<p><iframe title="STORY OF SEASONS: Grand Bazaar – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lI0QZKEdHbk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the series is best known for its farming action, and a plot of farmland remains the foundation of your experience here, this is actually a game about business. Zephyr Town’s success and its populace’s well-being revolve around the Grand Bazaar, and your time, effort and focus have shifted to selling your produce and goods at the titular market.</p>


<p>Here, the Bazaar takes place at the end of every week, and you build your produce and wares accordingly, ready to sell them for the most profit. You’re handed a stall and a bell, and you have to attract people’s attention before making sure they’re served as quickly as possible. It’s not exactly frantic, at least not in this early portion of the game, but it’s a fun and welcome change of pace from the daily tasks you’re normally embroiled in. As you grow and expand your offering, so too does the market around you come back to life, bringing more visitors to the area, and increasing your standing with the local community.</p>
<p>Ready to begin your new life in Zephyr Town, there’s a very limited character creator here, that only really lifts itself into modernity by getting you to choose your birthday and offering you different pronouns. Still, you can unlock new outfits as you progress, and alter your appearance as you see fit, so there’s still fun to be had making the character your own.</p>

<p>You’ll likely want to make them as charming as possible, because relationships are an integral part of Grand Bazaar. Speaking to characters daily – or greeting them with a quick hello – will improve your standing with them, and you can build up a friendship, and even propose marriage, with your digital soulmate.</p>

<p>Special moments will appear on the map from time to time – with a helpful icon to show that they’re available – and these deepen your understanding of that character, learning about their love of cooking or grabbing a good cup of coffee from the cafe. Here in the preview a lot of time was spent talking to Sophie and Freya, both of whom seemed drawn to my hardworking farmer. We’ll see where it goes!</p>
<p>To be honest though, the highlight of the character roster has to be the mayor, Felix. He is uproariously upbeat and driven, wanting you and your farm to bring trade and prosperity back to Zephyr Town. I had to talk with him every day, just to see if I could make him say something brilliant in his booming voice, and he’s already an icon in my eyes. Interactions are definitely lifted by extensive voice acting, whether in whole during cutscenes or in part alongside written dialogue, and the entire town feels alive and real to you as you explore and chat with the locals.</p>
<p>As a remake of a DS game, Grand Bazaar’s art design and visual quality have seen a stratospheric jump. Now fully 3D, Grand Bazaar looks every bit the 2025 cozy farming sim, with an art style that lends it a Pokemon-esque feel, albeit one with a stable framerate. It goes to show just how good a game can look with a clean and charming aesthetic, and it serves to show up how rough the Switch version of the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game-review/">Tales of the Shire</a> looks in comparison.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 edition uses all that extra processing power to pump everything out at a higher resolution, and there’s a sharpness and vibrancy to the visuals that definitely add an extra level of class. Besides that, there’s enhanced frame rates – seemingly taking them up to 60fps – but otherwise this is, to all intents and purposes, the same game you’re getting on the original Switch.</p>

<p>Where the new hardware adds something extra, is in the addition of mouse controls. However, I have to say that I’m pretty disappointed in how they’ve been implemented. I was hoping for a time-saving point and click option for your farming, much like we saw in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>, but instead this is a tool for menu management more than anything else. I really hope that someone rethinks this, because it would massively improve players’ quality of life. All it has to do is make farming easier – hopefully that’s not too much to ask.</p>
<p>Grand Bazaar’s positioning as a remake, rather than an all-new entry in the series, is an interesting choice. In terms of quality, the original game sits somewhere in the middle of the series; the fundamentals of farming and trading form a solid foundation, while some of the design choices – such as the way that crafting was handled utilising the windmills – proved to be needlessly finicky. Through our hands on though, it feels like smart updates have been made to make the game more appealing, and I found myself easily drawn into the easy-going action.</p>
<p>Story of Season: Grand Bazaar is clearly familiar, embracing the tick of farming alongside the tock of building relationships, but the addition of the weekly Grand Bazaar gives you something more concrete to work towards. Everything is very focused, Zephyr Town, your farm and the Bazaar only taking a few minutes to walk around, but within that there’s a life to build which feels full of possibilities.</p>

		<p>Two new gameplay videos have been released for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, exploring the new Fusion system and Heavy Armor mechanics that will enhance the game’s player customisation. Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is set to launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 5th September 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion | Fusion" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iSXGKlruTww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fusion will give you the option to forsake your humanity and fuse in Immortal Factors that are retrieved from fallen enemies. Factors come in three types –&nbsp;Might, Shell, and Skeleton – which determine the skill that they will offer, but fusing them to your body will mutate your character into something inhuman.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, though, you can always buy your humanity back for a fee, losing all the skills in the process.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion | Heavy Armor" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZGFh8HHEjI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But maybe you won’t need to indulge in body mods, since there’s customisable Heavy Armor that can be applied to your Arsenal mech in the thick of battle, calling it in when the call gauge is full to let you dish out more powerful attacks. In a brilliant move, your regular mech actually climbs into the bigger mech, meaning that you have a pilot inside a mech, inside a mech.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope we get a third game in this series so that we can have mechs piloting mechs piloting mechs. How far can this rabbit hole go?</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/11/daemon-x-machina-review/">Daemon X Machina review</a> back with its original Nintendo Switch release, Miguel wrote, “Daemon X Machina sets the bar for robot action games. The addictive mecha fighting is almost flawless, but it’s complemented by so many other incredible parts to the game. There’s a rich, unique world filled with incredible and memorable characters, endless and addictive customisation, gorgeous visuals and a jaw-dropping soundtrack. Daemon X Machina rarely stumbles, and even when it did, I still couldn’t help but be impressed by this amazing new experience.”</p>

<figure><a title="Ho-Oh Pokémon TCG Pocket: Wisdom of Sea and Sky" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c658c692ace3f/ho-oh-pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Overnight, The Pokémon Company was hit by allegations of plagiarism ahead of the release of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> expansion, <strong>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</strong>. And today, with the release of the expansion, TPC has pulled the card — plus one other card — in question.</p>
<p>In a statement issued on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1950406273150693652?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">social media</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-suddenly-pulls-card-design-embroiled-in-plagiarism-controversy-as-company-admits-production-issue-and-launches-wider-investigation">IGN</a>), TPC "deeply apologize[s]" for the error, which affects the Ho-Oh EX (3-Star) and Lugia EX (3-Star) cards drawn by SIE NANAHARA, which it puts down to a "production issue". The expansion was datamined yesterday by fans, which is where the card art for Ho-Oh came from.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards". The art has been replaced in-game with a "temporary placeholder".</p>

<p>The team is also "conducting a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game."</p>
<p>The accusations focused on the Ho-Oh card specifically, which appears to be based on fanart art of the Legendary bird from <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu" tabindex="-1">lanjiuji</a>, which they published in 2021.</p>
<p>lanjiuji, confused at the potential plagiarism, shared some <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950044196842459644">comparison pics on social media</a>, and even at a quick glance, you can see that the resemblance is pretty darn close.</p>
<p>They have since released a <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610">statement</a> acknowledging The Pokémon Company's response, stating "My original post stemmed solely from perplexity upon encountering questionable images online, with no means to verify their authenticity as game assets".</p>

<p>"Relieved by the timely resolution, I also thank those who contributed constructive perspectives." the statement concludes. lanjiuji also potentially refers to a figure based on the artwork, created by PC House, which <a href="https://x.com/KetX2L/status/1950099518168432873">someone has linked in the replies</a>. The Ho-Oh art appears to be a commission from the company.</p>
<p>The situation has sparked discussions around Pokémon and its legal terms surrounding fanart — which seemed to suggest that The Pokémon Company owns any publicly shared artwork, and that it doesn't need to notify anyone if the company decides to use it.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/legal/information">legal statement here</a>, but whatever it says, today's decision implies that, while Pokémon <em>could</em> use your art, it wants to avoid doing so.</p>
<p>So, while we wait for the art to be replaced, let's have a look at that placeholder art, then:</p>

<p>Well, at least people are having fun with the temporary cards...! Alongside the new expansion, there's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-much-needed-trading-update-and-a-new-expansion-next-week">huge overhaul to trading too</a>, which is a bit of a boon given how much it was criticised when it first dropped.</p>
<p><em>Have you been following this situation? Are you diving into the new expansion today? Let us know down below.</em></p>
