			<p>Rockstar Games is reportedly planning to implement age verification in GTA Online to play the game or access some of the online game's features.</p>



<p>As reported by Tez2 on X, users may need to verify their age in the future to play the game or access certain features like phone messages, text chat, and Snapmatic. Tez2 couldn't say which regions could be targeted for these age verification checks, but there's little doubt players in the UK will be the first to be impacted by age verification if it goes into effect, considering the enforcement of the Online Safety Act is expected to ramp up in the coming months.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Jokes aside, Rockstar is planning to implement age assurance checks in the near future, rolling them out by region.</p><p>You may need to verify your age to access <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAOnline?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GTAOnline</a>, or certain features, like phone messages, text chat, Snapmatic, may be restricted until you verify your age. <a href="https://t.co/v0wLwV8nyh">https://t.co/v0wLwV8nyh</a> <a href="https://t.co/QYVaydlbhZ">pic.twitter.com/QYVaydlbhZ</a></p></div>— Tez2 (@TezFunz2) <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1951058585359634459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although age checks are yet to become mandatory, select publishers and developers already started implementing some form of age verification ahead of time, like Roblox and Epic Games, to prevent younger players from accessing to some features like voice and or text chat, so it wouldn't be surprising for Rockstar Games to do the same in GTA Online, considering the game is constantly under intense scrutiny due to its setting and content. As the developer is also said to be working on a new version of their online game to coincide with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-online-sold-separately-30-fps-target/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> next year, it will be interesting to see how age verification will impact this new project in some way.</p>



<p>GTA Online is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game's latest updates on its official website.</p>

			<p>There’s been no shortage of The Lord of the Rings games over the years, but precious few of them focus on the real stars of J. R. R. Tolkien’s books, the humble hobbits. Granted, outside of the unlikely adventures of the Baggins family, hobbits are known for living rather unexciting lives, so perhaps it’s not surprising that game makers would rather focus on Middle-earth’s elves, orcs, and dragons. But, of course, not all games have to focus on action and excitement – enter <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/tales-of-the-shire/">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game</a>,&nbsp; a new cozy life sim in the vein of Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing that aims to celebrate hobbit life in all its sleepy glory.</p>



<p>Does Tales of the Shire successfully carve out its own cozy corner of Middle-earth? Or does it confirm why Tolkien’s books never stayed in the Shire for long? Venture forth for the answer…</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Tales of the Shire begins with players creating their own furry-footed avatar before putting down stakes in Bywater, the neighboring settlement to the more famous Hobbiton. I suspect most folks who hear the phrase “cozy life sim set in the Lord of the Rings universe” will make some similar assumptions – that the game will have a richer, more developed world and cast of characters than your average life sim, and that it might mix a bit more adventure in with the usual farming and mushroom picking. Sadly, this couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While Tolkienites will no doubt recognize some names from the books and movies – the crusty Old Noakes and Samwise Gamgee’s eventual wife Rosie Cotton being chief among them – the game doesn’t expand on these characters in any interesting way. There are a number of nameless NPCs that wander around Bywater, but there are only 15 characters you can actually interact with and they’re all lifelessly written, with most having perhaps a single identifying trait (and sometimes not even that). There's no real conflict, no real drama, everyone just speaks in dry awkward sentences and empty platitudes.</p>



<p>Most who play Tales of the Shire will likely start making a mental list of all the things you’d expect from a proper cozy farming game that you <em>won’t</em> find here, such as mining, festivals, livestock (aside from chickens), and romance, to name just a few. The one thing Tales of the Shire has going for it, really the <em>only </em>thing, is cooking. The game takes hobbits being hungry little buggers to the extreme by having basically everything revolve around food.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The only way to raise your relationship level with your fellow hobbits is to invite them over for a meal. The main way to earn new recipes, tools, house and garden expansions, and other upgrades in Tales of the Shire is to increase these relationships or boost your ranking in a series of food-related clubs (there are cooking, farming, fishing, and foraging clubs). Basically, if you want to get ahead, everything circles back to your kitchen, which may sound like a smart, focused approach, but in this game it just feels overly simplistic. Nobody in Bywater feels like a real character, they’re just walking stomachs.</p>



<p>To be fair, this game’s cooking mechanics actually work pretty well. In addition to finding and mixing the right ingredients, players also have to decide how “smooth” or “chunky” they want to cut things, how long proteins should be cooked, and what seasonings to add. Dinner guests have certain dish and flavor profile preferences and combining certain tastes will result in more pleasing dishes. The complexity of making dinner steadily increases as more recipes, ingredients, and cooking implements are introduced, eventually becoming relatively involved.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Once you have some dishes whipped up, you’ll invite guests to one of several different dining venues, place their meals in front of them, perhaps add some decorations for ambiance, and then, bon appétit! The whole cooking and dining process is actually rather satisfying, but does it make up for everything <em>else </em>Tales of the Shire doesn’t do or simply does poorly? Absolutely not, but when you're chopping up veggies and setting the table you do get a brief glimpse of what this experience perhaps <em>could</em> have been with a bit more ambition, time, and support from management (a recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/709797/tales-of-the-shire-lotr-development-weta-workshop">article from The Verge</a> details the game’s rocky development).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The only other way to progress in Tales of the Shire is to work through the game’s “campaign,” such as it is. The big dilemma driving said campaign is… whether Bywater will be officially designated a village. Nothing more thrilling than the civic bureaucratic process! Story missions are almost entirely fetch-quest busy work of the most mind-numbing variety with only occasional requirements to cook a meal breaking things up.</p>



<p>As barebones as the rest of Tales of the Shire is, I’ll admit, there were times when the cozy formula still kicked in and provided some moments of low-key enjoyment, but ultimately, the game’s dead-fish campaign truly killed the experience for me. Tales of the Shire makes the same mistakes so many middling cozy games make – it’s so mellow, it lacks any form or direction, so friendly and nonthreatening that everything just turns to mush. Sure, actually-good cozy games like Stardew Valley are fairly chill, but they’re not uneventful or vapid. The promise of the hobbit life sim concept just makes the bland monotony served up by this game sting all the more.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Tales of the Shire doesn’t even impress on a technical level, which is surprising given Weta Workshop has won Oscars for its work on the LotR movies. While Bywater looks decent enough from afar, upon closer inspection, you’ll find everything’s made up of chunky polygons and blurry textures the likes of which haven’t regularly been seen in a few hardware generations. Despite this lack of visual pizazz, the game runs terribly on the PS5 (I can only imagine how rough the Switch version must be) and is rife with visual glitches.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>You can experience all the thrills of Tales of the Shire’s main campaign within around 15 hours, but, of course, you’re free to while away your time in Bywater for as long as you please. That said, I suspect most will be begging for a wizard to come give them something better to do before long.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Tales of the Shire is a frustrating missed opportunity. Decent cooking mechanics aside, nearly everything else you’d hope to see from a cozy hobbit life sim is either missing or half-heartedly executed. Meanwhile, those familiar with developer Weta Workshop for their contributions to the groundbreaking Lord of the Rings films will likely be surprised by how technically inept the game is. Even the smallest person can change the course of the future, but in this case, our furry-footed friends simply fall short.</p>

                <p>The first big game of the Switch 2 era has emerged, as Nintendo has sold almost as many units of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> as actual Switch 2 consoles. In its Q1 financial results for the three months that ended on June 30, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo reported</a> that it had sold 8.67 million units, with Mario Kart World being responsible for 5.63 million of those sales. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/" data-ref-id="1100-6533625">This is almost as many units sold as Switch 2 consoles sold</a>, indicating a very high attach rate.</p><p>To put this into context, it is worth noting that Nintendo launched the Switch 2 with a bundle deal that included Mario Kart World. Given that the game has an MSRP of $80--and Nintendo rarely drops the price on its evergreen titles--it did make financial sense to grab the bundle and save $30 in the process.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World – Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p>The game also has a long way to go before it dethrones Nintendo's best-selling game of all time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Switch game has reached lifetime sales of 68.86 million units, but these are still very early days for Mario Kart World. There will be some competition on the way with Drag X Drive, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A this year, but it'll be interesting to see if Mario Kart World will enjoy the same level of longevity as its predecessor. There are also plenty of third-party games on the way, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/">as this week's Nintendo Direct</a> showed off 25 games headed to the Switch 2 throughout the year and well into 2026.</p><p>Overall, business is good for Nintendo as sales during the quarter that ended on June 30 reached roughly $3.8 billion and operating profit grew 4% to $378 million. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">Nintendo is still predicting that it'll sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles</a> by March 2026, even during turbulent financial times brought on by US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>

            <p>Nintendo sold 5.82m <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> consoles worldwide in its first month of release and 5.63m copies of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, meaning the launch title has an attachment rate of around 97 percent.</p>
<p>The figures come from <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Nintendo's latest earnings release</a> as of 30th June, where the company added software sales for Switch 2 reached 8.67m units in that same period. That means Mario Kart World accounts for 65 percent of all software sales on the new console.</p>
<p>Nintendo added, in the seven weeks since launch, the Switch 2 has sold over 6m units worldwide. Even so, Nintendo has noted demand is exceeding supply in many countries.</p>

<p>Clearly the console and racing game bundle has proven a popular option for customers. Mario Kart World was the primary launch game for the new console, and was also available to buy separately.</p>
<p>Shortly after the console's launch, Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Switch 2 was the company's fastest-selling hardware ever</a>, moving 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale. Last week, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-video-game-hardware-device-in-us-history-usurping-the-ps4">Switch 2 is the fastest-selling video game hardware device in the US</a>, beating the PS4.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sales of the original Switch console have now reached 153.10m units.</p>
<p>This year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-expects-switch-1-to-become-its-best-selling-hardware-ever-this-year-but-fall-just-short-of-ps2-record">Nintendo expects to sell 4.5m Switch consoles</a>, which would see the console usurping the Nintendo DS as the company's highest-selling piece of hardware - it's now less than 1m sales behind. That's still quite a way from the PS2, though, which is estimated to have sold 160m units as the best selling console of all time.</p>
<p>Overall, Nintendo's net sales grew by 132.1 percent year-on-year thanks to the Switch 2's launch, while gross profit increased by 21.4 percent to 185.1bn yen. The gross profit margin declined due to a lower profit margin of the Switch 2 compared with the previous console.</p>
<p>Digital sales decreased by 13.5 percent, but still account for 59.3 percent of all software sales. Nintendo attributes this to a "decrease in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software".</p>
<p>Nintendo has not changed its financial forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, where it expects to sell 15m Switch 2 consoles worldwide. This has not been impacted by US tariff measures, echoing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">statement from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa in May</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> will be released on Switch consoles on 16th October, as one of Nintendo's key first-party games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-pops-up-on-the-korean-ratings-board-sparking-hope-well-get-a-firm-release-date-soon">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> remains a 2025 release without a specific launch date.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo revealed more third-party games due for release this year - here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">everything shown at the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-all-switch-2-users-have-bought-mario-kart-world-as-sales-of-new-console-pass-6m-worldwide]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The Battlefield fanbase experiences the rollercoaster highs and lows of game releases like almost no other. Over the past 15 years, each game’s launch is greeted with a degree of dismay, the team having to go back and pour even more effort in to rectify issues and pull it into shape, and then, just as it’s become a beloved entry in the series, you crest the big drop and go hurtling back down to the depths of gaming despair as a new game arrives to start the journey all over again. But there’s hope for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>. Dreams that this beloved open war shooter really is back to the rose tinted glory days of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/10/31/battlefield-3-multiplayer-console-review/">Battlefield 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/11/04/battlefield-4-review/">Battlefield 4</a>. Are we back? I think we might be back.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Battlefield 6 brings us a contemporary war setting, taking place in an utterly implausible 2027, from a current geopolitical viewpoint, where the steadfast bastion of Western military cooperation that is NATO is suddenly under threat from…um… a really rich private military corporation? No China, no Russia, it’s the mercenaries of Pax Armata that are the baddies, managing to chip away at the allies, the war that breaks out stretching from the Middle East, from Egypt, through Gibraltar and even coming to US shores with a battle in Brooklyn. Truthfully, it doesn’t matter who the goodies and the baddies are for the multiplayer, but it does feel a bit toetippy and safe after the games of the early 2010s.</p>


<p>What really matters is what the combat and action is like, and here it’s classic Battlefield. There’s four classes – Assault, Engineer, Support and Recon – and you’re in squads of up to four, trying to use your different roles and skills to complement one another and with a squad leader marking objectives to try and coordinate your efforts. Assault is about crashing into situations, able to boost themselves with a shot of adrenaline and coming with two main weapons, Engineer has the rockets and blow torch, Support bundles together the old Medic healing, ammo resupply and barricades, and Recon is all about scoping out the enemy with drones, placing spawn points, and the like. There’s the usual remixing of familiar abilities into these four buckets, and outside of the smushed together duties for the Support class, it’s a lot like the good old days… specifically the good days of Bad Company 2’s classes. Assault does have a personal health stim, but needs Recon to take out tanks and Support for healing and ammo.</p>


<p>Alongside the gadgets of your class, there’s also a new score-based perk system in Field Specs that rewards you with passive and active boosts. These start small, like starting your own health regen when you revive an ally as a Medic, hampering enemy vehicle repairs when damaging them as an Engineer, or building up to a top tier ability that you manually trigger, like Assault’s Combat Stimulant which highlights nearby sounds and reveals enemies. These feel like they’ll be gameplay style enhancements instead of wholesale class mods, but we’ll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>But there’s still some controversy. You see, where weapons used to be locked to particular classes in Battlefield V and before, that’s no longer the case. Each class still has a “signature” weapon type, and there’s boosters for embracing that synergy, so engineers have better hip-fire control with the SMGs, and Assault can draw and switch weapons quicker with an assault rifle, but you’ll also have the freedom to pick from the full selection of weapons. It’s something that a vocal part of the community has railed against for months, but really it makes sense. Having weapon freedom makes it a smidgeon more likely that someone will sacrifice being an Assault when your squad is faced by a tank.</p>

<p>Bouncing back and forth between roles and weapons, it’s a bit like putting on an old pair of slippers, but there’s plenty of fine details to adjust to as well. The one I particularly appreciate was how marking enemies works. Instead of spamming a ping button, you instead mark enemies by shooting at them, in turn giving away your position. I wish you could still just point out a tank, but this is a great change in general. I also really like the new revive system, where you can drag a fallen buddy out from the open and into cover, making you both at least be slow moving targets.</p>
<p>And if we’re really getting into the week, I love that the end of match screen that highlights squads and achievements has a line chart representation of how tickets were depleted through a match of Conquest.</p>

<p>But really there’s just all the bombast of Battlefield’s trademarked all-out warfare. Infantry plays a big role, but so too do vehicles, tanks, helicopters and fighter jets. I can absolutely see myself spending time manning the LMG for a buddy driving a tank, holding down a key position in Conquest and hopping out to fix them up when we take hits. But I also just enjoyed marauding, hopping onto an AA emplacement to take out a pesky helicopter.</p>
<p>The map I played a couple matches on was on the rocky mountainside of Liberation Peak, a set of six control points littered with military defences and buildings. There was some of the destruction available here, but it would really be for the urban battles where this will be felt the most, where entire facades of buildings can collapse in spectacular fashion.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 will arrive with 9 maps, and almost as many game modes. Conquest, Rush and Breakthrough return as the series staples, but there’s the small ball of TDM, Squad DM, Domination, KOTH and something new called Escalation. And of course there will be seasons of content with new maps, modes and events.</p>
<p>So, is Battlefield back? At first blush, it certainly feels like it might be. Thankfully it won’t be long before we can spend more time with it, with two beta weekends kicking off in August, and there’s sure to be plenty more to be said about this once we’ve played more. But also, there’s stuff still to really be revealed and explored that will only emerge for the full release. How are weapon unlocks going to play out? How with Field Specs modify each class? What balance changes can DICE really make from the beta to the full game in time for October?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It has been a while since new information was unearthed regarding the HLX project at Valve, which is thought to be Half-Life 3. Despite the lack of new details, however, work on the project seems to have been proceeding steadily, and development may have reached the final phase, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>In new videos shared yesterday by Tyler McViker and Gabe Follower, it is reported that Counter-Strike 2's massive July 29 update not only brought changes and improvements to the competitive game but also some behind-the-scenes changes to the Source 2 engine related to the Half-Life 3 HLX project. One new line of code in particular, the one mentioning thumpers to scare antlions, which mirrors a line of code in Half-Life 2, seems to be a direct message to dataminers, and further confirmation that the project continues to be in active development.</p>



<p>Not only does the HLX project continue to be in active development, but it may have reached the final phase of development. The most significant change introduced in the new Source 2 engine update is the complete refactoring of AI scripting in the FGD and localization token files. This is pretty significant, as this refactoring has changed how NPCs react to in-game events, going from sounds to what are not called AI events. This has been known to be an HLX feature for a while, but the difference now is that there's a definition file for these AI events, which suggests that the feature is done and polished up to a point that it can be used in scripting and map-making. Hammer, Valve's level design tool, was also recently updated to support many of the Half-Life 3 HLX features discovered in the past few months via datamining, such as vehicle mechanics, wind mechanics, model deformation, thermodynamics mechanics, and more. The fact that the new documentation reads like a tutorial to explain how to use the development tools properly to take advantage of these features also adds more fuel to the fire and even suggests how mod support could be coming not too long after the project launches. Ultimately, this sort of polishing and development tool updates usually happen at the end of development, but considering how differently Valve operates compared to the vast majority of game developers, it cannot be said for certain if the game is close to being announced and released.</p>

<p>Other recent happenings may also suggest that the HLX project thought to be Half-Life 3 could be in the final phase of development. Gabe Follower claims in their video that some parts of the project are already finished and need only to be polished, and developers have started moving on to other projects. Usually, this means the project may have been abandoned, but Gabe Follower believes these developers are moving on to other projects because their work on HLX is no longer needed.</p>

<p>As mentioned, Valve operates differently from other game development studios, so even if the game is in the final phase of development, an announcement and release timeline for the HLX project, thought to be Half-Life 3, remains unknown. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to learn more about what's next for one of gaming's most celebrated series. </p>

In its Q1 financial results for the three months that ended on June 30, Nintendo says it sold 6 million Switch 2 units globally in the seven weeks since launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">which has led to several records being broken</a>.</p><p>The hybrid console has been a hot commodity since it went on sale, exceeding the expectations of Nintendo. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">The company says it still expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles</a> during its current financial year, which ends in March 2026. Meanwhile, Nintendo sold 0.98 million Switch consoles, pushing the lifetime sales of that device up to 153.10 million units sold.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542007-witch-2-sales.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542007" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542007-witch-2-sales.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542007"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 lifetime sales to date</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542007-witch-2-sales.jpg"></figure><p>"Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers," <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo said</a>. "We will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible."</p><p>In the games department, things are also looking good as Nintendo says it has reached sales of 8.67 million units. Mario Kart World made the bulk of these sales at 5.63 million units sold, but that's not too surprising given that the game was available via a bundle console deal.</p><p>Looking ahead, there'll be plenty more reasons to grab a Switch 2 this year with exclusive games like Drag X Drive, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/">Nintendo also held a Direct livestream this week</a>, dedicated to games from third-party studios and developers.

            <p>Itch.io - the digital distribution platform known for its focus on independent game developers and other artists - is today re-indexing adult NSFW (Not Suitable For Work) content that is available for free.</p>
<p>In addition, it is currently in discussions with payment processors who are comfortable with adult material, and will be reintroducing paid content "slowly" to ensure it can "confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term".</p>
<p>Itch.io noted that payment processor Stripe has said it will not support adult content that has been "designed for sexual gratification".</p>

<p>In a statement shared with Itch.io, Stripe said:</p>
<p>"Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future."</p>
<p>In the meantime, Itch.io said those who wish to have their pages eligible for today's re-indexing process must ensure they have the "no payments" option checked.</p>
<p>The platform is also putting a new content warning system in place for pages tagged as being NSFW. It states this refers to pages that have the "contains sensitive material" option checked, as well as tags that suggest the project includes adult content such as "porn" and "fetish".</p>
<p>Itch.io said anyone wanting to be eligible for re-indexing is "required to complete this". The platform added the feature is not quite ready as yet, but those who had their pages previously indexed will be given enough time to complete all the necessary processes "to avoid going in and out of indexing".</p>
<p>You <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">can find further information on the platform's re-indexing efforts via Itch.io</a>.</p>
<p>Today's update from Itch.io follows last week's news that the platform had "deindexed" all NSFW content following discussions with payment processors contacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-approached-payment-processors-because-steam-did-not-respond-australian-pressure-group-collective-shout-claims-responsibility-for-steam-and-itchio-nsfw-game-removal">the same Australian pressure group that recently targeted Steam</a>.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itchio-deindexes-all-nsfw-games-blames-same-anti-porn-group-that-campaigned-against-steam">itch.io creators began reporting their NSFW games were no longer being displayed in search results on the platform</a>. At this time, platform founder Leaf Corcoran said: "We are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change."</p>
<p>Itch.io's movement followed on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Valve "retiring" unspecified NSFW titles and introducing vague new rules banning "certain kinds of adult content" from its own PC storefront</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/itch-begins-re-indexing-free-adult-nsfw-content-as-it-seeks-alternative-payment-processors]]></content:encoded>

In fact, with another quarter under its belt, the OG hybrid is edging ever closer to the DS' lifetime sales.</p>

<p>While surpassing the DS would put the Switch on <em>Nintendo</em>'s podium of all-time sellers, it will still have some way to go if it is to ever overtake the PlayStation 2's 160+ million units sold — which, let's not forget, got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/as-switch-approaches-the-ps2s-lifetime-sales-sony-moves-the-goalposts">generous five million boost</a> from PlayStation's ex-CEO Jim Ryan last year.</p>
<p>The big 160 feels a long way off for the Switch 1 (Nintendo only forecasts an additional 4.5 million hardware sales for the system in FY 2026), but we'd be surprised if we're <em>not</em> looking at a new Nintendo gold medallist in the next one or two financial reports.</p>

Following its launch in June, the Switch 2 console has now sold 5.82 million units according to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">Nintendo’s Q1 earnings report</a>, more than double the 2.7 million unit sales achieved by the original Switch in its first month.</p><p>“Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers,” Nintendo said in its report, pledging to strengthen production. While Switch 2 preorders sold out across major retailers in the US ahead of the launch, some limited stock was still available on launch day, likely because Nintendo had built up enough inventory to meet initial demand.</p><p>That success is driving a 132 percent surge in quarterly revenue, which increased to ¥572.3 billion (around $3.8 billion) between April-June, compared to ¥246.6 billion (around $1.6 billion) for the same period last year. Nintendo says it’s still forecasting to hit 15 million Switch 2 sales by the end of its 2026 financial year, despite uncertainties like Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/further-modifying-the-reciprocal-tariff-rates/">White House announced</a> that a 20 percent tariff on goods from Vietnam — where Nintendo produces its Switch 2 consoles — will begin next week. That’s double the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646693/trump-tariffs-pause-nintendo-switch-2">10 percent baseline tariff</a> introduced in April that Nintendo used to forecast earnings for the current fiscal year.</p><p>“While there have been changes in the market environment since we announced our initial forecast for the fiscal year, such as the US tariff measures, at this time there is no significant impact on our earnings forecast for this fiscal year,” <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">Nintendo said</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2’s popularity at launch has made it the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest-selling game console</a> of all time. Meanwhile, people are still purchasing the first Switch console, which has now hit 153.1 million units in lifetime sales — inching closer to dethroning the DS as Nintendo’s most successful console, which sold 154.02 million units. The Wii U sold just 13.7 million units over its entire lifetime.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Right, so. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">supposed to go</a> as follows: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-3-remaster">Yakuza 3 Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-4-remaster">Yakuza 4 Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-5">Yakuza 5</a> Remastered, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-6">Yakuza 6: The Song Of Life</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a>, then off into full-blown Like A Dragon land, and on to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza</a>. Easy. Except right now in my Steam library, it's not. The Kiwamis are cheekily lurking behind Yakuza 6, and the LADs are before all of their more Japanese gangsterly-named siblings.</p>
<p>It's chaos and anarchy. I can't live like this. The good news is that thanks to the update Steam's Client Beta has just gotten, it looks like I'll no longer have to.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Added a customisation tab to game properties," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/545616353498759462?l=english">the notes</a> for it read, "The customisation tab allows users to view and set custom artwork for the game and set a custom sort title that will be used instead of the actual title when sorting games in the library."</p>
<p>Cue <a href="https://x.com/chibilawl/status/1951056729778823585">many</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1meelqh/theyre_finally_doing_it_oh_my_god/">many</a> folks who've been frustratedly looking at the alphabetically misbehaving names in their library letting out a big sigh of relief. To be clear, the custom name you add won't overwrite the game's display name in your library, it's just hidden away behind-the-scenes, letting the storefront's inner workings know not to put 2016's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> above 2013's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of that, this Client Beta update's all about useful but unglamourous fixes for various issues you might run into when Steaming. Some are specifically aimed at big picture mode, recording games, and Linux, with a good chunk of them being interface-related.</p>
<p>Oh, and the top genres list in the store menu should now be "more relevant and dynamic", which I assume means you'll know in an instant if Steamers all over the world suddenly get way more into shmups.</p>
<p>If you've taken one look at the new sorting powers on offer and are currently salivating at the prospect of getting your librarian on, instructions to opt into the Client Beta can be found <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3">here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/praise-the-kiryu-steams-latest-client-beta-update-will-finally-let-you-sort-like-a-dragons-and-yakuza-into-the-right-order]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> is set to go up against Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this year, and while both are military first-person shooters, it sounds like there will be at least one significant point of difference: skins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty’s foray into goofy skins territory is not a new phenomena, although recent releases have certainly amped up the conversation around them. With the likes of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Dad hitting the game this year shortly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-ongoing-420-obsession-sparks-debate-among-fans-some-have-had-enough-others-really-want-that-seth-rogen-skin">weed-obsessed bundles starring Seth Rogen</a>, some fans have said they’ve had enough of what they call the 'Fortnite-ification' of their beloved Call of Duty, and have pleaded with publisher Activision to return to its mil-sim roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Battlefield 6, a game EA is pitching as having a “gritty realism” aesthetic. But will this extend to skins? In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-dev-responds-to-fears-of-unrealistic-beevis-and-butthead-skins-we-listen/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer</a>, UX director Alan Pimm said he was unaware of any internal plans to release crossover skins that would break the aesthetic Battlefield 6 is going for, and promised the developers were listening to fan feedback.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I can tell you is I don’t know of any plans and, at the moment, that package is the ‘gritty realism’ and that we listen. That I can tell you,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we must also bear in mind that there is enormous pressure on Battlefield 6 to do the business for EA. Indeed the company has said it’s all in on the game, which it sees as a platform just as Activision does with Call of Duty. It would be naive to expect EA to resist the temptation to release eye-catching skins, and even crossover with other IP for bundles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, how far will it go? Will EA, when all is said and do, stick with Battlefield 6’s “gritty realism” when it comes to skins, as Call of Duty initially set out to? Or will it buckle and end up going down the same path with 90s cartoon skins of its own?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/01/f2dyabzwaaa5-ec-1754039802526.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nicki Minaj hit Call of Duty in 2023.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate interview with DBLTAP, Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil doubled down on EA's committment to grounded realism, and even pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-call-of-duty-season-5-snoop-dogg">Call of Duty's infamous Nicki Minaj skin</a> as something Battlefield 6 doesn't need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has to be grounded," he said. "That is what BF3 and BF4 was — it was all soldiers, on the ground. It’s going to be like this,” Uchil said, pointing at the key art featuring soldiers in soldier gear looking out over a wartorn New York City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Battlefield 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-preview">a hands-on preview</a>.

Nintendo said demand for Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and it apologizes to consumers. “We will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible,” the company said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a fantastic result for the Switch 2 hardware itself, which is comfortably the fastest-selling in Nintendo history. Nintendo said demand “has surpassed our expectations.” Still, it’s sticking to its forecast of selling 15 million Switch 2 units in the financial year ending March 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for games, Nintendo said Switch 2 software sales reached 8.67 million units. Launch title Mario Kart World made up the bulk of those game sales, shifting 5.63 million units (almost as many as the Switch 2 itself has sold). But it’s worth noting that figure includes units bundled with the hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result is that overall sales totaled 572.3 billion yen (approx. $3.8 billion), and operating profit grew 4% to 56.9 billion yen ($378 million) for the three months ending June 30. After all the furore over Trump’s tariffs and changing product prices, in its financial report Nintendo said “at this time there is no significant impact on our earnings forecast for this fiscal year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, demand for the OG Switch has remained even after the launch of the Switch, and sales of the console inched ever higher, and are now at 153.1 million. The number of annual playing users between July 2024 and June 2025 has remained above 100 million, which means Nintendo launched Switch 2 into an environment where a huge number of people were already playing Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming Switch 2 exclusives include Drag x Drive, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Kirby Air Riders, and FromSoftware's The Duskbloods.

Tencent describes the game as taking place in a "world overrun by colossal machines" on its Steam store page. Sound familiar? Sony wants a court to prevent Tencent from marketing and distributing the title, and in a wild twist even alleges that Tencent sought to license the Horizon IP in 2024 before revealing Light of Motiram a few months later.

It turns out, however, that a group called Collective Short, which professes to fight "sexploitation" was at least partially to blame for the wave of censorship that washed across the game industry almost overnight.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/00174cf7731d2/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's latest financial results are live, and the platform holder has confirmed Switch 2 hardware sales "exceeding 6 million units globally in the seven weeks after launch."</p>
<p>Switch 2 launched on 5th June and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">today's Q1 financial report</a> includes figures up to the end of that month. The stated figure of "more than 6 million" accounts for sales past that date, though, to approximately 24th July (seven weeks post-launch).</p>
<p>As of 30th June, Nintendo had sold 5.82 million Switch 2s (3.5 million <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">in the first four days</a>) along with 5.63 million copies of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, including the digital downloads included in the popular Mario Kart hardware bundle. Overall Switch 2 software sales totalled 8.67 million units.</p>
<p>For comparison, the original Switch managed to shift 0.98 million units in the same period, down from 2.1 million in the same quarter last year (-53.5%), bringing it to a lifetime total of 153.10 million units so far. Switch 1 software sales came in at 24.4 million, down from 30.64 million in Q1 last year (-20.4%).</p>
<p>Here's the regional breakdown for Switch 2 hardware sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>Japan: 1.27 million</li>
<li>The Americas: 2.08 million</li>
<li>Europe: 1.34 million</li>
<li>Other: 1.13 million</li>
</ul>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d33cb7f24bec8/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> launched to critical acclaim, but isn't included in today's results (it launched in July) — <em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you'd expect following a successful console launch, gross profit increased 21.4% year-on-year (to 185.1 billion yen), although the lower profit made on the newer hardware meant profit margins declined 29.5 points to 32.3%.</p>
<p>Nintendo's forecast to sell 15 million Switch 2 units this financial year remains unchanged from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-expects-to-sell-15-million-switch-2-consoles-this-financial-year">its May forecasts</a>. The company expects to sell 45 million software units in the same period.</p>
<p>The report states that demand for the new system is exceeding supply "in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers."</p>
<hr>
<p><em>tl;dr: Switch 2 sold like hotcakes, Mario Kart World has a crazy-good attach rate (as you'd expect), and Nintendo's new generation is off to a very solid, record-breaking start.</em></p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening of pre-orders</a>, Electronic Arts has also shared the minimum and recommended PC system requirements for Battlefield 6, and they are relatively mild for a 2025 Frostbite game that looks this good. It will also 'only' require 75GB of your drive's space at launch, and the game even runs on a traditional HDD.</p>

<p>Of course, at this time, we don't know if there will be any support for ray tracing effects, although it would be weird if not. After all, Battlefield V was <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-bfv-nvidia-rtx/">one of the very first games to support NVIDIA RTX</a>, specifically for reflections. The support of PC upscalers like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel is practically a guarantee, though.</p>

<p>It won't be long until the open beta hits, though, with the first weekend scheduled to go live in just eight days. </p>

                                        <p>When I was growing up, E3 was one of the events in the calendar that I looked forward to the most. From console reveals to star-studded conferences, the Electronic Entertainment Expo was a series of corporate conferences that somehow felt like The Oscars, Comic-Con and Glastonbury combined. It was there that Final Fantasy VII Remake and The Last Guardian were finally shown (at the same conference); where then Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé made his public debut; and the venue where Keanu Reeves told a packed LA auditorium that they were all breathtaking. Yet for all its show-stopping game and console reveals, after 2020, it was the show itself that stopped, with the last in-person E3 taking place in 2019.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540186-gamescom_24_071_091.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540186-gamescom_24_071_091.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540186"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540186-gamescom_24_071_091.jpg"></figure><p>Luckily for mourning gamers, there was always another world-leading interactive entertainment show that connected fans and industry folk with demos, head-turning announcements and best-in-class community events: Germany's gamescom. Where E3 was an event that was media-only for most of its existence, gamescom was always--and very much continues to be--a public-facing celebration of games and gamers; a convention that is just as brilliant for inspiring world-beating cosplay as it is for connecting journalists with publishers and industry folks in the business area. E3 may be gone, but gamescom is still here, having established itself as the world's biggest and best gaming event.</p><p>Since 2019, gamescom has begun hosting its own games announcements, with the annual Geoff Keighley-hosted gamescom Opening Night Live gaining a reputation for delivering a non-stop cavalcade of exciting reveals. With gamescom's annual August celebration now comfortably the largest gaming event in the world--and with new gamescom sister events now delighting gamers in Brazil and Singapore (gamescom Asia is moving to Thailand for its next event)--it feels like the right time to celebrate the legacy of gaming's most beloved event. So, without further ado, here's a history of how Cologne's once humble convention went on to change the game forever.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540187-gamescom_24_069_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540187" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540187-gamescom_24_069_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540187"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540187-gamescom_24_069_001.jpg"></figure><h2>gamescom Origins</h2><p>Starting life in 2009, gamescom immediately attracted the attention of the biggest publishers in the games industry, alongside 228,000 excitable punters. With 450 exhibitors showing up in its first year, the inaugural gamescom also saw Sony announce the PlayStation 3 Slim, alongside Microsoft revealing Fable 3 for the first time. Since then, gamescom has only gone from strength to strength, attracting more players, developers and publishers with each new year that goes by.</p><p>Esports became a cornerstone of the Cologne convention. In 2011, gamescom hosted the first-ever DOTA 2 international tournament to great success, leading to massive Starcraft 2, League of Legends, and Counter Strike competitions being held at gamescom in the following years. By 2017, gamescom had attracted over 100,000 more visitors, with 355,000 people attending the event, and gamescom's doors were opened by none other than Germany’s Chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p><p>Alongside these public-facing demos and reveals, from 2009-2016, gamescom also hosted a sister developer-focused event, a European spin-off of San Francisco’s legendary Game Developer Conference.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540188-gamescom_24_068_066.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540188" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540188-gamescom_24_068_066.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540188"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540188-gamescom_24_068_066.jpg"></figure><h2>gamescom Revelations</h2><p>In 2018, gamescom had over 1000 exhibitors showcasing at their event. Nvidia made headlines that year by revealing their GeForce RTX 20 Series at the event, with 370,000 gamers, developers, journalists and publishers all making the pilgrimage to Cologne to see the best games in the world. Thankfully, 2018 was also the last year that only those on the ground could share in the fun. Ten years after gamescom first opened its doors, in 2019, gamescom kicked off its first-ever livestreamed event--gamescom ONL. Hosted by The Game Awards' Geoff Keighley, gamescom ONL immediately cemented itself as a marquee, industry-shaping showcase, with new looks at Gears of War 5, Call of Duty, and Death Stranding alongside announcements of titles like Little Nightmares 2. With 1,500 people watching live in the auditorium and over 500,000 people tuning in online, gamescom ONL was a huge success.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540192-gamescom_24_068_072.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540192" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540192-gamescom_24_068_072.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540192"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540192-gamescom_24_068_072.jpg"></figure><p>As the pandemic hurriedly cancelled events and public gatherings across the world, gamescom took the entire show online, its 2020 edition delivering a jam-packed schedule of online developer interviews and new looks at games alongside its second gamescom Opening Night Live. It was also the first time gamescom published content specifically for independent gaming with gamescom awesome indies. The show provided recognition for the hardworking, creative indie developers who produce some of the most unique games in the industry, and also provided tantalising teasers for gamers who appreciate the indie scene.</p><h2>gamescom Evolution</h2><p>As the world reopened after the pandemic, so did gamescom, with 2022's edition offering gamers a canny mix of online and in-person events. Since then, gamescom has only become more vital for the games industry--the beating heart of in-person game feedback, world-exclusive demos, and dream-fulfilling game reveals. Over the years, gamescom's cultural and political influence has continued to grow, with Chancellor Dr. Angela Merkel's visit in 2017 followed by German ministers like Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck in 2023 and 2024. Federal Minister for Research, Dorothee Bär--the representative responsible for games in the new German government--has also attended. European games associations such as Video Games Europe and EGDF also regularly take advantage of gamescom, using it as a place to invite political leaders to the event, with 2024's gamescom hosting over 500 political guests.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540193-gamescom_24_068_064.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540193-gamescom_24_068_064.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540193"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540193-gamescom_24_068_064.jpg"></figure><p>Yet it’s not just the in-person extravaganza that has blossomed. In its five short years of existence, gamescom Opening Night Live has only gone from strength to strength, establishing itself as a key event in gaming culture’s calendar. Gamescom ONL has been chosen as the place to reveal Borderlands 4, Dead Island 2, Dune Awakening, and many others, with 2024’s edition seeing 44 million viewers watching the show's content globally.</p><p>Last year, gamescom tripled its opening exhibitor number, hosting 1,462 exhibitors, with even more exhibitors and visitors expected in 2025.

            <p>Mafia: The Old Country players on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will be able to choose between Quality and Performance visual modes when the game launches in a week's time.</p>
<p>Those who prefer a higher resolution should plump for Quality Mode, while those who would rather prioritise framerate should go for Performance Mode. <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1951012716409397433">The studio</a> said Mafia: The Old Country will run at an "average" of 60fps when played in Performance Mode. The studio's statement does not include Xbox Series S, which will presumably run at a lower framerate.</p>
<p>In addition, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> has confirmed the PC requirements from Minimum (suitable for older hardware) to Epic ("If you've got a powerful-enough PC, these Epic specs will give you the absolute best visual fidelity for Mafia: The Old Country's rendition of 1900s Sicily").</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> team has asked its community to stop directly blaming or criticising the artist who created cards for its mobile trading game using "incorrect reference materials", which turned out to be unofficial fan art.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it came to light that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-developer-apologises-deeply-after-players-discover-key-artwork-for-its-new-set-was-based-on-fan-drawing">fan artwork had been inadvertently used as a reference to create cards for Pokémon TCG Pocket's Wisdom of Sea and Sky expansion</a>. At this time, the developer acknowledged it had "provided incorrect reference materials as official documents" to the artist who was commissioned to create the cards in question. However, it never explicitly stated how the materials were provided, and in the time since many were still directing the blame towards the illustrator themself for copying the fan art.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Now, Pokémon TCG Pocket's publisher The Pokémon Company together with developer Creatures Inc have issued a new statement, affirming the blame does not lie with the illustrator but with them.</p>
<p>"Regarding the previously announced issue with the Ho-Oh EX (3-star) and Lugia EX (3-star) illustrations – it has come to our attention that there is criticism towards the cards' illustrator circulating online," the statement, which was shared via the official Japanese X account of Pokémon TCG Pocket, reads (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-pokemon-company-claims-full-responsibility-for-tcg-pocket-card-plagiarism-issue-asks-fans-not-to-criticize-artist/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"The illustration errors were caused by the production teams of The Pokémon Company and Creatures Inc, who provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator, and we intend to take full responsibility for it."</p>
<p>The companies explained there are two workflows when it comes to creating cards for Pokémon TCG Pocket - either illustrators have creative control over the card designs, which is the most common practice, or the game's production team create a 'blueprint' of what it requires for a card. A commissioned illustrator then tweaks and finalises the concept before it is added into the game, and it would appear that this is what happened with the production of the since-removed Ho-oh and Lugia cards.</p> <div>

<p>The Pokémon Company and Creatures Inc have asked the community to stop blaming and criticising the illustrator for what they admit is their error, and said they will enforce stricter measures going forward, to ensure this kind of mix up does not happen again.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the affected cards have been replaced with placeholders cards which read "New Artwork Coming Soon" in lieu of a creature (see below).</p>

			<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly financials</a> just delivered an update on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 sales</a>. According to the Big N, the hardware has now exceeded a sell-through of six million units in the seven weeks after launch. By the end of the quarter that ended in June, the Nintendo Switch 2 had sold 5.82 million units. Software sales for the platform have reached 8.67 million units in total, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> unsurprisingly taking up the lion's share (5.63 million units, nearly one per Switch 2 buyer).</p>



<p>Nintendo recognized the existing supply issue:</p>



<p><em>Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers. We will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible.</em></p>



<p>The previous conservative forecast of 15 million Switch 2 units and 45 million software units sold in fiscal year 2026 remains unchanged. </p>



<p>Net sales predictably boomed in this first quarter compared to last year, from 246.6 billion yen ($1.6 billion) to 572.3 billion yen ($3.8 billion), marking a 132.1% increase. However, the IP related business decreased slightly this quarter (from 17.5 billion yen to 16.7 billion yen, a 4.4% downgrade) due to decreased revenue related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, Black Flag actor Matt Ryan suggested Ubisoft was set to release a remake of its piratical Assassin's Creed entry, and it now sounds like the developer wasn't exactly thrilled about that.</p>
<p>Ryan portrayed Edward Kenway in Assassin's Creed Black Flag, which came out in 2013. It soon became a series favourite for many, and in recent times rumours of a remake have been making the rounds.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>These rumours were amplified again in June, when Ryan hinted not very subtly to one fan they should perhaps get ready to replay the game, implying with a bit of a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' that the remake was indeed real.</p>
<p>"Have you beaten [Black Flag]?" Ryan asked a fan in a clip that was shared around social media (see below). The fan confirmed they had but some time ago, to which Ryan followed up with: "Well, you might have to beat it again…"</p>
<p>When the fan suggested maybe playing through all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a>, Ryan replied: "Well, especially this one… There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything." </p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Edward Kenway's voice actor, Matt Ryan, said this during a fan interaction. It looks like he hinted at the Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remake. 🔥</p><p>🟢 Quote:<br>“Have you beat the game?… well you may have to beat it again”<br>And <br>“There’s a reason I say that but I can’t say… <a href="https://t.co/n3PwF8Q7Ri">pic.twitter.com/n3PwF8Q7Ri</a></p></div>— Zephryss⛩️ (@TheRealZephryss) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealZephryss/status/1939392046151926243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Anyway, fast forward to today, and it turns out not only was Ubisoft unhappy that Ryan had been a little loose-lipped, but the company actually also threatened him with legal action.</p>
<p>At another more recent convention, the Edward Kenway actor was asked about a Black Flag remake or remaster, to which he replied with a casual shrug and a "I don't know, mate". The questioner then pressed Ryan further, calling back to the previous video from June, when the actor then explained:</p>
<p>"Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this [gestures towards the person filming the exchange], and I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone.</p>
<p>"And then the company threatened to sue me. So [now] I say nothing." A video of the exchange was uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylo_hd659/video/7532502046889528598">TikTok</a> but has since been removed. A copy is embedded below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn’t realize he was being recorded😵 <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>— The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Ubisoft for further comment on Ryan's Black Flag-flavoured exchanges, and will update you if we hear anything more.</p>
<p>Word of a Black Flag remake first began circulating in 2023, when it was said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> studio Ubisoft Singapore was "heavily involved". Of course, Skull and Bones - which sadly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-metacritic-user-reviews-open-to-generally-unfavourable-scores">failed to really get any decent wind in its sails following its launch last year</a> - began life as a spin-off from Black Flag.</p>
<p>At the time of this initial rumour, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">project was not expected to be completed for "at least a few years"</a>, though given we are now marching firmly into the latter half of 2025, a 'few years' is actually coming up <em>relatively </em>soon now. Stay tuned!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Monday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> on the PlayStation 6 and PlayStation handheld codenames (Orion and Canis), YouTube Moore's Law Is Dead (MLID) has now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tym6xxCKvHg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> specs for both upcoming consoles from a leaked 2023 AMD presentation.</p>



<p>According to the leaks, Sony is going for a relatively conservative system. Its main goal will be keeping power lower than a base PlayStation 5, with the target being 160W TBP. The console will employ a chiplet design, with 8 Zen 6 cores and between 40 and 48 RDNA 5 Compute Units clocked at over 3GHz.</p>



<p>These are fewer Compute Units than the 60 available for the PlayStation 5 Pro, but they will run much faster. Moreover, RDNA 5 is expected to bring a noticeable improvement in IPC performance, so each Compute Unit will deliver more performance than the CUs in the PS5 Pro. </p>



<p>The memory also has a lower bus than the PS5 Pro (160 or 192 bit compared to the PS5 Pro's 256 bit), but it will be powered by the much faster GDDR7, allowing it to reach clocks of 32Gbps for an estimated bandwidth of 640GB/s-768GB/s, depending on the final bus spec. That's higher than the PS5 Pro's bandwidth of 576GB/s.</p>



<p>Overall, the estimation is that rasterization performance will be over three times that of the base PlayStation 5 and around double that of the newer PlayStation 5 Pro. That would place the performance level of the PlayStation 6 roughly around a GeForce RTX 4080, although of course, it's never quite an apples-to-apples comparison when measuring consoles and PC GPUs directly. The uplift of ray tracing performance should be much higher (6-10x), thanks to the expected advancements AMD will bring in the area. </p>



<p>Backward compatibility is expected to be maintained for PS5 and PS4. The production phase should begin in mid-2027, with an estimated release in stores in late 2027 or early 2028 for a price of around $499.</p>



<p>As for the Project Canis handheld, it should use a monolithic 3nm die equipped with 4 Zen 6C cores. The GPU is expected to have between 12 and 20 RDNA 5 Compute Units clocked between 1.6 and 2.2GHz. The memory will equip a 128-bit bus with LPDDR5X 7500 RAM. Sony is reportedly targeting a 15-watt thermal board power.</p>



<p>Rasterization performance should be around half that of the base PlayStation 5, but thanks to the advancements brought by the RDNA 5 architecture, the uplift of ray tracing performance should be higher. The handheld should also feature backward compatibility with PS4 and PS5, microSD and M.2 SSD storage support, haptic feedback, dual microphones, a touchscreen, and a USB-C port supporting fast charging and video output.</p>



<p>Overall, it should easily outperform the Xbox Ally X. However, that's not saying much since that handheld is launching soon, and the PlayStation handheld is instead targeting a similar launch window to its bigger sibling, the PlayStation 6. Pricing estimates put it around $400 or $500.</p>



<p>Moore's Law Is Dead also briefly touched upon the next-generation Xbox console, whose codename is Magnus. It should be equipped with 11 Zen 6 cores and 68 Compute Units, proving to be more powerful than the PS5 Pro but not quite a match for the PlayStation 6. However, it should launch sooner than that, which resonates with <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous rumors</a> that Microsoft might be looking to try a repeat of the Xbox 360 situation, which debuted one year before the PlayStation 3 and was Xbox's most successful console to date. Still, the YouTuber says the new Xbox console won't be available before 2027.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the specs came from an old presentation. Therefore, specific details might have changed since. We won't know the official specs until well into 2026, at the very least. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-%E2%80%93-we-played-it-for-5-hours.1259331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who loved Bloober Team’s 2024 remake of Silent Hill 2, I’m happy to report that while being made by an entirely different developer, Silent Hill f boasts that same level of quality and polish. From story to worldbuilding, from graphics to combat and exploration, Taiwan-based developer Neobards has crafted an experience that meets the high bar set by the Polish developer, albeit in a drastically different setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I started walking the dense yet deserted streets of Ebisugaoka, it was immediately apparent just how detailed and well-realized this fictional remote town in the mountains of rural Japan in the Sixties is. With an immersive over-the-shoulder view and no UI on screen during exploration, Silent Hill f is a game that tells a convincing story through its visuals.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill f Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly, I was initially skeptical of Konami’s decision to entrust a non-Japanese developer to create a game set in Japan, but five hours of actually playing Silent Hill f shattered such prejudices. Ebisugaoka is undoubtedly one of the most impressive contemporary Japanese townscapes I have ever seen in a video game, and that comes from someone who has lived in Japan for the majority of his life and loves games like Shenmue, Persona, and Ghostwire: Tokyo.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Exploring a Japanese mountain village</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the few minor issues I had with the Silent Hill 2 remake was that the majority of its playtime is spent inside buildings and facilities. While these functioned as well-designed dungeons packed with horrifying enemies to fight and intricate puzzles to solve, the increase in volume compared to the 2001 original made it feel like exploration of the actual town of Silent Hill was limited.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised that the vast majority of my playtime with Silent Hill f was spent exploring Ebisugaoka. Old wooden houses with tin roofs line the narrow alleys, scattered with bicycles, flower pots, and mailboxes. Small streams and footpaths between rice fields gently lead the way to the village. Fences along the river and concrete stairways following the slopes create a townscape that oozes with atmosphere. Files and other documents scattered throughout the town add context to Ebisugaoka, which flourished as a mining town during its heyday. Now, it has become a largely forgotten village and its people are stuck in old ways, such as favoring traditional healthcare methods over modern medical science and being overly devout to the Shinto deity Inari. The context of Ebisugaoka and its people immediately feel like they are an integral part of Silent Hill f’s cohesive story, which made me eager to go off the beaten path and obtain every hidden file.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Walking the empty streets of Ebisugaoka and heading to the local candy store to meet up with Hinako’s fellow high school friends feels like an authored walking simulator reminiscent of games like Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story starts after protagonist Hinako – a female high school student – runs away from home after being scolded by her drunk father. Walking the empty streets of Ebisugaoka and heading to the local candy store to meet up with Hinako’s fellow high school friends feels like an authored walking simulator reminiscent of games like Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it doesn’t take long until Hinako and her friends discover something is wrong in town, and before you know it Hinako is holding an iron pipe in her hands, an iconic weapon of the series. Ebisugaoka then gradually proves to not just be suited for a captivating walking simulator experience, but also the perfect setting for a horror game, as its narrow alleys and staircases are ideal to hide enemies behind corners while also functioning as a maze for the player to get lost in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In some instances, doors left ajar and open windows invite Hinako inside traditional tatami-floored houses, where she will have to solve some simple puzzles in order to make her way through to the next area. These puzzles play out in an unconventional way. One puzzle, for example, had me obtain keys to a locked door, but there was nothing noteworthy inside. Then, as I went back to the corridor another door suddenly swung open, which gave me the chills.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Something feels off</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f’s scenario writer Ryukishi07 sees Japanese horror as a sub-genre that doesn’t so much rely on threats to the protagonist's life, but rather makes you feel uncomfortable by creating situations that feel off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you think about it, Silent Hill is a series known for just that. While there isn’t a lack of life-threatening encounters, some of the series’ most uncomfortable moments are in conversations with its outright weird characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Silent Hill f, Hinako and her friends are trying to find a way to escape the haunted town of Ebisugaoka. Interactions with these friends seem normal at first, but then suddenly they say or do something that catches you off guard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, in typical Silent Hill fashion, puzzles often reveal something about Hinako or the world she inhabits. A puzzle on a misty rice field has you examine scarecrows in order to learn the direction you should be heading, which is connected to a childhood trauma of Hinako getting lost and being afraid of the scarecrows.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill f - Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During my playthrough, puzzles never felt too difficult. Hints provided by files you obtain never make the solution too obvious, while still giving the player an idea of what they have to do. On a related note, Silent Hill f has difficulty settings for both its combat and puzzles, and while Konami advised me to play on Story mode for both, I stubbornly chose Normal mode as I wanted to take on a challenge. While the difficulty of the puzzles never overwhelmed me, combat proved to be a bit more demanding. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Weapon durability at its best</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f’s combat relies entirely on melee attacks. Hinako can obtain all sorts of weapons ranging from iron pipes to kitchen knives and baseball bats, but no guns come into play. With some exceptions, these weapons are not obtained through story beats, but are scattered throughout Silent Hill f’s world like other resources, and Hinako can carry up to three weapons at a time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Silent Hill f’s combat relies entirely on melee attacks. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you wield iron pipes and stab at enemies with knives, you will notice that the game has weapon durability. It is a nice touch that weapons that are about to break actually change in appearance, so expect to be holding a bent pipe or a broken bat. This also functions as a hint to the player, which Hinako will acknowledge by mentioning that she should fix it. Weapons can be fixed by using a repair kit, but these are so scarce that on many occasions you will have to say goodbye to your new favorite weapon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While weapon durability is often regarded as a burden in games, it works here as finding a new weapon and repair kits quickly becomes an integral part of the resource management that the survival horror genre is known for, especially since you won’t be having to look for ammo this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A clever system allows you to turn in your resources for an in-game currency at save points, which can be used to increase your stats or obtain new amulets that can be equipped to give you certain buffs. That means that if you are careful and don’t waste your resources, leftovers can be turned into something useful, which feels like a great reward to a well-planned expedition. Hinako can only carry a limited amount of items, which also seems to stimulate active use of this new trading system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the Silent Hill 2 remake, resources were so abundant that skilled players didn’t really have to worry about resource management, to the extent that they would have a large stock of unused ammo and items by the end of the game. Silent Hill f solves this problem by making resources tradable.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Silent Souls?</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat itself has a similar feel to Silent Hill 2’s close-range combat. You can dodge enemy attacks with the DualSense’s circle button, while you can activate a light and heavy attack with R1 and R2, respectively. Your limited reach and lengthy attack motions give a realistic, weighty feel to combat. Heavy attacks especially are slow and need to be timed well, contributing to the feeling that Hinako is just a teenager with limited strength.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, each weapon type has a completely unique set of motions and reach. Swinging a newly obtained baseball bat at an enemy or charging at them with a knife you found in the kitchen of a local residence always creates new and exciting situations.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What sets Silent Hill f’s combat apart from Silent Hill 2’s more limited melee combat is the implementation of timed dodges and counterattacks.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What sets Silent Hill f’s combat apart from Silent Hill 2’s more limited melee combat is the implementation of timed dodges and counterattacks. The latter in particular deals lots of damage and is key in battle. Enemies briefly show a sign when a counterattack can be utilized, but unless you have trained your reflex skills by playing games like of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, you will likely have a hard time reacting. That’s where the Focus mode comes in, which can be triggered by holding L2. When in Focus mode, enemy signs for counterattacks appear for longer, while also charging up a power attack that staggers an enemy. That means you might head into Focus Mode with the intention of going for a counterattack, but find yourself switching to a power attack when it charges before the enemy shows an opening.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Focus Mode is tied to Hinako’s mental energy gauge, which exists separately from her stamina and health bar. Interestingly, the upper limit of her mental energy decreases when enemies do something that scares her or when she is frightened by a certain event, connecting the gameplay to the story and Hinako’s mental state. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily, there are items that can recover the upper limit of your mental energy gauge, but Hinako’s stamina is limited too. When she runs out of stamina and mental energy, she can become so frightened and tired that she won’t even be able to move for a while. Managing her energy resources, therefore, is key to survival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fighting one regular enemy is fairly manageable, but when confronted by multiple enemies, running away often felt like the best option, especially since enemies don’t give experience points or drop resources. Combat was fun enough that I found myself actively engaging in fights even if there wasn’t a real benefit to it beyond being able to explore the environment more freely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While keeping combat engaging and complex, Silent Hill f does a great job in making the player feel weak. The design cleverly incorporates this by having what seems to be a boss battle at first actually play out as a sequence in which the player has to find an escape route.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another iconic element to the series is the existence of an alternate world, which is present in Silent Hill f as well. Hinako is occasionally transported to a different dimension that shows a more traditional Japan, where a mysterious masked figure guides her through the grounds of various shrines. Here, Hinako obtains traditional Japanese weapons such as the Naginata, a pole weapon with a curved blade on the end, similar to a glaive or halberd that is known to be mostly used by women. Weapons that Hinako finds in this alternate world don’t break, but Hinako won’t be able to carry them over to Ebisugaoka.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was in this realm that I encountered the main boss of my playtime, which proved much more difficult than I had anticipated. Even with my full understanding of the combat mechanics and systems, its long reach, hard-to-predict attack patterns, and multiple stages required significant trial and error. The boss took me nearly an hour to beat, but gradually learning how to take on the boss was a welcome challenge that never felt unfair. For reference, my colleague was playing on Story Mode and defeated the boss on his second try, but an acquaintance from another media outlet who was also playing on Story Mode didn’t manage to defeat the boss and ran out of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While he didn’t specifically mention the Soulslike genre, series producer Motoi Okamoto says that Silent Hill f’s combat was inspired by the current popularity of more difficult action games. With multiple difficulty settings, Silent Hill f is by no means a Soulslike, but its boss design shares a similar learning curve that ultimately results in a great feeling of satisfaction when you finally beat it. Silent Hill f is a story-driven experience above anything else, but it just happens to have really solid combat mechanics and systems at the same time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One unique component of Silent Hill f’s storytelling is the notebook Hinako carries. Here you can read about characters, locations, and events that appear in the story, all written from Hinako’s perspective. At first, it seems to be a pretty straightforward archive, but events in the story can trigger additional text for previously unlocked entries. Instead of simply repeating what events in the story already told you, these additional texts go much deeper into the lore and background. Sometimes, they can slightly contradict or change your view on characters and events, indicating that things are never what they seem to be on the surface. It is not hard to imagine that for a deeper understanding of Silent Hill f’s story and characters, examining these texts will be essential.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Back to school</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The last part of my demo took place inside a school, which was essentially a dungeon similar to Silent Hill 2’s aforementioned apartment buildings, hospitals, museums and hotels. Upon entering the school, Hinako obtains a map of the building which the player will have to use to navigate their way through. Luckily, Hinako is just as diligent a note-taking enthusiast as Silent Hill 2’s James, so whenever you learn that a door is locked or that there is a passage somewhere, it will be noted on the map. Inside the school, I had to solve a multitude of puzzles in order to find keys to reach different classrooms and floors while fighting and running away from enemies along the way. Just like the town itself, the old wooden school building oozes with atmosphere and feels lively even though none of its students or teachers are there, and Hinako's remark to herself, “I haven't been here since graduation,” subtly added to the atmosphere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While in recent video games, the abundance of self-talk by the protagonist can sometimes feel a bit too much, Hinako’s occasional monologue succeeds in subtly contributing to the situation without ever coming over as an exposition dump.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Okamoto, the average playtime for Silent Hill f will be about 12 or 13 hours, which should indicate that I have played through roughly one third of the game. While I don’t know how things will go from here, so far the game’s balance between town exploration and interior facilities feels like an improvement over the Silent Hill 2 remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, while the first five hours of the game felt like they were structured linearly, Silent Hill f has multiple endings like many other games in the series, including the famous UFO ending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My time with Silent Hill f was promising to say the least. Its worldbuilding and story had me so intrigued that I still think back on my brief visit to Ebisugaoka almost a week later. The deep fog that envelops the town somehow feels more natural than in the town of Silent Hill, perhaps due to the fact that Ebisugaoka is a mountain village. Ebisugaoka just feels like the perfect fit for a psychological horror narrative, and all of Silent Hill f’s systems and mechanics complement the setting. Series composer Akira Yamaoka’s soundtrack also does a stellar job in making the player feel uncomfortable throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Silent Hill f seems to be a horror game that gets everything right. If, like me, the Silent Hill 2 remake was one of your favorite games of 2024, Silent Hill f has the potential to become a serious game of the year contender when it releases for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Silent Hill 2 f ©Konami Digital Entertainment</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>*In-development footage and screenshots are shown.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bd8dd6dd346c/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Eclipse</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new wave of Game-Key Card titles have just been announced for the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">following Nintendo's Partner Showcase</a>. Although it seems this type of release won't be stopping any time soon, not every third-party title is necessarily taking this route.</p>
<p>According to a new listing, Digital Eclipse – which has made a name for itself <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/atari-50-game-list-every-playable-game-in-the-anniversary-celebration-expanded-edition">reviving various retro game libraries</a> – will be offering the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> on a full game cartridge. This information was shared via the Canadian-based physical game seller and website, Video Games Plus.</p>
<p>The social page makes a special note about how the Nintendo Switch 2 release is on the card. The website also lists a deluxe edition of this physical release for $114.99 CAD, which will apparently contain a "steelbook and other exclusive items" that haven't been revealed just yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Video Games Plus: "Preorders are now live on Day 1 &amp; Deluxe Editions of Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection Nintendo Switch, PS5, and NSW2 (Game on Cart)"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pre-orders for the standard edition (priced at $79.99 CAD) and deluxe edition of this Legacy Kollection are now live on the same website, but there's no mention on these particular pages about the product being a "game on cart" release, so you might want to hold off until there's a more official confirmation.</p>
<p>So far, only a handful of third-party Switch 2 titles have shipped with the entire game on the game card. One of these was CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, with the company even acknowledging the importance of physical media, and to not "underestimate the physical edition" of games.</p>

<p>To send off Nintendo's recent Partner Showcase, Square Enix announced some new projects, and one of them happened to be the brand new HD-2D title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>.</p>
<p>This is an action RPG where the combat will take place in real-time instead of the usual turn-based battles you might be used to in certain other titles. It's also developed by Team Asano (the developers behind series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/bravely_default">Bravely Default</a>).</p>
