<p>Now, ahead of the official release on <strong>25th July 2025</strong>, the Japanese team has rolled out a demo in select locations on Nintendo's new hybrid system. You can download it in places like Australia and Japan, and it's expected to be made available in other regions soon.</p>
<p>It will require around <strong>24 GB</strong> of free space on your system, with the full game listed on Nintendo's eShop as <strong>34.5 GB</strong> in size.</p>
<p>This new version of the game will allow you to team up with up to three other players as you fight nature-infused beasts while also developing your hunting grounds and customising your gameplay with multiple combat styles and weapons.</p>

Prime Day runs until July 11, unless they sell out before then, so make sure you grab the discounted components while you can.

The biggest discount is for the Ryzen 9 7900X 12-core 24-thread Unlocked CPU, which is down to $288 (was $550). This is a solid CPU that can work well for PC gaming, and since it's unlocked . However, if you're looking for something more powerful, the Ryzen 9 9950X is now available for $434 (down from $650), making it a great pick for anyone building an AMD-based gaming PC.

There's also a discount on an Asus-made RTX 5060 Ti with just 8GB GDDR7, which we'd only recommend to players sticking with 1080p resolution and max 60 fps frame rates, but is a bit cheaper at $400 (was $470).</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-3-125-slot-Military-Grade-Components-Protective/dp/B0DS6S98ZF?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 12GB GDDR7 OC Edition</a> -- $685 (<del>$740</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-DisplayPort-2-5-Slot-Axial-tech-Technology/dp/B0F7WB6LSH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB GDDR7 OC Edition</a> -- $430 (<del>$480</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-SFF-Ready-Graphics-2-5-Slot-Axial-tech/dp/B0F76KGH6B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GDDR7 OC Edition</a> -- $400 (<del>$470</del>)</li></ul><hr><h2 dir="ltr">Desktop PC Prime Day Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529383-pcs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529383" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529383-pcs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529383"></a><figcaption>Alienware Aurora ACT1250 Gaming PC</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529383-pcs.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you want to skip buying individual components, you can also grab one of several pre-made <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ij8sta" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC gaming desktops</a> that are discounted for Prime Day.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/now-you-can-finance-in-game-items-in-addition-to-burritos.1239897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/12/buy-now-pay-later-fall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predatory morass</a> of “buy now, pay later” schemes – which <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/doordash-klarna-payments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famously and meme-ably</a> made their way to the world of DoorDash food deliveries earlier this year – arises a slimy new option: financing in-game purchases. I’m sure nothing regrettable will come of this, considering how <a href="https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-regulated</a> and famously <a href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune to exploitation</a> in-game transactions tend to be.&nbsp;</p><p>The new system is the result of a partnership between Affirm, a prominent BNPL provider, and Xsolla, a company that makes payment software used by thousands of companies like Epic and Sega, as well as numerous free-to-play and mobile games. In <a href="https://investors.affirm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/xsolla-and-affirm-partner-help-game-developers-offer-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an announcement</a> published late last month, Affirm said that its services are now “automatically available to [Xsolla partners’] players – enabling them to split purchases into interest-free biweekly payments or longer-term monthly installments for carts starting at $50.” </p><p>While the companies did not specify which games this has been applied to, it is not hard to imagine a scenario where a player piles up a heap of cosmetics in a free-to-play MMO or a bunch of currency in a battle royale and then pays off the real-world cost in installments.</p><p>The two companies went on to bloviate about how they prioritize “empowering” developers and players “by putting transparency and personalization at the center of every transaction.”</p><p>This news flew under the radar a little bit, which is why I’m dredging it up now. BNPL advocates, which tend to be the companies benefitting from this new, tech-facilitated form of debt, will tell you that they’re offering a service preferable to traditional credit, as payment plans involve fixed terms, can be interest free, and don’t require high credit scores.&nbsp;</p><p>But anybody with a functioning brain will counter that you cannot separate these things from one another as though you’re an old-timey prospector panning for gold. America is a nation built on debt, with a 2024 New York Fed report finding that American household debt sat at <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2024/20240806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$17.8 trillion</a>. Companies large and small worm their way into the cracks of this busted foundation and, of course, extract profit.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/12/buy-now-pay-later-fall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>, research has shown that some BNPL users exhibited symptoms of greater financial distress.&nbsp;</p><p>“What you need to think about is the rest of the consumer’s portfolio. If they’re making BNPL payments … maybe they’re not paying off their credit card, maybe they’re not paying their cellphone bill, and that’s actually more concerning,” said Ed deHaan, a researcher who <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4230633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a paper on the matter in 2023</a>. “They’re essentially substituting one payment for another.”</p><p>Additionally, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – which was trying to <a href="https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subject games with robust in-game currency marketplaces to cursory regulation</a> before the Trump administration <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-doge-cfpb-elon-musk-456b747c367fccbcf3b74d2893cd1a35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gutted it earlier this year</a> – published <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-research-reveals-heavy-buy-now-pay-later-use-among-borrowers-with-high-credit-balances-and-multiple-pay-in-four-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> in January showing that more than 60 percent of BNPL users had simultaneous loans and held higher balances on other credit lines, and that most BNPL loans went to consumers with subprime or lower credit scores.</p><p>If you want more granular examples, social media is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkN6I3gZfGI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rife with them</a>.</p><p>In other words, these systems disproportionately target people who are either on a slippery slope or have already hit rock bottom. They are parasitic, yet another byproduct of rising costs, economic instability, and wealth disparity. In a functioning society, there would be no need for such a thing, which is why the ludicrous notion of financing burritos became such a pervasive meme. But here we are.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, I doubt an increasingly desperate video game industry will have any qualms with leaning on Affirm. Young people are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/young-american-consumer-spending-cut-f2b482e5?st=HJkcW3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spending less on games</a> this year compared to last, but US spending on video game subscriptions, specifically, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjvylgirs2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached an all-time high</a> in May 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>"Looks to me that the pressures of higher prices in everyday spending categories like food and general economic uncertainty has folks looking for value," Circana video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjvylgirs2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Bluesky</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/buy-now-pay-later-in-game-items-xsolla-affirm]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/anthem-server-shutdown-trying-for-the-first-time-bioware-ea</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-anthem%E2%80%99s-impending-server-shutdown-i%E2%80%99m-trying-it-for-the-first-time.1239894/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare’s multiplayer shooter <em>Anthem</em> was released in 2019 and simply didn’t meet the expectations of players or Electronic Arts. There have been some tweaks over the years, but EA stopped supporting the game in 2021. Last week, EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the servers will be shut down on January 12, which came as a surprise to the numerous people who had assumed they’d been shut down already. You can’t buy the game or purchase its premium currency anymore, but you can still play it, so I did.</p><p>I flew around the lush planet of Coda, landing by beacons emitting strange power. I weaved through waterfalls and dodged wyverns, sought out new creatures to observe (like a meerkat-esque beast with colorful plumage), and practiced my barrel roll. Though I haven’t encountered any other people playing <em>Anthem</em> — a problem for the online-only multiplayer game that encourages four players per server — I’m not the only one giving <em>Anthem</em> a shot years too late.&nbsp;</p><p>“I personally started playing like a week ago because I saw that it was free with Game Pass Ultimate on Xbox and decided to give it a try to see if the game is as barebones as people say it is,” one player told me. Another player told me they started recently because they were curious why a friend liked the game so much. All three of us are enjoying it — the flying, especially. “The traversal is single handedly the most fun I've had with a game,” one player said. “People call it the best Iron Man game for a reason.”</p><p><em>Anthem</em> hinges on its movement; people like me, who are early on, are still enjoying the novelty of it all. The game’s exosuits give it a sense of movement that’s rare to find in video games, one that’s forgiving but requires precision, simple yet dynamic. Flight is central to <em>Anthem</em>, but BioWare found ways to constantly keep the mechanic interesting, even when you’re not in combat — balancing traveling long distances with using the environment to keep your suit from overheating, therefore staying in flight longer.</p><p>“You couldn't fly indefinitely, your suit would overheat and you'd have to land ‘til it recovered," a player told me. “But if you flew through a waterfall, or through the spray of water at the top of a waterfall, it would completely cool your suit down, and if you flew right over a river or body of water it would also cool your suit down.”</p><p>The best part of the game, that player said, was playing in the free roam mode: “Every so often I'd see another player flying around too, they or I may follow the other and fight alongside them for a while.”</p><p>But <em>Anthem</em> couldn’t live on its movement and flight mechanics alone. The game didn't live up to the ambitious promise of its marketing and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/anthem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched to abysmal scores</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/anthem-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews</a>. A <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/anthem-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku report</a> published after <em>Anthem</em>'s launch told a story of mismanagement at BioWare: The game was in development for almost seven years, but "didn't enter production until the final 18 months, thanks to big narrative reboots, major design overhauls, and a leadership team said to be unable to provide a consistent vision and unwilling to listen to feedback." After the troubled launch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BioWare and EA vowed to reboot the game as <em>Anthem NEXT</em></a> as a way to fix the game's many problems. In February 2021, <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2021/02/24/anthem-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BioWare announced it was canceling <em>Anthem NEXT</em></a> and would instead simply keep the servers online as they already were. <em>Anthem</em>'s existed in that state since.</p><p>Despite all this, <em>Anthem</em> continues to support a small, dedicated community of players. For years now, players in private Facebook groups and Discord servers have been gathering to look for groups on all platforms. Sure, you can’t just jump into a game and queue up with three other people, but one veteran player I spoke to, Jon, said he can usually find at least one or more people in the game’s free roam modes.</p><p>But the announcement of the game’s closure is one last breath of life for the game before it’s killed off. “The game feels almost alive again, as if support is [bringing in back],” he said. “Almost like a hope of breathing life back into the game. The community has come back alive from what it was.”</p><p>I’ll keep playing <em>Anthem</em> until it leaves Game Pass on August 15, when it will be tossed into the ether with the rest of the games that have been shut down — games like <em>Dauntless, The Crew</em>, <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em>, and <em>XDefiant</em>. It’s a common practice for companies to stop supporting games with diminishing returns and low player counts, but one that’s especially painful for the small, dedicated fan bases of online-only games like <em>Anthem</em>. Once a server goes down, there’s nothing left to play.&nbsp;</p><p>Some players are organizing initiatives to stop publishers from taking down games that people have purchased, such as the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop Killing Games</a> movement, which is currently petitioning people in the UK to bring the issue to Parliament. <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The petition has hit a signature threshold</a> (more than 100,000 signatures), and organizers hope the government will discuss this as a consumer rights issue.</p><p>For now, it’s seemingly too late for <em>Anthem</em>. Any minor boost of the playerbase is just a bump in nostalgia for what the game was or could have been, or simply curiosity.</p><p>“With a shutdown like this around the corner, there's this air of ‘now or never,’ and it's definitely brought me back to the playthrough I'd started,” a player named Leo told me. “So I have to imagine the same might be the case for a few others.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/anthem-server-shutdown-trying-for-the-first-time-bioware-ea]]></content:encoded>

Solgaleo, the mascot of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon/" data-ref-id="5000-465376">Pokemon Sun</a>, is appearing in five-star raids until July 14, giving you a few days to add it to your collection.</p><p>While the legendary Pokemon has been available in the mobile game since 2022, this is the first time it's appearing as a raid boss. Previously, Solgaleo could only be obtained by evolving Cosmoem, so if you missed your chance to get a Cosmog, you now have the opportunity to catch one if you're able to defeat it in battle.</p><p>Like other legendaries, Solgaleo is a formidable opponent, so we've put together some tips to help you beat and catch the legendary Pokemon before it leaves raids next week.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Solgaleo_Raid_Schedule">Solgaleo Raid Schedule</a></li><li><a href="#Solgaleo_Weaknesses">Solgaleo Weaknesses</a></li><li><a href="#Best_Solgaleo_Counters">Best Solgaleo Counters</a><ul><li><a href="#Fire">Fire</a></li><li><a href="#Ground">Ground</a></li><li><a href="#Ghost">Ghost</a></li><li><a href="#Dark">Dark</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Types_To_Avoid">Types To Avoid</a></li><li><a href="#Can_Solgaleo_Be_Shiny_">Can Solgaleo Be Shiny?</a></li><li><a href="#How_To_Fuse_With_Necrozma">How To Fuse With Necrozma</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Solgaleo_Raid_Schedule">Solgaleo Raid Schedule</h2><p>Solgaleo is appearing as a five-star raid boss <strong>from July 8 to 14</strong>, giving you less than a week to catch one before the next raid boss, Terrakion, replaces it.</p><p>Solgaleo raids will occur periodically throughout this time, but your best chance to join one will happen during the Solgaleo Raid Hour on <strong>July 9</strong>. The legendary Pokemon will take over most nearby gyms <strong>from 6 to 7 PM local time</strong>, giving you more opportunities than usual to battle and catch it.</p><hr><h2 id="Solgaleo_Weaknesses">Solgaleo Weaknesses</h2><p>Despite its fiery appearance, Solgaleo is a psychic- and steel-type Pokemon, which makes it weak to only a handful of types.</p><p>Since psychic and steel don't share any vulnerabilities, no Pokemon type will deal quadruple damage to Solgaleo, but the following types will still dish out super-effective damage against the legendary Pokemon:</p><ul><li>Fire</li><li>Ground</li><li>Ghost</li><li>Dark</li></ul><hr><h2 id="Best_Solgaleo_Counters">Best Solgaleo Counters</h2><p>Any Pokemon that has a type advantage over Solgaleo will be helpful when battling the legendary, but here are some recommended choices to use during a Solgaleo raid:</p><h3 id="Fire">Fire</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Pokemon</th><th scope="col">Type</th><th scope="col">Recommended Fast Attack</th><th scope="col">Recommended Charged Attack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mega Charizard Y</td><td>Fire/Flying</td><td>Fire Spin</td><td>Blast Burn</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Charizard X</td><td>Fire/Dragon</td><td>Fire Spin</td><td>Blast Burn</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Blaziken</td><td>Fire/Fighting</td><td>Fire Spin</td><td>Blast Burn</td></tr><tr><td>Reshiram</td><td>Fire/Dragon</td><td>Fire Fang</td><td>Fusion Flare</td></tr><tr><td>Heatran</td><td>Fire/Steel</td><td>Fire Spin</td><td>Magma Storm</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Ground">Ground</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Pokemon</th><th scope="col">Type</th><th scope="col">Recommended Fast Attack</th><th scope="col">Recommended Charged Attack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Primal Groundon</td><td>Ground</td><td>Mud Shot</td><td>Precipice Blades</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Garchomp</td><td>Dragon/Ground</td><td>Mud Shot</td><td>Earth Power</td></tr><tr><td>Therian Forme Landorus</td><td>Ground/Flying</td><td>Mud Shot</td><td>Sandsear Storm</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Swampert</td><td>Ground/Water</td><td>Mud Shot</td><td>Earthquake</td></tr><tr><td>Excadrill</td><td>Ground/Steel</td><td>Mud-Slap</td><td>Scorching Sands</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Ghost">Ghost</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Pokemon</th><th scope="col">Type</th><th scope="col">Recommended Fast Attack</th><th scope="col">Recommended Charged Attack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mega Banette</td><td>Ghost</td><td>Shadow Claw</td><td>Shadow Ball</td></tr><tr><td>Lunala</td><td>Psychic/Ghost</td><td>Shadow Claw</td><td>Shadow Ball</td></tr><tr><td>Origin Forme Giratina</td><td>Dragon/Ghost</td><td>Shadow Claw</td><td>Shadow Force</td></tr><tr><td>Dragapult</td><td>Dragon/Ghost</td><td>Astonish</td><td>Shadow Ball</td></tr><tr><td>Blacephalon</td><td>Fire/Ghost</td><td>Astonish</td><td>Shadow Ball</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dark">Dark</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Pokemon</th><th scope="col">Type</th><th scope="col">Recommended Fast Attack</th><th scope="col">Recommended Charged Attack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mega Tyranitar</td><td>Rock/Dark</td><td>Bite</td><td>Brutal Swing</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Absol</td><td>Dark</td><td>Snarl</td><td>Brutal Swing</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Houndoom</td><td>Dark/Fire</td><td>Snarl</td><td>Foul Play</td></tr><tr><td>Hydreigon</td><td>Dragon/Dark</td><td>Bite</td><td>Brutal Swing</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Gyarados</td><td>Water/Dark</td><td>Bite</td><td>Crunch</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2 id="Types_To_Avoid">Types To Avoid</h2><p>Thanks to its typing combination, Solgaleo resists a number of popular Pokemon types. <strong>Dragon, fairy, rock, grass, ice, </strong>and<strong> normal</strong> attacks will all deal half-damage, making them ineffective when battling the legendary Pokemon. <strong>Poison and other psychic types</strong> will deal even less damage, so you'll want to avoid using those Pokemon entirely when participating in a Solgaleo raid.</p><hr><h2 id="Can_Solgaleo_Be_Shiny_">Can Solgaleo Be Shiny?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1578/15787979/4529039-3111285131-shiny.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529039" data-ratio="0.56574394463668" data-width="578" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1578/15787979/4529039-3111285131-shiny.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529039"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1578/15787979/4529039-3111285131-shiny.jpg"></figure><p>Unfortunately, shiny Solgaleo is not yet available in Pokemon Go, so you'll only encounter the standard white variant when you challenge one in raids. You can get a shiny Solgaleo in other Pokemon games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/" data-ref-id="5000-559213">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a> for Nintendo Switch, but you'll need to wait a little longer before you can add one to your collection in Pokemon Go.</p><hr><h2 id="How_To_Fuse_With_Necrozma">How To Fuse With Necrozma</h2><p>Solgaleo and its counterpart Lunala are unique among legendary Pokemon in that they're able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-fest-adds-new-forms-to-a-legendary-pokemon/1100-6523408/" data-ref-id="1100-6523408">fuse with Necrozma, another legendary</a>.</p><p>Once you've amassed enough Solar Fusion Energy, you can fuse Solgaleo with Necrozma to form Dusk Mane Necrozma. The fusion process costs 1,000 Fusion Energy, 30 Necrozma Candy, and 30 Cosmog Candy, and the two legendary Pokemon will remain fused until you manually separate them.</p><p>Dusk Mane Necrozma is a formidable Pokemon, maintaining Solgaleo's psychic/steel typing but gaining access to some powerful moves like Sunsteel Strike, a steel-type Charged Attack. This makes it a particularly good counter against fairy and ice Pokemon.</p><p>Solgaleo may leave raids on July 14, but there's still plenty to do in Pokemon Go over the next few weeks.

                <p>Earlier this month, the founders of Unknown Worlds--the studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/subnautica-review-a-water-wonderland/1900-6416847/" data-ref-id="1900-6416847">Subnautica</a> and its upcoming sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-officially-announced-with-four-player-co-op-coming-in-2025/1100-6527239/" data-ref-id="1100-6527239">Subnautica 2</a>--were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">reportedly forced out of the studio</a> by parent company Krafton. Now, it's being alleged that Krafton's decision to delay Subnautica 2 into 2026 could cost developer Unknown Worlds' team a $250 million bonus.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Unknown Worlds' ousted leaders--Subnautica director and designer Charlie Cleveland, Unknown Worlds co-founder Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill--were against delaying Subnautica 2. Cleveland recently shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his belief that Subnautica 2 is ready</a> for early-release now, which was the original plan for the game's rollout this year.</p><p>Krafton was reportedly going to be on the hook for the $250 million bonus if Unknown Worlds reached revenue goals before the end of this year. But without Subnautica 2's early access release, those numbers are likely to fall short of those targets.</p><p>The report indicates that Unknown Worlds' former leaders planned to share the bonus with all of the studio's employees. Steve Papoutsis--the new CEO of Unknown Worlds--was reportedly asked about the bonus at a town hall meeting. Papoutsis is said to have replied that he wasn't told anything about the bonus and wasn't aware if it had been a factor in the decision to push back the game.</p><p>Krafton hasn't set a specific release date for Subnautica 2.</p>

Players must master precision and timing to evade these attacks while simultaneously eliminating enemies.</p><p>After being chased by a bulldozer, the level culminates in an underground face-off with Rhyvashi, where Kumori and Kenji must skillfully plan attacks in between her onslaught of claw swipes, falling spikes, and electric orbs to continue to the next stage.</p><p>In addition to the combat, this new footage highlights the game’s robust upgrade and shop systems.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrakis is an unforgiving planet, characterized by its vast desert and rocky terrain. Its only redeeming quality is in its spice, but that’s secondary to your need to survive. You require water. Without a constant supply of hydration, the massive sandworms roaming the dunes will be the least of your worries. The game offers a few ways to acquire water, many of which require you to be bloodthirsty. Literally. I hope you’re ready to get your vampire on, because getting water in <em>Dune: Awakening</em> is a messy affair.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h28997"><a id="1"></a>Suck up the dew</h2><figure id="" data-id="cd9cdb10d3b15d21a255236aaa897f0a" data-recommend-id="image://cd9cdb10d3b15d21a255236aaa897f0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A full Dew Field in Dune: Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A full Dew Field in Dune: Awakening." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cd9cdb10d3b15d21a255236aaa897f0a" data-recommend-id="image://cd9cdb10d3b15d21a255236aaa897f0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A full Dew Field in Dune: Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sucking up excess dew from flowers is one of the earliest methods you’ll uncover to quench your thirst. These flowers, a pinkish-red in hue, are known as Dew Fields. Their sole purpose is to provide sustenance to survivors like you. You can’t harvest them otherwise.</p><p>The downside, however, is that Dew Fields only provide enough water to fill your thirst meter to the first gauge. After that, it’s up to you and your other devices and, um, well ideally you’ll need some blood.</p><h2 id="h28998"><a id="2"></a>Expand your blood-harvesting capabilities</h2><figure id="" data-id="4ebd121b5d91c8e4ba6a55e07a257839" data-recommend-id="image://4ebd121b5d91c8e4ba6a55e07a257839" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Blood Purifier machine in a base in Dune: Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Blood Purifier machine in a base in Dune: Awakening." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4ebd121b5d91c8e4ba6a55e07a257839" data-recommend-id="image://4ebd121b5d91c8e4ba6a55e07a257839" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Blood Purifier machine in a base in Dune: Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most effective ways to obtain water in <em>Dune: Awakening</em> is via blood. You won’t encounter bandit camps too frequently, but they’re common enough that you should have a steady supply. Venture out of your base long enough to cut down two or three bandits, or even a player or two if you’re feeling confident, and then harvest their blood using a Blood Extractor and Blood Sack.</p><p>With your sustenance in hand, return to your base—ideally one with power, as you’ll need it for the workbench—and dump the blood into a Blood Purifier. It will take some time for the machine to work its magic, drawing out life-saving water from your enemy’s blood. Alternatively, you can drink the blood straight from the Sack.</p><h2 id="h28999"><a id="3"></a>Craft a Stillsuit</h2><figure id="" data-id="390dc78d49b309161580d47538891c13" data-recommend-id="image://390dc78d49b309161580d47538891c13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The initial Stillsuit unlock in Dune: Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The initial Stillsuit unlock in Dune: Awakening." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="390dc78d49b309161580d47538891c13" data-recommend-id="image://390dc78d49b309161580d47538891c13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The initial Stillsuit unlock in Dune: Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once you have a steady supply of water, you need to retain your hydration when roaming the desert. That beating sun will suck up moisture quickly. As you run and sweat, a Stillsuit will revitalize your hydration meter slowly by repurposing the water you lose.</p><p>To craft a Stillsuit, you must first unlock the initial blueprint from the research table, then build a Fabricator. Once you have the workbench in place, along with the appropriate materials, you can craft:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Scavenger Stillsuit Body</li><li>Scavenger Stillsuit Boots</li><li>Scavenger Stillsuit Gloves</li><li>Scavenger Stillsuit Mask</li></ul><p>Altogether, the suit provides hydration that’ll keep you on your toes…until a sandworm consumes you and you lose it all! That didn’t happen to me, I’m not upset, I promise.</p><hr><p><em>Dune: Awakening </em>is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-water-thirst-dew-fields-blood-stillsuit-1851785918]]></content:encoded>
