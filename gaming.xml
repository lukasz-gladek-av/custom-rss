<p>Yes, if it wasn't obvious from the above image, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shin_megami_tensei_v_vengeance">Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</a> will be available to download for free for NSO members from <strong>16th to 22nd October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It's a flippin' massive game, so chances are you won't get particularly far in just a few short days, but it should prove to be a compelling little demo if you're on the fence.</p>

<p>It's quite funny that this happens to also coincide with the launch day for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, with X user <a href="https://x.com/BranPickle" tabindex="-1">@BranPickle</a> stating "Same day Z-A comes out is scandalous". Indeed! Which will you opt for?</p>
<p>If you need even more convincing, then consider checking out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance">our full review</a> for Vengeance when you have a moment.</p><div><figure data-videoid="QN9BAPpV7tw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QN9BAPpV7tw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QN9BAPpV7tw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QN9BAPpV7tw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed451c74tmporz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>We gave it a score of 9/10 and said that its "comprehensive approach to improving the story and various gameplay systems of the original release makes for an experience that’s even more engrossing than the already excellent original game".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>So much of the crap we own is beholden to a long cable and fat adapter to make it work. Our phones, our headphones, even our watches now all have a lithium battery that needs to be charged on the regular. When you need to plug in more than one device at a time, suddenly you space feels like a cobweb of cables running all directions, creating a tangled mess. Or worse, they don’t all fit. So now you’re on the hunt for multiple free wall outlets to get your AirPods up and running again just so you can relisten to the&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> soundtrack while you work. Thankfully, you can take control of your stress and clutter with a good charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">Baseus has a 10-in-1 desktop charge of which Amazon knocked 40% off the price</a>. The charger normally goes for $50, but the discount ends up saving you an even $20. That means you only have to pay $30 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multi-Device Charging</h2>
<p>This all-in-one charging block combines 10 different ports so you can charge up as many as 10 devices simultaneously. Between them all, you get six AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one standard USB-A port. With a wide spread of options, you shouldn’t have any issue charging your various devices without the need for a unique charging block. You can just plug your device directly into the unit. In the event you still end up needing to plug an adapter into the AC outlet, you shouldn’t have that common problem of the block taking up multiple slots on the power strip. On the Baseus charger, each outlet faces a different direction to allow for better flexibility.</p>



<p>Designed for desktops and nightstands, the Baseus charging station comes with an adhesive strip for the bottom of the unit. This was it can stand firmly in place to the side of your desk, out of the way, but always where you want it to be.</p>
<p>Whether you’re charging your phone, earbuds, a MacBook, or all three at once, you can expect them to charge up quickly. The Baseus power station is able to deliver a maximum output of 67W. As a point of reference, the USB-C adapter that comes with iPhones nowadays is only 20W. And with GaN6 technology, you can trust your devices will stay safe and cool while charing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">For a limited time, you can secure yourself this versatile 10-in-1 Baseus charging station for $20 off. Get it now for just $30.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>By playing Battlefield 6 online, you’re bound to level up. Completing matches and challenges will give you precious XP, allowing you to level up your profile. If you want to know how far you can go and how many levels there are to ascend, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-6-5-million-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has a lot of content, to say the least. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> will contribute to this, offering the community more ways to level up and earn rewards. Whether you play for the next few weeks, months, or years, chances are you’ll level up a lot.</p>



<p>So we’re checking out how many player levels there are to grind.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-highest-level-in-battlefield-6">What’s The Highest Level in Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bring the fire. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Technically, there isn’t a max level you can hit in Battlefield 6, as your player level can keep going.</strong></p>



<p>It’s believed that your Battlefield 6 player level can reach the high hundreds, maybe even the thousands. This means you can keep playing, keep leveling up, and flex on people with your incredible rank. Yes, remember to go out and touch some grass once in a while, but make sure you return to BF 6 as it’s always a fun journey starting at player level 1 and seeing how far you can progress.</p>



<p>As long as <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> keeps delivering the multiplayer goods—and offers a strong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale</a> component—there’s no reason not to dedicate many hours to BF 6 to see if you can reach the unreachable ceiling!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-level-do-you-stop-earning-battlefield-6-rewards">What Level Do You Stop Earning Battlefield 6 Rewards?</h2>



<p><strong>At the moment, you stop earning Battlefield 6 online rewards once you reach player level 100.</strong></p>



<p>Again, there seems to be no max level cap, but it should be a while until someone finds out anyway. However, once you hit rank 100, this definitely brings an end to your free rewards. At least for now, as EA might decide to increase the rewards cap, and either give you backdated rewards for levels you’ve already reached, or implement a new reward system.</p>



<p>Special events might also be another way to grind levels within the overall grind. Either way, there are plenty of goodies to attain.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-amp-fastest-ways-to-level-up-in-battlefield-6">Best &amp; Fastest Ways To Level Up in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p><strong>Playing in a party, seeking out special Portal maps, and being smart with XP Tokens are the best methods to level up fast in Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>We’re not going to get into the nitty-gritty of each point here, as we already have a useful, in-depth ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Farm XP &amp; Level Up Fast in Battlefield 6</a>‘ guide you should definitely read and bookmark.</p>



<p>But if you’re looking to level up fast, there are many ways you can embrace to make the process easier.</p>



<p>We hope this gave you the information you were looking for. May you level up in style and take pleasure in the misery of others as you defeat them for XP to level up! Let us know what level you are through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

The bustling metropolitan setting of Lumiose City will offer a significant change of pace from rolling hills and wilderness in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Your first partner Pokemon will be either Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig. The streamlined catching system from Arceus will return, so you won't have to battle every wild Pokemon you encounter before lobbing a Poke Ball at them.</p><p>Z-A will also be a major departure in another way: the battle system. The traditional turn-based combat from Arceus and the mainline series will be replaced by a strategic real-time system. You and your partner Pokemon can move during combat encounters--though you'll still be confined to a specific area. Positioning and timing will impact your success on the battlefield, both when attacking and defending incoming attacks by executing dodges.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="880909437" data-promo-id="0"

<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159532/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Before spinning us an enchanting and emotionally charged yarn, developer Little Sewing Machine opens with a simple dedication in lowercase: <em>for mom</em>. It’s a reminder that, despite the scope of the journey ahead, this is a deeply personal tale.</p>
<p>Little Sewing Machine lead Chris Darill is no stranger to artistic horror or cinematic flair. His <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Aremothered"><strong>Remothered</strong></a> games were standout examples of survival horror done right. Here, he introduces us to a disarming world of primary colours and art that feels straight out of Disney, before plunging us into a nightmare filled with tricky puzzles and shadowy monsters.</p>
<p>Lana Benton lives a bleak life of toil at Bunny Hall Orphanage. Her only solace was her friend Carole, who has gone missing under mysterious circumstances. Haunted by nightmares of a tall figure in a top hat, Lana sets out to find her friend. In doing so, she stumbles into the world of Corolla, where strange creatures roam and the sinister Mr. Kyn, the man from her dreams, relentlessly pursues her.</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159537/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In keeping with its art style, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bye_sweet_carole">Bye Sweet Carole</a> unfolds like a classic Disney tale. A downtrodden heroine, who can speak to birds and is frequently called “princess” by fantastical creatures, moves from a bleak earthly existence to a strange alternate realm in search of a loved one. Personal struggles are overcome, and emotional lessons are learned. There's even an omniscient narrator that chimes in occasionally to exposit and vocalise the hero's internal trauma.</p>
<p>The writing has welcome cultural complexity. Bunny Hall is an oppressive institution that reinforces distorted gender dynamics. These story elements are well illustrated and underscore the importance of the central relationship.</p>
<p>The mechanics of Lana's adventure are as traditional as its story. Essentially a side-scrolling puzzle adventure, it plays out like an old-school point-and-click, with some added QTEs and punishing trial-and-error encounters.</p>
<p>Early on, Lana gains the ability to transform into a rabbit, unlocking wall jumping and new traversal options. The alternate Bunny Hall also features grotesque versions of authority figures that our princess must run or hide from in tense, though often clunky, stealth sections.</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159533/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hiding in dark spaces, holding your breath, and trying not to get caught by a twisted rabbit creature evokes the gothic chills of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_complete_edition">Little Nightmares</a>. However, unlike the quick death that awaits in that Burtonesque classic, Bye Sweet Carole’s has a health bar that encourages multiple attempts at hide and seek. Character animations don’t always allow for a smooth escape once you’re discovered. Lana can switch between human and rabbit form to navigate obstacles, but these moments can still feel like frustrating exercises in trial and error.</p>
<p>There’s some light combat, where you take control of the mysterious protector Mr. Baesie. It fares a bit better than the stealth encounters but still feels somewhat fiddly. That said, an empowering final battle is thoroughly enjoyable, but I won’t spoil that here. The lavishly animated challenges are not as punishing as the visually similar <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dragons_lair_trilogy">Dragon’s Lair</a> (Don Bluth rather than Disney), yet there are times when Lana simply has to die before you can figure out the solution.</p>
<p>The rest of the time is spent travelling between screens, collecting various ephemera to clear obstacles or open doors. There’s some very light platforming and frequent chase encounters with Mr. Kyn and his minions.</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159536/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s worth pushing through the rough patches to continue Lana’s search for her friend. Using a familiar yet distinctive aesthetic to tell such a personal and occasionally bleak story is effective. The visuals are complemented further by a beautiful score from composer Luca Balboni, which makes even the simple act of retracing your steps through loading screens feel grandiose.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the art style doesn’t always mesh perfectly with movement and combat, but that doesn’t take away from its beauty on either a big or small screen. Aside from a fair bit of loading between areas, the game performs well on the Switch, with smooth, fluid animation, especially when Lana is darting around in rabbit form.</p>
<p>Undocked Switch 2 performance feels mostly the same as on Switch 1, though the visuals stand out far more on the newer console’s larger handheld display. Undocked play is a much more viable option on the Switch 2, but Bye Sweet Carole performs well across both platforms.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unfolding like a classic Disney tale, this is a beautifully animated adventure that weaves a deeply personal tale. Bye Sweet Carole is driven by its art style and a brilliant musical score, but occasionally stumbles due to stiff controls and frustrating mechanics.</p></section>

            <p>Ubisoft have opened up the pandora's box of mid-2000s shooters and deployed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</a>: Pandora Tomorrow onto Steam, rendering its PC version easy to grab for the first time in ages. It's not a remaster, so don't get too excited, as you might still have fun getting things to run as smoothly as your covert ops.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This is a re-release of the original game, not a remastered version," Ubisoft bark in Pandora Tomorrow's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3929740/Tom_Clancys_Splinter_Cell_Pandora_Tomorrow/">Steam listing</a>. "Aside from fixing critical issues, the game remains unchanged.  Please note that multiplayer mode will not be available."</p>
<p>Cue a bunch of Clancyheads going 'oh, brill', then firing the thing up and realising that it forces you to go through the fun Ubisoft's Connect launcher. As with most third-party launchers (I'm looking at you, EA), it's an extra faff that's ultimately unnecessary to play a game conceived when even Connect's previous guise Uplay was only a punny glimmer in some exec's eye.</p>
<p>That said, if can stomach that headache and are cool relying on mods to provide the likes of controller support and sand off some of the remaining rough running edges, it's a chance to slap back on some retro tactical goggles. It's also on sale as of writing, setting you back only £5.39 / $5.99 / €5.99 until October 28th. There's also a substantial discount on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> legacy collection <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/23545/Splinter_Cell_Legacy_Collection/">bundle</a>, which currently offers six splintered cells for £15.73 / $18.84 / €18.84.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you're wondering how Pandora Tomorrow runs on Steam Deck, <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow-playable-steam-deck/">SteamDeckHQ</a> report that the answer is just about.</p>
<p>We're still waiting for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-the-splinter-cell-remake-might-be-about-to-reappear-after-years-in-the-dark">Splinter Cell Remake Ubisoft have in the works</a> to arrive, but in the meantime - and likely the reason for this re-release - an animated Splinter Cell Netflix series dubbed Deathwatch has just arrived. Here's a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-splinter-cell-deathwatch-review">review from big Iggun</a> if you want an idea of whether it's worth making time for some Sam Fisher and chill.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now in the no man’s zone between October’s Prime Day sales and November’s Black Friday sales. You might expect it to be hard to find a good deal across the online retail giant’s website during this time, but you’d be wrong. You can still find great opportunities to save on electronics if you know where to look. For instance, take a gander at this Anker power station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">The Anker SOLIX C1000 second-generation portable power station has dropped by nearly 50%</a>. Amazon has the unit listed normally for $799, but after the $370 discount, you can get it for just $429 for a limited time.</p>
<p>The Anker SOLIX C1000 power station has an output of 2,000W (peak of 3,000W). That should be plenty enough power for basically all the appliances you might have with you in your RV on a camping trip or in your truck in the parking lot of your next tailgate. It also serves well in an emergency at home like during a blackout. You can ensure everyone in the house has a fully charged phone and you can run necessary appliances, like your TV and Nintendo Switch 2. How else we going to pass by the time other than some Knockout Tour?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With its 10 different ports, you can charge up to 10 devices at once. You have five 2,000W AC ports along with two USB-C 140W ports, one, 15W USB-C port, on USB-A 12W, and one 120W car port.</p>
<p>Fit the power station easily into the trunk of your car. It only measures 15.1 inches by 8.2 inches by 9.6 inches and weighs 24.9 lbs. That’s 14% smaller and 11% lighter than the first-generation Anker SOLIX C1000. It can operate quietly too, running at between zero and 20dbs when discharging under 200W.</p>



<h2>Solar Power Generation</h2>
<p>The power station holds enough charge in its 1,024Wh capacity to fully charge an iPhone 67.7 times over before the Anker SOLIX C1000 runs out of charge itself. When that does happen, you can bring the power station back up to 100% capacity in just 49 minutes when you have it set to UltraFast recharging via the Anker app. You can choose to add on a solar panel and recharge the Anker SOLIX C1000 via solar, which only takes 1.8 hours. Great for extended weekended in the outdoors.</p>
<p>If you choose to add on the 100W solar panel, the full bundle will cost you $679. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">For just the Anker SOLIX C1000, you can get it for just $429 for a limited time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s principal game designer has stated that a fix for bullets not registering is on the way. </p>



<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 have done a spectacular job with the game, and the sales reflect that: the game has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-6-5-million-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 6.5 million copies</a> within a few days. However, there is still some work to do, as several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-glitches-exploits-ea-working-overtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bugs and glitches</a> continue to plague BF6. Fortunately, the next patch will address the ghost bullets issue in Battlefield 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-hits-not-registering-will-be-fixed-in-next-patch">Battlefield 6 Hits Not Registering Will be Fixed in Next Patch</h2>



<p>A new post by Battlefield 6’s principal game designer, Florian Le Bihan, on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978405809814987229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) discusses ‘rolling out a fix’ for bullets not registering. The developers have observed an issue “where bullets hit an enemy and where blood splatters are visible but don’t cause damage.” Le Bihan explained that this issue was caused “intermittently with certain weapons and attachments combinations and should now be resolved.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We are rolling out a fix to address the issue seen where bullets hit an enemy and where blood splatters are visible but don't cause damage.</p><p>The issue happened intermittently with certain weapons and attachments combinations and should now be resolved. <a href="https://t.co/rf4L04PpLR">https://t.co/rf4L04PpLR</a></p></div>— Florian – DRUNKKZ3 (@DRUNKKZ3) <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978405809814987229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a reply to the thread, Le Bihan clarified that some hit registration issues can be caused by poor internet or game server performance; however, players will be informed of this through performance icons at the top left. The principal game designer also confirmed that this Battlefield 6 fix will not address bloom, as that’s “a different issue”. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s campaign tells you to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-campaign-tells-you-to-uninstall-when-youre-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uninstall once you have completed it</a>. Additionally, the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beat Call of Duty’s all-time concurrent player count</a> on Steam with nearly 750k players.

<p>He was a big deal at the studio, and now after 36 years, he's left for pastures new.</p>
<p>Yes, after Microsoft unceremoniously cancelled <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/everwild">Everwild</a>, Mayles decided it was perhaps time to move on, and has now posted a farewell message on social media with his very own poem (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/thanks-to-everyone-who-played-donkey-kong-country-and-banjo-kazooie-designer-gregg-mayles-leaves-rare-after-36-years">Time Extension</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Alongside the aforementioned titles, Mayles also directed the wildly popular <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/sea_of_thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> which, after its initial launch in 2018, found an additional home on the PS5 in April 2024. Many thought that perhaps Microsoft was also planning a launch on Switch, but alas, this has yet to come to fruition.</p>
<p>In addition to the cancellation of Everwild, Microsoft also pulled the plug on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/perfect_dark">Perfect Dark</a>, a planned reboot of the N64 classic from Rare. In development by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics, the former was also shuttered as part of the cancellation. Boo.</p>

            <p>It is time to once again desecrate the much-pillaged tomb of Looking Glass Studios and have it away with the materials for a new dark fantasy immersive sim. Starhelm Studios have announced Project Shadowglass, a purebred first-person Thief-like with a light-shadow system, lockpicking, pickpocketing, noisy or quieter walkable surfaces, magical traps, heist planning and jailbreaks.</p>
<p>Lead developer Dominick John is one of the two people behind Youtube music parody outfit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/spacebards">Space Bards</a>, but it doesn't sound like you'll be singing much in Project Shadowglass. Not unless you really enjoy getting caught. Or are great at ventriloquy. Has an imsim allowed you to distract people using ventriloquy yet? Maybe next time.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Project Shadowglass is making waves partly because the announcement teaser below is a dunk on generative AI. Long story short: a month or two ago, some clever custard posted a generated gif of a rustic fantasy game mock-up, with a torch-wielding player trotting down a valley towards a gigantic castle. The image earned viral acclaim from the AIdvocates and scornful quote-tweets from the detrAIctors. Speaking as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">very long-winded</a> detrAIctor, my only takeaway from the generated mock-up is that more games should have cloud-piercing, Maleficent-worthy citadels in them, while doing elementary things with perspective.

<p>The Project Shadowglass teaser references the mock-up in the opening seconds, and alludes to it on the official site. It's weirdly clap-back for a project whose "360 degree pixelart" tech has apparently been on the boil for years. "Everything you see is 100% real and running realtime in-engine," <a href="https://shadowglassgame.com/">reads the blurb</a>. "It may look similar to those pretty pixel art AI videos, but this is the playable real deal. No content or art featured in Project Shadowglass will be AI generated."</p><p>If I were being a stinkpot, I'd object that Project Shadowglass's wistfully corrugated graphic are channelling the same mouldy nostalgia that enables much genAI culture. GenAI is inherently reactionary and regurgitative, after all, and many emerging genAI creators have found an audience by targeting well-known aesthetics. Project Shadowglass just isn't consuming as much electricity to do it, pixel for pixel, or filching anybody's art in the process - Starhelm have <a href="https://shadowglassgame.com/#credits">credited</a> the makers of all the open source creative commons assets used in the teaser.
</p><p>
As you'd expect from the pixelart direction, this appears to be a no-frills love letter to the genre, blending ideas from Thief, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> and Shock. Your tactics and techniques includes dousing torches, hiding bodies and memorising patrol routes. There's a persistent city environment in which you can build a reputation as a murderer, causing the regular civvies to flee from you on sight. You'll get to research and plan heists, perhaps acquiring new gear, crafting recipes or components before committing to the robbery.
</p><p>It seems progression-light. "You are no hero with powers," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3970690/Project_Shadowglass/">the Steam page</a>. "Instead, you must rely solely on improving your own planning and skill." Needless to say, hand-to-hand combat is discouraged, as is falling off high objects.

</p><p>Some story blurb to finish: "In a lush, dark, and oppressive seaside kingdom, the richest nobles have fallen in line with a new king promising them more. The poor grow poorer, the rich grow richer. The claustrophobic city has been building more walls to keep them out from where they don't belong. Higher towers to not hear them, smell them, but always keep an eye on them. But they didn't account for you."
</p>
<p>I'd tell you when you can play it, but sadly, some cat burglar has snuck in and absconded with the ciphered note containing the release date. They have left the derisive calling card "to be announced".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-17-3%E2%80%B3-laptop-bundle-64gb-ram-2tb-ssd-takes-over-3-000-price-dive-as-amazon-clears-out-5-star-stock.1325113/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We aren’t quite sure who to thank for this latest HP laptop deal at Amazon, but it’s kind of crazy how generous this one is. So, big shout-out to whomever is responsible for taking this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop, loading it with 64GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2TB SSD, and then installing the 12-core Intel Ultra 7 255U processor, and deciding it should be over $3,000 less than the list price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4781/">Granted, that original $4,400 list price was more than a little bit silly, but even so, the final price of $1,140 for a state-of-the-art touchscreen Windows laptop</a> that arrives as loaded as this one does is more than a little bit crazy too. There’s also a free accessories bundle which includes Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a 7-in-1 USB hub, 128GB thumb drive, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4781/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Down to Business</h2>
<p>The Intel Ultra 7 255U processor would be a stone cold beast under any circumstance thanks to its max speed of 5.2GHz, but then when you add in the 12 TOPS of AI acceleration to drive the Microsoft Copilot AI assistant that’s preinstalled, that’s when the magic happens. Copilot’s bona fides as a top-notch AI assistant are well established, but the AI enhancements don’t end there — useful features like background blur and intelligent noise reduction for video calls and conferencing are also powered by AI.</p>
<p>The rest of the package under the hood of this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop is all about going big, especially the 64GB of DDR5 RAM that is basically a license to open as many tabs and apps as you want without fear of slowdown. That kind of workout also requires a fat storage capacity to hold all of your projects and other files, and this HP has a 2TB SSD ready and waiting.</p>



<h2>Roomy Everywhere You Look</h2>
<p>You can truly appreciate the 2TB of storage and the 64GB of RAM, but the other giant feature on this HP Business Laptop us the one you can actually see and touch — the beautiful 17.3-inch touchscreen display. Not only is there more than enough room for truly immersive streaming or as many windows as you want to open for multitasking, they’re all touch-controlled so this HP laptop can work like the world’s most powerful tablet.</p>
<p>Everything about this 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop is big, except its 0.81-inch thickness that makes it an easy backpack carry. The biggest feature of all is the price, or more accurately, the discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4781/">Amazon’s limited-time 74% off deal on this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop and its accessory bundle brings that price down to $1,140</a> — exceptionally good for a laptop this stacked.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> sales are in-line with Ghost of Tsushima’s in Europe, new data shows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-delivers-strong-opening" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, Ghost of Yotei debuted at No.2 in the GSD European charts behind EA’s FC 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has yet to announce a sales figure for Ghost of Yotei, which launched exclusively on PlayStation 5 on October 2, 2025. But we now know that in Europe it’s doing about as well as its predecessor, which launched in 2020 exclusively on PlayStation 4. That is, for its first few days on sale, as the GSD European chart runs to October 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of things worth noting here. Not only did Ghost of Tsushima launch on a console with a bigger install base at that point than PS5 has now, it launched during the pandemic, which saw record video game sales and player numbers as people were forced to stay at home during lockdowns.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Business noted that Ghost of Yotei is the biggest first-party PlayStation launch since Spider-Man 2 in October 2023. Helldivers 2, which launched February 2024, remains the fastest selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, with an incredible 12 million sold in 12 weeks. The question is whether Ghost of Yotei will end up meeting Sony's sales expectations over time; Ghost of Tsushima ended up a hugely successful release, with over 13 million sold as of September 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it shines a light on just how few new games Sony’s first-party studios have released over the last few years. Since Insomniac’s Spider-Man 2 came out in October 2023, we’ve had the aforementioned Helldivers 2, the disastrous Concord, Team Asobi’s wonderful Astro Bot, Lego Horizon Adventures, MLB The Show 25, and a bunch of remasters. Naughty Dog has seemingly skipped the PS5 generation entirely in terms of brand new games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First-party Sony games we know to be in the works include Bungie’s Marathon, Housemarque’s Saros, Insomniac’s Marvel’s Wolverine, Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Haven’s Fairgames, and a multiplayer Horizon game from Guerrilla. A whole bunch of Sony first-party games were canceled as the company's live-service push faltered, including a multiplayer The Last of Us game, a live-service God of War game, and another live-service title from Bend Studio. Bend's last brand new game was 2019’s Days Gone on PlayStation 4, which launched on PC in 2021.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But how has Ghost of Yotei done in the U.S.? According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m33ifb42gk2w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mat Piscatella</a>, senior director at Circana, Ghost of Yotei ranked 12th on its Top 15 Titles by Total Weekly Active Users chart for the week ending October 4, with 4.4% of active PlayStation players giving it a go. Coincidentally, Ghost of Tsushima also ranked 12th in its launch week back in 2020 with 4.4% of active PlayStation players engaging. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it sounds like Ghost of Yotei has done about as well as Ghost of Tsushima did, at least at launch. It will be interesting to see if Sony says anything about its performance in upcoming financial reports, and how sales hold up in the coming weeks as we head into the crucial holiday season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what’s next from developer Sucker Punch, in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>, co-founder and studio head, Brian Fleming, said the studio will decide its next project once the multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out in 2026. But, he suggested, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-we-were-good-at-juggling-four-projects-yeah-wed-have-a-remaster-ghost-of-yotei-dev-sucker-punch-says-it-will-remain-a-single-project-studio">don’t expect a flurry of games from the relatively lean developer — it’s one project at a time</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review">Ghost of Yotei review</a>.

The entire track can be heard in the mission Dear Uncle Tacitus, in an impactful segment when you're riding a horse back to camp. It boasts over 55 million streams on Spotify alone.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/gettyimages-528806919-1760521801919.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Photo by Frans Schellekens/Redferns.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">D'Angelo was a huge fan of video games and would visit Rockstar during Red Dead Redemption 2's development after reportedly reaching out to Ivan Pavlovich, director of music and audio at the studio, through an intermediary, to "just play the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We weren’t even talking about doing music,” Pavlovich told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/dangelo-red-dead-redemption-2-767748/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>RollingStone</u></a> in 2018. "When D’Angelo comes through, he shows up at midnight, and he’s playing the game until four in the morning. Each time he was just like, ‘It’s incredible.’ It just blows his mind. He’s such a fan. I have never seen someone that excited. D’Angelo’s actually a massive, massive, massive fan of the game — more than I ever knew." It was because of this that Pavlovich asked if D'Angelo would be interested in contributing to the soundtrack, which is partly why there are some vocal tracks on an otherwise chiefly instrumental score. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dozens of artists have paid tribute to the musician, including Flavor Fave, Beyoncé, Nile Rodgers, Lauren Hill, and Doja Cat, but so have hundreds of gamers, some of whom were introduced to D'Angelo's music through Red Dead Redemption 2.

                <p>This week, Activision is launching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> Season 19: Haunted Masquerade, the latest Halloween-themed event for the franchise. This year, Haunted Masquerade is introducing magical masks of their allied heroes that give the characters special buffs and powers. For example, Tracer can wear a Winston mask, and he can wear her mask. The launch trailer below shows off some of those new mask abilities in action.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIhY9M5dWB4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hIhY9M5dWB4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to the Haunted Masquerade arcade mode, the new season is bringing back Halloween Terror 2025, which will allow four players to team up in co-op to defend Adlersbrunn from Dr. Junkenstein and his monster minions. Your chosen heroes will have to face hordes of foes and "powerful bosses" to maintain control of the castle.</p><p>Additionally, Junkenstein's Revenge lets players control Sojourn, Junker Queen, Kiriko, and Ashe as they crush barricades and battle "exploding zombie omnics," as well as Banshee Moira and Gargoyle Winston, before uncovering Adlersbrunn's castle. The new season is also bringing back Wrath of the Bride as a co-op fight and adding new Mythic cosmetics and other in-game collectibles.</p><p>Stadium is adding three new heroes: Hazard, Sojourn, and Torbjörn. It's also getting a new map, Busan (Control), and other item upgrades.

            <p>Misbehaving bullets, your hour of reckoning is nigh. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> hotfix has been deployed with the goal of stopping you from refusing to register hit damage when you embed yourselves in virtual flesh. Bouncy ladders, your time will likely come soon, as EA's Battlefield Studios are busy trying to work out the arcane secrets of your rubbery rungs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We're aware of reports of rare cases where bullets may not register damage correctly when hitting enemies," the developers have <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978400189476896968">just posted</a>, "Following our investigation, we found this was related to certain weapon attachment combinations. A hotfix has been deployed to address known instances."</p>
<p>For those who haven't run into this issue, there've been a bunch of clips shared by players since the weekend in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-best-weapons-guns">guns</a> have been infected with a bit too much bad guy aim-itis. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> has mechanics in place to ensure you do have to work to get shots on target and do damage, but firing directly at someone and having them brush it off like it's nothing obviously isn't ideal.</p> 
<p>Here's hoping this fix, which follows DICE principal game designer Florian Le Bihan <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1977698663427133659">tweeting on Monday</a> that an investigation had commenced, can persuade these tiny hunks of metal to return to work. Unless the devs are hiding the fact they've become sentient and are objecting to the purpose they've been ascribed, in which case I say free the ammo. Independence for peace-loving projectiles, damn the consequences!</p><p>The same applies to the <a href="https://x.com/mokeysniper/status/1977115683839152535">bouncy ladders</a> players have been using to vault themselves around, which Battlefield Studios are <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977705926476918979">also looking into</a>. If a ladder wishes to experience the joy we have to assume trampolines get from springly sending soldiers skyward, who are we to deny that? Sod the laws of physics and warzone realism. </p>
<p>I look forward to being sniped by someone who's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-backend-tweaks-tune-down-some-sniper-rifles-and-shotguns-as-ea-keep-fiddling-with-little-knobs">had to lead their shot just a little bit more</a> than was required a few days ago for expressing these controversial positions.</p>

            <p>Have you been struggling to hit other players in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, especially when shooting for extended periods of time? Well, it turns out it may not be a skill issue, as a bug related to bullet dispersion is causing shots to go wide.</p>
<p>It's meant to work is like this. When you shoot an automatic weapon in Battlefield 6 for an extended period of time, the bullets will start to shift away from where your aiming reticle is pointed. This is due to a combination of recoil and random, intended deviations, and is there to prevent people being able to maintain near-perfect accuracy while unloading an entire magazine. It also promotes firing in bursts, which is more realistic and Battlefield-y.</p>
<p>The problem is, even when you do fire in bursts, stopping to allow this weapon bloom to reset, right now that doesn't always happen. As shown in the clip below, the bullet spread you had at the end of your previous burst can remain even after you stop and start firing again, leading to greater inaccuracy. In laymen's terms, your guns may not be as accurate as they should be during persistent firefights.</p>

<p>This was a problem during the Battlefield 6 beta too, and some have speculated this is the same problem from that early version of the game alive and well during Battlefield 6's full launch. However, it turns out this problem is thanks to entirely new bugs.</p>

<p>Principle game designer on Battlefield 6 Florian Le Bihan stated on X: "The Beta bug was actually fixed but we've identified another issue (two in fact) that impacts dispersion/bloom in an unintended way and will cause you to have more dispersion at times," Bihan stated on X. "The team is working on this and we're looking at general balance/tuning of dispersion too."</p><p>Such small problems do have a wider impact on the gameplay experience, especially for more competitive players. However it's worth noting that the Battlefield 6 team has proven especially keen to fix bugs and other issues. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-ladder-launching-one-of-the-games-funnest-bugs-will-soon-be-gone">It was only recently they announced that Ladder Launching will soon be gone</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-issues-fix-for-jump-momentum-bug-and-is-monitoring-breakthrough-player-counts">various movement techniques that proved unpalatable for the intended Battlefield experience were removed too</a>.</p>
<p>These come as Battlefield 6 remains a powerhouse in terms of player numbers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">quickly becoming one of the biggest Steam launches of all time</a> with nearly 750,000 concurrent players on its launch day last weekend.</p>

            <p>Ladder launching will soon be removed in an upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> patch, according to lead producer David Sirland.</p>
<p>The act of ladder launching allows players to essentially bounce off Assault Ladders to get a sudden boost of speed up into the air, allowing for unintentional mobility options and alternative angles of attack. It is absolutely a bug and needs to be removed, but on the other hand, it is really fun to do! So you should probably give it a go while you can.</p>
<p>Sirland, asking for general feedback on X following the initial launch of Battlefield 6, outright confirmed this bug in particular will be removed in an upcoming patch. He wrote: "Please keep the feedback coming! With the first weekend for BF6 in the wild, we are bound to have found issues, problems, stuff you like to see change - perhaps even praise? It's still all good, I want to know. And the team is eager to show you how much we care!"</p>

<p>Other suggestions Sirland publicly acknowledged include names for objective points, as well as problems with helicopter spawns. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-issues-fix-for-jump-momentum-bug-and-is-monitoring-breakthrough-player-counts">Quick hotfixes have already been pushed out to fix movement bugs</a>, so it looks as though Battlefield 6 will certainly continue to get improvements in the coming weeks, as the game marches towards its major season one update on the 28th October.</p><p>Assault Ladders it seems are a source of a few headaches, at least as far as bugs are concerned.

<p>Pre-orders open on <strong>17th October 2025 and close on 16th November 2025</strong>, and you can choose between three available SKUs: Standard, Steelbook, and Collector's Edition.</p>
<p>The latter, priced at <strong>$134.99</strong>, has a boatload of tat included that we suspect only the most passionate of fans will be interested in. This includes:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wvpoui&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Yeah, you read that right, action figures! Now little Timmy can recreate the infamous beheading scene while you play. Or maybe not... You'd need a Frau Engel figure, at least.</p>

<p>Still, it all looks pretty cool, but we're particularly enamoured with the steelbook – it looks really nice! If you feel similar, then its <strong>$69.99</strong> price tag might sound more tempting. Alternatively, if you're fussed about any extras and just want the physical game, this will set you back <strong>$49.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Wolfenstein II originally released on the Switch back in 2018 and wound up being one of the stronger ports for the console. We highlighted its "brilliantly-written story and intense action" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/wolfenstein_ii_the_new_colossus">8/10 review</a>, so we think it's well worth checking out.</p>

<p>There are 17 teams competing at the League of Legends World Championship in 2025. The first team to be eliminated on October 14 was Invictus Gaming, whittling the teams in the Swiss Stage down to 16.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of teams competing at the League of Legends World Championship in 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gen.G</li>



<li>Hanwha Life</li>



<li>KT Rolster</li>



<li>Bilibili Gaming</li>



<li>Anyone’s Legend</li>



<li>Top Esports</li>



<li>FlyQuest</li>



<li>Keyd Stars</li>



<li>100 Thieves</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>KOI</li>



<li>Fnatic</li>



<li>CTBC Flying Oyster</li>



<li>Secret Whales</li>



<li>PSG Talon</li>



<li>T1</li>



<li>Invictus Gaming (<strong>eliminated</strong>)</li>
</ul>







<p>Everyone comes into the League of Legends World Championship with keen eyes on T1 Gaming, the defending champions and the home of Faker, arguably the GOAT of the esports world. Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-2024-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faker made history</a> while flying his traditional T1 banner, and the team has every opportunity to win <strong>yet another </strong>LoL Worlds this time around.</p>



<p>Behind T1 sits Gen.G, the top seed coming out of Korea and heading into LoL Worlds after a <strong>dominant </strong>run through the summer and regional qualifiers. Faker’s nemesis in Chovy is ready to bring it all to the table in China.</p>



<p>For the European League of Legends fans, the pick remains G2 Esports, Europe’s best hope for a League of Legends World Championship trophy.</p>

		<p>PUBG remains one of the best online multiplayer shooter experiences going. I’m not sure what that says about more modern releases, but still, if you’re looking for the truest battle royale experience out there, you want to play PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds. Part of that ongoing popularity comes from the teams’ constant stream of updates and patches over the year, and update 38.1 has just dropped today for PC, with consoles not that far behind, with the update due to follow on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on October 23rd.</p>
<p><iframe title="Patch Report #38.1 | SMG Nerfs, Destructible Terrain on Miramar, and Halloween Collab Mode" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2iaopdqRSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The October update introduces a limited-time Halloween collaboration mode featuring the globally popular YouTube animation IP <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaFuqBoom">Skibidi Toilet</a>, a new Contender character, and a series of gunplay and gameplay improvements, including updates to SMGs, vehicles, and map mechanics. You can find the full patch notes below!</p>



<h2 id="patch-notes3" data-renderer-start-pos="23474">Gameplay</h2>
<h3 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="23484">Vehicles &amp; Special Vehicle Skins</h3>
<p><span id="isPasted">Update 38.1 brings broad adjustments to vehicles and Special Vehicle skins.</span></p>


<ul id="isPasted" data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="23600">A similar level of window tint has been applied to the front and rear windows of base vehicles, matching those of Special Vehicle skins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="23740">The driving experience has been improved for the following vehicles and Special Vehicle skins:</p>
<ul data-indent-level="2">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="23838">Dacia, Mirado, Coupe RB, “The Good Ol’ Days (Black)” Sedan, “The Good Ol’ Days (White)” Sedan</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="23937">Special Vehicle Skins</h4>
<p id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="23960">When equipping Special Vehicle skins:</p>
<ul data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="24001">All vehicle windows can now be penetrated by bullets, regardless of skin type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="24083">All vehicles now share the same wide, consistent penetrable area at the rear, regardless of design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">&lt;Dev’s comment&gt;</em></p>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Across the vast Battlegrounds, vehicles serve as more than just a means of transportation—they are vital strategic elements that can shape the outcome of survival and combat. The PUBG development team has always valued the unique experiences and tactical depth that vehicles bring to the game. As Special Vehicle skins also serve to expand the joy of PUBG, we’ve collaborated with premium car brands to deliver realistic, immersive experiences that capture the essence of driving within the Battlegrounds.</em></p>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Throughout the development of Special Vehicle skins, we have always prioritized maintaining identical driving performance to their base vehicles. We’ve also worked to maintain balance in vehicle hit areas by allowing penetration based on material type, ensuring that combat remains as fair as possible. However, as more Special Vehicle skins have been introduced over time, we began to notice that the differences in size and shape were creating slight advantages or disadvantages in actual engagements, an unintended outcome that diverged from our original goal of offering purely visual variety. As players’ skills and understanding of vehicles have grown, these disparities have become more pronounced, revealing a growing imbalance that could no longer be overlooked. We recognized that adhering solely to our original policy of equal performance was no longer enough to address this issue. Since these discrepancies could directly impact survival and fairness, we saw this as a crucial matter that required fundamental action. Therefore, rather than making adjustments to specific skins, we decided to take a comprehensive look at the entire vehicle system—including previously released vehicles—and make improvements.</em></p>
<p id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="27702"><em data-renderer-mark="true">In this update, we’ve implemented improvements in two key areas. First, we refined the overall driving experience of base vehicles and adjusted window transparency to make seated players less visible from the outside, narrowing the gameplay gap between base vehicles and Special Vehicle skins. At the same time, we’ve adjusted the hit areas of Special Vehicle skins to closely match those of the base vehicles, ensuring a fair and consistent experience regardless of which vehicle or skin players choose. These standards will continue to apply to all future Special Vehicle skins.&nbsp;<span data-renderer-mark="true" data-text-custom-color="#00b8d9">However, the Bugatti Special Vehicle skins were not included in this update, as no adjustments were required in relation to the changes made in this patch. (The balance of all Special Vehicle skins is subject to change depending on development progress.)</span></em></p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="28539"><em data-renderer-mark="true">We understand that these changes may alter some aspects of the familiar experience, but we believe they are a necessary step toward maintaining a fair competitive environment. We will continue to listen closely to player feedback and remain committed to creating a more balanced and enjoyable Battleground for everyone. As always, we appreciate your feedback and thank you for your continued support.</em></p>
<h3 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="26919">Recall System</h3>


<ul id="isPasted" data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="26942">The registration time at the Blue Chip Tower now scales with the number of Blue Chips.</p>

<ul id="isPasted" data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27317">The countdown message for the Recall flight has been removed from the spectator view, and the remaining time is now displayed at the top of the Minimap and the bottom right of the World Map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27511">Recall-related system messages now follow the same format as regular system messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27600">Some recall-related UI messages have been updated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Dev’s comment: Since the Recall system was introduced to Ranked and Esports, it has given eliminated players a second chance and had a significant impact on the overall flow of gameplay. To ease the fatigue that can come from repeated recalls, we’re making a few adjustments in this update. With these changes, recalling multiple teammates at once now carries greater risk. Players can also view other teams’ recall information, which creates new opportunities for strategic play. In addition, recalls are now limited in the late game so that the feature mainly serves as a recovery option for players eliminated early. We’ll continue working to give players more intense and strategic choices in every stage of the match.</em></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="28461"><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Dev’s comment: With Update 38.1, we’re applying a series of adjustments to SMGs and the Panzerfaust. SMGs have been on a steady rise, and while we want to preserve their core strengths—low recoil and close-range dominance—we felt their stability when firing from the hip, without aiming over the shoulder or using scopes, was a bit too strong. To address this, we’ve made changes to improve balance in those situations. We’ve also reduced the damage of the MP5K, which has shown a noticeably higher usage rate than other SMGs. Its TTK (Time to Kill) will remain the same at close range, but you’ll feel a clear increase in TTK at longer distances. These changes are aimed at keeping SMGs an appealing choice for close-quarters combat while maintaining healthy weapon variety across the Battlegrounds. As for the Panzerfaust, which has long been known for its overwhelming firepower, we’ve introduced several penalties to its handling and damage potential. True to its nature as a large, heavy weapon, movement is now more restricted when it’s equipped, adding a layer of risk to its use. We’ve also increased the sight deployment sound and reduced the damage it does to players inside vehicles, giving players more opportunities to respond to Panzerfaust attacks.</em></p>

We’ve been gradually rolling out terrain destruction to multiple maps. With this update, players can now enjoy creating new cover strategies not only on Rondo, Sanhok, and Taego, but also on Miramar. These changes aim to bring Miramar’s gameplay experience more in line with other maps. Please note that the Destructible Buildings feature, which currently exists only on Sanhok, is not planned for other maps at this time.</em></p>

            <p>Given how quickly older games can be delisted or end up near impossible to run properly without tinkering nowadays, efforts like GOG.com's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">preservation program</a> are always nice to see. There's obviously a money-making motive behind it for the storefront, but keeping retro works in working order's a noble way to earn that cash. As it turns out, though, the folks behind the CD Projekt-owned site underestimated just how difficult an undertaking the program would be.</p>
<p>That's not to suggest they're giving up though, just that they've had to re-evaluate some of their ambitious early goals.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"To be perfectly honest, it’s harder than we thought it would be," GOG senior business development manager Marcin Paczynski told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/when-we-launched-resident-evil-on">The Game Business</a>. "What we’ve found out is that the games and how they work has deteriorated way faster than what we thought. And we are not talking only about the game not launching. We are talking about more subtle things as well, like the game not supporting modern controllers, or the game not supporting ultra-widescreen or modern resolutions, or even a simple thing like being able to minimalize the game, which is an essential feature today. Modern gamers expect to be able to minimalize the game and then to bring it up without issues."</p>
<p>So, it's turned out that the sellers have had more work on their hands than they anticipated to bring older games up to "the standards that we defined". As you might expect, that's led to the revamped games pot not filling up at quite the rapid rate GOG predicted, with the preservation program now forecasted to end 2025 with somewhere between 300 and 350 titles, rather than the 500 originally set as a goal. As of writing, it's 232 games strong.</p><p>GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski also picked out the ancient DRM tech old games have often been saddled with as a headache when it comes to performing these updates, suggesting that companies should consider making the DRM easier to ditch once it's protected the game around launch. The other side of that coin, of course, is that companies will always want to cover their own backs - convincing them to compromise early on in the name of a future comeback project surely resembles a chat with a tie-wearing brick wall in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>Finally, Paczynski picked out a couple of cases which have seen getting the rights to preserve games present a different challenge than simply convincing a lawyer people still dig classic Resi. Amongst other things, GOG have hunted down ex-shooter devs turned Texan oil magnates, and hired a private investigator to track down one bloke living totally off-the-grid who'd inherited the rights to some games. </p>
<p>Imagine, you're living in a tent in the wilds of somewhere like the Scottish highlands. As you snooze, the zip gently winds down, startling you into fight or flight mode. It's Tom Selleck. 'Oi, people want to play Links: The Challenge of Golf without running into weird popping audio,' he declares. You reach into an old tin and hand him a bit of paper which reads 'Do what you want with it'. He leaves. You accidentally forget to check that none of the berries you've picked for breakfast are poisonous.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I can't remember much about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-1942">Battlefield 1942</a>, two decades on, but I'm pretty sure I never thought "by golly, what if this + enormous sad stone monsters" while storming the beaches of Wake Island. It's one of many things that separate me from Fumito Ueda, director of melancholy PS2 titan-feller Shadow Of The Colossus, first released in 2005. In a new interview, he and other staff at Team Ico and Sony explore the game's development from start to finish, including some early dabblings with multiplayer.</p><!--more-->
<p>That SOTC - aka Nico, aka Ico 2 - was envisaged as a group hunting sim is reasonably well known, but this is the first I've heard that it took inspiration from DICE's khaki ballistics fest. Read all about it in <a href="https://www.designroom.site/shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history/">this oral history</a> published by Design Room, a longread mothership recently launched by former Polygon writers.</p>
<p>The piece begins with Ueda and other staff reflecting on the poor sales of Ico, their reputation-making Gormenghastian escort questathon. "In terms of inspiration, I wasn't playing many offline games back then," Ueda recalls. "But I was really hooked on Battlefield 1942, an FPS. I felt immense potential in the experience of that as a competitive game, where you'd shoot at or help out other players you didn't know. That desire to create a network game - meaning a game where you play together, battle, or cooperate with others online - led me to start with the idea of a game where you cooperate to defeat giant monsters."</p>
<p>Design Room include a cheeky offstage Jerry Springer-style reaction here from Johan Persson, the lead programmer responsible for Battlefield 1942's original concept. "You tend to just assume these ideas were the result of someone having a eureka moment, waking up one morning, without any context," he says.</p><p>You might think that Capcom's original Monster Hunter would be the major influence, but that only came out the year before SOTC, and it's hard to imagine the development timelines lining up. Still, the prototype outline given by then-Sony Computer Entertainment America producer Kyle Shubel certainly evokes the team tactics of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and co. "I'm going to stun it. I'm gonna tie its leg while you mount on top of it. I'll go in front of it and blind it while he takes it out," Shubel expounds. "That concept, and then jumping back off onto your horses, and riding off in the sunset -- yeah, if we could have pulled that off, everyone would be talking about this game."</p>
<p>The multiplayer concept didn't come together for mostly humdrum reasons. Team Ico had little experience making multiplayer games, and PlayStation's online support was in its infancy at the time. The idea never progressed beyond some early prototypes. "We probably hadn't gotten as far as testing multiplayer, or maybe we just connected two controllers on a local network and were able to move characters around," Ueda says. "That was about the extent of it. We hadn't reached the point where you could play online. </p>
<p>"Personally, I thought we could attempt making a multiplayer game because we were developing within Sony's first-party studios," he goes on. "But looking at the production resources at the time, I decided that we couldn't realistically do it. To efficiently concentrate resources, we cut the multiplayer portion." Ueda adds that it was likely other parts of Sony's Japan Studio would have had to help out.</p>
<p>SOTC was a humongous undertaking even without the ability to gank the lonesome juggernauts. "Compared to Ico, this game had to have the following: an open-world setting with dynamic loading to express infinite space; "deforming collision" where you cling to giant structures; and a quadrupedal animal for the horse," Ueda details. "All of these features were already raising the bar significantly compared to Ico.</p><p>"We had nearly the same production team as Ico, and we knew network games were tough to make. Adding network support would also require the player to have more hardware to play, limiting those who could experience it. For these reasons, I decided to cut our losses early." It wasn't the only thing they ended up chopping - the game had 48 colossi at one point, not 16. You can read more in the full feature, with selections reserved for paying subscribers.</p>
<p>Given SOTC's story themes, introducing multiplayer may seem utterly ruinous. It's hard to imagine losing yourself in the mossy undulations of massive grieving metaphors when you have DorminNova69 spamming "revive me" in chat.</p>
<p>Still, grief is as much a collective ritual as a personal ordeal, and there is such a thing as "emotive multiplayer" - see the sherpas of Journey and the gloomier covenants of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. Somebody should make a proper mod for it. Somebody should mod the colossi into Battlefield 1942 as well. I'm frankly appalled that there don't appear to be any such mods already - SOTC at least has the excuse of (somehow) not yet being officially available on PC.</p>
<p>As for what Ueda is up to these days: he and Team Ico are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-creator-of-ico-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-is-making-a-giant-robot-piloting-game">getting into the mech business</a>.</p>

It’s a traversal tool that can be used to reach high-up places, opening up opportunities to gain new vantage points or even sneak up on unsuspecting enemies. The thing is that now, just days after Battlefield 6 launched for PC and consoles, the ladder is also being used for much, much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve even accidentally whipped out the ladder while playing Battlefield 6 multiplayer, you might have noticed that actually mounting it can be a hassle. The bottom of the gadget bumps players around if placed at a certain angle, triggering moments that balance frustration with slapstick humor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some Assault classes in Battlefield 6 have found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o558n3/assault_ladder_is_criminally_underutilized_im/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>practical uses for the tool</u></a>, others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o4g675/me_when_i_meet_the_ladder_of_repulsion_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>struggling to use it at all</u></a>.

All it takes is maneuvering around the gadget at the right angle and speed, causing a chain reaction that sends players careening through the air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, ladder launching is, mostly, practically useless in Battlefield 6.

            <title><![CDATA[Space Adventure Cobra: The Awakening Review]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-adventure-cobra-the-awakening-review.1325047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>If you’ve never even heard of the 1970s manga ‘Cobra’ and the anime movie – ‘Space Adventure Cobra’ – and TV show that spawned from it, then don’t worry; me either. What I came to learn is that Cobra is absolutely brilliant, it’s self-indulgent, silly sci-fi at its finest. An over-the-top tale in which a Han Solo-like hero called Cobra, an intergalactic adventurer no less, travels the galaxy battling the villainous Pirate Guide – whose numbers include the superbly named Crystal Bowie. Well, Space Adventure Cobra: The Awakening is the video game of that story, a 2D side-scrolling Metroid-lite shoot ‘em up that does a lot of things well, and just as many things badly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Adventure Cobra - The Awakening - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qur4Wfmu-BU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What Space Adventure Cobra: The Awakening absolutely nails is the look and feel of an 80’s matinee cartoon. Footage from the original anime is interspersed with the gameplay, giving a satisfying, cohesive feel to proceedings, as well as a strong narrative flow. The game is smartly structured around a TV episode format, welcomingly aping the TV show that inspired it. Other than the original footage, the rest of the story is told via talking heads and text boxes, with dialogue kept pleasantly short, keeping the focus firmly on the gameplay.</p>


<p>The animation for Cobra himself is fantastic; he moves like a character from GI-Joe or Thundercats. Our red spandex-clad hero is all about dynamic comic book poses, demonstrating plenty of effortless style as he slides and dashes across each stage, blasting away with his Pychogun. Enemy types don’t fair nearly as well, however. Most are bland, colour palette swapped and near indistinguishable henchman, whilst bosses fall too often into small metallic drone tedium. The game singularly fails to give you anything interesting to shoot at, but thankfully the shooting itself is rather fun.</p>


<p>Along with all the regular run and gun, which has a distinctive Samus feel, Cobra is able to use his pychogun to entertaining and unique effect. After charging a meter, you can launch a special laser attack that briefly freezes time, whilst you steer the energy beam in a manner rather reminiscent of playing Snake on your old brick Nokia. Steer your laser strategically and you can nimbly dodge obstacles and take out numerous enemies in one hugely satisfying blast, Cobra congratulating himself – and you – as he does so.</p>
<p>This gameplay mechanic leads to some great moments and is one of the key elements in the handful of switch-based puzzles that will briefly befuddle you. Sadly though, the controls are inconsistent, all too often my laser snake took it upon itself to auto-steer – usually when up against bosses that require pinpoint targeting of weak points to destroy – taking me by surprise and thus missing my targets entirely. It’s a frustrating blip in what is an otherwise deeply enjoyable addition.</p>

<p>Sadly, the level design doesn’t live up to the standard of the combat. Bland and empty, running along corridors with some very predictable platforming interspersed, charging through these environments soon gets boring. There’s a light Metroidvania element to proceedings, encouraging you to return to previous levels with newfound abilities to unlock and discover secret areas, but when exploring is this tedious, there’s really little incentive to do so.</p>
<p>More problematically, the controls for Cobra don’t behave whilst he leaps and clambers, all too often missing a handhold that he clearly should have reached and so plunging to his doom. Worse is when the game sticks an enemy on top of a platform that you’re clasping onto. Try and climb up and things get confused, the game not knowing what you want to do, resulting in a stationary Cobra getting shot a lot as you frantically waggle your thumbstick and tap buttons furiously. Perhaps in recognition of these issues, the check point system is very generous, putting you right back into the action with full health and no lives to worry about. Which does undermine the challenge somewhat, that is at least until you run into one of the very unpleasant difficulty spikes.</p>

<p>Overall, Space Adventure Cobra is a smooth and accessible experience, putting up just the right amount of resistance to provide a slight challenge, but not much more than that. But then, rather too often, you run into a ridiculously tough mini-boss who will make you cry with despair. These rotters are veritable bullet sponges, and, unlike the main bosses, have no discernible weak points for you to take advantage of and boost your damage.</p>
<p>Each of these irritating foes usually fights you on a locked screen and spews a nasty bullet hell at you, something the game hasn’t bothered in teaching you how to avoid in the proceeding stages, resulting in a lot of frustration as Cobra dies and dies again until you eventually get lucky and can finally proceed. Because of the easy level of challenge elsewhere, these difficulty spikes really stick out, jabbing you right in the unmentionables.</p>
