<p>It's getting Hutt in here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are just one day away from the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> on Switch 2, and while we at Nintendo Life are still hard at work in the Jedi Temple, getting our review in order, we do have some gameplay footage for you to feast your eyes on in the meantime.</p>
<p>In the above video, you'll find 16 minutes of Outlaws on Switch 2. We've got gameplay from a whole bunch of scenarios, including internal environments, stealth sections, open-world exploring and outer space dogfights, so you can get an idea of what Nintendo's latest hybrid has in store.</p>
<p>The good news is, it looks really rather solid. We felt a disturbance in the Force when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-force-isnt-strong-with-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-initial-impressions-suggest">initial impressions</a> on the game's performance began to appear out of PAX West, but from what we've seen with our own eyes far, it plays far better than expected — heck, it looks like a totally different game to the low-frame footage Ubisoft shared in official trailers. Sure, it's a step down from the PS5 version as far as visuals are concerned, but it's nothing like as choppy as we were braced for.</p>
<p>Everything that you'll see above is from docked play, but video producer extraordinaire Alex Olney has also had a chance to play about in handheld mode, and it sounds equally promising. "It's soft, but it's perfectly playable," he said. "Frame rate is stable enough, leagues ahead of what the official trailer showed, which is a blessed relief".</p>
<p>As we mentioned, you'll have to wait a little while longer before you can read our full review for Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2, but we'll endeavour to have it with you as soon as possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>IO Interactive's <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-fastest-io-interactive-game-500k-wishlists-steam/">highly anticipated</a> 007 First Light is due to have another deep dive later today during a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/01/state-of-play-presents-007-first-light-gameplay-deep-dive-on-september-3/">State of Play</a> event focused entirely on gameplay in the Hitman studio's take on James Bond, and a few details about the game have leaked ahead of the showcase, though nothing to do with how the game will play.</p>



<p>From prominent and reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580">Billbil-kun</a>, the price for the standard edition of 007 First Light appeared on an Amazon listing, which pins the game at $70 USD for the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 editions. That marks it as another game where players don't have to worry about spending $80 to play it, but if you wanted more than just the game, IO Interactive is more than happy to oblige with a collector's edition, with a price set at a whopping $300.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 EXCLUSIVE - 2026 🚨</p><p>007 First Light from IO Interactive will be released in Physical format + Collectors Edition</p><p>And you can even pre-order them from now!</p><p>🔸 Standard Edition (PS5, Xbox Series, Switch 2): 69.99 US$</p><p>🔹 Collectors: 299.99 US$<br>- PS5: <a href="https://t.co/65g723UT7x">https://t.co/65g723UT7x</a></p></div>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>We don't yet know what that $300 price tag gets you besides a copy of the game, though if it's anything like other collector's editions, the remaining $230 likely covers the cost of a statue or figure representative of the game's charming protagonist and a few other bits and bobs for the biggest James Bond enthusiasts to enjoy.</p>



<p>What's perhaps more intriguing for those looking forward to 007 First Light, is that if price information has leaked hours ahead of today's gameplay deep dive, then that means we are likely hours away from learning the game's official release date. We already know the <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-cinematic-trailer-revealed-will-launch-in-2026/">game is due out in 2026</a>, but IO Interactive has refrained from saying when in 2026 we'll be able to order our 'shaken, not stirred' vodka martini's. Hopefully, we'll find out today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're swinging from the rooftops with excitement for the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>&nbsp;Universes Beyond <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-spider-man-villains-bonus-sheet-and-infinity-stone-revealed" rel="nofollow">Spider-man</a> </em>set, and we're thrilled to have the official spoilers for two brand Bonus Sheet cards - straight from our friends at Wizards of the Coast! Let's jump right in.</p>

<h2>MTG Spider-Man - Rest In Peace</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/techraptor-mtg-spider-man-rest-in-peace-exclusive.jpg?itok=RPahGfVQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/techraptor-mtg-spider-man-rest-in-peace-exclusive.jpg?itok=lFGX-rEV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Graveyard hate has never looked this good! Featuring original artwork from this pivotal moment in the comics by Mark Buckingham and D'Isreali (from Spectacular Spider-Man #27 (2003)), I can't think of a single better moment to illustrate this card.</p>

<p>And with this full-art treatment, the art truly gets to shine as we see Peter Parker at his beloved Uncle Ben's grave. Your opponents running a mono-black sacrifice deck will&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;hold their head in their hands when you drop this on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Now, onto our next card - which brings a bit of delightful chaos to the scene.</p>

<h2>MTG Spider-Man - Rite of Replication</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/techraptor-mtg-spider-man-rite-of-replication-exclusive.jpg?itok=IBuEnfdg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/techraptor-mtg-spider-man-rite-of-replication-exclusive.jpg?itok=1baBP9HJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This iconic artwork, showing a horde of Spider-Man clones bursting onto the frame, is the perfect piece to choose to represent Rite of Replication, a sorcery allowing you to clone (or, if kicked, clone and clone and clone) a creature on the battlefield. Once again, the full-art of these bonus sheet treatments really adds a lot of energy and chaos to this card.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of copying creatures, and I've always loved the way Rite of Replication doesn't restrict&nbsp;you to copying a creature you control. Does your opponent have an annoying Commander? Give them a taste of their own medicine!&nbsp;</p>

<p>What do you think of these two Bonus Sheet cards? Do you think they chose the right artwork to represent them? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-review-impressions-horror-bloober-team-silent-hil-2-ps5-2000622488</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-the-new-horror-game-from-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-cats-are-your-best-allies.1287699/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A few hours into playing <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>,</em> while I was creeping around a desolate and nightmarish world filled with dilapidated buildings and creepy, fleshy monsters, I heard a cat meow from behind a locked door. Later, after killing some nasty horrors and solving a puzzle, I returned with bolt cutters and freed the cat. In exchange, it granted me a useful item. All future cats I found in <em>Cronos</em> did the same. It was good to have an army of cats as allies in this strange, hellish world. Also good: <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, the latest horror game from Bloober Team.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482">Last year’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake from Bloober Team</a> proved that the studio, which has sometimes been criticized for making sloppy, bad horror games, could knock it out of the park if given the chance. But remaking one of the greatest scary games of all time into something that’s also scary and good, while impressive, arguably isn’t as hard as creating something unique and fresh that is also memorable and creepy in its own right.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-horror-new-bloober-cronos-new-dawn-xbox-1851675319">So I was both excited and nervous about <em>Cronos</em></a>. Could Bloober deliver a worthy follow-up to the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake that was also a game wholly of its own creation? Well, the answer is mostly yes. While <em>Cronos</em> isn’t as good as <em>Silent Hill 2</em> (but like, what is?), it is still a fantastically nasty third-person horror game that is a perfect post-apocalyptic, sci-fi survival experience that fans of<em> Resident Evil 4 </em>will feel right at home with.</p>

  <p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is a third-person horror game that places you in the big, lumbering boots of The Traveler. This strange character is a time traveler of sorts with advanced weaponry and tech. Her mission, or “vocation,” is seemingly to fight back against a dangerous, unnatural virus that turns people into sickly, decaying monsters that only want to kill you and merge their flesh together with other monsters and corpses. Doing so lets them grow stronger, and you’ll want to burn bodies to stop that from happening. At some point in the ’80s, as seen during sections of the game in which you go back in time briefly, this horrible virus spread across the planet and destroyed everything. Now you and your fellow Travelers work tirelessly to stop it, contain it, and learn more about it. Or maybe, you all are to blame…</p> <p>The narrative <em>Cronos</em> weaves is weird and kept me guessing for most of my time playing it. Sadly, I wasn’t able to finish the game and had to restart it due to some technical issues involving the game’s PS5 build (don’t worry, this won’t happen to you), but from what I was able to play (and later re-play), <em>Cronos</em> tells an odd story that isn’t like that in any horror game I’ve played in recent memory. It doesn’t always work and it can sometimes feel like you go long stretches without the narrative moving forward, but I mostly enjoyed peeling back another bloody layer of flesh from this disgusting onion.</p>

 <p>The real meat of <em>Cronos</em> is found outside of the cutscenes and dialogue. Most of the game is spent creeping around horrible places with limited ammo, health items, and other resources, trying desperately not to die to some nasty flesh-ghoul in the dark. Combat in <em>Cronos</em> is tough at times, especially if you let any of the monsters merge with dead monsters or other corpses. Bigger enemies easily made me burn through most of my ammo and sometimes proved tougher than the actual boss fights. Thankfully, you can use the environment to your advantage; there are many oil tanks and red barrels dotted around the wasteland, which can be very useful for thinning out the herds of enemies the game sometimes throws at you.</p> <p>I do expect some will be put off by how much combat is in <em>Cronos</em> and how hard it can be, especially if you aren’t hoarding resources like a crazed survivalist who has spent too many weeks listening to Joe Rogan podcasts. I liked the tough-as-nails encounters, especially as I started to upgrade my suit and guns and could put up a better fight, but your mileage may vary.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000622721" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622721"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622721">©Bloober Team</figcaption></figure> <p>Between these fights and scrapping for supplies, you occasionally solve environmental puzzles by using a strange energy tether tool that can let you manipulate time by either rewinding or fast-forwarding specific areas of the map through the timeline. So a set of collapsed stairs can be rewound to when they were whole again, or a fallen piece of flooring can be brought back to its original location and raised like an elevator in the process. It’s a neat trick that looks cool, but it sometimes felt like the designers forgot it was a part of <em>Cronos</em>, and I’d go a long time between these time shenanigans. Still, I enjoyed messing with the flow of time, and being able to rewind it to bring back a red barrel and use it again against flesh monsters was fun.</p> <p>What I didn’t enjoy were the technical issues I encountered playing <em>Cronos</em>. While things greatly improved after Bloober Team sent me a new build of the game running on PS5, I still encountered performance spikes, weird animation bugs, broken subtitles, and some classic Bloober Team jank. The quality of character dialogue also varies wildly. Sometimes folks you encounter sound like real people, with great performances supporting excellent writing, and other times you might think you’re watching a cheesy <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> horror movie, just without the bots and Joel riffing over the top of the bad acting and clunky dialogue. Thankfully, the game is mostly the Traveler talking to herself and the cats she finds while recording and documenting everything.</p> <p>I’m excited to return to <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> and finish it, as the large chunk of the game I played, while at times rough, was an earnest and dedicated attempt by Bloober to create something new and creepy. Not every part of <em>Cronos</em> succeeds at what Bloober set out to do, but most of it does, and often in a way that sets it apart from other recent horror games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-bloober-team-underdog-proved-wrong-remake-1851787141">This might not be as good as the<em> Silent Hill 2</em> remake</a>, but those craving a new third-person survival horror game that is more shooty-shooty, like <em>RE4</em> or <em>Dead Space,</em> will want to check out <em>Cronos</em> when it launches on September 5 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2 and PC.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dell’s 15.6″ Laptop (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) Is $2,200 Off With Accessories, Making It an Almost Free Bundle]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dells-15-6-laptop-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-is-2200-off-with-accessories-making-it-an-almost-free-bundle-2000622434</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell%E2%80%99s-15-6%E2%80%B3-laptop-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-is-2-200-off-with-accessories-making-it-an-almost-free-bundle.1287696/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nothing grabs consumer eyeballs like a bundle deal. But who could possibly avert their eyes when Amazon takes an elite-level touchscreen laptop like<strong> the Dell Inspiron 15 3535 and bundles it with Windows 11 Pro and a box of goodies including a stylus pen, camera privacy cover, and USB flash drive</strong>, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3882/">and offers that $3,000 package for just $800?</a></p>
<p>The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 alone at that price is a steal, especially when you see how loaded this model is.<strong> It’s packed with 32GB of RAM and a fat 1TB solid-state drive, with the AMD Ryzen 7 processor at the heart of the machine to make everything run fast and smoothly</strong>. The bundle add-ons of usually sold-separately necessities like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">pre-installed Windows 11 Pro</a> with Copilot, a protective sleeve, and 128GB USB flash drive are the clincher that make this deal truly amazing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3882/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No Shortcuts Taken</h2>
<p>We know, bundle deals are often just the sweetener to sell an iffy product that doesn’t move units on its own. This is most definitely not that. The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 is a total beast, with a 15.6-inch touchscreen that’s also LED-backlit and full-HD (1920×1080 resolution) with a refresh rate of 60Hz. The screen takes up nearly all of the inside lid thanks to the slender borders. The AMD Ryzen 7 processor can really cook, with speeds of up to 4.5GHz at the ready.</p>
<p>The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 isn’t one of those thick, heavy old-school laptops that are a chiropractor’s nightmare when carried in a shoulder bag. It’s sleek and trim at just three-quarters of an inch thick with the lid closed, and the 3.6 pound weight isn’t going to drag you down. The anti-glare screen, HD webcam, and generous array of ports and connection options complete the package.</p>



<h2>Meet Your Copilot</h2>
<p>This bundle deal also does not skimp on the operating system, as Windows 11 Pro is preloaded and just a press of the power button away from launch. Pro is designed for business professionals and power users, packed with advanced security network management features. It also comes with Copilot, one of the very best of the huge recent wave of AI assistants. Copilot is a great source for quick, accurate research, and if you’re ever stuck on writing the perfect email or any other creative effort, Copilot is one of the best assistants around.</p>
<p>This incredible bundle is topped off with an accessories kit that includes a stylus pen (remember, the Inspiron is a touchscreen), privacy cover for the webcam, 128GB USB flash drive, laptop dust plug, protective sleeve, and microfiber cleaning cloth. These are all of the little incidentals that can run up a shockingly big bill as add-ons, and they’re free. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3882/">Amazon’s $800 deal on this massively packed bundle is a killer 73%-off deal that brings you an elite-level laptop, OS, and accessory package at a savings of $2,200.</a></p>

            <p>Director Zach Cregger - known for Barbarian and more recently modern horror fairytale Weapons - has shed more light on his upcoming Resident Evil film, which will begin shooting later this year. Most notably, the director has said the film will be "true to the experience of the games", and "lives" in the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and 3. That being said, Cregger said his adaptation "adheres more to the tone of 4".</p>
<p>Cregger was a guest on the <a href="https://youtu.be/jnKTQ2Xenbs?feature=shared">Double Toasted YouTube channel</a>, when the conversation turned towards Resident Evil. "It takes place in the world of the games, but most importantly the journey you'll have as a viewer of watching this movie is going to be similar to the journey you have as a player when you play these games," the director said of the adaptation.</p>
<p>"And what that means is it follows one protagonist from point A to point B as they just descend deeper and deeper and deeper into hell."</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Cregger continued: "And as someone who's played I don't know how many thousands and thousands of hours of Resident Evil, I just feel like I know how that pacing can go, and it's inherently cinematic, and I feel like there's a great movie that can live inside of this world and inside of that sort of pacing. And I'm just really, really pumped about the story that we get to tell here.</p>
<p>"So, I feel like I'm champing at the bit to make this thing."</p>
<p>As he has said before, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak">director reiterated he has not seen any of the previous Resident Evil films</a>, saying there are fans of the movies that are "probably not really prepared" for what he has planned. "But, I think that people that are fans of the games are probably going to be stoked," he said.</p><p>Cregger said the "thing about the games is that the game franchise itself is incredibly malleable", noting that both 2 and 3 take place in Raccoon City, while in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> we all head overseas with Leon ("and it feels like it's in the past even though it's not"). Resident Evil 7 he likens to "a Texas Chainsaw kind of a thing", before then saying "8 is like some ancient European village and definitely in the past".</p>
<p>"So, the games don't even have some sort of a set lore. It's not rigid. And so I don't think I'm taking any more liberties with this than the game franchise does at all," Cregger concluded. "So, I'm colouring within the lines."</p>
<p>Cregger's Resident Evil film is expected to be released on 18th September, 2026.</p>

			<p>Hytopia is a platform of games not entirely dissimilar to Roblox, with the key difference being its focus on blockchain games, and it has just launched its latest major title, SkyGarden, in open beta on its <a href="https://hytopia.com/games/">website</a>.</p>



<p>SkyGarden is a farming MMORPG that will immediately remind you of games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-creator-buying-game-purchase-pirating-not-theft/">Minecraft</a>, but that's not a mistake considering the fact that the development team includes the Minecraft artist Sebu, and is led by notable web developer<a href="https://x.com/GamingEtheria"> Shrimp</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SkyGarden A New Era of Cozy Farming MMORPG on HYTOPIA" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QDpe2sNipC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The game is free-to-play and allows players to build their own farms, grow crops, raise cattle, and create decorations for their farm to make it their own. Crops will also continue to grow even when players are offline, so you'll need to check in to keep your farm tidy and successful as you sell your crops and grown resources.</p>



<p>It's a milestone launch for the platform as it continues to try and grow its player base and developer base with games like SkyGardens and calls for developers, giving them <a href="https://www.blockchaingamer.biz/news/39771/hytopia-paying-25000-dev-teams-make-a-game-in-90-days/">$25K</a> if they can make a game within 90 days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Why was a decision that saved <em>Borderlands</em> such a dumb one to make? What was it like to play <em>Prey 2</em> at E3 2011? Will <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> eventually come to Switch 2? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Yours truly is still recovering from the weekend’s PAX West marathon and I have a bunch of interviews and previews still to publish on the site throughout the week. In the meantime, let’s take a short walk down memory lane.</p> <h2>Watch someone play Bethesda’s canceled sci-fi shooter <em>Prey 2</em></h2>  <p>Let’s talk about <em>Prey 2</em>. The short version is that <em>Prey 2</em> was a sequel to a popular 2006 shooter by Human Head Studios about solving puzzles on an alien spaceship. It got a big blowout showing at E3 2011, including a playable demo that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jun/20/e3-2011-prey-2-game-preview">generated a ton of buzz</a>. As a bounty hunter in an alien city, players used guns and parkour to chase suspects and choose how to apprehend them. A robot punished you if you caused too much immersive sim chaos,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>style.</p> <p>The game was supposed to come out in 2012 but never did. What was most surprising of all was that Bethesda never provided clear reasons for why the project was suddenly scuttled. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/05/what-went-wrong-with-human-heads-prey-2">There were reports</a> of contractual disputes and Bethesda leveraging the <em>Prey 2</em> publishing agreement to try to fully acquire Human Head Studios. Ultimately, Arkane began working on a reboot of the game that would become 2017’s very different sci-fi immersive sim <em>Prey</em>. This is where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/leaked-e-mails-suggest-bethesda-misled-gamers-about-pre-1149092622">term of endearment “press sneak fuck” was born</a>.</p>

 <p>Now fresh footage of the original <em>Prey 2</em> has leaked on YouTube under the account “David Halsted.” There are five videos totaling just over 20 minutes of gameplay showing off different features as well as the E3 demo. “I remember when they revealed this at PAX back in the day,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6zcc8/prey_2_development_videos_leaked/?share_id=GehdxVGPPqJefxwNWn5Ci&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">wrote one fan on Reddit</a>. “The whole con was buzzing about how cool it was and how hype we were for it. And then we got whatever it rebooted as. Dream revival game though.”</p> <h2><em>Borderlands</em> devs reflect on its “insane” art style overhaul</h2> <p>Gearbox’s loot shooter series is known for its <em>Diablo</em>-style loot, rude attitude, and bubblegum wrapper cel-shaded art style. But it was not always thus. Early in development, the first game in the shooter series looked like a broke knock-off of <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Rage</em>. That’s how it appeared in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/that-time-team-fortress-2-and-borderlands-changed-art-s-1749106652">demo at E3,</a> and on the cover of a 2007 <em>Game Informer</em> containing a deep dive on the game back before anyone had ever even heard of Claptrap.</p>

 <p>The magazine is back <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/01/the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-the-art-style-swap-that-saved-borderlands-1">with a new series of interviews</a> about Gearbox’s race to overhaul the grim, gritty, and dull look of the game to help it stand out and eventually become the mega-hit it is today. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford gave members of the art team permission to look into overhauling the art style, even as milestone deadlines were breathing down their necks:</p> <blockquote><p>It was, like, five guys with two weeks to go mess around with the look and the feel, and I immediately knew I made a mistake. I was like, ‘S—. We’re trying to get to Alpha, dude. There’s a business here. I’m responsible for other people’s money. I’m going to let these guys spin for two weeks, which means they’re going to be even more invested in what they’re doing, and then I have to go in and look at what they did, and I have to shoot it in the head. That’s what’s going to happen here. Son of a b—-. I’m an idiot. Why did I do that?’ But there was something in my heart that knew that we had to at least look at and explore. I knew we weren’t right.</p></blockquote> <h2>There’s another <em>28 Years Later</em> movie coming in just a few months called<em> The Bone Temple</em></h2> <p>Ralph Fiennes got so ripped fo<em>r 28 Years Later</em> that they made him the star of the sequel just 12 months later. <em>The Bone Temple</em> will briefly have Cillian Murphy return as Jim from the original movie as well. He’ll have a much bigger role in a trilogy-capping third movie arriving after <em>The Bone Temple</em>.</p>

  <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> director can neither confirm nor deny the existence of a Switch 2 port</h2> <p>The turn-based GOTY contender seems like a perfect fit for Nintendo’s new handheld hybrid. Will it get there sooner or later? Sandfall Interactive isn’t saying. “We have some possibilities that we will explore, but at the moment we cannot confirm anything,” the studio <a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/sandfall-interactive-esta-explorando-lanzar-clair-obscur-expedition-33-en-nintendo-switch-2/">told <em>Nintenderos</em></a>. That sounds like a studio who promised not to disclose that they have a Switch 2 dev kit.</p> <h2><em>Stellar Blade 2</em> is fully in development</h2> <p>That’s according to <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1963102317886283809">developer ShiftUp’s latest financial report</a>. “We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the ‘Stellar Blade’ IP and are currently developing a sequel to ‘Stellar Blade.'” The game is supposed to have a bigger world and some additional action mechanics. In the meantime, the first game is another candidate ripe for porting to Switch 2.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">Fighting game pros are confronting Saudi Arabia’s new co-ownership of Evo</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-corvette-steam-players-2000622428"><em>No Man’s Sky</em>‘s Voyager update is leading players and the game’s Steam records to new heights</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381">A look at&nbsp; <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em>‘ cultural takeover</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Resident Evil Movie’s director has stated that it “adheres more to the tone” of RE4. </p>



<p>We have yet to see an official trailer for the upcoming Resident Evil Movie, but new information about the adaptation seems to emerge periodically. Last time, we learned the movie’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-leak-reveals-link-to-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link to the game series</a>. Now, the director has revealed that the upcoming RE movie will be aligned with the tone of RE4. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-much-bigger-in-scale-than-the-director-s-previous-movies">Resident Evil Movie is Much Bigger in Scale than the Director’s Previous Movies</h2>



<p>Resident Evil Movie’s director, Zach Creggor, was recently interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnKTQ2Xenbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Double Toasted</a> (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-2026-movie-zach-cregger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>) and was asked questions about the adaptation. When discussing the approach, Cregger explained that the upcoming movie is “true to the experience of the games.” The journey the audience would have as a viewer in this movie is similar to a player of these games, where we follow “one protagonist from point A to point B as they just descend deeper and deeper and deeper into Hell.”</p>



<p>Cregger elaborates that he has played “thousands and thousands of hours of Resident Evil,” which has made him well-versed with the franchise’s pacing. He understands that it is “inherently cinematic” and is “really pumped” about the story they are building in this world. The Resident Evil movie features an original story and is very much in line with Cregger’s sensibility and his “sense of tone”. Moreover, “it is just a much bigger scale than Weapons and certainly Barbarian”. </p>



<p>Cregger adds that fans of the Resident Evil movie franchise might not be prepared for what he has planned, but fans of the games “are probably going to be stoked.” </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-s-tone-and-inspiration-from-games">Resident Evil Movie’s Tone and Inspiration From Games</h2>



<p>The upcoming Resident Evil movie is more closely tied to the world of the games, the director states. Cregger explains that the upcoming Resident Evil movie probably “lives more” in the world of RE2 and RE3, but it “adheres more to the tone” of RE4. He explains that the game franchise has always been malleable, with every new game featuring different settings and tones. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-being-shot-in-prague-and-shooting-begins-mid-october">Resident Evil Movie is Being Shot in Prague, and Shooting Begins Mid-October</h2>



<p>Zach Cregger has revealed that shooting for the Resident Evil Movie begins in mid-October and is expected to wrap up by January 2026. The movie is being shot in Prague, and when asked why that location, the director explained that it has a rebate that allows them to make this movie with the budget they have. Moreover, it has a talented crew, great stages, and a lot of resources; “it is the right place for it”. </p>



<p>In other news, the director of the Resident Evil movie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-director-wont-focus-on-lore-people-are-going-to-come-for-me-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be “completely obedient</a>” with the series’ lore. Additionally, the upcoming adaptation will feel “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-movie-fresh-edgy-weird/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh, edgy, and weird</a>“. What are your thoughts on the Resident Evil movie following the tone of RE4?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh from serving up a smalltown, psychological scare-a-thon in the form of 2024’s superb <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, developer Bloober Team has since focussed its energy on birthing a snarling, spiritual successor to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008">Dead Space</a> series in the form of Cronos: The New Dawn. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> is a tough act to follow, though, so even though Cronos is a respectable creep show it’s hard not to be a little disappointed it didn’t knock my socks off in the same way. This survival-horror shooter takes place amidst the ruined, futuristic hellscape of a plague-riddled Polish city, a fascinating and foreboding expanse to set its slaughter in, but its fairly uninspired combat doesn’t do enough to distinguish itself from the necromorph-dismembering series it clearly draws so much inspiration from. Cronos still manages to deliver a solid slab of spooky mutant-slaying action, but a new dawn for survival horror it most certainly is not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cronos: The New Dawn - Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We step into the space suit of the Traveler, an investigator searching the desolate ruins of the city of New Dawn after her comrade goes missing. It quickly becomes clear that almost every remaining local – aside from the curious abundance of friendly stray cats – is a hostile mutant out for blood rather than conversation. Thankfully, the Traveler has an interesting trick up her sleeve: the ability to temporarily travel back through rifts in time in order to harvest the essence of New Dawn residents before they succumbed to the plague and interrogate them for clues about the fate of her fellow Traveler. It proves to be a compelling mystery presented in a fairly novel way, one that seems to take as much inspiration from Netflix’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/dark">Dark</a> as it does <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alone-in-the-dark-1992">Alone in the Dark</a>.      </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Traveler herself is a bit like a slightly more murderous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-mandalorian">Mandalorian</a>: she’s short on words, never takes off her helmet, and signs off on each communication with the same solemn mantra – in this instance, “Such is our calling” in place of “This is the way.” However, despite her initial lack of personality I found myself growing more and more interested in her plight, since each essence she harvests seems to have adverse effects on her mental state. This manifests in an increasingly unsettling state of psychosis (not unlike that suffered by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008">Dead Space’s</a> Isaac Clarke) that injects nightmarish hallucinations into the already-volatile world around her.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although many of Cronos’ haunted houses are straight out of the survival-horror playbook, from decaying apartment blocks to the obligatory menacing hospital, each area feels distinct and dreamlike thanks to hauntingly fractured architecture that seems trapped in some sort of limbo between time and space. However, connecting these interesting major areas is a noticeable amount of padding that adds unnecessary bloat to its 14-hour runtime. Even the Traveler herself gave voice to my exasperation the second time I had to put story progress on hold for upwards of an hour in order to gradually bring a trainline power generator back online, and I lost count of the times I had to slowly inch my way through boil-covered corridors of biomass that felt like squeezing through Satan’s lower intestines. It certainly looks and sounds revolting, but it’s the sort of thing that becomes mundane pretty quickly, and the tortured torsos waiting in the walls to ambush you in these areas only grow easier to anticipate over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, although Cronos’ atmosphere is consistently moody and sinister, it never quite intensifies into the full-on frightfests that developer Bloober Team itself so expertly conjured up in last year’s Silent Hill 2 remake. Sure, there are plenty of cheap jump scares from monsters crashing through walls like they’re the <em>Ghoul</em>-Aid Man, but nothing terrifying enough to compel me to nervously turn on an extra light and check the shadows behind my couch midway through each play session. That said, there is some creepy environmental storytelling to be found here, from bloodstained interrogation rooms to hallways lined with the severed limbs and scattered shields of riot police. In tandem with the many interesting notes and audio recordings that give welcome context to how its society crumbled, Cronos consistently presents an intriguing world that feels at once both lived in and plagued by death.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fighting Orphan Power Ragers</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Cronos’ bloodsmeared hallways might look like they were decorated by a butcher, but the monsters stalking within them have clearly been inspired by a carpenter. Specifically, John Carpenter. The iconic horror director’s influence has reared its disturbingly ugly head in a survival-horror adventure once again, and Cronos is filled to the pus-oozing gills with twisted freaks that look like wax figures that have been left out in the sun too long. These mutated humans – known as “orphans” – come in a handful of forms, from stretched-out fiends with whipping tentacles for arms to towering, tank-like toughs that absorb multiple shotgun blasts before they drop, to the spider-like messes of body parts that scurry erratically along walls and ceilings, making it a challenge to keep them in your ironsights. Later, almost every enemy type is reintroduced in acid-spitting forms, putting greater emphasis on the importance of staying mobile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your main weapon to dispatch them with is a fairly rudimentary yet reliable pistol that can fire either standard shots or charged-up blasts, should you opt to deal extra damage on delay at the risk of leaving yourself open to a lunging attack. Extra ammunition can be crafted on the fly using chemicals and scrap scoured from the environment, but there’s clearly some intelligent balancing going on behind the scenes to only ever present just the right amount of resources to make you feel like you’ve barely got enough to survive rather than ever having the luxury of a surplus. That kept my paranoia levels at a consistent peak and meant that I stayed switched on as I entered each new hallway of horrors.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Cronos is filled to the pus-oozing gills with twisted freaks that look like wax figures that have been left out in the sun too long.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the course of the journey gun mods can be found, both as part of the main story’s path and also by sniffing out secrets behind locked doors, but for the most part these are fairly subtle variations on the same pistol, shotgun, and assault rifle types. One shotgun variant can fire high-powered charged-up blasts, while the double-barreled version can fire two blasts in quick succession, for example. It doesn’t seem to make a drastic difference one way or the other in terms of power, so it’s more a matter of letting you fight how you want to rather than upgrading from one to the next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did manage to get my hands on a high-powered railgun of sorts, but I mostly kept it locked up in the safe house storage chest because I could never make enough room in my inventory to be able to carry it. Speaking of which, it strikes me as odd that despite the fact the Traveler’s gun appears to shapeshift between weapon types while held in her hand, not unlike the all-in-one firearm found in Remedy’s Control, each gun variant takes up its own individual slot in her heavily restricted inventory space. How does that make sense? It would be like using an entire cutlery drawer to hold a single Swiss Army Knife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, the bigger problem here is that because Cronos wears its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008">Dead Space</a> influence so plainly on its sleeve – from the messages written in blood on the walls, to the Isaac Clarke-style fashion the Traveler stomps through item crates, to the zero-gravity stretches that have you zipping between drifting chunks of terra firma – it practically begs for comparisons to that seminal survival-horror classic (and its excellent 2023 remake). Unfortunately, going toe to toe it comes up shorter than a zombie after a shotgun round to the head. Where the combat in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008">Dead Space</a> is wonderfully dynamic, enhancing the already-flexible gunplay with stasis powers to slow the charge of fast-moving monsters and telekinesis to turn their own detachable limbs into projectiles, Cronos is disappointingly one-note by comparison. You can shoot the legs out of certain enemy types to trip them up if you want, but generally your best option is almost always to aim for the head or a conveniently placed explosive barrel. It never really inspires much more improvisation or creative killing than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no telekinesis, but there is the ability to target orb-like “oddities” found in the world and reverse their trajectories through space and time, introducing some light environmental puzzle solving in between enemy encounters that challenge you to rewind collapsed bridges and tunnels to clear the path forward. But this time-manipulating ability sadly has no application for elevating the fairly stock-standard combat, aside from occasionally allowing you to rebuild explosive barrels for repeat blasts during boss fights. It would have been interesting if you could perhaps reassemble one of the suicide-bombing acid monsters and set them as some sort of time bomb to trip up other attackers, or rewind one of the rushing ghouls back a few steps to buy yourself the breathing space to chamber your next shotgun round, but sadly you can’t do anything of the sort.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Cronos’ main combat idea is that some of its enemies will attempt to absorb the power of any corpses found in their vicinity, evolving them into stronger mutations that deal greater damage and withstand more of your limited ammunition should you fail to disrupt them in the process. This again, is not too far removed from the Infector necromorphs in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008">Dead Space</a> that reanimated human corpses if you didn’t kill them quick enough, and although it did create some added urgency to prioritise specific foes anytime the telltale swirl of corpse-sapping tentacles sprouted out of them, it never really made a huge difference to my general approach to each encounter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Initially, Cronos encourages you to use single-use flamethrower bursts to burn any carcasses you come across lest they become energy-dispensing ATMs for the other orphans still standing, but I typically used the scrap parts required to craft flamethrower rounds for shotgun shells instead and never really ran into any major hurdles as a result. (The post-game stats screen indicates that I allowed just 20 enemies to merge with fallen foes, which is a pretty small percentage of the sizable number of disfigured demons I dispatched over the course of the campaign.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Cronos is capable of creating survival horror at its stressful best, at least in short bursts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, I did enjoy Cronos’ half a dozen or so boss fights. Although in practise they rarely require much more strategic complexity than to shoot the standard three glowing weak spots, they’re each nonetheless intimidating in size and the arenas you face them in are intensely claustrophobic, from the swirling mass of blackened tendrils that assembles into a towering golem to stalk you through a ruptured apartment, to the disgusting conjoined twins that crash through the walls of the steelworks’ basement. Each climactic clash had me desperately scrambling for ammo and panicking over each pistol shot, sometimes just barely making it through with my heart monitor redlining and only a couple of rounds left in the chamber. The handful of moments like these prove that Cronos is capable of creating survival horror at its stressful best, at least in short bursts.     </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Harvester of Sorrow</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the corpse-merging mechanic mentioned earlier, the only other notable point of difference that Cronos’ combat presents is the essence system. As the Traveler harvests the essence of specific story characters and other fallen comrades you find along the way, they each give you an attribute buff, like increasing the damage you deal to enemies that are on fire, or reducing the amount of resources required to craft ammo and medkits. In a system reminiscent of the equipable status effects typically found in roguelikes such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, you can only have three of these essences active at once, and you can only add a new one by sacrificing one of your existing buffs – once it’s gone, it’s gone for good. That presented me with some interesting choices to shape my character with, even though it wasn’t always totally clear how much benefit I was getting. In one extreme case, the description of an essence was just a random string of numbers and letters like a suggested password from Google Chrome – I equipped it out of curiosity, but I have no idea what effect it had or indeed if it had any effect at all.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere there are a few too many unwanted nasties that creep into the campaign on PlayStation 5, and I'm not talking about the tortured ghouls with second jaws for necks that stalk you at every turn. Oftentimes I’d have to stomp an item crate repeatedly before my hits would register, which became annoying particularly during the many horde mode-style arena fights when enemies were swarming from all angles. At other times I’d waste precious pistol rounds because the gas canister or explosive barrel just failed to rupture at first shot, which is not ideal when ammunition is at such a premium. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most egregious, though, were the handful of times that the Traveler would get stuck on scenery. At one point, after surviving a particularly brutish late-game boss, I was heading back to save my game at the nearest safehouse when I got trapped in a room full of infinitely respawning acid bombers because the Traveler just straight-up refused to walk through a wide-open exit. That forced me to reload my save and fight that same boss all over again, which was more deflating than a punctured spacesuit. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/cronos-the-new-dawn-review]]></content:encoded>

Now, add Forsaken 64, which launches September 4, to the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forsaken 64 launched in 1998 courtesy of developer Iguana UK, which handled the port, and publisher Acclaim. It’s a 3D first-person shooter similar to 1995’s influential Descent, with a whiff of Quake. You navigate through a series of tunnels while blasting enemies in a sci-fi setting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Nintendo:</p><blockquote>You are a ruthless mercenary, sent to the condemned remains of Earth as part of a covert operation codenamed "Forsaken." Your mission is to infiltrate and destroy the last bastions of the mechanized terror that wiped out all life on the planet. Earth is a death trap riddled with merciless mechanoid adversaries and gangs of rival bounty hunters, and you'll have to brave them all astride your anti-grav pioncycle to make your fortune...or meet your doom. Choose between different modes in this first-person shooter title released for the Nintendo 64 system in 1998, and enter the fight in Single Player Mode or Multi-Player Mode. Then, select your bike. Each bike has different attributes, each biker a different attitude. Pick one that suits your style, then dive into your mission. The availability of weapons, enemies, and powerups changes depending on the level you play, so stay sharp!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Forsaken 64 is infamous for its U.S. box art, which leaned on the game’s Mature rating by showing a random woman’s face with a solitary tear and tattooed cheek. The woman did not appear in the game, with some fans accusing the image of being misleading. The PAL box art, on the other hand, simply displayed the Forsaken 64 logo on an image of Earth.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/screenshot-2025-09-03-130611-1756901207271.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Remember the Forsaken 64 box art?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Every now and then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/1hofdjr/what_is_everyones_favorite_n64_box_art_and_why_is/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forsaken 64’s box art comes up in online conversation around the N64 console</a>, with some fondly remembering how out of place it looked. “Without any previous knowledge or looking at screenshots, would you be able to guess Forsaken 64’s genre based on the boxart alone?” asked redditor Drowsy_Drowzee in a post eight months ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember picking up Forsaken 64 as a loose cart back in the early 2000s and thinking it would be a cool horror/survival horror based on the name, cover art, and age rating. To my surprise, it was a vehicular action game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Top 10 N64 Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Forsaken irritated me as a kid,” added InfiniteRespond4064. “I rented it not knowing what it was and found the gameplay really obtuse and boring.

                <p>If you're at the intersection of ultra-wide monitor users and fans of Hollow Knight, then you're in luck. On the eve of the long-awaited (hard emphasis on "long") release of Hollow Knight: Silksong, the game's marketing lead confirmed that the metroidvania will support 21:9 displays, giving players another option on how to view its gorgeous 2D art.</p><p>Matthew Griffin, the marketing and publishing lead for Silksong, shared four screenshots from the game's PC version in ultrawide format, each showcasing a different biome from the setting of Pharloom. The original Hollow Knight, released in 2017, lacked official 21:9 support.</p><p>Including ultrawide support in a video game is easier said than done--it's a complete change in the game's field of view and resolution. A sidescrolling game like Hollow Knight: Silksong has to take into account the extra view space an ultrawide screen provides that a 16:9 screen won't have, and the developers at Team Cherry would have had to design around it.</p><p>Silksong is launching for all modern platforms, but as ultrawide monitor support is a PC-only feature, it may be the deciding factor for players who own multiple platforms. In the lead-up to the game's launch, Team Cherry shared <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/4473863" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">details about the Nintendo Switch release</a>, confirming that Switch 1 owners can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for free.</p><p>No matter where you play Hollow Knight: Silksong, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-is-cheaper-than-you-might-have-guessed/1100-6534401/" data-ref-id="1100-6534401">it'll be relatively cheap</a>, only going for $20. Xbox owners who subscribe to Game Pass can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6534209/" data-ref-id="1100-6534209">play Silksong on day one</a> at no additional cost.</p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong releases on September 4, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-reviews-probably-arent-going-to-be-ready-for-launch/1100-6534191/" data-ref-id="1100-6534191">don't expect any advance reviews</a> to come out on launch day. But after the infamously long wait for the game, you probably already know whether or not you'll buy it--the question is which platform you'll play it on.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-king-is-watching-it%E2%80%99s-a-very-good-video-game.1287612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's only<a href="https://aftermath.site/9-kings-pc-roguelike-deckbuilder-impressions-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> been a few months since I wrote about the excellent <em>9 Kings</em></a>, a roguelike 'Kingdom Sim' that had you juggling base-building with tower defence. Now I am here to write about another member of the same deeply-specific genre that is also excellent: <em>The King Is Watching</em>.</p><p>The deal here is very similar! You pick a King and make "runs" through the game, unlocking more stuff every time so that your subsequent runs are easier/more interesting. You have to juggle one side of your screen being about building placement, adjacency bonuses and the gathering of resources, while the other has bad guys constantly turning up to try to kill you. It even has a very cool pixel art thing going on.</p><p>But within the confines of that deeply-specific genre, these games are pretty different! Where <em>9 Kings</em> was a very quickfire experience,<em> The King Is Watching</em> is a deeper, more sedate strategy game, with a much wider variety of buildings to choose from, way more resources to gather (and juggle) and more things you can research and trade.</p><figure></figure><p>I'm not saying this to compare them quantitatively (oh, this one has <em>more</em>, so it's <em>better</em>), but to say that the elegance with which <em>The King Is Watching</em> ties everything into its central mechanic–only the limited number of buildings that you're "watching" will generate resources, basically an Eye Of Sauron for a labour force–works a treat. Were this just a resource-gathering x tower defence game on its own, with its pleasant visuals and variety of stuff on offer, I'd probably have had a good time! But having to juggle all that <em>and </em>make sure my buildings are placed in such a way that I can watch certain types at certain times, making sure my "gaze" is powerful enough that it can oversee six buildings instead of three at a time, turns this into my favourite type of chin-scratcher.</p><p>There's no wrong way to play this! But I can't find a right way either. Every game has this wonderful tension to it, where I always feel like I'm doing well enough to survive, but never like I've <em>perfected </em>my build, a constant pull between doing well enough to progress but always feeling like I could do, and learn, <em>more</em>.</p><p>Which is the whole point of a game like this in a genre like this, so...well done, <em>The King Is Watching</em>, you absolutely nailed the brief.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bet-kakegurui-netflix-live-action-anime"><h3>I Unironically Like Netflix’s Live-Action Kakegurui TV Series</h3></a><p>Bet is a fun watch when you don’t have sweaty anime fans breathing down your neck

But its announcement also may have confirmed a major leak for the service — a line-up of games coming to the N64 app (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-latest-switch-online-news-couldve-just-confirmed-a-major-leak/">VGC</a>).</p>

<p>Forsaken's arrival on the Mature app seems to have all-but-confirmed that the other titles spotted above are also coming. You can see the blurred boxes <a href="https://youtu.be/wDNg1pwrTVg?si=A4xAoMBhc0OHgzGx&amp;t=41">at around 0:41</a>.</p>

<p>If true, that's a pretty solid list of games — and given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s release in July, many have been clamouring for DK's other 3D platformer to make its way to the service.</p>
<p>Crucially, of course, nothing is confirmed until Nintendo itself makes the announcement, and we have no idea when we'll actually get these games, <em>if</em> the blurred-out image is to be believed. We'll just have to wait and see...</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can check out Forsaken from tomorrow if you have the Expansion Pack.</p>
<p><em>Do you hope to see DK64, Smash, Glover, and Rayman 2 on NSO soon? Do you see the games in the blurred image? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silent Hill F will be a great showcase of what Unreal Engine 5 can deliver with proper work in terms of image quality and performance, judging from some early impressions.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> revealed that the PC and PlayStation 5 build available during Gamescom last month behind closed doors did an excellent job showing how the engine by Epic is fully capable of delivering clean image quality and stable performance with no stuttering. The game's performance, in particular, sounds impressive for a game powered by the engine, as it ran at stable 60 FPS on base PlayStation and PC, though not at native 4K resolution, with 30 FPS-locked cutscene that still managed to look great thanks to a very good usage of motion blur. Better yet, none of the obnoxiuous stuttering issues too often seen in Unreal Engine 5-powered games were present, which definitely sounds promising. The game looked so clean, without the typical temporal noise seen in other games, and ran so well that it was almost difficult to tell it is powered by Unreal Engine 5, according to Digital Foundry, although a more in-depth look revealed the use of software Lumen which delivers great lighting in the vast majority of scenarios.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's definitely great to hear how Silent Hill F will deliver on the technical front, as it is the first brand new entry in the series to be released as part of Konami's revival of the franchise. It is also set to be among the most unique entry in the series to date, featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-gamescom-onl-2025-trailer/">combat mechanics</a> like dodging and a stamina bar which many thought were influenced by FromSoftware's Souls series. This, however, isn't exactly the case, <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-producer-game-is-not-a-soulslike/">according to producer Motoi Okamoto</a>, as similar mechanics not only were featured in past entries in the series in some form, but they also aren't exclusive to the soulslike genre.</p>



<p>Silent Hill F creeps worldwide on PC and PlayStation 5 on September 25.</p>

            <p>A company backed by the Saudi Arabian government's Public Investment Fund have become the co-owner of the Evolution Championship Series (Evo) fighting game tournament.</p>
<p>Following Sony's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-sells-ownership-stake-in-evo-to-nodwin-gaming">sale of their stake in Evo</a>, with India-based esports company Nodwin gaming buying it up, the event's co-owners have been Nodwin and talent management company RTS. Well, RTS have now been bought by Qiddiya Investment Company, a PIF-backed firm that's also overseeing the building of Qiddiya City as part of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 initiative.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/muhannadaldawood_excited-to-share-that-qiddiya-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-has-activity-7368405316906016770-cYJX/">LinkedIn</a>, Qiddiya's chief strategy officer Muhannad Aldawood called the move "a strategic step that will further strengthen our esports business and unlock new opportunities across the broader gaming ecosystem". He added: "Most importantly, this will enable Qiddiya to keep fueling the continued growth of Evolution Championship Series (EVO), the world’s largest fighting game event since 1996, with unlimited potentials."</p>
<p>As with the array of other games industry-related <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabia-increases-stake-in-electronic-arts">investments</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/snk-saudi-arabias-96-ownership-doesnt-affect-us-in-any-way">acquisitions</a> Saudi PIF and Saudi government-backed firms like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-is-savvy-games-group-and-how-is-it-trying-to-change-saudi-arabias-image">Savvy Games Group</a> have made in recent years, the word of the day is sportswashing. The country's been accused of using videogame investments like these and the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/gaming-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-call-of-duty-ronaldo-b2786237.html">Esports World Cup</a> - as well as paying to host the likes of the 2034 World Cup, WWE events, and the LIV Golf series - as part of efforts to turn around its terrible international reputation.</p><p>A bad reputation Saudi Arabia and bin Salman's regime have earned through an abysmal <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/">human rights record</a> including <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/05/17/lgbtq-death-penalty-idahobit/">state-sanctioned homophobia</a>, the murder of journalist <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">Jamal Kashoggi</a>, and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/08/21/they-fired-us-rain/saudi-arabian-mass-killings-ethiopian-migrants-yemen-saudi">mass killings of migrants</a> at the country's border with Yemen. Invest in things people in other countries already like or follow, and maybe all of that gets buried a bit in the collective consciousness - or so appears to be the goal.</p>
<p>It's not surprising then, that when you visit <a href="https://qiddiya.com/">Qiddiya's website</a>, the first thing you see is big splash about the freshly-built Qiddiya City golf course. "This is the stage on which the Kingdom showcases its rich culture and traditions to the world and the bridge that connects us to the wonderful things the rest of the world has to offer," reads the self-described "PIF company and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/12/04/die-first-and-ill-pay-you-later/saudi-arabias-giga-projects-built-widespread">giga project</a>"'s blurb on culture.</p>
<p>We'll have to see what immediate effects, if any, this ownership change has on Evo. However, as my former VG247 news running mate Connor Makar notes at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">Eurogamer</a>, several prominent members of the Evo/fighting game community have already shared their disapproval or begun looking towards alternative events.</p>
<p>"Not terribly surprising, but still unfortunate news," <a href="https://x.com/ChrisCCH_/status/1963035397988221121">wrote</a> professional Street Fighter player ChrisCCH. "Sad for the LGBTQ+ members of the community, and also worried about the scene becoming increasingly funded by money that will disappear as soon as the funders get bored."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops are miracles of productivity, but they’re limited to just one screen of workspace. Even the big boys with their ultra-sharp 17-inch displays are, well, just one 17-inch display for all of those windows you multitasking mavens want to have open at one time. Reaching the full potential of your laptop or even your tablet requires an extra screen, or maybe even two, and the <strong>Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter </strong>is the perfect tool to make that happen. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/">Even better, it’s just $25 right now in a limited-time Amazon deal</a>.</p>
<p>The Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter requires no extra software or drivers, just plug-and-play with any compatible laptop or tablet with an USB-C port. Windows laptops can be extended to two additional 4K monitors either in mirror mode, with all three screens showing the same image, or extended desktop mode with A-B-B or A-B-C configuration. MacOS laptops can extend to two additional 4K monitors in mirror mode or A-B-B extended desktop mode. Smartphones with a USB-C port can also be connected to a dual-HDMI display.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Huge Configuration Potential</h2>
<p>While the Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter can definitely be thought of as an ideal laptop-to-external monitor device, its capabilities don’t end there. On the USB-C source side of the adapter, compatible tablets and smartphones are also just a plug-and-play connection away from being mirrored onto a much-larger screen. That screen isn’t just limited to HDMI-compatible external monitors, either. TVs and projectors with an HDMI input port are also accessible to your USB-C devices, and without the need for a driver or app.</p>
<p>The potential use for these connections is nearly limitless. The productivity boost of going from one small screen to one small screen and two large 4K screens is obvious. But now instead of having to pass your smartphone or tablet from person to person to show off those pictures and videos you shot on vacation, you can connect your compatible USB-C device to an external monitor, big-screen TV, or projector and put on a show.</p>



<h2>Pocket-Sized Power</h2>
<p>We’ve seen hubs and ports that, while powerful and versatile, are large and/or requiring their own source of AC power. The Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter is anything but bulky. It’s 2 inches by 2.5 inches in size — smaller than a credit card — and just under a half-inch thick. The adapter’s weight is negligible at 1.7 ounces, so you can stick it on your pocket or laptop bag and bring it out anywhere there’s a HDMI-compatible display at the ready.</p>
<p>The Anker name that’s so trusted for charging devices is also a sign of quality for this multi-device adapter. Anker covers the USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter with a worry-free 18-month warranty should anything go wrong. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/">Amazon’s limited-time deal makes this a $25 accessory that guarantees you’ll never look at working on one small screen the same way again.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/reaper-actual-blockchain-developer-why-interview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reaper-actual-has-blockchain-features-and-i-spoke-to-the-developer-to-figure-out-why%E2%80%94interview.1287585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Reaper Actual is an upcoming open-world first-person shooter with persistence. It will one day accommodate hundreds of players on a single server, boast a breathing ecosystem featuring the evolution of time, weather, and factions, and it’s going to be free to play. If that doesn’t sound good enough, consider that it’s designed to be accessible, no matter your skill level.</p>



<p>Well, the first impressions of Reaper Actual are often derailed slightly when prospective fans learn that the game has blockchain and NFT elements built into it. This was a huge concern for me, but since talking to the team at Distinct Possibility Studios at Gamescom, I caught up with them once again to dispel any worries about the NFT mechanics in Reaper Actual.</p>



<p>I’m happy to say that, once I learned how it all works, I’m satisfied it’s not going to be a problem.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview, if you’d rather see it that way:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Reaper Actual's PvPvE(vE) World Explored with Matt Higby - Developer Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-vRol-pTgk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="h-getting-into-the-blockchain-with-reaper-actual">Getting Into the Blockchain with Reaper Actual</h2>



<p>Reaper Actual takes elements from open-world shooters, arcade games like Call of Duty, and extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov. It’s from developers that formerly worked on the likes of PlanetSide and H1Z1, and it’s being designed as an open-ended and ever-evolving game with a rolling meta and customization features out the wazoo.</p>



<p>It’s surprising to some to learn that Reaper Actual also has elements that place the game on the blockchain. I don’t <strong>fully </strong>understand that world, but I know enough to appreciate that, for some gamers, that’s a <strong>huge </strong>red flag.</p>



<p>I sat down with Distinct Possibility Studios co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Matthew Higby, to learn how these NFT mechanics work in Reaper Actual.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The things that you’ll be able to buy, sell… Bases are a good example. You’ll be able to buy a base which will be a unique unit at an address in the game world. You can think of that like an elevator in a high-rise building or the entrance to a bunker facility — multiple people can have bases within that same location, but each one is like a unique fingerprint.</p>



<p>Not only is it unique in terms of what the base by default is, but it also contains all of the upgrades that you do to it as a player over time.</p>



<p>If you levelled up your base to be able to make really good sniper rifles and that represents some number of hours and some number of credits and investments to level your base up, if you decided to sell that base, you could just rip out all those upgrades if you wanted to and get your credits back, but you could just package up the base with the upgrades you’ve installed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Higby’s words, it’s ‘an increase to ownership’ in Reaper Actual, giving players a kind of <strong>financial control </strong>over their bases that they invest time and effort in to build up. While we discussed <strong>bases</strong>, I also learned that <strong>Reapers</strong>, the game’s character models, will be available to list as NFTs after being upgraded and evolved by players.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Another thing you’ll be able to mint and sell are Reapers. As I mentioned, they’re permutationally unique characters that exist within the game. They have a combination of things that can make them situationally attractive for different roles and missions.</p>



<p>Between all of this and their biography, their name, their look, they have a pretty unique combination of things, and it’s just a very easy way to convey that, to allow people to trade those things. It’s with the functionality that you get with an NFT, where it’s just all contained in one cryptographic asset.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-but-are-nfts-optional-in-reaper-actual">But Are NFTs Optional in Reaper Actual?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>As I dove down the rabbit hole with Matt, I learned how <strong>practical </strong>the blockchain mechanics are in Reaper Actual. Players can spend hours building up a base to then sell it to someone who would rather purchase one ready-made than grind themselves to get it. It’s a real estate market in that respect.</p>



<p>Matt explained further:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It makes it feel like it’s something that’s yours, and that’s how we’re trying to lean into NFTs. One of the things that they get maligned on, and people have opinions on all sides of the map about this stuff, is that they tend to be viewed only as this speculative vehicle and the reason they’re in the game is because people want to be doing money stuff with them, or whatever.</p>



<p>In reality, a lot of these mechanics can be utility-granting and utility-oriented, right?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Practical is one thing, but what about optional? Not everyone enjoys the concept of NFTs, and in the gaming world, the term has long been seen as the boogeyman. I asked Matt if you could play Reaper Actual just fine without investing in the blockchain side of things.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Totally, yeah. We’re going to be running the game on Steam, we’re going to be running on Epic, and those environments, it’s going to be completely devoid of the Web3 mechanics. All of the functionality is going to be exactly the same.</p>



<p>There will still be permutationally unique Reapers, you’ll still be able to upgrade and sell your house, you’ll just be using it with a different kind of currency.</p>



<p>What I hope that we can do is show that these blockchain mechanics can be a force for good and not just for greed, and that there’s actually a sort of value that gets unlocked by using them. One thing that is guaranteed to be true about this game is that it’s unlike any other game you’ve played before.</p>



<p>If people really like the feeling of playing one of these peristent world games, then maybe they’ll decide to take the extra step and go try it on the Web3 service if they feel like it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at Distinct Possibility Studios wants to offer the NFT mechanics to those who want them, but it’s not at all critical to the overarching game <strong>experience</strong>.</p>



<p>Everything else that I learned in my deep dive with Matt Higby was more than enough to fill me with serious interest in Reaper Actual, and with an intended release window of Q1 2026, it’s only a matter of time before we can all dive in.</p>



<p>Do you think Reaper Actual is your kind of game? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to spend more on the new James Bond game from the makers of Hitman, you'll apparently be able to. Another Amazon listing reveals a collector's edition that costs $300. There is no word on what may be in the collector's edition to justify the price tag, but the description says the package weighs six pounds. Listings for the $300 edition were discovered for all platforms except Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>Industry experts believe people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, and that it's just a matter of time before higher price points for games become normalized. For now, though, many companies are sticking with $70 for new games (and also offering more expensive premium editions and selling lots of DLC and microtransactions at the same time). </p><p>Mario Kart World was the first major game to jump up to $80, though it is also available within a $500 Switch 2 bundle. Microsoft planned to charge $80 for games this year, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2, but later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">scuttled those plans.</a> For its part, EA has said it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-battlefield-6-coming-ea-reiterates-that-it-has-no-plans-to-charge-80-for-games/1100-6533540/" data-ref-id="1100-6533540">no plans to charge $80 for games</a>, while Rockstar owner <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/" data-ref-id="1100-6533788">Take-Two responded to a question about GTA 6's price</a>, but didn't confirm anything.</p><p>These listings were first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a></p><p>007 First Light is set for release in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC. There have been numerous James Bond video games over the years, of course--including the iconic GoldenEye 007--but 007 First Light is the first to tell an origin story for the world-famous character.</p><p>You'll play as James Bond when he's 26 years old and in the Royal Navy, prior to becoming the British superspy everyone knows today. He gets recruited for MI6 and eventually its elite 00 section.</p><p>The State of Play today, September 3, will showcase 30 minutes of gameplay, showing off Bond taking on his first mission.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158446/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Fans of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/everybodys_golf">Everybody’s Golf</a> have had to twiddle their one-gloved thumbs for a while now, waiting since 2017 for a new official entry in the series. Mashing together the series’ previously regionally distinct names (Everybody’s Golf and Hot Shots Golf), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots</a> has finally stepped up to the tee. Have series newcomers Hyde (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tamagotchi Plaza</a>) hit a hole in one, or is this more like a triple bogey? Well, a bit of both really.</p>
<p>For almost all of its history, Everybody’s Golf was developed by Clap Hanz and published by Sony. Hyde is in the driving seat now, with Bandai Namco on the publishing side, unlocking the series from PlayStation for the first time. However, they’re clearly working from the same playbook, keeping what works best in the series while adding some novel ideas of their own.</p>
<p>The Everybody’s Golf series combines deceptively detailed physics and subtle controls with cartoonish characters. It absolutely works as a pick-up-and-play party game, but equally rewards deeper engagement. The basic controls involve facing where you want the ball to go, then pressing 'A' three times to set power and accuracy.</p>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158442/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That works well for a breezy round of golf, but once you start getting into the intricacies of spin, accounting for the wind, and working with the slopes of the course — and, as your stats develop, exploiting silly shortcuts like using the fairways of other holes, skipping across water, or bouncing along paths — the skill ceiling leaves lots of space to have fun.</p>
<p>Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots follows this formula with gusto. There are more than 25 characters to unlock, and 10 regions on the World Tour. You can now choose a caddy to accompany you on the course – this gives a face to the previously disembodied voices offering encouraging comments after teeing off, putting advice on the green, or squeaks of dismay when you fluff a shot.</p>
<p>The core game mode is Challenge, which sets up short tournaments or versus matches, and winning them levels up and unlocks more courses. World Tour, meanwhile, is a bizarrely story-led setup. Fairly tedious cutscenes present odd tales — a girl seeking stardom, a hostile takeover of a golf theme park — somehow circuitously resulting in the repeated need to play golf. It seems the devs know what they've done here, as the option to turn off all cutscenes is front and centre. Online play makes a return, although no games were available while testing.</p>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158449/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest addition is Wacky Golf, which lets you play with obstacles scattered around the course, play a game stealing your opponents' clubs, or have a round of “boom golf” where your ball may spontaneously explode after any shot, sending it flying in a random direction. These were fun for a bit of multiplayer, but ultimately throwaway. When it comes down to it, the core of the game is well balanced – these quirky ideas only interfere.</p>
<p>For those looking to get deep into the game, a loyalty system lets you develop individual characters by playing as them, unlocking special skills and abilities. You can purchase food, which boosts stats like power or spin, and can be shared across characters, letting you spread progress instead of getting stuck with one overlevelled main. Essentially, you can fatten up one character by feeding them on the winnings of another.</p>
<p>Now, all of this so far would suggest that we have a solid Everybody’s Golf on our hands, and series fans will be all smiles. Here comes the big 'but', and it’s all about performance on Switch. This is a game all about pressing a button at just the right time, and for that you need fluid visual feedback. I felt a lack of smoothness made accuracy suffer. I went back to my PS TV to compare with the 2011 entry in the series and definitely found that to be smoother.</p>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158448/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What’s worse is that using special skills — decorated as they are by fancy graphical effects — dropped the frame rate even further. Those special shots are supposed to get you out of difficult situations, but they’re too risky to be usable on Switch. I tried out Switch 2 and things were noticeably better. However, the overall frame rate was not improved. I got used to it, but the game deserves better.</p>
<p>Even with these performance limitations, trees look simplistic, there’s heavy level-of-detail pop-in, and grass textures are flat. The lighting and colours are nice, with night golf now an option, but I would take just about any visual cut to get smoother performance. One footnote here is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2730810/EVERYBODYS_GOLF_HOT_SHOTS/">Bandai Namco revealed</a> some of the foliage textures were produced using generative AI. Looking at the results, it’s hard to imagine that any added efficiency was worth the loss of cred from using the controversial technology.</p>
<p>The soundscape of the game is chaotic. The swings and strikes and the tuneful rattle of the ball into the cup are all delightful, while the music is like a corny jingle from a Tokyo convenience store. Over the top of everything, your multiple caddies and players make extremely caricatured remarks – often all at the same time. There’s no way on Earth that Hyde didn’t realise how bonkers it all sounds, so you have to take it as a stylistic choice – one that strangely grew on me, I must admit.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots carries on the series traditions with solid courses, a robust character levelling system, and the appropriate level of silliness. However, the experience is uneven on Switch. Fans may enjoy it in short bursts, but technical issues and patchy presentation stop it from being the standout entry it could have been.</p></section>
