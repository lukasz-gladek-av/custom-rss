We already knew they were coming thanks to Gameloft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-includes-tiana-timon-and-pumbaa">most recent roadmap</a>, but Timon and Pumbaa's officially make their <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> debut next Wednesday, 9th October.
</p>
<p>
The Lion King favourites arrive as part of Disney Dreamlight Valley's free Jungle Getaway Update, which has now been detailed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK7qi44pC8s">Gameloft's latest developer video</a>. Timon and Pumbaa will, for instance, initially be encountered in the overhauled Lion King Realm, first introduced when Simba and Nala joined the village life sim last April.
</p>
<p>
This time around, the Lion King Realm is explorable in the daytime, with players joining Timon and Pumbaa on a "relaxing jungle retreat" where they'll "learn valuable lessons in the art forms of rest and relaxation." Once the adventure is complete, Timon and Pumbaa will be available out in the main world, complete with their own Friendship quests and rewards.

<p>
Elsewhere in the Jungle Getaway Update, there's a new battle-pass-like Star Path, this time with a music festival and rock concert-inspired theme. The Night Show Star Path, as it's known, features "rebellious clothing and hairstyles" inspired by Disney villains, Disney princesses, and rock music. It also includes new unlockable elements and furniture to create your own concert stage, including neon lights and pyrotechnics.
</p><p>
And wrapping up October's update are a selection of quality of life improvements, including tweaks for Scrooge McDuck's in-game store. Furniture items, for instance, will now appear in place of any empty clothing displays, and there's a chance for additional Realm decor to arrive in the daily rotation. That's on top of new Edit Mode control schemes, and the ability to add crafting recipes and duties to the onscreen quest tracker.
</p>
<p>
Disney Dreamlight Valley's free Jungle Getaway Update will be available on all platforms when it launches next Wednesday, 9th October.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-shorts-extended/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>YouTube Shorts are about to get longer – which kind of defeats the point, but it’s great news for content creators. It was just announced that YouTube will start supporting longer Shorts as of October 15, taking the maximum duration for a qualifying clip from 60 seconds to 180 seconds.</p>



<p>In an update posted by the platform’s representatives, it was stated that this was a ‘top requested feature by creators’ and that it’ll give users more flexibility to tell their stories.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shorts-getting-long">Shorts Getting Long</h2>



<p>It’s likely the beginning of the end in terms of growth and evolution. TikTok started by allowing users to record and upload clips just a minute or two in duration, and now, you can upload videos that last <strong>one hour </strong>on the platform. It’s a bit odd because the majority of users these days want short, sharp, and entertaining content.</p>



<p>But hey, the longer the video, the more ad revenue and earning opportunities for creators, so it’s not all bad.</p>



<p>For the longest time, YouTube Shorts have accommodated a 60-second limit, but as of October 15, that’s set to change, with YouTube boosting the duration limit to 180 seconds. Here’s what the team said in a release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Longer Shorts, more of you. Starting on October 15, you can upload Shorts up to 3 minutes long. This was a top requested feature by creators, so we’re excited to give you more flexibility to tell you story. This change applies to videos that are square or taller in aspect ratio, and won’t affect any videos you uploaded before October 15. And we’ll be working to improve recommendations for longer Shorts in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Content creators looking for more avenues along which to diversify their portfolio will swoon at this change. It’s another angle for them to try making a few dollars by uploading content. There’s quite a difference in how regular YouTube videos and YouTube Shorts are monetised, but they’re lucrative enough even for small creators.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a solid change? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft's efforts to improve the Star Wars Outlaws experience continue today with arrival of its newest update, this time promising further stealth tweaks, speeder improvements, performance and stability optimisations, and more.
</p>
<p>
Title Update 1.2, as the latest update is officially known, weight in at 3.8GB on PS5, 4.71GB on Xbox Series X/S, and 5.6GB on PC. Its primary goal, according to Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1Kq2ABlTdHgkdbGRQZ20he">release notes</a>, is "improving the camera on your speeder and its responsiveness", as well as "other tweaks to ensure your adventures are smoother and more rewarding."
</p>
<p>
Top of its list of notable changes, though, are those aforementioned stealth tweaks. Star Wars Outlaws' previous Title Update 1.1.2 already made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-patch-to-fix-incredibly-punishing-stealth-sections-is-now-live">some initial changes</a> to the games's stealth sequences - which  director Julian Gerighty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-punishing-stealth-sequences-will-soon-be-easier">acknowledged</a> were "unfair" and "incredibly punishing" shortly after launch - but Title Update 2 seems to take things further.

<p>
Ubisoft says it's adjusted AI detection to improve stealth, as well as the number of NPCs and their positioning, patrol pathing, and camera detection. Additionally, it mentions "highlighting environmental opportunities to reduce player friction." That's on top of various much-requested speeder enhancements, including camera improvements when FOV is increased, improved response and reaction when the speeder is called, plus better environmental collision to reduce the likelihood of players being knocked off the speeder during travel.
</p><p>
Elsewhere, stability and performance improvements are promised across all platforms, Kay's movement animations have been enhanced, and various progress-impacting issues have been fixed, including one that would cause players to get stuck in the hyperjump sequence towards Kijimi. The full list of fixes is considerably more expansive - Kay, for instance, now closes the correct eye while aiming down sights - and you'll find them in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1Kq2ABlTdHgkdbGRQZ20he">Ubisoft's patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Outlaws hasn't, of course, been the unmitigated success Ubisoft was hoping for. Last month, the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">admitted</a> the game's launch had been "softer than expected", a situation it was hoping to remedy with a "series of updates to polish and improve the player experience in order to engage a large audience during the holiday season". 
</p>
<p>
Today's Title Update 2 is just one part of that plan, with future content set to include Star Wars Outlaws' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-lando-calrissian-story-dlc-gets-november-release-date">first bit of post-launch story DLC</a>, starring Lando Calrissian, on 21st November. That's alongside continued work on "optimisation, gameplay polishing, and tweaks, as well as quality of life changes includes adjustments to combat and stealth gameplay".
</p>
<p>
Whether Ubisoft can turn Star Wars Outlaws' fortunes around in time for the holidays (or at all) remains to be seen; Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell felt the experience was fundamentally flawed when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">reviewed it back in August</a>, awarding it two out of five stars.

In Sid Meier’s <em>Civilization 7</em>, such flights of historical fantasy can become historical fact. The game has new ages to experience, new civilizations to build up, new leaders to guide them, and — for the first time in franchise history — the ability to mix and match leaders and civilizations to build the empire of your wildest dreams. <em>The Verge</em> had the opportunity to test out the game and talk with its developers at Firaxis Games. The brief, three-hour demo wasn’t enough time to get a feel for how well leaders and different civilizations work together, but I left feeling excited about all the ways <em>Civilization VII</em> aims to change the course of history.&nbsp;</p><p>In previous <em>Civilization </em>games, civs were always tied to a specific leader who was usually, but not always, a noteworthy head of state. Later iterations of the game offered multiple leaders for civs, and on a couple of occasions where it made historical sense, one leader could straddle multiple civs like France and England both having access to Eleanor of Aquitaine, who, during her unusually-long-for-the-time-period life, was the queen of both countries.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-86197c61-7f6e-4283-a3d2-bd8bbbe6fea2"><div><p>Here are the PC requirements for Civilization 7.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471">Check ‘em out</a> to see if your PC can run the game when it comes out on February 11th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-latest-expansion-wiped-out-some-guilds-inventories-seemingly-for-good-and-players-are-furious<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>World of Warcraft's latest expansion, The War Within, has been out for over a month now, and things are going great. Critics and players are largely happy with all the new content additions, the new Delve feature appears to finally be appropriately balanced, and the Race to World First was a real fun nail-biter.</p><p>But there's been one major, glaring issue with The War Within simmering since a pre-launch patch that's frustrated hundreds of players, with seemingly no fix in sight: the disappearance of thousands of items from guild banks, seemingly never to be returned.</p><h3>The Great Guild Bank Caper</h3><p>Issues began on August 13 with Patch 11.0.2, which dropped a number of updates to the game ahead of the release of the latest expansion, The War Within. In the following days, players began flocking to the official community forums, Reddit, and other community spaces to report a strange and upsetting issue: tons of items seemed to be missing from their guild banks.</p><p>While initially some players suspected thieving guild members or some sort of visual bug, as more reports came in, the reality became increasingly clear. Without warning, hundreds of guilds had seen massive amounts of items sitting inside their banks wiped out by the 11.0.2 patch with seemingly no rhyme or reason. Not every guild was impacted, nor did every impacted guild lose every item, but many reported half, two-thirds, or even the entire contents of their banks vanishing. Individuals who used guild banks as personal storage reported losing the accumulated riches of several years playing WoW. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Blizzard Game Review</h3></div></output><p>For some guilds, the extent of the damage was difficult to track at all. According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1euiumg/guild_banks_missing_items/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">player reports</a>, the in-game "logs" of guild bank withdrawals and deposits did not reflect massive amounts of items being taken out, leaving those who were less active stewards of their guild banks struggling to remember what had even been in there in the first place.</p><h3>Blizzard Responds</h3><p>As reports flooded in over several weeks, players became increasingly frustrated by Blizzard's lack of public response to the issue. Informal player surveys found that it was impacting hundreds of players and guilds, with likely far more going unreported, so it seemed unusual for the developer to remain silent for so long on what seemed to be such a massive problem.</p><p>Finally, after over a month, <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/guild-bank-missing-items-update/1963451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blizzard issued a response </a>explaining what had occurred. Per Blizzard, "a technical update that was made to support cross-realm guilds" encountered an unexpected bug that "caused one of our maintenance processes to make some items disappear." Blizzard claims this mainly impacted items "related to professions materials from prior expansions" but acknowledged other items had disappeared as well. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The result will be an incomplete restoration for some guilds, and we do not have a way to restore the remaining missing items.</p></div><p>In response, Blizzard said that it had been "packing up the missing items that we’re able to identify as lost by this process, and we will soon mail those to the guild leader character for each affected guild." But there was a catch. "Due to how some of the data was lost, we’ve reached a point where the result will be an incomplete restoration for some guilds, and we do not have a way to restore the remaining missing items for them." The developer apologized for both the incomplete restoration and the long wait.</p><p>While on its face this seemed to be a positive resolution to a frustrating situation, relief quickly turned to anger as players realized exactly how "incomplete" the "incomplete restoration" would be.</p><h3>Incomplete Restoration</h3><p>In the weeks since, players have been sharing the results of the "incomplete restoration" of their guild banks, and it doesn't look good. Some guild leaders are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fmkbl4/a_tiny_fraction_of_everything_i_lost_due_to_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showing off</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fm2lcg/a_guild_bank_beforeafter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before and after</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1flqk73/out_of_7_full_guild_tabs_wiped_this_is_all_that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshots</a> of their banks, claiming to still be missing hundreds of items worth thousands of in-game gold. Some are reporting restorations that are insulting or even humorous, such as one person claiming they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1flqk73/comment/lo5es58/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received a single piece of silk</a> in the mail, or another who only got a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fm7p7l/i_think_i_might_win_the_award_for_spookiest_guild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bunch of Halloween-themed items</a> back. Some are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1foaz2k/my_guild_of_13_years_lost_every_item_and_not_even/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing stories of collections</a> they spent years building being completely wiped out with nothing restored. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fr08m1/i_feel_bad_for_my_friend_regarding_the_guild_bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One player claims</a> their friend, a 72-year-old woman, lost an entire guild bank's worth of pets, toys, mounts, and other items she was giving out as gifts to new players. Others have noted that since Blizzard's item restoration is sending items to guild leaders via in-game mail, any guild whose leader is inactive won't receive any of its items back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Still others are bringing up the fact that since the introduction of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/07/the-wow-token-is-now-live">WoW Token</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fodlt9/the_guild_bank_thanos_snap_should_get_more_outrage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-game items essentially have an equivalent value in real-world money</a>. "Would you accept your bank to "whoopsie" your savings account, replace it with a fraction of what it had, and have the end all be called an "incomplete restoration"?" they wrote.</p><p>There are some players who are coming to Blizzard's defense. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fodlt9/comment/lopm6fb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Several commenters have pointed out</a> the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fodlt9/comment/lopm6fb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sheer scale of what went missing</a> makes it very likely that Blizzard is telling the truth about its own ability to restore missing items, and there's really no good way to determine who is owed what even with data backups. But even players who acknowledge Blizzard's in an impossible spot are still frustrated by the loss of sometimes years' worth of progress, savings, and work, and concerned that further mass item deletions may happen in the future. It's an unfortunate black mark on what is otherwise a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review">very well-received expansion</a>, and an unfortunate weird side effect of the addition of a long-asked for feature (cross-realm guilds).</p><p>"It's heart crushing, and it's hard to play the game, even though this was stuff we could play without technically, it was about getting others what they need and would enjoy," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fodlt9/comment/loplodt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said one player</a>. "It took a lot of the enjoyment out of the expansion for leadership of my guild."</p><p>IGN reached out to Blizzard for further comment as to how this happened or if the company plans to take any further actions to restore lost items, but did not receive a reply in time for publication. We will update if and when we receive a response.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

We do surveys and everything, we do market research. We don’t wanna just make something, we wanna make something we honestly believe that the players to their core will enjoy, and that drives our decisions.”</p><p>The interview was published this week but conducted prior to the latest controversy to hit <em>MTG</em>: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-commander-banned-cards-wizards-1851661288?_gl=1*bi4a5f*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzk4NDUzNi4xMjQuMS4xNzI3OTg2MTY4LjUuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-commander-banned-cards-wizards-1851661288?_gl=1*bi4a5f*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzk4NDUzNi4xMjQuMS4xNzI3OTg2MTY4LjUuMC4w">the banning of several powerful cards in its popular Commander format</a></span>.

<p>The Vice President of the Rainbow 6 franchise, Cameron Lee, has left the franchise and Ubisoft.</p>



<p>Cameron Lee joined the Rainbow 6 brand in April 2022 after working as Vice President of Production at Activision but had previously had over 20 years of experience as a producer, manager, and VP at companies including EA, Bungie, and BioWare, and has worked on such franchises as Tony Hawk, Call of Duty, and Dragon Age.</p>



<p>Following the announcement to join the Rainbow 6 franchise, Ubisoft said that Lee “will be responsible for creating the long-term brand strategy for the Rainbow Six franchise and aligning and collaborating with all internal partners.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear why Lee decided to leave the franchise and the company, but an internal email sent to staff reads, “For the time being, the role of VP and Executive Producer for the Rainbow Six brand will not be replaced.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming asked Ubisoft for comment on Lee’s departure but has not received a comment.</p>

<p>Motorsport Games, the studio behind Le Mans Ultimate and other racing video games, has had another round of layoffs. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming first learned of the layoffs earlier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikestrawmedia.com/post/3l5mr2bpput25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Thursday</a> across the studio’s social media and marketing departments, but couldn’t confirm the number of employees that were impacted. <a href="https://traxion.gg/le-mans-ultimate-hangs-in-the-balance-as-studio-hit-by-further-redundancies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Traxion</a>, which was formerly owned by Motorsport Games, reports that 10 employees were let go in the latest round. Insider Gaming has since been able to corroborate that the number is “around there”, per sources.</p>



<p>After talks of layoffs began, a brand and marketing manager for the company took to social media to confirm that he had been “made redundant from Studio 397 and Motorsport Games due to further reductions in the workforce.”</p>



<h2 id="h-why-more-layoffs-at-motorsport-games">Why More Layoffs At Motorsport Games?</h2>



<p>As far as why the layoffs are taking place, Insider Gaming understands that the studio has continued to struggle to find investors to help fund the company. Multiple sources have said that the company has continued to look for various funding opportunities, but nothing substantial has been achieved yet.</p>



<p>“They’re trying, but they need more than what they’re getting,” said one source. “The goal remains to release Le Mans Ultimate on console in the future.”</p>



<p>Motorsport Games is scheduled to hole a  “Special Meeting of Stockholders” on October 25 in Miami, Florida. As part of the meeting, they will hold a vote to approve a purchase of up to 949,310 shares of Motorsport Games Class A Common Stock. Should that deal be approved and the company sell all of the aforementioned shares, it could bring in roughly $1.5 million in funding based on the current market price of Motorsport Games shares.</p>



<p>In October 2023, Motorsport Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-announces-new-console-game-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold the license to NASCAR</a> to iRacing. Not long after, the company also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indycar-terminates-agreement-with-motorsport-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost the license</a> to the Indy Car game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-indycar-game-status-up-in-the-air-at-motorsport-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been in development</a>. </p>



<p>Motorsport Games has yet to respond to multiple requests for comment from Insider Gaming on the layoffs and status of the company.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-graces-f-dev-talks-about-tales-of-the-abyss-remaster-possibilities-and-the-future-of-the-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A beloved RPG series celebrated its 30th anniversary.</h2></div><section><p>Bandai Namco recently announced Tales of Graces f Remastered as the first title in the Tales Remastered Project, celebrating the Tales of 30th anniversary. We both got to go hands-on with Tales of Graces f Remastered and speak with the game’s producer, Yuki Ishikawa, who talked to us about the series’ future and the possibility of a Tales of Abyss Remake. </p><p>First, we asked why Tales of Graces f Remastered was chosen as the first title in the Tales of Remastered Program. One, Graces f is one of the more beloved titles of Tales of, Ishikawa said. It’s especially heralded for its battle system. Two, it was just “good timing to make this a remastered title.” </p><p>What Ishikawa means by “good timing” in this moment is related to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-arise-review">Tales of Arise’s wide, positive reception</a> not just within Japan, but with the overseas audience as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“When the team is thinking of what comes next for us, if they were to bring up something that is like a 2D pixel kind of game that was only on a Famitsu console the last time, there would be a huge gap between people who have liked Tales of Arise and then with that kind of content,” Ishikawa explained.</p><p>And three, the original version of Tales of Graces f had only four languages, so with a remaster, the Tales team is able to bring Tales of Graces f to a wider audience with more language options. This is especially true considering Graces f has been “stuck” on the PS3, at least over in the West, since its initial release here in 2012. Tales of Graces f Remastered is being released on pretty much all platforms–Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, <em>and</em> PC.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If [a Tales of the Abyss remaster] could happen and I could share that joy with the rest of the fans, that’s something I’ll work hard towards</p></div><p>“In the past there were certain titles that were platform exclusive, but as of this moment and in terms of the current direction of the Tales of team, they're not looking to have the title or any upcoming titles to be platform exclusive,” Ishikawa explained. “We want to bring Tales Of to a wider audience. So we think one of the ways is by having it available on as many platforms as possible.” </p><p>Of course, there’s more to come after Tales of Graces f Remastered. </p><p>Personally, Ishikawa is a fan of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/11/tales-of-the-abyss-review">Tales of the Abyss</a>, and quoted it as one of the reasons why he entered the company [Bandai Namco]. “If [a Tales of the Abyss remaster] could happen and I could share that joy with the rest of the fans, that’s something I’ll work hard towards,” Ishikawa said. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Tales of Graces f Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“The goal for the Tales of IP in general is to make the IP grow,” Ishikawa explained. “So it’s not to say that the Tales of series is going to end with Tales of Arise…So whether there is an entirely new title, whether it’s a remaster, whether it’s a remake, we can’t say for sure, but we definitely want to keep moving forward.” </p><p>For more on Tales, don’t miss our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-hands-on-a-tasteful-modernization-of-a-classic-rpg">Tales of Graces f Remastered Hands-on preview</a>.</p><p><em>Casey DeFreitas is IGN's Deputy Guides Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That's a great price for a 10,000mAh power bank with USB-C output that can fast charge a Nintendo Switch at its maximum rate. Baseus hasn't been long around enough to develop the same reputation as Anker, but its power banks have been steadily racking up favorable reviews and recommendations. They are also less expensive than an equivalent Anker model.</p><h2>Baseus 10,000mAh USB Type-C Power Bank for $11.99</h2><div id="187616" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Baseus 10,000mAh 20W Portable Charger</h3></p></div><p>If you're looking for a good power bank to complement your Nintendo Switch, then a 10,000mAh power bank is the perfect balance between size and battery capacity. This Baseus power bank measures 6" long and 2.7" wide, about the same size as an iPhone 14 Pro, and weighs in at only 7 ounces. With a 10,000mAh capacity, this power bank can completely charge a Nintendo Switch or Switch OLED around 1.5 to 2 times, even if you factor in approximately 80% power efficiency.</p><p>The Baseus power bank has three ports. The USB-C port serves as both output and input, the USB Type-A port is output only, and the Micro USB port is input only. The USB-C port features up to 18W of Power Delivery. Coincidentally, the Nintendo Switch and Switch OLED accept a maximum charging rate of 18W, so this power bank can charge your Switch as fast as the OEM wall charger. Not only does that shorten the time it takes to charge your Switch, you'll also be able to play games while charging without draining the battery. The Baseus power bank is UL certified and comes with built-in safety protections you'd expect from a decent quality power bank. There's no digital display, but it does feature an LED battery indicator that you can check with a press of a button.</p><h2>TSA-Approved</h2><p>Note that the TSA requires all power banks to be brought in carry-on bags; <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/power-banks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power banks are not allowed in check-in</a> regardless of capacity. The Baseus power bank's 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit, so it can be brought onto planes. It's also low-profile enough that no one will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage on your power bank, you're well in the clear.</p><p>For more options, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger">best power banks of 2024</a>.

Whether you're thinking about buying (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-save-30-on-the-dlc-and-get-bonus-in-game-content/1100-6526803/" data-ref-id="1100-6526803">at a discount</a>) or playing Shattered Space or you want to know how far along you are in your current playthrough, knowing how long it takes to beat the DLC is worthwhile knowledge.</p><p>Below, you can see a rough estimate of how long it takes to beat Shattered Space as well as a full quest list.</p><h2>How long to beat Starfield Shattered Space</h2><p>As with any game or expansion, the time it ultimately takes you to get through Shattered Space is reliant on a few different factors. First and foremost, your time to beat the DLC mainly depends on how much exploring you do on Va'ruun'kai, the new planet where the entirety of the expansion takes place. If you simply blow through the main story without taking part in side content or outside exploration, you'll have a much shorter overall playtime.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4378512-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.10.02-16.15.23.28.png" data-ref-id="1300-4378512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4378512-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.10.02-16.15.23.28.png" data-ref-id="1300-4378512"></a><figcaption>Shattered Space takes place on a new planet with fresh characters and items. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4378512-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.10.02-16.15.23.28.png"></figure><p>That said, the entire main story in Shattered Space takes roughly <strong>eight hours</strong> to get through. This assumes you're not dying repeatedly, make one choice per quest and stick with it, and run from quest to quest without doing anything else. If you're on a higher difficulty level or reload saves to see the outcomes of different choices in certain quests, <strong>your overall playtime can be bumped to close to 10 hours</strong>.</p><p>In addition to the main story, there are 11 total side quests available to complete on Va'ruun'kai in Shattered Space. Some of these quests are shorter, but others are longer, so completing all of them will take around <strong>seven hours</strong>. Once again, this assumes you're not reloading too many saves or dying frequently. Your playtime could also be bumped up trying to locate and start all seven side quests, as some of them require you to visit different locations on Va'ruun'kai outside of Dazra.</p><p>All in all, if you complete the main story, find and finish all seven side quests, and do some exploration on Va'ruun'kai, you can expect to put in anywhere from <strong>15-20 hours</strong> in Shattered Space.</p><h2>Starfield Shattered Space full mission list</h2><p>Below, you can see all of the main story missions and side quests that are available in Shattered Space.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dedicated-fan-compiles-over-1000-pages-of-dungeons-dragons-lost-content<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A trove of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> lost content has been compiled. Thanks to one dedicated fan of the world's most popular TTRPG, hundreds of pages of supplements believed lost forever to the internet have been restored in a single convenient compendium.</p>
<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Lost Content Compendium</h2>
<p>According to a news report from <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/3.5e-web-compendium">Wargamer</a>, the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> lost content compendium is the work of Reddit user u/Yawgmothlives. The user has been collecting free support material published by Wizards of the Coast for 3.5 edition of the fantasy TTRPG.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-lost-content-the-orchard-screenshot.jpg?itok=E5pUPVSK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-lost-content-the-orchard-screenshot.jpg?itok=7hM-o8hU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This material has been either made inaccessible, either intentionally removed or no longer supported by the official <em>D&amp;D</em> website in July 2014. This material includes extra abilities for certain classes, new monster statblocks, dozens of new spells, adventure locations, and additional content for previously published <em>D&amp;D</em> books.</p>
<p>This collection of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> lost content has been called The Web Compendium. It contains 1,281 pages in total and is available for all players and TTRPG historians to enjoy via a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yt5r79daqnky372lo9lcf/The-Web-Compendium.pdf?rlkey=h2u2vsh4lovdgxbgfnkjds1kf&amp;e=2&amp;st=f9tdxb9w&amp;dl=0">dropbox link</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, Yawgmothlives' endeavor is a noble one in terms of media preservation. <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 3.5 edition was the second-most popular edition of the game, and still has a special place in the hearts of many players. Its the ruleset that <em>D&amp;D's</em> biggest competitor, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, used as its foundation.</p>
<p>Because this material was only available online, it has been subject to turbulent changes when it comes to accessibility and ownership. It is a challenge certain sites like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/internet-archive-loses-hachette-books-case-appeal/">Internet Archive</a> are actively struggling with.</p>
<p>But now, thanks to the dedicated work of one fan, this Dungeons &amp; Dragons lost content is now readily available again. Dive into the Epic Insights of the iconic <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>. See the danger and the allure of the succubus paladin. Or perhaps dive into the eclectic power of the obscure psionic classes.</p>

                <p>It's the start of a new month, and Fanatical is kicking things off with the October 2024 edition of its Platinum Collection bundle deal. Like other Fanatical build-your-own bundle promotions, customers select from a list of games to create their own batch of discounted PC games. This month's bundle has 18 games to pick from, with various genres represented, including first-person shooters, RPGs, 3D platformers, horror games, and more. Every game is available for super cheap, and the more games you add to your bundle, the better the deal gets. Some of the items include multiple games, such as Stalker Complete Collection.</p><p>Pricing starts at three games for $10 ($3.33 per key), but if you pick at least five games, the price drops to just $3 per key, and at seven or more games, you'll pay just $2.86 per game. There's no limit to how many games you can grab, meaning you could add all 18 games to your bundle and pay just $51.48 total.</p><p>There are some pretty good games to choose from here, including several hidden gems you might have missed, including the open-world first-person shooter <strong>Rage 2</strong>. Developed by Avalanche Studios as a sequel to id Software's 2011 shooter, Rage 2 is a bloody post-apocalyptic game featuring over-the-top sci-fi weapons and a vast ruined landscape to explore in giant vehicles.</p><p>Another great game to add to your bundle is <strong>No Straight Roads</strong>. This one has a great aesthetic and killer tracks to tap your feet to as you explore the world of Vinyl City, a musical metropolis under the control of an oppressive EDM empire. This is also the Encore Edition of the game that throws in a ton of extra content and gameplay tweaks. If you're a fan of games like Hi-Fi Rush, this is one to grab for your collection.</p><p>Other recommendations from the list include the sprawling sci-fi/fantasy RPG <strong>Edge of Eternity</strong>, the psychological horror game <strong>Ad Infinitum</strong>, and the <strong>Stalker Complete Bundle</strong>, which is perfect for anyone wanting to catch up on the series before Heart of Chernobyl launches November 20. Stalker fans will also want to check out <strong>Tunguska: The Visition</strong>, which is a top-down survival shooter that draws heavy inspiration from the Stalker series. That's just a few of the titles you can grab, so be sure to check the list below for the full lineup of games on offer in Fanatical's October 2024 Platinum Collection.</p><p>For a few more game bargains, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atlus-rpgs-get-massive-price-cuts-ahead-of-metaphor-refantazios-release/1100-6526861/">all the Atlus JRPGs that got a discount</a> before the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-preorder-guide-collectors-edition/1100-6522856/">Metaphor ReFantazio</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/snag-8-games-including-remnant-2-and-persona-5-strikers-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month/1100-6526858/">all of the great games you can get for $12</a> in this month's Humble Choice bundle, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-has-big-discounts-on-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-more-square-enix-games/1100-6526819/">Amazon has some big deals on Square Enix games</a> currently.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><h3>Build your own Platinum Collection (October 2024)</h3><ul><li>Ad Infinitum (Steam Deck playable)</li><li>Asterix and Obelix: Slap Them All! 2</li><li>Creepy Tale Quad Pack</li><li>Despot's Game: Dystopian Battle Simulator (Steam Deck verified)</li><li>Edge Of Eternity (Steam Deck verified)</li><li>Jawbreaker (Steam Deck playable)</li><li>KeyWe (Steam Deck playable)</li><li>Necrosmith 2 (Steam Deck playable)</li><li>No Straight Roads: Encore Edition (Steam Deck verified)</li><li>Rage 2</li><li>The Repair House: Restoration Sim</li><li>The Smurfs 2: The Prisoner of the Green Stone</li><li>Stalker Complete Bundle</li><li>Tormented Souls (Steam Deck verified)</li><li>Tunguska: The Visitation - Enhanced Edition (Steam Deck verified)</li><li>Vividlope</li><li>Witching Hour</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-discounts-region-free-copies-of-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/1100-6526781/">Amazon Discounts Region-Free Copies Of The Legend Of Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-preorder-release-date-bonuses-editions/1100-6526687/">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorders Are Up To $20 Off On PC</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games/1100-6526741/">Nintendo Switch Exclusives Get Huge Limited-Time Discounts, Including Zelda And Mario Games</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-shadow-box-discontinued-get-the-elaborate-4000-piece-batcave-before-its-gone/1100-6526776/">Lego Batman Shadow Box Discontinued - Get The Elaborate Batcave Before It's Gone</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/attack-on-titan-steelbooks-holiday-anime-gift-idea/1100-6526622/">Attack On Titan Steelbook Editions Get Big Preorder Price Cuts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mario-red-nintendo-switch-oled-is-back-in-stock-with-a-big-discount-at-amazon/1100-6526568/">Super Mario-Themed Nintendo Switch OLED Drops To Best Price Yet At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-now-has-a-deckbuilding-card-game/1100-6526544/">Avatar: The Last Airbender Now Has A Deckbuilding Card Game</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>I miss the height of Wordle mania not because of the game itself, which I still play on occasion, but because of the torrent of delightful, experimental browser-based puzzle games that followed in its wake. Worldle, Octordle, Moviedle, Waffle, Who Are Ya?, Cloudle and many, many more were a gold rush of bandwagon jumpers I was fully onboard with.
</p>
<p>Scrambled Maps takes me back to those good old days. It bears little relation to Wordle, but it is a browser-based puzzle game that offers one new challenge each day, and it is just as delightful a distraction.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The challenge is simple: a map of a part of the world has been sliced into 18 squares of equal size, and scrambled. You must reconstruct them, piecing together a jigsaw of roads and rivers, train lines and place names.
</p>
<p>This is more difficult than it may first seem. Maps have no edges, no corners, no blue sky, no easy footholds familiar to dedicated dissectologist. Instead you match coloured roads, building complexes and green fields, then look closer at road shapes and writing.
</p><p>In completing my first puzzle, I found tile after tile that linked together, but found it more difficult to position those tiles within the broader image. Did two tiles, which clearly fit together, go in the top right, the bottom left, the middle, or...? It was only after 25 minutes when I realised that I had constructed the map perfectly, but in two reversed halves: the nine tiles on the left belonged on the right, and vice versa. 
</p>
<p>As I fixed that issue, placing each tile in its correct position, a green border appeared around each one. Ah. The game confirms correct answers as you play. Useful.
</p>
<p>Like Wordle, no Scrambled Map seems truly difficult, only more or less time consuming. Like Wordle, it would be easy to cheat with a visit to OpenStreetMap (the source of the map data) or Google Maps. In any case, like Wordle, I'm hooked, and eagerly awaiting each new day's puzzle.
</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.tripgeo.com/scrambledmaps">play Scrambled Maps here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
