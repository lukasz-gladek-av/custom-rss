You can also grab the Deluxe version, including a digital art book and digital mini-soundtrack, for $59.99 (or your local equivalent). Most notably, this limited time offer includes Final Fantasy VII - as in "a ported version of the original game" that was made available on the eShop in 2019.</p>
<p>The standalone copy of FFVII on the eShop is currently priced at $15.99, so this bonus in Remake's early purchase edition is worth a look if you don't already own it. Here's what else is included with this purchase, according to Nintendo's store page:</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/activision-unveils-warzone-resurgence-series/</link>
            <guid>1413973</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has lifted the lid on a massive Call of Duty: Warzone tournament circuit dubbed ‘Resurgence Series’. The new ecosystem boasts a massive prize pool worth $1.2 million and will unfold through 2026, culminating in a Championship event at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>This is set to replace the World Series of Warzone, throwing players into the small-form, fast-paced maps, as opposed to the larger, traditional battle royale experiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-has-a-new-esports-circuit">Warzone Has a New Esports Circuit</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://callofduty.worldseriesofwarzone.com/resurgence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent release</a>, Activision detailed the all-new Resurgence Series, a grand event set to turn around some gamers’ fortunes in 2026. It starts with online qualifiers that begin on February 9th, which will feed players into the first LAN event at DreamHack Birmingham in late March in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>Following that event, a second qualifying stage starts, this time with players competing at DreamHack Atlanta in May. From these two LAN events, a selection of teams will qualify for the Esports World Cup <strong>directly</strong>. Another 22 spots will remain open for the Esports World Cup Qualifiers, set to be hosted in June ahead of the ultimate tournament in July in Riyadh.</p>



<p>The prize pool will be split accordingly:</p>



<ul>
<li>DreamHack Birmingham: $100,000</li>



<li>DreamHack Atlanta: $100,000</li>



<li>Esports World Cup: $1,000,000</li>
</ul>



<p>This is a trios-based tournament that uses the traditional kill race format, with players earning points for kills and getting boosted multipliers for higher finishes during each round.</p>



<p>For a while, fans have been sceptical about the future of Warzone’s esports ecosystem. It has been rocky for a couple of years now, but this new diverse approach that has spawned more LAN events at some of the biggest showcases in the business has pro players enthused.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-23-957/</link>
            <guid>1413970</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Welcome to the end of another long week, and the introduction of a fresh round of NYT Connections hints and solutions. Today’s puzzle is a tough one, but that’s why I’m here to help you out. Before we roll into the weekend, let’s see if we can keep your streak running for a little while longer.</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions in just a few seconds.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-23">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 23)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #957:</p>



<ul>
<li>STONE</li>



<li>TEMPLE</li>



<li>PILOT</li>



<li>LIP</li>



<li>STREET</li>



<li>CHEEK</li>



<li>FOOT</li>



<li>TRAFFIC</li>



<li>EYE</li>



<li>ACRE</li>



<li>FLOOD</li>



<li>METER</li>



<li>GARAGE</li>



<li>LIME</li>



<li>BUSHEL</li>



<li>VALET</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about parts of the face you’d point to during a game of “Simon Says.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Different ways you might leave your car depending on the situation</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> Old‑school measurements still used in certain countries.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each one forms a common compound phrase when placed before the word <em>light</em>.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 23:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-23-957">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 23 (#957)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHEEK, EYE, LIP, TEMPLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – GARAGE, METER, STREET, VALET</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ACRE, BUSHEL, FOOT, STONE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FLOOD, LIME, PILOT, TRAFFIC</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>No use holding back when faced with the Dark Devil himself, as he'll show you no mercy with his array of devastatingly powerful throws!</p>
<p>Alex can be purchased individually with Fighter Coins and the owners of the Year 3 Character Pass / Ultimate Pass will automatically get access to Alex when he releases.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted above, Alex is available as part of the Season 3 Character Pass DLC, or you can purchase him separately with Fighter Coins. Capcom also offers in-game rentals, where you can try out a character for one hour before purchasing them.</p>
<p>This character steps into the ring on <strong>17th March 2026</strong> and is joined by the already available characters Sagat and C.Viper, with Ingrid up next.</p>
<p>Capcom has also managed to secure one of the "biggest names in the anime song universe" JAM Project - which has contributed to this original BGM track "Go! Alex! Hope is Born! - Alex's Theme". You can listen and sing along to the full song in the YouTube upload below:</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-explains-fables-new-reputation-based-morality/</link>
            <guid>1413880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The morality system in the Fable reboot sets out to reflect our own world.</p>



<p>Playground Games’ reboot of the Fable franchise was the centerpiece of the Xbox Developer_Direct on January 22, 2026. In the wake of that presentation, Playground’s founder, Ralph Fulton, spoke with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/fable-interview-overview-details-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a> about the game’s direction.</p>







<h2 id="h-morality-is-a-sliding-scale-in-fable">Morality Is a Sliding Scale in Fable</h2>



<p>When discussing upgrading the classic morality system for the modern era, Fulton explains that the team wanted the way people view morality in everyday life to be reflected in the game’s system.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>How we think about morality in the world today has really informed how we wanted to represent it as a game system in this game. That’s to say: there is no objective good, there is no objective evil. Really it’s just about people’s subjective opinions and what they choose to value in someone else when they make that judgment.</p>



<p>So, as you saw in Developer_Direct, our version of morality isn’t a sliding scale – we’ve chosen to anchor this around the actions you do, and specifically the things you do in Albion that are witnessed by at least one other person. So, if the things you do are seen by one or more people, you’ll start to earn a reputation for that thing. Obviously, we always use the chicken kicking example, because kicking chickens is classic Fable.</p>



<p>So if a person sees you kicking a chicken, you will start to get a reputation as a ‘Chicken Chaser’ – and if enough people see you do it, or you do it a lot, that reputation will become one of the things you’re known for in that settlement. And people will react to you based on what they think about that particular reputation.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Fable is slated to launch in the autumn of 2026. For the first time ever, it is headed to PlayStation 5 in addition to its release on Xbox platforms.</p>



<p>One thing that will be missing from this reboot is dog companions. Learn why Ralph Fulton made the decision to cut that feature in the upcoming game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/theres-no-dog-companion-in-new-fable-and-even-devs-are-upset/">here</a>. </p>



<p>However, don’t worry, the team worked very hard to preserve the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-founder-on-preserving-fables-true-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">true spirit and Britishness.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Was the Best-Selling Console of 2025 in the U.S. and Is Still Outpacing the Nintendo Switch]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-was-the-best-selling-console-of-2025-in-the-us-and-is-still-outpacing-the-nintendo-switch</link>
            <guid>1413856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 was the best-selling console of 2025 in the U.S., both in unit sales and dollar sales, selling a total of 4.4 million units in the U.S, and continuing its streak of selling faster than the original Nintendo Switch over the same period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana's full-year reporting on the U.S. games market courtesy of analyst Mat Piscatella, and shouldn't come as a shock to anyone. The Switch 2 has been at the top consistently since it launched earlier in the year, amid a period of decline for the steadily aging PS5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of last year, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> was the best-selling accessory.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the U.S. games market reached $60.7 billion in sales for all of 2025, and $7.8 billion in December alone. That's up 1% and 3% year-over-year, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In hardware, spending was up 9% year-over-year to $5.4 billion for the year, and up 6% year-over-year to $1.2 billion in December. The Nintendo Switch 2, as the best-selling console of the year, managed to sell 4.4 million units, 94% higher than the original Switch at the same amount of time after its own launch, and 35% ahead of the PlayStation 4. It also continues its reign as the fastest-selling video game console hardware platform, with Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczfshqpik2v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointing out on Bluesky</a> that the Game boy Advance remains the fastest-selling hardware platform overall after seven months on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over in software, December spending was up 3% to $5.9 billion, with subscription services seeing the biggest increase of 24% year-over-year. Overall full-year spending was only up 1% year-over-year, with subscription spending increasing 20% offsetting declines in everything else except mobile spending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of the whole year, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 took the crown in December, despite its precense on Game Pass making its impact on Xbox much harder to tally. Fortnite saw the highest total active users across PlayStation and Xbox in 2025 of any game, with over half of all active users on the two platforms playing Fortnite at least once.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for other games, the top five sellers for the full year should shock no one who's been watching the numbers all month: after Battlefield 6 was NBA 2K26, Borderlands 4, Monster Hunter: Wilds, and Call of Duty Black Ops 7, again noting that Call of Duty was a Game Pass Day 1 title. The rest of the list was populated by a series of expected sellers, with some standouts such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered coming in at No.9, Elden Ring: Nightreign at No.14, Pokemon Legends: Z-A at No.17 (though Nintendo doesn't report digital sales, so it's possible this would have been higher), and Split Fiction at No.19. Grand Theft Auto V clocked in at No.20 as players await the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, probably this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, just looking at December, standout games including Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which launched into No.7 overall for the month, and Flight Simulator 2024, which released on PlayStation in December and shot from No.114 in November to No.16 last month. Over on PC for December, both Elden Ring and Elden Ring: Nightreign saw jumps likely due to the new Nightreign DLC.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">December 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A*</li><li>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (NEW)*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza*</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Flight Simulator 2024</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Kirby Air Riders*</li><li>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2*</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Full Year 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>Borderlands 4</li><li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li><li>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>MLB: The Show 25*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A*</li><li>WWE 2K25</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wildgate developer Moonshoot is the latest video game developer to confirm layoffs, as announced by its parent company, Dreamhaven. </p>



<p>The undisclosed number of layoffs comes after the sci-fi shooter struggled in the month following its July 2025 release. </p>







<h2 id="h-dreamhaven-is-hopeful-they-will-find-a-way-to-support-moonshot-in-the-long-term">Dreamhaven Is Hopeful They Will Find a Way to Support Moonshot in the Long Term</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Moonshot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a statement made to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/moonshot-games-making-layoffs-after-wildgate-struggles-to-become-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Dreamhaven stated that despite Wildgate launching on the Epic Games Store at the start of 2026 and seeing a boost in playership, Dreamhaven was forced to make a difficult decision in an effort to ensure it could continue updating the game and work on ways to support the studio long-term. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Despite the increase in player numbers and overall positive reception, it wasn’t enough to sustain the size of our development team. So we made the difficult decision to reduce team roles to ensure we can continue delivering updates to the game while working in a way that supports the studio in the long term. We remain focused on Wildgate’s next content update, which introduces more quality of life improvements, including the highly-requested progression system, which we anticipate coming later this quarter.” </p>
</blockquote>







<p>Dreamhaven also had to make cutbacks in September 2025; at that time, they largely affected the publishing team. A month earlier, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhavens-wildgate-has-struggled-with-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it was reported</a> that the game had only sold $130,000 unit; now, it is free to play on the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, layoffs in the gaming industry are common right now. Ubisoft recently announced a massive restructuring. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>No, there is no dog companion in the upcoming Fable reboot. Yes, there are those in the development team who are upset about it as well.</p>



<p>In Fable 2 and Fable 3, one of the player-favorite features of the game was the dog companion. However, the series is now being rebooted by Playground Games, and unfortunately there’s no dog companion. There will be horses, though.</p>







<h2 id="h-playground-founder-explains-why-he-nixed-dog-companions-in-fable">Playground founder explains why he nixed dog companions in Fable</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with IGN, </a>Ralph Fulton of Playground Games noted that he was the one who made the decision to cut the dog companions, he cited “development reasons” as the cause, and noted that there were members of his team that have yet to forgive him for making the decision.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I did know I was going to get this question. And do you know what? There are some folks on the team that were relishing me getting this question because I cut it a while back. You know what? For development reasons, right? I don’t need to go into any more detail than that, except to say there are a substantial number of people on the team who have yet to forgive me for that decision.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Despite the lack of a canine by your side, Fable will retain the freedom and Britishness of the original series. Learn more about the origins of the reboot at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-founder-on-preserving-fables-true-spirit/">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Text-based games, management RPGs, and visual novels – of whatever kind – rarely make the most exciting previews. It's just not easy to build a rich interest in the world and characters of a story you can only get the slightest taste of. I'm very pleased to say that a few hours with Sovereign Tower broke that trend entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whosoever turns the key in the giant magic lock on the tower becomes king. So, as the mystically-appointed lord of the tower, your poor faceless wanderer becomes a very important person overnight in what developer Wild Wits calls a "story-rich, Round Table management RPG." It's an entertaining concept that draws its characters and dialogue equally from fantastical tradition and modern life. Couple that with a deliciously detailed art style and a sense of what's most entertaining to do in both management games and visual novels. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's enough to sell it, I think, but it also has some nice surprises and a weird little twist on the genre as a whole. I had a pretty darn good time with it, and I'm looking forward to more.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">King of the Castle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In each turn of Sovereign Tower, you have to do two things: accept audiences, then assign knights from your round table to various quests. Taking audiences is a simple concept: Sit on the throne and deal with problems people bring you. The decisions you make there can alter the path of the story, bring up new quests for your knights, or avoid problems. They'll also affect the sovereign's standing with the realm's four factions: the Nobility, People, Merchants, and Scholars. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some problems go away if you just throw money at  them, and the taxes you get at the start of every cycle can pay for some of that—but those are the same taxes you use to pay for stuff like cool new swords and horses and magic potions, so do you really want to spend them on boring stuff like bridges or whatever? Probably not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sovereign Tower Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That sounds pretty normal, but it's the weirdos that show up to need things from you or to join your kingdom that make it memorable. I encountered a stinky jester, proud emissaries unable to admit they couldn't solve their own problems, clever peasants, annoying nobles, and even an assassin. Talking with them solidifies the personality of your blank-slate Sovereign, raising their stats in Audacity, Tyranny, Wisdom, and Kindness to unlock alternate decisions in future events.</p><p>It's the weirdos that show up to need things from you or to join your kingdom that make it memorable.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Knights are the flavor that'll really have to carry the game, and from what I saw they might do it. I met a huge guy that acted like a child, a very fancy boy, an extremely overdramatic guy, a nice lady who loved forest critters, the most goth knight ever, and even a straight-up actual wolf. Each of them had their own unique little events and dialogue that popped up from time to time, each of which affected your sovereign's relationship with them. They also had history to learn, as well as more straightforward stats, all of which affect their performance on missions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-08-1769118770111.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Figuring out which knight would be best for each quest was an actually interesting choice. Equipment like a specific horse to ride, a sword to use, or a magic potion can give them temporary stat boosts, but it's often the bonuses or penalties from their personality traits that make the difference between a failure and success or between mere success and an outstanding victory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example if you're doing something that's a bit of public relations? Probably should send the more charismatic knight, but not the really arrogant one. Watching each knight's background and figuring out which of the little highlighted keywords apply to the current mission is a fun bit of understanding the characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there's a real penalty for failure. Your knights each have an armor score, which if it goes to zero means that knight's, well, dead and gone. Your blacksmith can only fix one knight's armor each cycle—so you need to be reasonably sure that the task you're sending a knight on is one they can at least survive if they fail.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Shining Armor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">None of the characters, nor the entire game as I saw it, would have nearly as much personality without the visual art on display in Sovereign Tower, and I've got to take a moment to run through the influences and elements that make it up. Starting with the simple choices of colors to draw from: The warm pastels, earth tones, and jewel tones are lovely, then they're combined with copious golden shades and tints to express lighting. It's a palette of colors that's something between stained glass or rich watercolor on thick paper.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-14-1769118784850.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters are drawn with a lot of emotion and movement, too, for what are otherwise relatively flat portraits. You can feel the shrug in how Urusla stands, for example. You can see the carefree attitude in the angle of Angelica's head. And, well, everything about Gideon tells you exactly who he is and how he behaves. It's not just great illustration work in that you can feel the motion, it's that you can immediately start to feel who the characters are just from how they look.</p><p>The characters are drawn with a lot of emotion and movement, too, for what are otherwise relatively flat portraits.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's clear that these are artists who understand how to work their chosen medium, and if you'll put up with me for a nerd moment, it is deeply reminiscent of the Art Nouveau period in design from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Particularly the advertisements, posters, and calendars of justly-famous artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Mucha" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alphonse Mucha</u></a>. It's a fitting choice, too: Mucha's work often used the kind of medieval romantic and even fairytale themes that Sovereign Tower seems to use in its stories—I imagine he'd approve of being the inspiration here.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-03-1769118800769.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that's where I'd place this whole game's artistic style, too: It's a blend of medieval fantasy and Arthurian romance setting, the art of Mucha, and the writing of a wryly clever modern comic book. There's basically nothing to dislike in that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Clever Twist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not a surprise to people who like this kind of game that there are going to be secret events and pathways through the story to uncover, as well as desperate outcomes and painful prices to pay when choosing poorly at certain decision points. I found that Sovereign Tower must have more than a few, since I managed to stumble into at least two hidden story outcomes while playing just by assigning an unexpected or suboptimal knight to a specific quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The frustration with these kinds of events, however, is that they can give you unwanted outcomes or change the story when you weren't expecting them to or were aiming for another outcome. The only choice you've got at that point is often to play the entire visual novel over again just to see a new path or the immediate consequence of a tough choice.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-02-1769118819660.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The real good choice that Sovereign Tower makes is to have a built-in do-over mechanic. See, there's a demon that lives in a cage in the tower basement, which I'm sure isn't scary or plot-relevant at all because the demon helps you do something very useful: Step back in time. Don't worry—the demon assures me this is because it has absolutely no bad intentions and is bound to help you—much like all the other magical things that live in the tower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the demon's help you can turn back time, especially when some choice you've made would lead to a disastrous end. I expect you'll also be able to use the power to avoid the worst ends in the game, and I'm betting most players will want to use it at least once or twice to avoid making whatever NPC they've chosen to romance not mad at them about something. There's also the hint, given in the trailer and screenshots for Sovereign Tower, that you'll be able to use the demon's power to unlock alternate dialogue in situations you've seen before—tagged with an "Omniscience" stat that surely won't upset or alarm people who don't realize you're time travelling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, from the art and the writing, I'm pretty intrigued by Sovereign Tower and it's going on my list of games to watch out for. Sure, the game mechanics are pretty simple, but when the story and characters are interesting in this way I'm glad the game rules are getting out of the way to let me entertain myself—failing and succeeding on my own terms.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sovereign-tower-preview-hands-on-with-this-unique-arthurian-round-table-management-rpg]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-is-finally-stealing-the-show-for-micros-1848034238">It’s almost time to leave behind <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>‘s Mexico</a> and journey to a brand new country. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> moves the series to Japan</a>, and it looks amazing! The new entry in Xbox’s popular car sim series arrives later this year, and we have all the useful info you might want to know about the upcoming open-world racer. Just put your seatbelt on first before speed-scrolling through this list.</p> <h2>What is <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>?</h2> <p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is the next installment in the <em>Forza</em> <em>Horizon </em>franchise. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-motorsport-8-horizon-xbox-game-pass-review-120fps-1850900323">Unlike the more serious, sim-heavy <em>Motorsport</em> games,</a> the <em>Horizon</em> titles are open-world racing games focused more on over-the-top moments, music, gorgeous locations, and arcade-y fun. This time around, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> brings the franchise to Japan, a location fans have been wanting for years. You’ll be able to explore the urban streets of Tokyo, the suburbs outside of the town, and plenty of open land and rural spaces far away from the city. And like in past games, you can choose to focus on big races to level up and unlock more challenges, or you can just chill, cruise, and jam out to music.</p>

 <h2>What’s different about this latest entry?</h2> <p>Beyond the new location, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is shaking things up and swapping out the main character. In <em>Horizon 6</em>, you won’t be playing as the “superstar” racer featured in the last few games. Instead, you’re a tourist visiting Japan who gets involved in the Horizon Festival and all the racing and car culture. That means you have to earn entry to the festival and its activities and slowly work your way up from driving rust buckets to supercars.</p>  <h2>How big is the map in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>?</h2> <p>Very big! In fact, this is the biggest map that Playground Games has created for a <em>Forza Horizon</em> game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> art director Don Arceta claimed in an interview</a> that <em>Horizon 6</em>‘s digital Japan is the biggest map in the history of the series, and Tokyo is the largest city the team has ever built. And as you explore this massive location, you’ll fill up a journal, a new feature in <em>Horizon 6</em> that helps you track everything you do and all the places you visit while playing the game.</p>

 <h2>How many cars are available at launch?</h2> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/">According to<em> Xbox Wire,</em> there will be around 550 cars</a> to collect and drive in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> at launch. That number will go up over time as the devs add more cars to the game. As for the car on the cover of the game, that’s the Toyota 2025 GR GT Prototype.</p>

 <h2>Can I play <em>Horizon 6</em> online with my friends?</h2> <p>Yup! Like earlier games in the series, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> supports multiplayer with friends as well as random players. And new to this entry, players will be able to build new tracks together with their friends. There will also be car meets you can hang out at with friends, and a location that lets players build their own personal home and race track. These are both new features for <em>Horizon 6</em>.</p> <h2>What is <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‘s release date?</h2> <p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is launching on May 19 for Xbox Series X/S and PC, and&nbsp;will be available day one on Game Pass Ultimate. Xbox is also holding the game hostage, like so many publishers. If you spend extra on the Premium Edition, you’ll be able to play <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> four days early, on May 15.</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> be available on PS5?</h2> <p>Yes, but not at launch. Playground has confirmed that it is working on a PS5 port of <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, but it won’t be available until sometime later in 2026.</p> <h2>Wait, where are the goblins and magic and swords?</h2> <p>Ohhh, you’re looking for Playground’s other open-world game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-open-world-release-date-fall-xbox-ps5-2000662295"><em>Fable</em>, which is also launching this year. Sorry to have wasted your time</a>.</p>

<p>Playground Games’ Ralph Fulton spoke about the origins of Fable’s return and ensuring the game kept the core spirit of the original series, which debuted a quarter of a century ago.</p>



<p>Fable has returned for the first time since 2018 and is set to release its first mainline game in the franchise in over a decade since Fable 3 in 2010. With Playground Games currently at the helm of the franchise, Fulton can now reflect on how the success of Forza Horizon 3 and the desire to grow as Developers sowed the seeds for Fable’s return. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with IGN, </a>Fulton expanded on what he thinks led to this opportunity for the team of developers.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that as a developer, you should always be trying to challenge yourself and expand your skill set. So, that’s where the idea came from. And obviously because we’d been working with Xbox for really since our inception as Playground Games, we had great relationships with them. We knew a lot of people there. The obvious first conversation for us was with them where we said, “Hey, look, we’re looking to build a second team. We want to work in a new genre.” We felt like the transferable skills that we had from the Horizon games were an open world. We had learned a lot about building open worlds technically in terms of streaming, in terms of game design and game flow and all that good stuff. And in lots of ways that are maybe surprisingly car-agnostic. There’s a ton of things about Horizon games that are about the cars, but there’s a ton of principles that we’d learned there, which we felt were transferable. And I don’t remember who said the word Fable first, but as soon as I heard it, I was like, “That has to be it. That fits so perfectly.” It’s a series that we adored here and still do.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-playground-wanted-to-make-sure-fable-maintained-its-core-elements-including-its-britishness">Playground Wanted to Make Sure Fable Maintained Its Core Elements, Including Its Britishness</h2>



<p>When rebooting such a beloved franchise from the ground up, the team at Playground wanted to ensure certain core elements remained intact. Ralph Fulton says the three pillars of Fable games they landed on were “Freedom,” “Fairytale,” and “Britishness.” For developers, these three pillars formed the core of Fable’s DNA.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We actually wrap that up into the word “freedom” because it’s about the freedom to choose, the freedom to make the choices and then have to live with the consequences of your choices. It’s the freedom to go where you want, do what you want, be the hero you want to be. And that right there is at the heart of our game. We want you to be the hero you want to be. So, freedom is absolutely central to it.</p>



<p>We landed on two other tonal pillars, I think. And the first is fairytale. And we actually inherited this from Lionhead. We had this treasure trove of documents which had been in storage, that came originally from Lionhead. And one of them had this incredibly neat little bit of direction, which was Fable is a fairytale, not fantasy, which I just think is brilliant, incredibly incisive and speaks to really tonally what Fable is…</p>



<p>Finally, it’s about Britishness. And again, why was it important to Xbox that a British studio continued with Fable? Because Fable is this quintessentially British game, and not just because Albion is medieval Britain through a filter, if you like. And not just because the characters are British and have British accents. There’s a sensibility to the games, there’s a tone of voice, a way of thinking about things, a way of reacting to things. It’s very British. And those things combined are for us the DNA of Fable. If you don’t hit those things, if you’re not true to those things, you’re not making a Fable game. So, that was something that we decided right at the start.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, Fable has the freedom to release on PlayStation, and the game will be coming to PlayStation 5 on the same day it’s released on Xbox platforms.

      <p>The Congressional Labor Caucus, with support from the Communications Workers of America, on Thursday released a <a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/laborcaucus.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/letter-to-ftc-on-proposed-acquisition-of-electronic-arts-ea.pdf?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">letter</a> to the Federal Trade Commission requesting a review of the $55 billion <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone/" rel="noreferrer">sale</a> of Electronic Arts to a group of investors made up of Silver Lake, Affinity, and (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/saudi-plans-for-video-game-hub-grow-with-55-billion-ea-deal?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">primarily</a>) Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The Caucus expressed concern over the proposed deal's potential effect on workers and on competition within the games industry.</p><p>The letter, signed by <a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/media/press-releases/labor-caucus-calls-for-review-of-electronic-arts-acquisition?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">46 House Democrats</a>, "urge[s] the Commission to conduct a thorough investigation into the labor market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA’s existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labor-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labor outcomes."</p><p>The Caucus takes issue with several parts of the deal. One is that, given that "EA is one of the largest employers of video game workers in the United States," the company has outsized power over game workers' jobs and pay. Noting that "EA has eliminated more than 1,700 U.S. jobs since 2023, contributing to an industry-wide total of over 35,000 layoffs since 2022," the letter highlights the $20 billion in debt that's set to finance the deal, which could lead to further layoffs as EA seeks to cut costs. It also raises the possibility of "offshoring, restructuring, or studio closures," all of which "not only jeopardize thousands of high-skilled American jobs, but also further concentrate already fragile labor markets" in the games industry.</p><p>The Caucus also notes that the deal would bring EA under the same ownership as "sports leagues, sports-betting platforms, talent management, and game-development tools," writing that</p><blockquote>For example, Silver Lake’s ties to WME and TKO, along with PIF’s ownership of LIV Golf, would put EA under the same umbrella as major sports and entertainment brands that its games rely on for key licenses. This level of cross-ownership presents risks of self-preferencing and anticompetitive coordination across these sports, sports-related talent, and sports-related video game business lines. This could, consequently, restrict worker mobility and reduce bargaining power for employees throughout the industry.</blockquote><p>Back in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cwa-calls-on-ftc-and-cfius-to-scrutinize-ea-buyout-and-protect-workers-consumers-and-the-future-of-the-game-industry?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">October</a>, the president of the CWA sent a similar letter to the FTC and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, urging the organizations to review the deal. The <a href="https://cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/20251028_cwa_letter_to_secretary_bessent.pdf?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">letter to CFIUS</a> also raised concerns about "critical national security risks due to EA’s (1) access to and collection of sensitive personal data from millions of American consumers and (2) current and planned development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology."</p><p>The deal was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shareholders-back-55bn-acquisition?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">approved by EA shareholders</a> in late December and now goes to regulatory review. Given the current political climate in the US, and given that Affinity was founded by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the odds any of these letters amount to anything feel pretty slim to me. But I'm heartened to see a number of US politicians recognize the magnitude of this deal and its potential consequences on games workers. As the letter concludes, "workers deserve a fair, competitive marketplace where their skills are valued," and this sale is certainly not a way to get it. </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump/"><div><p>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On - Aftermath</p><p>EA says that its sale to Saudi Arabia will not come at the price of creative control.

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Remake On Switch 2 Is A Good Way To Play A Great Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851</link>
            <guid>1413748</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> brings a 2021 PlayStation 5 upgrade of a 2020 PS4 game to a 2025 gaming handheld hybrid in 2026. It’s a good port of a great game and suggests a bright future for third-party blockbusters on Switch 2 from publishers willing to invest the time and resources into doing it right.</p> <p>I played the new version, out January 22, for around four hours, racing back through the early section of the game in time to meet back up with Aerith and stroll through some of the more taxing areas in the early game. I was struck by two things during my brief return to the slums of Midgar. The first was just how linear, focused, and cinematic the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is compared to its sprawling successor, <em>Rebirth</em>. It was fun, refreshing, and nostalgic—all the things that made the 2020 game worth its long wait.</p>

 <p>The second was how rarely it felt like I was playing a nerfed version <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, one compromised for a portable device (I played almost exclusively in handheld mode). It’s locked at 30fps instead of something higher but that never felt like a drag. The textures, lighting, and particle effects never drew attention for the wrong reasons. I never sat there in a boss fight or cutscene thinking, “This is fine but I wished it looked better.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000662353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662353"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662353">Digital Foundry / Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s a vibe check backed up by technical analyses from the experts. A very thorough review of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>‘s performance on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUjYGy7cqog">by <em>Digital Foundry</em></a> finds that it’s weaker than the PS5 version in some areas but generally better than the PS4 one across the board. There is no infamously low-res texture eternally waiting to load on Cloud’s 7th Heaven apartment door. Pop-in is mostly a non-issue. The lighting in many scenes is more detailed than in the PS4 version as well.</p>

 <p>The only real place the Switch 2 port falters is when it comes to hair in handheld mode. It’s a small issue but a noticeable one for a game whose hero’s most defining feature is a Chocobo’s nest of spikey blond hair. From Tifa’s long ponytail to Aerith’s brunette braids, there’s often dithering and fuzziness. Some of the UI elements occasionally feel especially small or hard to read in handheld mode as well. It didn’t shatter my immersion but the game isn’t completely free of small downgrades here or there that remind you you aren’t playing on one of the high-end home consoles (the Switch 2 version arrived alongside the Xbox Series X/S ports).</p>

 <p>If you’re someone who never owned a PS4, PS5, or PC that could play <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, I’d recommend the Switch 2 version without hesitation. If the Switch 2 is the only console you’ve ever owned, I might even call it a “must buy” relative to the rest of the console’s library right now. PlayStation owners take access to games like this for granted. For Nintendo fans, it’s still a special treat, and hopefully the first of many.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[It Took An Xbox Showcase To Get A Rare Look Inside The Makers Of Pokémon]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We live in a post-platform world. Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo are no longer treating each other like they’re adversaries of the “he who must not be named” variety in their marketing material. Though console warriors are still fighting that battle in comments sections like soldiers who don’t know the war has ended, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>is coming to PlayStation</span></a><span>, so the war is over. Not only does that mean we get games on more platforms than we once did, but we also get some brainbreaking moments, like today when </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>developer Game Freak was featured </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>in an Xbox showcase</span></a><span>, and we got a rare look into the studio that made Pikachu.</span></p>  <p><span>The Tokyo office Game Freak operates out of has been the company’s home </span><a href="https://officesnapshots.com/2020/11/09/game-freak-offices-tokyo/"><span>since 2020</span></a><span> when it moved to be closer to Nintendo’s own offices in the same building, called Kanda Square. It’s been about as long since we last got a good look inside the company’s office, whose decor is based on the Kanto region of the original </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i> <i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green</span></i><span>. While the studio was showing off its upcoming action RPG </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>in today’s video presentation, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>got namedropped several times over footage of the team working on the game in its Kanda Square office. The clips we see show an office that, in some rooms, looks like any other video game developer’s space, with concept art on the walls and computers in cubicles. But some rooms look much different, like one that is covered in trees to look like Kanto’s Viridian Forest.</span></p>

 <p><span>While </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s name was said a few times in the showcase and this room is an homage to one of its most iconic early “dungeons,” as far as I can tell there’s no sign of a Pikachu or Poké Ball in these brief glimpses into Game Freak’s inner sanctum. I understand why they wouldn’t show us shots of the team working on upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games, but I am surprised that there’s not even a frame of iconography in these shots. That feels like a deliberate choice, perhaps to not distract from </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>?</span></p> <p><span>The Viridian Forest backdrop does work for the upcoming Xbox/PC/PS5 game, though, as it takes place in a post-apocalyptic fantasy Japan in which nature has reclaimed much of the land. Still, it’s odd to get an intimate look inside the historically secretive studio from an Xbox showcase. It’s a shame Pikachu didn’t get to make a cameo appearance, but I sincerely doubt we’ll be seeing a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game on Xbox, even as the console barriers are falling down.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beast-of-reincarnation-game-freak-pokemon-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000662327</link>
            <guid>1413742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Game Freak showed a pretty lengthy look at its new action-RPG </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> during today’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>Xbox Developer Direct</span></a><span>. The studio is primarily known for its work on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, though. Given that recent entries like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-nintendo-switch-1849843125"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i></a><span> were notorious for being pretty ugly and running very poorly on the original Switch, you might be wondering how </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>looks as good as it does. Will it end up having similar technical troubles? Well, we won’t know for sure until the game launches in the summer, but Game Freak was recently asked this exact question.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking with game director Kota Furushima, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game"><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>asked</span></a><span> about </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>’s ambitions after games like </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> struggled with performance despite not chasing nearly the same level of same fidelity or scope. Furushima’s answer might sound encouraging for </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>, but it also feels like </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is catching strays.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><b>IGN: </b><span>Game Freak has received some criticism in the past few years for the performance and look of some of its 3D open world games. </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> looks to be fairly ambitious. What would you say to those who are concerned that it might struggle in the same ways?</span></p> <p><b>Furushima:</b><span> I think when it comes to </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>, and I guess we would regard it as the scale and the ambition of the title, when we approach game design, we’re not looking to make, say, a title of a certain level of quality. We’re looking to deliver a very specific game experience, and visual fidelity and graphics, this is something that supports that game experience, everything that goes into that. That includes things like bug fixing, optimization. Everything is there to serve the gameplay and the experience. Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>The unspoken implication here is that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games are not the type of “specific game experience” that requires the aforementioned bug fixes and optimization. It feels like an offshoot of the argument people who run defense for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games make by saying “people don’t play these games for the graphics,” as if that means they shouldn’t still aspire to not look like GameCube games.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere in the interview, </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>asks about the size of the team working on </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> since Game Freak is a relatively small developer that is also working on </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>projects year-round. Furushima says the multi-studio headcount is “quite large,” but the actual internal Game Freak team working on </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>is “relatively small” and mostly leading the project through direction and management.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realize the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we’re lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well,” Furushima says.</span></p>

 <p><span>It sounds like </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> might not suffer the same technical troubles as Game Freak’s </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games since it’s not being developed primarily internally like </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> and the upcoming Gen X games. Will any of </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>’s fidelity end up rubbing off on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>? Who knows. </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this summer.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">From the screen to your nightstand.</h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a delightfully inventive and downright trippy video game. One of the earliest hallucinogenic bits you encounter are talking flowers. If you’re a fan of the chatty flora, you’re in luck: you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxe07P?object_uuid=af91a900-9ec9-4fe1-8f1b-f8f2a21c7bde&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder</a> a plastic Talking Flower of your own right now. They’re available at the Nintendo Store for $34.99, with a release date of March 12.</p><div id="234668"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234668" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Talking Flower</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing to note is that this is not exactly a kids’ toy geared towards play. It’s more of a decoration that occasionally talks. You set it on a desk, shelf, or bedside table, and the thing will say something periodically (Nintendo says it speaks roughly twice an hour). It says things like, “Is it weird for flowers to talk?” Or, “Sometimes it’s nice to space out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has a button you can press to make it talk on command. If you press the button repeatedly, it will utter “special phrases,” whatever that means. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Talking Flower doesn’t have any built-in AI and it’s not connected to an LLM. It doesn’t have a microphone, so it’s not listening like an Amazon Echo, and you can’t hold a conversation with it. But it does have a built-in clock, so it can make comments about the time of day it is. It can also sense the temperature and make comments about that. </p></div><div id="183351"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="183351" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It can also make the sound from the game when you get a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/super-mario-bros-wonder/Wonder_Seed_Locations">Wonder seed</a> and the level transforms. It then plays music, and you can press the button in time with the music to make it react.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can have it speak in the morning when you want to wake up, like an alarm clock (lookin’ at you, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-alarmo">Alarmo</a>). You can also press and hold the button to make it be quiet for a while. It also won’t talk over night. The Talking Flower supports 11 languages. If you want one of your own, you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxe07P?object_uuid=af91a900-9ec9-4fe1-8f1b-f8f2a21c7bde&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder now</a> at the Nintendo Store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Super Mario Bros. Wonder news, the game is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade, plus a new expansion called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-edition-release-date-plus-elephant-mario-and-captain-toad-amiibo">Meetup in Bellabell Park</a>.

The presser doesn't specify what these conditions are, but it can be speculated that both involve playing a long con of some kind without anyone being the wiser.</p><p>For those in the United States, there is a special edition version of <em>Disney Villainous: Success At Any Cost</em>. This version of the game will feature classic papel picado artwork, reminiscent of art seen at Dia de los Muertos festivals, complete with a special finish on Ernesto's mover. The catch is that this version is exclusive to Target. The expansion will be available at an MSRP of $22.99.</p><p>The second <em>Disney Villainous</em> expansion, <em>Disney Villainous: Come, We Fly!,</em> will showcase the witches from the 1990s Halloween movie, <em>Hocus Pocus</em>. The expansion contains one villain, the Sanderson Sisters, complete with their own sculpted mover, unique illustrations, and bespoke mechanics.</p><p>Notably, this is the second <em>Disney Villainous</em> expansion to feature a baddie from a live-action Disney movie. The first was Davy Jones from the Pirates of the Caribbean series.</p><p><em>Disney Villainous: Come, We Fly!</em> will be available in the second half of 2026 at an MSRP of $14.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
