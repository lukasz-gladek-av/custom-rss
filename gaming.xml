            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Stellar Blade was one of the standout titles of 2024, emerging as a new IP with fantastic combat mechanics and an intriguing story. It also helped that the protagonist, Eve, was able to lure in many gamers on account of her character model being just a little bit scandalous.</p>



<p>Insane body model aside, Stellar Blade represented something fresh and energetic, and it offered intense boss battles, a killer soundtrack, and a lot of meat on the bones, enough to keep gamers occupied for many hours.</p>



<p>Now, a sequel has been confirmed as being in development.</p>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-2-is-being-developed-by-shift-up">Stellar Blade 2 is Being Developed by Shift Up</h2>



<p>In a recent financial update, Shift Up confirmed that a sequel to 2024’s Stellar Blade is in active development. It was just a few <strong>weeks </strong>after the game was released that Shift Up announced an intention to make a sequel, but now those cogs are actively turning.</p>



<p>Here’s a snippet of that <a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20250814004388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial report</a>, translated by <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1963102317886283809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki_JPN</a> on X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the ‘Stellar Blade’ IP and are currently developing a sequel to ‘Stellar Blade’.</p>



<p>This sequel will inherit the action-packed nature of the original ‘Stellar Blade’ while incorporating an expanded worldview and enhanced gameplay, further solidifying its position as a franchise IP. We anticipate that this will result in even greater success than the original.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stellar Blade continued to be a rampant success this year, with Shift Up releasing the game on PC. The anticipation was so high that it hit one million sales <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-pc-hit-1-million-sales-faster-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19 times faster</a> </strong>on PC than it did when it originally launched on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>It was also said earlier this year that the intention is to release a Stellar Blade sequel by 2027, so we won’t have to wait too long. Not only that, but Shift Up is considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-a-switch-2-port-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Switch 2 port</a> for the first Stellar Blade game.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade was one of my favorite games of 2024, which is strange, because the genre isn’t usually one that would attract me. I was won over by the post-apocalyptic setting, the accessible boss battles, and the plot. Definitely the plot.</p>



<p>Do you want to see Stellar Blade 2 emerge soon? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Playing Borderlands 4 on a PC with the right requirements is likely going to be the best place to get the best graphical quality and performance when compared to consoles.</p>



<p>Luckily, games these days are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-borderlands-4-have-crossplay-split-screen-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to have crossplay</a>, so you don’t even need to force yourself to play on console with friends. All <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future content</a> within the game can be accessed at your desk without any issue, provided your setup can run it.</p>



<p>While the ceiling on AAA games being played on a PC is higher, there is also a lot more room for something to go wrong. In many cases where that happens, it has to do with players trying to run a game on hardware that just can’t handle it. Here are the minimum and recommended specs to play Borderlands 4 on PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-minimum-system-requirements">Borderlands 4 Minimum System Requirements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>While not providing the unmatched amazing experience while playing the game, the Borderlands 4 minimum system requirements will let you play the game, hopefully with the least number of issues possible.</p>



<p>If you try to run the game with specs that fall below this, you may run into quite a few issues with loading times, freezing issues, crashes, and more. Here is what Gearbox on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> considers to be the minimum requirements to play Borderlands 4.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating System</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 64-bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">100 GB available space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As long as your PC meets all of these requirements, you should be able to play Borderlands 4 with fewer issues holding you back. If you are unsure if you meet the criteria above, you can consider <a href="https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">using this tool </a>to help you understand. If you think you do meet the minimum, but things aren’t working, try updating your graphics drivers.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-recommended-system-requirements">Borderlands 4 Recommended System Requirements</h2>



<p>As you might expect, the specs definitely take a step forward for the recommended hardware to play Borderlands 4. These are the things that will help your experience on PC outperform those who are playing on a console.</p>



<p>Below are the recommended system requirements for Borderlands 4 on PC.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Recommended Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating System</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 64-bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">32 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">100 GB available space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>With the above, you should not experience many issues at all when playing Borderlands 4 on your PC. You might not be blowing away the competition, but you can<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pitchford-nervous-challenge-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> definitely take on difficult enemies</a> and gather all the loot they leave on the ground with the confidence that you’re not seconds away from an unexpected crash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this update, we made specification changes to some main weapons to make their individual characteristics stand out. We also made balance changes to multiplayer based on changes observed after adding the Splatlands Collection.</p>
<p>For three types of main weapons—Splash-o-matic, .52 Gal, and Splat Brella—rather than simple upgrades, we made specification changes to make their individual characteristics stand out.</p>
<p>For Splash-o-matic, we extended the flight distance for shots to make it easier to take advantage of its characteristic where the accuracy of your aim directly applies to your ability to defeat opponents. On the other hand, we decreased its ability to ink to make it more difficult to fight in ways that don’t take advantage of accurate aim, such as maintaining battle lines without direct confrontations or using special weapons with high frequency.</p>
<p>For the .52 Gal, we increased the speed of shots to make it easier to fight by taking advantage of its high attack power to defeat several opponents in a short time and create big opportunities. On the other hand, we increased the amount of ink consumed to make it harder to fight in a way that maintains battle lines over time.</p>
<p>For the Splat Brella, we expanded the area of its inking to make it easier to fight by taking advantage of its ability to defend from attacks to keep opponents in check and maintain battle lines, or to use the canopy to prolong the durations of battles to cooperate with allies. We also created a distinction between it and other Brellas by expanding the area of its shots. This makes it easier to support allies by dealing small, reliable damage, while at the same time making it so that in one-on-one fights, players must get closer than before to fight in ways that can quickly defeat opponents. We have also adjusted the number of points required for special weapons to ensure that special-weapon frequency does not rise higher than necessary as a result of expanding the area it inks.</p>
<p>For other main weapons, we made changes to make them easier to use by shoring up their weaknesses.</p>
<p>As for special weapons, for the Zipcaster we made changes so that it’s easier to fight with in combination with certain main weapons.</p>
<p>For the Ink Vac, we made changes so that when used in one-on-one situations, it is harder to be left open by quickly filling up the ink tank, but it also has greater effect when used well to block opponents’ shots.</p>
<p>For the Ink Storm, by expanding the area of effect, we made it easier to use it to force opponents lying in wait in advantageous positions to move, and easier for allies to fight within the area.</p>
<p>Additionally, we made changes to the points required for special weapons, taking into account changes observed since the addition of the Splatlands Collection.</p>
<p>The next update will focus on changes to the balance of battles.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has announced it's bringing the first-person shooter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken 64</a> to its "Mature" Switch Online + Expansion Pack app.</p>
<p>The Acclaim Entertainment title, released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998 and developed by Iguana UK, will be arriving for the Switch and Switch 2 online service on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>. Here's the official Nintendo description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You are a ruthless mercenary, sent to the condemned remains of Earth as part of a covert operation codenamed "Forsaken." Your mission is to infiltrate and destroy the last bastions of the mechanized terror that wiped out all life on the planet. Earth is a death trap riddled with merciless mechanoid adversaries and gangs of rival bounty hunters, and you'll have to brave them all astride your anti-grav pioncycle to make your fortune...or meet your doom. Choose between different modes in this first-person shooter title released for the Nintendo 64™ system in 1998, and enter the fight in Single Player Mode or Multi-Player Mode. Then, select your bike. Each bike has different attributes, each biker a different attitude. Pick one that suits your style, then dive into your mission. The availability of weapons, enemies, and powerups changes depending on the level you play, so stay sharp!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, you'll need to have an active Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription tier as well as the "mature" version of the N64 app to play this game on your Switch or Switch 2. You can download this version of the app from the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>This latest N64 Switch Online announcement also happens to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/blurred-art-in-nintendos-n64-switch-online-trailer-suggests-exciting-upcoming-additions">follow a rumour in July</a>, which may have identified unannounced releases for this particular app. Apart from Forsaken 64, the games spotted included <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Smash Bros.</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/glover">Glover</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2</a>.</p>
<p>In Japan this week, Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers get to revisit Brownie Brown's GBA RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/magical_vacation">Magical Vacation</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Nintendo has been rolling out regular firmware updates to help improve this, and following yesterday's major system update (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-4-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">bumping the Switch 2 up to Version 20.4.0</a>), a handful of games are now running as intended.</p>
<p>As highlighted by Universo Nintendo, this list includes multiple third-party titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/killing_time_resurrected">Killing Time: Resurrected</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/melty_blood_type_lumina">Melty Blood: Type Lumina</a>, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like many of you, I was once a guy who either thought he could build his own PC, or knew a guy who knew some stuff and who offered to scrounge some parts together for a bargain price. I lived a formative part of my life like this, and let me tell you, it fuckin <em>sucked</em>.</p><p>Whether it was my own bumbling hands or the ultimately unqualified bluster of A Guy, for years my PC gaming life was plagued by hardware conflicts, <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-dont-understand-my-pc-which-i-built" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part failures</a>, a need to constantly be <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-bought-the-wrong-graphics-card-and-i-am-full-of-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgrading</a> one part or another and just a general sense I was living on a knife's edge, always one bootup or overclock away from something dying and needing to be replaced. It was stressful when everything was going OK and it was a huge pain in the ass when it wasn't, and considering video games are supposed to be a fun and cool way to relax, I was not having a great time.</p><p>So a decade ago (August 2015), with "getting to enjoy <em>The Witcher 3's</em> visuals as God intended" foremost in my mind, I decided I was going to stop being such a tight-fisted weirdo with my time and money, suck it up, risk the ridicule of friends and peers and just buy a prebuilt PC. Yes, they were more expensive, which meant yes, I was getting less PC for my buck, but given the hell I'd been living through for years previously, I figured it would be money well spent.</p><p>A decade later I am happy to report that it was indeed money well spent, and that I have finally found peace. I have just <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-keep-my-pc-on-the-floor-where-it-belongs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought</a> my third prebuilt PC in that time, and whatever extra money I've poured into having someone else put the things together has been more than worth it. In that decade, do you know how many times I've had a part fail, or had a weird driver conflict, or mystery reboot cycle, or have <em>anything </em>go wrong? Across three computers and a decade spent using them all day for work and playing games all night and on weekends?</p><p>Not one! Not a single issue. I paid some guys a premium of probably $300 per PC to make sure everything fit and worked and that the cables were braided nicely and that's exactly what they've done, and I couldn't be happier. I turn my PC on and it works, every time! I play games on it for years at a time and nothing ever goes wrong! All three times a big box got delivered to my door and I opened it up and plugged it in and everything was set up and already running!</p><p>I recognise there's a degree of privilege to this scenario; the fact I was scrounging for parts in my 20s then spending extra for the luxury of convenience in my mid-30s and beyond says as much about my income situation as it does my desire for convenience, not to mention the fact I'm lucky enough to be able to claim a new gaming PC as a tax deduction.</p><p>Even taking that into account, though, I cannot recommend it enough. I know there are already loads of people reading this more skilled and knowledgeable about this stuff than me, thinking "building a PC isn't hard, you big baby", or that the need to save $300 overrides all other considerations, and I get that. But also: have you ever considered that instead of me "blowing" hundreds of dollars per PC I have actually invested that money in peace-of-mind? One of the best things you can <em>ever </em>spend money on?</p><figure><figcaption>My latest PC, with a Fractal North case.

<section><p>The latest Nightdive remaster is an excellent example of bringing beloved classics into the modern age.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>When it comes to preserving long forgotten or unavailable shooters, Nightdive Studios is leading the charge. While older games often struggle to be preserved properly due to a myriad of issues--licensing disputes, asset loss, tech limitations and simply being forgotten chief among them--studios like Nightdive have made a concentrated effort to prove that no game is beyond preservation. In the past few years, Nightdive has restored and released new versions of System Shock 2, Star Wars: Dark Forces, and Turok, bringing the beloved classics to modern audiences. Yet even more impressive is the studio's commitment to including a wealth of accessibility options, making these titles more playable and accessible than ever before.</p><p>Nightdive's most recent re-releases, Heretic and Hexen, are prime examples of this. Released in 1994 and developed by Raven Software, Heretic was one of many “Doom Clones” from that era. Instead of a space marine taking down the hordes of Hell, players took on the role of a spellcaster named Corvus who navigates a dark fantasy world brought to ruin by the Serpent Riders. Heretic is notable for being far more interactive in its environments compared to Doom and even allowed players to look up and down: a rarity for shooters at the time. A year later, Raven Software released Hexen: Beyond Heretic, a distant sequel to Heretic that saw players pick one of three protagonists as they set out to defeat the second of the Serpent Riders. Like its predecessor, Hexen was notable for its distinct features, such as a darker fantasy setting and a central hub that connected all the game's levels.</p><p>While these games had their devoted followings, neither reached the popularity of games such as Doom and Quake and, as such, fell into obscurity. For a long time it felt as if these games would never get their proper due. That all changed, however, at this year's Quakecon, when Microsoft and Nightdive announced a remastered collection featuring both games--complete with numerous accessibility options and enhancements--was now available. According to Nightdive founder and CEO Stephen Kick, Heretic and Hexen's focus on accessibility is not a passive effect of remaking the games, but an intentional choice that reflects the studio's larger priorities.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560227-heretic-hexen_03_heretic-6b3df5c67c3176057f9c-scaled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560227" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560227-heretic-hexen_03_heretic-6b3df5c67c3176057f9c-scaled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560227"></a><figcaption>An image from the Heretic + Hexen collection.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560227-heretic-hexen_03_heretic-6b3df5c67c3176057f9c-scaled.jpg"></figure><p>"Accessibility is a 'key part' of our mission at Nightdive. When we remaster a classic game, we’re not just making it look better--we’re making sure it can be played and enjoyed by as many people as possible, regardless of their hardware, preferences, or physical limitations,” Kick said.</p><p>One of the main new features of Nightdive’s Heretic and Hexen remaster is the addition of a map and waypoint system. The original releases were labyrinthine in design, and a lack of navigational tools resulted in the game turning into a slog. As such, Nightdive's director of business development Larry Kuperman confirmed that a map was "the feature most requested by fans," as well as the most praised addition at QuakeCon.</p><p>“We knew that Hexen and Heretic could be frustrating to new players not accustomed to this style of gameplay so we implemented a pseudo-waypoint system that marked important objectives on the map," Kick added. "It doesn’t show you how to get there, but it does give you an idea of where you need to explore which is an extremely helpful feature.”</p><p>In addition to the new waypoint feature, Nightdive also included its trademark visual and controller options such as controller and keyboard bindings, visual filters, and anti-aliasing, allowing players to customize the whole experience to their liking. It can be hardcore, like the original release, or more accessible--the freedom of choice is in the player’s hands.</p><p>“We have always treated the games that we work on with respect and [aim] to respect the original developers. We know that they did all they could given the software and hardware limitations of the times," Kupperman added. "We see ourselves as helping to fulfill the original vision using today’s tool[s]."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560229-heretichexen.png" data-ref-id="1300-4560229" data-ratio="0.5596546310832" data-width="1274" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560229-heretichexen.png" data-ref-id="1300-4560229"></a><figcaption>An image from the Heretic + Hexen collection.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560229-heretichexen.png"></figure><p>Heretic and Hexen is a prime example of Nightdive succeeding in its goals. While the game is far more playable due to the gameplay and visual changes, the original intent is still there. At the remaster’s core, it is still Heretic and Hexen, just made available to a modern gaming audience. The level layouts remain the same, the gameplay remains as frantic as ever, and the atmosphere lives on in Nightdive’s retooling of it.</p><p>Nightdive promises to keep its sights on accessibility for future titles as well, though the team admits there are areas where they can improve. “One area I think we could do better is to include options for colorblind players,” Kick said.</p><p>According to Kick, the studio will always strive for more accessibility for the sake of getting beloved and forgotten titles to the widest of audiences on modern hardware. A great example of this besides Heretic and Hexen is the studio’s recent System Shock remake and System Shock 2 remaster. While the former is a full, from-the-ground remake and the latter is an update to current modern hardware, both feature a wealth of options to fine tune the player experience from puzzle difficulty to combat assists. These once inaccessible games (System Shock in particular has often been described as playing an operating system) are now available to anyone to enjoy without the headaches of the past.</p><p>While game preservation will always remain an important topic in gaming and could always use more support, Nightdive is leading the charge by helping games not only fall out of obscurity, but also by making them more enjoyable to play. In an era where more and more games are falling into obscurity due to not being preserved properly, Heretic and Hexen is a glimmer of hope for the future of our industry.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-unironically-like-netflix%E2%80%99s-live-action-kakegurui-tv-series.1287036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like video game adaptations, live-action anime adaptations get a bad rap for being so rancid that fans preemptively sling shit at their creators for having the audacity to attempt them. Having been a card-carrying member of that camp for years, when I tuned into <em>Bet</em>, Netflix’s live-action take on <em>Kakegurui</em>, I expected an irredeemable trainwreck. What I got instead was a surprisingly entertaining, campy fever dream. I take pride in contributing to getting it greenlit for a second season.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bet | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R7xl9QjtNDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Developed by Simon Berry, <em>Bet</em> reimagines Homura Kawamoto and Tōru Naomura’s 2014 psychological drama series <em>Kakegurui: Compulsive Gambler</em>. The original manga follows Yumeko Jabami, a precocious high school transfer student at a prestigious academy where one’s social status is determined by underground gambling. Think <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em>’s early manga chaos meets <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-things-to-check-out-after-youve-binged-squid-game-1847875371/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kaiji</em></a>’s debt-riddled death games. The anime adaptation by Mappa in 2017 catapulted the series into pop culture prominence, and I even ranked it as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-anime-ranked-decade-attack-on-titan-demon-slayer-1850117910/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30th best anime of the decade</a> at the other website.</p><p>Visually, <em>Bet </em>is Netflix’s CW-esque answer to <em>Riverdale </em>with BBC’s<em> Sherlock</em> levels of overproduction. Its set design and costuming go hard—like, somebody put their whole bussy into it hard. Sure, the show is still campy and wacky, just like its source material, but it leans into that chaos rather than apologizing for it. Unlike Hollywood's more infamous anime misfires (cough cough <em>Dragon Ball Evolution</em> and <em>The Last Airbender</em>), Bet embraces its eccentricity with pride, and while being a more palatable thing to have folks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS7mdn4DFuc&amp;pp=ygUaa2FrZWd1cnVpIGd1biBzY2VuZSBtaWRhcmk%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walk in on you watching</a> than its anime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p><em>Bet</em> doesn’t just cosplay the source material—it remixes it by Americanizing it in the most contemporary camp way possible. And in doing so, <em>Bet </em>fixes things that even the manga and anime never quite nailed. Mainly, how it handled adapting three characters from the source material.&nbsp;</p><p>First off is actor Miku Martineau’s Yumeko. In the anime, she’s a manic enigma who gets turned on by the danger of gambling even when the odds are stacked against her. With each episode, she inexplicably wins every game (even when her opponents are cheating), making the viewing experience bereft of emotional stakes. <em>Bet </em>gives her gravity. While she’s still as much a thrill-seeker as her counterpart, her backstory as a girl haunted by the murder of her parents and her quest for revenge, wrapped in that grief, is lampshaded at the start of the show, giving viewers a tangible character to root for from the get-go.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kakegurui | Trailer [HD] | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTlHQiRNVl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In contrast, the anime takes forever and a day to reveal that plot point. Thanks to this change, Yumeko’s highs and lows feel earned. Every rare stumble, recalibration, and fight from beneath make her victories feel like actual triumphs instead of a narrative inevitability.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there's Ryan, the race-swapped version of Ryota, played by Black actor Ayo Solanke. In the manga and anime, Ryota is basically a glorified background character whose only purpose is to react to all the wild shit Yumeko does as an analogue for the audience. <em>Bet</em> gives Ryan his own arc where his one-sided crush on Yumeko, in tandem with his own family issues, gives him a seat at the table as a character with as much agency, if not more so, than the show’s leading lady. Even original show moments where the series feels like it's dipping into eye-rolling territory, like a plot line where the school places bets on Ryan losing his virginity to Yumeko, are played with emotional maturity and care. Where the anime would have Yumeko handwave away the danger her gambling has on her cohorts, like a bullishly written Batman, <em>Bet</em>’s Yumeko doesn’t unwittingly gamble with her friends' lives like an asshole.</p><p>Another character I was surprised by was how much I loved Netflix’s adaptation compared to the anime was <em>Bet</em>’s reimagined version of the early villain, <a href="https://kakegurui.fandom.com/wiki/Itsuki_Sumeragi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Itsuki Sumeragi</a>. In the anime, Itsuki is a one-note sadist who takes joy in collecting her victims’ fingernails as trophies. But the adaptation transforms her into <a href="https://kakegurui.fandom.com/wiki/Suki_Hennessey#Appearance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suki Hennessey</a>, a gender-nonconforming character with a shady influencer past, akin to James Charles. Suki actor <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dnybackact/video/7523628335675575557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Sutherland</a> might as well have been Denzel Washington, given how he chewed up the scenery in every scene he was in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Yumeko Accepts Mary’s Challenge to Skirmish | Bet | Netflix Philippines" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MSASvyra1ZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Bet</em>’s whole vibe isn’t far off from Netflix’s live-action <em>Death Note</em>—which, yes, features Margaret Qualley for some reason—but Bet scratches the same “if this anime took place in America” itch with more confidence. And, unlike Death Note, which survives almost entirely on the galaxy-brained casting of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMHFlD65hY4&amp;pp=ygUXd2lsbGVtIGRhZm9lIGRlYXRoIG5vdGU%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Willem Dafoe as Ryuk</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1mcQ6CzXo8&amp;pp=ygUcbGFrZWl0aCBzdGFuZmllbGQgZGVhdGggbm90ZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LaKeith Stanfield as L</a>, <em>Bet</em> doesn’t hedge its bets on a single saving grace. It’s just top-to-bottom unpapologetic cringe, as it was meant to be.</p><p>My inciting incident that convinced me and my friend to watch the series was our collective curiosity about how WWE champion Seth Rollins would make a cameo in the series—a cameo that, out of context, reeked to us of shameless brand synergy following Netflix’s own hosting of WWE Raw. Spoiler: <a href="https://x.com/25_Saurav/status/1906705868831228331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rollins’ already cunty wardrobe</a> and shrill, whiny tone fit right into the show’s madness as another brilliant point of casting.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison to <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-one-piece-yu-yu-hakusho-anime-live-action-netfl-1850050620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other upcoming live-action anime projects </a>fans are biting their nails to the nub in anxiety over, <em>Kakegurui </em>isn’t a sacred cow in the grander anime community. It’s a weird, horny, and chaotic mess—and <em>Bet </em>understands that. It doesn’t try to sanitize it. Instead, it Westernizes it in ways that feel playful rather than disrespectful. Like <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-piece-netflix-live-action-oda-luffy-review-anime-1850788857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em></a> being a similar&nbsp; to <em>Percy Jackson</em>’s whimsical energy or <em>Death Note</em> morphing into <em>Final Destination</em>, <em>Bet </em>knows where not to overstep and where to play loudly within its adaptation.&nbsp;</p><p>So if Netflix’s export of live-action anime series going forward is going to lean into CW-style camp, then I welcome it as a chaotic but valuable addition to the anime and manga ecosystem. Adaptations like <em>Bet </em>aren’t slop or guilty pleasures—they’re gateways where normies could join in the fold and check out the anime and manga that inspired them. If Netflix’s <em>One Piece</em> live-action series could become a talking point on <em>The View</em>, pulling normies like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceLiveAction/comments/16t4ric/actually_insane_whoopi_goldberg_gave_a_raving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoopi Goldberg into Luffy’s warm light</a>, then why not let lesser-known titles like <em>Kakegurui </em>get their moment alongside shonen royalty? <em>Bet </em>was wildly fun, and if that fun gets more folks to check out the manga and anime, then let the cringe renaissance continue.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-demonschool-delay-silksong"><h3>Why Demonschool Got Delayed, Even Though It’s Nothing Like Silksong</h3></a><p>"It’s frustrating because we’ve really tried very hard to let people know that this game exists"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/long-story-short-bojack-netflix"><h3>Long Story Short Is A Lot, In A Good Way</h3></a><p>The new family drama from the creators of Bojack Horseman is funny, moving, and just the right amount of intense</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vivi-is-screwing-up-magic-the-gathering-and-you-know-what-good-for-him"><h3>Vivi Is Screwing Up Magic: The Gathering, And You Know What?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> update, players are discovering that developers Arrowhead have sneakily added a massive and nearly impossible-to-kill super worm, known as the Hive Lord, to the online sci-fi shooter. But one team has felled the beast, though it reportedly took nearly a dozen nukes.</p> <p>On September 2, PlayStation and Arrowhead pushed out a new, free <em>Helldivers</em> <em>2</em> update known as “Into The Unjust.” This big update, available now on PS5, Xbox, and PC, added intricate caves to explore, new missions to complete, and a little surprise. Well, more of a big surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/yZ34QSm-nJw">The Hive Lord</a>, a bug the size of a skyscraper, is now an enemy you might encounter in <em>Helldivers 2.</em></p>  <p>While the Hive Lords appeared in the first <em>Helldivers</em>, they hadn’t yet shown up in the sequel. <a href="https://youtu.be/cdOs5duY6yI">Hive Lords were hinted at in the update’s trailer</a> and have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1bchk4b/for_those_new_among_us_these_statues_appear_to_be/">been teased</a> in-game since launch. But Arrowhead <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850?emclan=103582791473678397&amp;emgid=516345493302805199">didn’t officially list the new massive enemy in the game’s patch notes,</a> so some players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6q1x5/this_was_my_first_experience_with_a_hive_lord/">discovered the Hive Lords completely by chance</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6kx48/what_in_sweet_liberty_is_that/">were shocked by their scale.</a> These things are big. <em>Huge</em>. Easily the largest enemy in <em>Helldivers 2.</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6ocyv/pls_dont_nerf_hivelords/">And they are very hard to kill</a>.</p>

 <p>At first, players weren’t even sure Hive Lords <em>could</em> be killed, with some reporting the beasts had survived tactical nukes and many, many bullets. But players spotted that sometimes a bullet would penetrate the beast’s armor and that it did react to explosions. “If it bleeds, it can be killed” became a rallying call under some posts of Hive Lords laying waste to players and vehicles. Even still, some weren’t sure. Maybe it was too much for the forces of democracy to handle.</p>    <p>Eventually, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6m0vo/they_are_real_and_we_killed_one_raaaahhhh/">one squad of brave and dedicated Helldivers killed a Hive Lord,</a> likely becoming one of the first teams, if not the first team, to do so. According to one of the people involved with killing the massive sand worm, it took 10+ Hellbombs, 8+ 500KG bombs, and “a ton of Ultimatums and Spears/RRs.” According to IsJustSophie, one of the Hive Lord slayers, “I shat my pants when it burst out of the ground.” Seems like a totally fair and reasonable reaction to encountering a massive god worm.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Lodi, it turns out, is a time traveler, kidnapped from his place in the distant past of the 1960s and flung through centuries as part of an unknown agenda. That makes him a different kind of character than Destiny 2 usually sees--his frame of reference is a lot closer to the people playing the game than the immortal Guardians who populate it. He's also much more of a "regular guy" than any of the characters the game has told stories about up to now, and that makes him something of an interesting anomaly in Destiny 2's world.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Edge of Fate, Lodi is portrayed by actor Brian Villalobos, a newcomer to the game. Since taking on the role, Villalobos has been immersing himself more in the Destiny 2 world, and has even taken to streaming the game on Twitch (his brother, Michael, is the well-known Dark Souls streamer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lobosjrgaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LobosJr</a>). GameSpot spoke with Villalobos via email about the experience of taking on the role of Lodi and finding the humanity in the character amid the space magic.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: I've seen that you're streaming Destiny 2--how familiar were you with the game and its story when you took on the role of Lodi? What was your process like for getting into the character and finding his place in the Destiny world, and how did your familiarity with the game play into that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Brian Villalobos: </strong>I was <em>not </em>very familiar. So, I'm not necessarily a <em>gigantic</em> gamer--my younger brother's a big, big Dark Souls streamer and he got me into that whole beautiful nightmare for a while, and he'd played Destiny a bit, but I never had. I got the notice that I was cast just over a year ago, and I'd obviously heard of Destiny, and I knew it was a huge, long-standing franchise, and I have friends who've been playing it forever, but I really only knew it as a "space shooter." I thought you just loaded up with friends and went in and blew up robots and aliens or whatever. (Aside from that, I think I maybe knew Nathan Fillion was in it? Haha.)</p><p dir="ltr">What really, truly surprised me and blew me away once I started digging in was the profound depth and breadth of the storytelling, and of these characters and lore. There's a whole cosmology. There's like, space magic; space <em>religions</em>, kind of; cohabitating peoples and societies; a winding military history; Eldritch interdimensional meddling--it instantly felt as expansive and deep as something like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. So, <em>that</em> part of it--which, as an actor preparing to try to somehow step into that world, was the first part I engaged with and was the first part I really fell in love with--I was not at all familiar with. Which, honestly, in a weird way, played right into the prep for Lodi: One of the very fortunate things about him--and I've been incredibly, incredibly fortunate in so many ways with this dude--is that he's this Timelost, Stranger In a Strange Land kind of guy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4560273-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_npc_compressed_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560273" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4560273-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_npc_compressed_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560273"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4560273-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_npc_compressed_02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So, I prepped--I mean, I played the game, I mainlined lore videos and Destiny storylines and did background stuff and all that--but so much of him, <strong>a.)</strong> felt like it was so clearly and beautifully on the page, and <strong>b.)</strong> was rooted in this kind of thing where it's like, "Okay, welcome to Destiny, you're playing this astonishingly regular-ass-seeming guy who's kind of constantly overwhelmed and confused by everything, but very interested by this massive preexisting fantastical future-world that he's just been thrust into, and he kind of has no idea what's going on and is in over his head and really doesn't want to screw things up, but he's just doing his best." And I was like, "Yep. Okay. I can <em>fully</em> relate to that."</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Lodi has some pretty heavy stuff to contend with, as a guy who was abducted by aliens, sent to the future, and now is getting his brain messed with. There are a few moments where a lot of anguish comes through in your portrayal. Can you talk about the challenges of capturing that emotional range? How do you channel all that sort of unknowable weirdness to get to the humanity of such an out-there situation?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Man, it was just <em>so </em>much fun. So, so much fun. Honestly. There's a ton of massive-scale weirdness, but that's just what makes this role such a dream--it sucks I can't spoil, but there are things I got to do as Lodi that I literally never, ever, <em>ever</em> would have imagined I'd get to do as an actor. Ever. <em>Ever</em>. Haha. The stakes are huge, everything matters in a cosmic, existence-in-the-balance way, but also, he's just a guy. Dealing with all of it. And he's smart, and adaptable, and kind, and open, which are all wonderful, useful tools, but also, someone just flipped the sheets of reality and spacetime on him, and he's got to take it all in and survive and integrate without letting his face twitch and giving him away. But I think with anything, as an actor, what you have, always and obviously, is the writing, and the thoughts and emotions and experiences of the character. And, if you're lucky, the eyes of another actor, which, for the cinematic stuff, I was very, very lucky: We got to do performance capture in Stockholm with multiple teams of wonderful people, including two truly amazingly gifted actors, Allyson Kulavis and Richard Sloniker--who are Destiny legends and, aside from voicing characters in the game, have done the physical and facial performances of so many characters over the life of the series--who made my job so very much easier.</p><p dir="ltr">We started with [performance capture], which was fantastic, so I had Allyson and Richard as scene partners (and patient, expert PCap mentors, because I'd never done it) to help ground the performance. All I had to do was lose myself in what I imagined Lodi was thinking and feeling and look at their eyes and what they were experiencing, and I was there. And so then, when we did all the booth-recording sessions over the past year, I had that week in Sweden with the team and Allyson and Richard as a foundation, which was such a help, because you're just in a booth by yourself imagining things.</p><p dir="ltr">As for humanity: The humanity is in the writing. Really. The narrative team on Edge of Fate is incredible (and kind!), and they not only created what was, for me, an instantly relatable character; they were immensely supportive--they had a very clear direction in mind, and everything was very precisely scripted, but they also made me feel very, very free to bring my own natural cadences and pauses and vocal idiosyncrasies, and really my whole self and personality to Lodi.</p><p dir="ltr">Early on, I knew the scope of this story was huge--there are almost-incomprehensible cosmic elements, there's interstellar time travel and unknowable space-deities and space wizards and the end of existence, not to mention that it's Destiny, so there are 10-years-plus of incredible performances and storytelling and an incredible, passionate community and tradition and just a whole, whole lot available there that I could choose to pressure myself to live up to if I wanted to. But I'll give myself credit for one thing, which is that I pretty instinctively felt like looking at any of that in that way wasn't part of the job. The job is this guy, and what he's thinking and feeling. What he <em>says</em> isn't even my job. That's taken care of. Just be open, and trust, and don't put any judgment or anything extra on it, and <em>trust</em>, and take a step into the unknown. And trust. Kinda like the guy himself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560275-kepler_invitation_altar_of_relativity_with_ikora_01-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560275" data-ratio="0.56296296296296" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560275-kepler_invitation_altar_of_relativity_with_ikora_01-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560275"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560275-kepler_invitation_altar_of_relativity_with_ikora_01-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Lodi is a really interesting character within the scope of Destiny 2 also, because he's maybe the most fish-out-of-water anyone can be, and anyone </strong><em><strong>has</strong></em><strong> been, in Destiny 2--but he also has to be authoritative in some ways, guiding the player through the course of the story. So what was it like trying to balance those two aspects?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Again, it's kinda like the job itself. And in a way, kind of like any job an actor walks into. To paraphrase the brilliant and kind Alison Lührs, Bungie's narrative director, Lodi's a fish out of water, but he's also the most qualified fish from that particular pond. So, as an actor, you come with your own set of experience and skills and perspective, and you can feel some level of confidence and comfort in that, and in the fact that you're here, that the artists creating this story saw something in you that seemed to fit, in their estimation, so you must be somehow "right," in some way, for the job. (That, or the other guy wasn't available.) But so, you were chosen for this purpose. You're "qualified," say. But also, this job is different, and enormous, and strange, and there's a lot riding on it. So, what do you do? You do what Lodi does. He's like the S-Tier fake-it-'til-you-make-it guy. And don't we all kind of do that? Or, not fake it. Trust it. More positive. Trust-it-'til-you-bust-it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What was the most interesting or compelling part of playing Lodi for you? What drew you to the role?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Well, everything, which isn't a good answer, but it's the honest one. Literally everything about this guy was interesting and compelling to me. We also share a somewhat uncanny amount of similarities on the page. We both love languages and people, we're both pacifists at heart, we both share a primary passion of communication and connection, we're both part Latino and speak Spanish but totally pass for a regular white dude, we're both peacemakers to a fault--I mean, it gets silly. I even loved ceviche before I went vegetarian. (I mean, I guess I still love it, technically.) We also kind of look alike.</p><p dir="ltr">One element of the character and story I will say I particularly enjoyed was that there was a fair amount of situational comedy that arose from being "guy from '60s cast into spacemagicfuture." There were some really, really fun beats to play with Lodi when he was getting fully discombobulated while trying to keep his cover and fit in with people who knows how many centuries past his frame of reference. He's like the ultimate, "How do you do, fellow kids?" guy, which, come to think of it, is another similarity we share. I kind of feel like I've been functionally 40 since I was 17. (Without, like, all the responsibility and knowing-about-stocks stuff.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560276-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_abilities_compressed_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560276-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_abilities_compressed_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4560276-2025_apollo_launch_press_kit_abilities_compressed_03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Were there any particular movies or performances that inspired you in bringing Lodi to life? Any other inspirations?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV: </strong>I got Kyle McLachlan/Dale Cooper tossed at me lightly, which made me squeal <em>very</em> audibly in the booth, because I'm a massive Lynch and Twin Peaks fan. And there was maybe, I think, a little mention of The X-Files. But honestly, it might sound boring, my North Star, so to speak, was the writing and Lodi himself. There were some <em>very</em> interesting and fun references made while discussing how to approach Lodi's other--let's say "personalities," to avoid spoilers?--but I'm honestly not sure I'm at liberty to discuss those. Heh. Man. That's why this character rules. I really got to do so, so much with him that I never ever saw coming.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are you aware of the theory that Lodi assassinated JFK? Follow up: Did Lodi assassinate JFK? Have you got a different theory? We're okay with headcanon for this one.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>BV</strong>: Sorry, hold on. I think I'm getting a call. I probably need to answer this.</p>

              <p>Backing up your files is something everyone should think about, especially if you don’t want to risk losing important stuff on your computer. Not everyone can or wants to pay for fast SSD drives, and that’s where classic external hard drives still shine.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/">Amazon is offering a fantastic discount on the Seagate Portable 4TB external hard drive – it’s dropped to just $99 from $125</a>. That’s about <strong>two cents a gigabyte</strong>&nbsp;which is just utterly fantastic if you need a lot of space without spending a fortune.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speedy Transfers</h2>
<p>This drive’s got USB 3.0 which means it’s speedy enough to transfer big files without leaving you waiting forever. And it’s very low-maintenance as well, reads perfectly fine from PCs, Macs and even PlayStation and Xbox. And it doesn’t need a separate power supply since it gets its juice directly from the USB port.</p>
<p>Size-wise, the Seagate portable HDD is thin and light so it won’t be holding you back if you’re accidentally tossing it in your bag. It’s for everyday wear and tear use, so don’t fret about a little bump or two.</p>



<p>And with 4TB of storage, you’ve got plenty of room: We’re talking thousands of photos, stacks of high-definition videos, and hundreds of music files – all in a secure, easy-to-reach location. It’s a good alternative or supplement to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-cloud-storage">cloud storage services</a>, if you want your things close at hand or can’t always trust the internet for backups.</p>
<p>The additional sweet touch is the free one-year Rescue Data Recovery Service: That’s right, if anything does happen (like accidentally deleting files or a hardware failure), <strong>you’ve got experts standing by to assist in getting your data back</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, SSDs are faster because they don’t have moving parts but they’re sometimes ridiculously pricey, especially if you require more than a few hundred gigs. That’s where hard drives like this Seagate shine through – they offer tons of space for far less money. If you’re looking for a high-capacity device that won’t break the bank, this deal is definitely worth considering.</p>

<p>The Borderlands 4 collector’s edition looks like something that many fans of the series might be interested in investing in.</p>



<p>However, purchasing games with various editions has become more complicated. Will it come with the game? How will the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content included affect your overall experience</a>? Will the items included actually be worth your money?</p>



<p>You should always know what you are getting into when you purchase something, so here is the answer to whether or not the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition comes with the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-get-a-copy-of-borderlands-4-with-the-collector-s-edition">Do You Get a Copy of Borderlands 4 With the Collector’s Edition?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, no, the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition does not come with a copy of the game. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-price-game-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford</a> has posted on X calling the bundle “pretty rad” and saying it would likely sell out, the answer to our question is answered in his tweet.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Collector’s Edition of Borderlands 4 available for Pre-Order at GameStop. It’s pretty rad and will probably sell out, so grab it if you’re into it:<a href="https://t.co/6eOZ9GYC4g">https://t.co/6eOZ9GYC4g</a></p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1934641019636818196?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The image for the bundle displays everything included with your purchase, but it is accompanied by big wording in the bottom right-hand corner saying the game is not included.</p>



<p>Why would Gearbox make a collector’s edition that doesn’t include the game? Like many other examples, it likely comes down to businesses trying to fool consumers into purchasing more. Not including the game does “technically” make the collector’s edition cheaper. However, if you’re buying the collector’s edition, you’re also likely to buy the game, so Gearbox and GameStop don’t have to advertise the purchase at over $200, but they would still be getting all of that money anyway.</p>

<p>Otherwise known as the ECHO-4 bundle, this GameStop exclusive will set anyone purchasing it back $150 and comes included with the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>8 in tall figure of ECHO-4 with LED lights</li>



<li>Cloth map of Kairos</li>



<li>Four double-sided art prints featuring the game’s vault hunters</li>



<li>Vault symbol necklace</li>



<li>SHiFT code card that rewards five golden keys upon redemption</li>
</ul>



<p>While the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition bundle comes with a pretty cool-looking figure that is definitely the main selling point, it seems that this all seems rather overpriced without the game. You are looking at a minimum of $220 to get the full experience here, and that’s if you don’t end up upgrading your standard copy of the game to the $100 deluxe edition or $130 super deluxe. Both of those come with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various DLCs</a> not included in the ECHO-4 bundle.</p>



<p>We’re not here to tell you what to do with your money, but the Borderlands 4 collector’s edition doesn’t appear worth the money to us. The only in-game benefit you get from the bundle is the five key codes, and with that, you’re guaranteed to be spending over $200 on the game to benefit from weapons that will likely be replaced in your inventory soon. The other items included look like something you could easily find on eBay in a few months for a cheaper price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-gaming-mini-pc-with-ryzen-7-5825u-costs-5x-less-than-a-macbook-pro-amazon-clearing-final-stock-2000622450</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-gaming-mini-pc-with-ryzen-7-5825u-costs-5x-less-than-a-macbook-pro-amazon-clearing-final-stock.1286949/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not all of us can buy a MacBook Pro or the new ASUS ROG gaming laptop. If your pocket is tight, there are surprisingly cheaper options that deliver just as much punch. One such option is the <strong>GMKtec M5 Plus</strong> gaming mini PC (Ryzen 7 5825U, 32GB RAM 1TB SSD), <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3868/">now available on Amazon at an unbeatable price of $319, originally priced at $400</a>. This is a great discount and with such a price, it’s an excellent opportunity to acquire a mini PC for both gaming and office use.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3868/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Gaming Mini PC</h2>
<p>The GMKtec M5 Plus comes with an AMD <strong>Ryzen 7 5825U processor which is a modern processor that offers 8 cores and 16 threads</strong>. The processor is 2.0GHz in base speed but is capable of turbo boosting up to 4.5GHz when energy mode settings are optimized. This is significantly more efficient than previous generations like Ryzen 7 5700U with about 35% more performance.</p>
<p>Within the memory division, the M5 Plus comes equipped with 32GB of DDR4 RAM that runs in dual channel which is a rich provision for a mini PC in this range. If you ever need to push it further, the system is expandable up to 64GB. With such a figure of RAM, you can go about office tasks, heavy browsing sessions, and gaming without feeling any delay. Storage won’t hinder you either, with a speedy 1TB PCIe 3.0 SSD.</p>



<p>Networking is also addressed quite nicely with dual NIC LAN ports providing 2.5Gbps Ethernet speeds. That is a big bonus if you need good internet to stream or play online games. The speed of Ethernet here is way more than usual gigabit connections, eliminating lag and buffering. With WiFi 6E thrown in, you’ve got solid, quick wireless that handles multiple devices easily and Bluetooth 5.2 keeps your headphones, mouse, and keyboard plugged.</p>
<p>Its graphics are processed by the on-board AMD Radeon Graphics 8-core processor with a speed of 2000 MHz.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon decided to spice up this Tuesday with some quick fire flash sales, and one of them is honestly hard to ignore. Portable chargers usually mean something small for your phone, but this deal is on a proper laptop-grade power bank from Anker.</p>
<p>It comes with a <strong>gigantic 25,000mAh capacity and three 100W USB-C ports</strong>. The kicker? It’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3864/">dropped to $94 from $135, which is an all-time low at Amazon</a>. Over <strong>60% of the stock is already gone</strong>, so if this interests you, you should probably get it while it’s available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3864/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Airline-Approved</h2>
<p>Most power banks are fine for topping off your phone a time or twice but the second you throw a MacBook (or even a Switch) into the mix, they fold over pretty easily. That is why this model is so coveted: You get <strong>three USB-C ports and each of them can do up to 100W of power</strong>. That means: you can really charge a laptop while out without keeping an eye on the battery draining otherwise.</p>
<p>With <strong>25,000mAh available</strong>, you’re looking at multiple phone charges or good laptop support for hours. If you’re a travel bug, that means extended flights or train trips with no worry of the battery going below 5% when you need it the most. And since this monster is smart about replenishing itself, it doesn’t take forever to refuel. With its 100W input system, you can charge to 30% in 22 minutes. That’s long enough to throw it on the charger while brewing your morning coffee before a flight and be ready to roll. And yes,<strong> it’s airline-approved, under the 100Wh boundary</strong>, so safe in overhead bins.</p>



<p>Unlike most chunky power banks, <strong>this has two internal USB-C cables inside</strong>. One extends up to 2.3 feet but retracts neatly when not being used and the other is a shorter cable that doubles as a strap for carrying the unit around. Both are tested for durability so they won’t deteriorate from regular use. No more digging through your bag or praying you had remembered to grab the right cord. The cords are preattached, which is the kind of little win that makes life a tiny bit easier.</p>
<p>You can definitely have more than two or three devices: <strong>Four devices can be charged at the same time by this unit</strong>: the two inbuilt cables, the extra USB-C port, and one standard USB-A port. That would mean that you could be charging a MacBook, a phone, a pair of headphones and some other device at the same time.</p>
<p>Anker has already established a reputation that is conducive to faith in its chargers, and this one does not disappoint in any way: massive capacity, bidirectional fast charging, intelligent design, and the ability of actually keeping a laptop alive. For $94, it’s a take-and-go type of deal you’ll be sorry not to have woken up to. The only real catch?<strong> Stock isn’t going to hold out for long</strong>.</p>

<p>The original Backyard Football game is being re-released on Steam and mobile devices.</p>



<p>Playground Games announced on Tuesday that Backyard Football 99 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170570/Backyard_Football_99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will launch on Tuesday, September 9</a>. Like past re-releases of the original Backyard Sports titles, Backyard Football will include legendary NFL players such as Jerry Rice, Dan Marino, Randall Cunningham, Steve Young, Barry Sanders, John Elway, Drew Bledsoe, and more. In total, there will be 30 NFL legends to pick for your squad.</p>



<p>The game also features a Single Game mode and a 14-game season mode. There are even classic on-field power ups such as “Hocus Pocus”, “Leap Frog”, “Cough Drop”, and “Spring Loaded”.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The re-release of Backyard Football follows past launches of Backyard Baseball ’97, Backyard Baseball ’01, and Backyard Soccer. In addition to the aforementioned four games, Playground Productions and Mega Cat Studios are continuing with work on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-more-backyard-sports-classics-are-coming-to-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other classic Backyard Sports titles</a> like Backyard Basketball and Backyard Hockey. </p>



<p>In addition to the re-release of classic titles, Playground Productions is planning on releasing brand new Backyard Sports titles. When those will come, however, is currently unknown.</p>

The award-winning UK studio—known for working on titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Still Wakes the Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dear Esther</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-following-management-buyout">divested from Tencent-owned parent company Sumo Group in July</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a bid to secure its future.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a decision that resulted in the studio becoming a born-again indie and one that should enable it to continue creating original titles. The downside, as has so often been the case recently, came in the form of layoffs. It's unclear how many people were made redundant as a result of that management buyout (MBO), but some employees won't be around to witness the dawn of the new era.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How, though, did The Chinese Room arrive here around seven years after it was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-dear-esther-i-dev-the-chinese-room-acquired-by-sumo-digital">acquired by Sumo</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a deal reportedly worth £2.2 million ($3 million)? And, perhaps even more importantly, where does the esteemed UK studio go from here? We sought answers to both of those questions and more at Gamescom 2025, where we sat down with studio director Ed Daly.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a candid conversation, Daly suggests the writing was on the wall for The Chinese Room at Sumo Group towards the end. For instance, he explains the development team was happy with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Still Wakes the Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which he says performed "pretty well" and managed to win over critics. Yet, despite those perceived wins, he claims Sumo wasn't necessarily happy with the returns being generated by original projects.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/evil-empire-tells-devs-to-avoid-early-access-unless-their-project-is-90-percent-complete" target="_self" data-discover="true">Evil Empire tells devs to avoid early access unless their project is 90 percent complete</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Given that, you can maybe see that at some point, Tencent or Sumo would decide 'we can't keep investing' [in original products]. I think Tencent would love to have a great new hit IP, but achieving that via Sumo maybe wasn't happening," says Daly.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Daly confirms The Chinese Room had planned to work on two more original projects that would have been funded by Sumo. Yet, when its parent company announced it would be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sumo-group-ditching-original-franchises-to-focus-exclusively-on-co-development-work">focusing exclusively on work-for-hire projects</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Brighton-based studio had to search for a future beyond the shadow of that corporate umbrella.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At that point, Daly explains The Chinese Room had two options: The first was to seek out another conglomerate that might be interested in acquiring the studio. The second was to pursue an MBO and become independent.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Daly didn't completely rule out the prospect of another acquisition at first, but says there was trepidation as to whether a prospective new owner would have allowed The Chinese Room to continue building original titles, or would instead position the company as a dedicated support studio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Maybe [the acquisition option] would have worked, but the alternative opened up," he says. "We thought 'there's a business plan we can produce that means we can fund the company' and it became a no-brainer. There is something to be said for the so-called security that comes of being part of a larger business, but the moment it seemed that we could actually [complete the MBO] it became really compelling for the studio to give that a go. Like I said, we had these two projects that we were really excited about. They were in the pre-production stage and we were really determined to make sure we see these games through and get them made."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frost-giant-ceo-tim-morten-says-layoffs-are-possible-after-stormgate-underperforms" target="_self" data-discover="true">Frost Giant CEO Tim Morten says layoffs are possible after Stormgate underperforms</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;There is no other business plan in town other than one in which we reduce our costs&quot;">"There is no other business plan in town other than one in which we reduce our costs"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Who, though, remains to wrangle those mystery titles into existence? Daly explains The Chinese Room currently comprises 55 employees and confirms the studio was "bigger" before the MBO. He explains it's difficult to discuss how many people were laid off because there is nuance involved. For instance, he notes that some people transferred to other divisions within Sumo before The Chinese Room bolted for the exit. So, while they're no longer with the studio, they are still employed.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even so, he says it was "disappointing to have to lose people" but claims there was no other way for the company to successfully execute a buyout. "There is no other business plan in town other than one in which we reduce our costs," he explains. "But it was good that some roles were offered to people at Sumo—for them to transfer to other studios—to reduce the impact of that."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/newsbrief-devcom-to-rebrand-as-gamescom-dev" target="_self" data-discover="true">Devcom to rebrand as Gamescom Dev</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the dust beginning to settle, Daly is hoping The Chinese Room can use the MBO and the opportunity it presents to reset. The indie landscape—and wider game industry—has changed dramatically since the studio was last independent in 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and subsided, bringing with it rampant investment that has since dried up after that particular bubble burst with aplomb. Now, in a world where companies big and small are struggling to secure financing and conglomerates seem intent on swallowing all in their path, Daly suggests the only way forward is to manage expectations with pinpoint precision.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Life is easier if budgets are large because you can take your time, play around, and make some mistakes. That approach no longer feels sustainable," he continues. "So, for our new games we're essentially funding them ourselves at the moment, but we will be looking for partners to help us with that at some point. Beyond that, and maybe it seems like this has always been the case to an extent, but we need to pick our battles, manage scope, and avoid spending too much too quickly before we're ready. I think everyone has become more cost-conscious, which I don't think is a bad thing."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Independence also brings more agility. Daly says having fewer stakeholders means The Chinese Room is able to make decisions more quickly, which can help save money. The studio is also committed to building on previous successes rather than starting from scratch each time it kickstarts a new project. For many companies that will be par for the course, but those are the marginal gains that could make the difference for an indie outfit attempting to bring original experiences to market.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact that studio bosses like Daly are now openly talking about the need to scope more efficiently and pragmatically is perhaps the most significant shift.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It feels like, three or four years ago, we were almost under pressure to talk up budgets for games to be taken seriously. So, sometimes we almost had the inverse problem where we had to figure out how to make a game that costs $10 million to $20 million," he continues. "At the moment, lots of people will be dealing with budgets in the low-single-millions to create double-A projects or whatever you want to call them. It's a big change."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Chinese Room doesn't want to spend more than three years bringing a game to market">The Chinese Room doesn't want to spend more than three years bringing a game to market</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked whether those tightening pursestrings might actually do some good in the long run, Daly seems optimistic. "I think it has got be healthy if games are viable and make a profit and recoup their cost. It's not going to work if everybody's expectations are being dashed left, right, and center. That isn't sustainable," he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You know, tools are better. It's becoming a little bit easier to build certain games. We're all-in with Unreal and that's helpful. I don't think it takes away from the creative opportunity to do something original and different even if budgets are half what they were three or four years ago, but we just need to make sure we're not being wasteful."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that philosophy in mind, Daly explains The Chinese Room is keen to cap production cycles at around three years for the foreseeable future. There's also the question as to whether the studio can be more proactive in ensuring its titles have greater permanence.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Everything we've done in the past, we just built the game, shipped it, and then moved on. We're never going to make a live service game, but we're looking at how we can [ensure longevity]. There's early access. There's a model that's more DLC oriented—or kind of an episodic model. We're interested in how we can get the new game out there maybe at a smaller initial scope, because spending three, four, five years [making a game] is not super appealing at the moment."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creatively, Daly explains The Chinese Room remains focused on building character-driven experiences that take place in deeply-researched, authentic worlds. "There'll certainly be an emphasis on narrative and world building," he says, before noting that both of the studio's original projects are currently in pre-production.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, Daly emphasizes the studio wants its next original titles to be more "mechanically rich" than their predecessors and offer more scope in terms of player agency. Given Daly mentioned the ideal production timeframe for those projects is no more than three years, we ask where he wants The Chinese Room to be when 2028 rolls around.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think [the ideal scenario] is to have launched that next game and for it to demonstrate the way we've evolved our creative strategy," he says. "I think it would be great to know that everyone in the team also feels secure about the future and to be able to focus without the distraction of 'where is the next deal going to come from?' Over the past year or so there have been a few distractions around the business, and it'd be nice to not have those."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer attended Gamescom 2025 via the Gamescom Media Ambassador Program, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

              <p>Gaming laptops do not come at bargain prices. If you’ve ever been walking around for one, you know that the instant you want to have powerful specifications, you’re facing a giant check. That’s why this Amazon sale is like a sweet surprise at the start of the school year. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3860/">2025 ASUS ROG Strix G16 ( has just dropped to $1,274, down from its $1,500 price point</a>, its all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3860/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fantastic Gaming Laptop</h2>
<p>This is a proper gaming machine, not a stripped-down entry-level model. At its heart, it’s powered by the new <strong>Intel Core i7-14650HX which is one of Intel’s latest 14th Gen laptop processors</strong> and built to handle demanding games. Pair that up with <strong>NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 5060 Laptop GPU</strong>, based on the fresh <strong>Blackwell architecture</strong>, and you’re ready for modern titles with cutting-edge performance. It also supports DLSS 4, NVIDIA’s new AI-driven upscaling tech, so you can enjoy more frame rates from your favorite games without sacrificing visual quality.</p>
<p>Of course, however, power is just half the tale. You need speed and room for your stuff, and this box has both: It comes with <strong>16GB of DDR5 memory</strong> clocked at 5.6GHz, so running lots of different apps at once or streaming your games is silky-smooth. Storage is also generous: <strong>a 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD</strong> gives you speed and space. That’s space for a ton of current AAA games, plus your work, media, and files.</p>



<p>The screen on the ROG Strix G16 deserves some special mention as well: A <strong>16-inch FHD+ display with 16:10 aspect ratio and scorching 165Hz refresh rate</strong> ensures gaming is truly gratifying. That higher refresh rate doesn’t just help with competitive games: it’s also smoothes out scrolling websites, video watching, and even everyday motion. With a 3ms response time, ghosting and blur are reduced.</p>
<p>ASUS has also relied on its ROG Intelligent Cooling solution which involves a<strong> full vapor chamber layout, tri-fan technology, and liquid metal to help cool the CPU</strong>. Translation: you can push the hardware more aggressively without worrying about thermal throttling, and fans stay reasonably controlled compared to past versions. If you’re sweating out a marathon gaming session or exporting a video project, the machine has learned how to stay stable.</p>
<p>At $1,274, this deal really hits a sweet spot: You’re getting a brand-new 2025 model that combines powerful internals with thoughtful display features and cutting-edge cooling in a design that looks sharp. The biggest challenge may not be choosing it but catching it before Amazon runs out of stock!</p>

              <p>After a weekend of online speculation, conspiracies, and jokes about President Donald Trump’s current state of health, the controversial leader held a conference in the White House that was technically about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-09-02-25#cmf2wdo1d00053b6tx5yccrld">Space Command moving from Colorado to Alabama</a>, but served as a proof of life for many online. And when he appeared alive and mostly well, a lot of people were disappointed.</p> <p>Starting late last week, <a href="https://www.doomsdayscenario.co/p/it-s-time-to-have-a-serious-conversation-about-trump-s-health">rumors began to swirl online that something had happened to President Donald Trump</a>. Reports of music being played in the Rose Garden led some to speculate that it was covering up doctors shouting or the aging President crying out in pain. As the weekend continued, Trump seemed to spend most of the holiday inside the White House. When he did appear outside, photos showed a man who many claimed looked extremely tired, out of it, and sickly. It didn’t help that the White House and Trump shared a photo that claimed to be the President golfing over the weekend, but which was actually from earlier. <a href="https://x.com/adamscochran/status/1962233429770285093">A popular thread</a> spread on Twitter with all sorts of claims, including theories related to Trump keeping his mouth open more often and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-hand-bruise-health-updates.html">bruises seen on his hands</a>.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-09-02-25#cmf2biaiq00003b6sjz4wbr6o">So when the White House announced on Monday</a> that Trump was going to make an announcement about…something, people were extremely curious to see the president. Was he dead? Was he alive? Was he being puppeted by VP JD Vance? Sadly for those wishing for the worst, Trump appeared mostly fine and as stable as you’d expect during his Tuesday conference.</p>

 <p>On YouTube and Twitch, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3lxurt3xo4k2z">the chat quickly turned hostile</a> and disappointed when Trump appeared and began speaking without any signs of a stroke or other medical issue. And on BlueSky and other social media platforms, people expressed their disappointment that Trump was still alive and kicking. Others pored over every frame of him talking during the event to see if they could spot any signs of something wrong.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update on the white house stream, chat is disappointed <a href="https://t.co/Y95jgJANYX">pic.twitter.com/Y95jgJANYX</a></p> <p>— RAYMAGEDDON‼️ (@Raymagedd0n) <a href="https://twitter.com/Raymagedd0n/status/1962951241513713695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>          <p>At one point during the conference, which was primarily about Trump moving Space Command’s HQ from Colorado to Alabama, Trump was asked by a reporter about the rumors of his death and medical emergency over the holiday weekend. This didn’t go over well with Trump, who first denied hearing about this, and then seemingly confirmed he had heard the rumors about his untimely demise.</p>   <p>“I also did a number of Truths,” he said, referring to his posts on social media network Truth Social. “Long Truths, and I think pretty poignant Truths,” said Trump. “No, I was very active over the weekend.” Trump also claimed the media, aka “Fake News,” incorrectly reported on his death or illness, adding: “[The media asked] Is he okay? How’s he feeling? What’s wrong?”</p> <p>Here’s the video of the full conference, which, as of 3:15 pm EST, was still dragging as Trump talked about many other topics, including school shootings, elections, and more.</p>
