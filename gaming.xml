</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Tonight, as part of the Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, called Beyond the Strand, we got a new update on the studio's peculiar work-in-progress, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/od">OD</a>.
</p>
<p>The title, which Kojima has previously referred to as "a game and at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media", got a new trailer during the livestream, as the developer was joined by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a>.</p>
<p>"At Xbox, we empower creators to push boundaries, and that's exactly the game that OD is," said Xbox CEO Phil Spencer when he turned up on stage. Kojima added that he wanted to 'go over the system' of films and games, before showing some footage of OD running on the Unreal Engine (assumedly Unreal Engine 5). This is most likely because the Xbox-backed title isn't allowed to use Guerilla's Decima engine, which is owned by Sony.</p>
<p>You can see the latest trailer here as part of the livestream below. "It's very scary," warns Kojima. I do have to say, the motion capture is astounding, if nothing else. The game gets a new tagline: 'For all players and screamers'.</p>

<p>"We have one goal in mind: to bring Kojima's vision to life for all players everywhere," wraps up Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>The game has a new subtitle: Knock, because Kojima wants to create the fear of the 'knock' - "I am afraid of the 'knock' sound, so I wanted to make that very frightening," says Kojima. Kojima cryptically notes that Jordan Peele is working on another part of the OD experience, so that subtitle, Knock, may refer to a specific episode Kojima is working on himself - it's currently unclear.</p>
<p>Kojima also joked that he 'wants to win an award' for being the first person to motion-capture a ghost, and that the scariest experience of all was standing on-stage next to Phil Spencer. Relatable.</p>
<p>So, what else do we know about OD? </p>
<p>The game first surfaced via rumours in 2022, when word online suggested Kojima was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-latest-project-is-reportedly-a-horror-game-called-overdose">working on a horror title called Overdose</a>. This turned out to be true, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">we got a 10-minute blowout on the game</a> that didn't, really, reveal anything at all. 
</p><p>At least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoUJh7W2xsY">we got a trailer</a> featuring Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier - all reciting the same eerie rhyme, and each with a different emotional emphasis, as the camera held steady on their faces. It ended with a door slowly creaking open, as seen reflected in Lillis' eyes, and a terrified scream. Intriguing.

<p>The Nintendo version launched in July of this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="WWE 2K25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c45ef279a6a5/wwe-2k25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo, 2K</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just months after the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> on the Switch 2, 2K Games has now revealed the title's server shutdown date.</p>
<p>As of <strong>14th March 2027</strong>, all online features and services will end for the title. Offline services like Play Now, Showcase MyRISE, MyGM and Universe will continue to be playable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scheduled Online Services Retirement Date</strong></p>
<p><strong>WWE 2K25:</strong> "Online features and services are scheduled to be available until 14th March 2027."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives the title a two-year lifespan since its original release for <em>other</em> platforms on 14th March 2025. Based on this, the time frame is even less for Nintendo players as the Switch 2 version was only released on 23rd July 2025. The physical version of this particular entry is also a "code-in-box".</p>
<p>Ahead of the shutdown of WWE 2K25, 2K will also end online services for <strong>WWE 2K24</strong> on 5th January 2026.</p>
<p>Although the winding down of online services in games doesn't appear to be stopping any time soon, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/it-will-have-a-chilling-effect-on-game-design-eu-group-responds-to-stop-killing-games">'Stop Killing Games' consumer movement</a> has been attempting to challenge the legality of publishers "destroying" certain video games sold to customers by revoking access following the cessation of online support.</p>
<p>Recently, a video game lobbying group in Europe (made up of major players in the game industry including Nintendo, Microsoft and more) put forth an argument that maintaining online support indefinitely could have a "chilling effect on game design" and act as a disincentive to make such games available in particular regions.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this and WWE 2K25 in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<figure><a title="Street Fighter 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8af306929e64e/street-fighter-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you've been hanging out for a Switch 2 eShop bargain, it seems the first major third-party one has arrived. Capcom is currently offering <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> (which was a launch title for Nintendo's new system in June) for half price in the US.</p>
<p>This takes this title, which has now surpassed five million combined sales globally, from $39.99 down to just $19.99.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is the base game, so the DLC and Season Pass content is locked off, but there's still a lot on offer. This includes three major game modes and a roster of 18 fighters, including new faces and returning fan favourites. It also features some special gyro game modes exclusive to the Switch 2 version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7xhpotl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Old McPalworld has a farm.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld is getting its first-ever official spin-off game from developer Pocketpair, and it's looking just a little bit cozier than the original game. It's called Palworld: Palfarm, and as the name implies, you and your gaggle of Pals will be farming, crafting, and living a life on the land together on an adventure that looks far more Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley than Palworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair announced the game today with a brand new trailer, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Steam page</a>. These reveal that Palfarm will be a slice-of-life farming and crafting sim set on the Palpagos Islands where familiar Pals will join you to build a dream farm. Alongside growing plants, you can cook with Pals, shop at their stores, give them gifts, and- no, no you can't eat them. Of course not. Not this time. They're farming buddies. Not food.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld: Palfarm First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, most of them. Some Pals will apparently come raid your farm, and you'll have to fight them off. And then maybe when they die, they might drop stuff that looks like food. Okay, maybe you can kind of eat Pals in Palfarm too. Don't think about it too hard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Palfarm does seem to be more focused on the cuddlier aspects of life with Pals, including allowing the player to pet Pals and even get married to other humans (with Pals matchmaking and officiating), it's not without its edges. The trailer includes a look at a black market where you can, yes, get a gun. What would you do with a gun in a cozy game like this? Don't think about it too hard!!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, the trailer showed off a number of Pals that can join you to help on the farm, including what seems to be one unannounced new Pal, Sekhmet, that's working with Anubis as a blacksmith. The Steam page also makes it clear that multiplayer will be an option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palfarm doesn't have a release date just yet, and so far only appears to be in development for PC via Steam, though given Palworld's trajectory it's possible other platforms are in the cards for later on. Palworld itself is currently still in early access, but Pocketpair has said it's planning a small update in December, and is working toward a big 1.0 launch sometime next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision and Treyarch have published a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</u></a> multiplayer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGFYtZD53ZA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reveal trailer</u></a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-deep-dive" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>deep dive blog post</u></a> that shows players everything they need to know ahead of its upcoming beta test.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers behind Call of Duty 2025 offered a multiplayer breakdown in a new post published on the series’ website today. It comes with information about every last map, weapon, and mode fans can expect in Black Ops 7, both during the beta and at launch, while showing off a sneak peek at what it all looks like in motion with today’s trailer. You can see the Black Ops 7 multiplayer reveal trailer, with Travis Scott and Playboi Carti’s FE!N providing the musical backdrop, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s Black Ops 7 multiplayer reveal trailer hits the highlights for those who have about two and a half minutes to spare. While players can be seen darting around corners, sliding and shooting at enemies, and even wall-jumping to reach high-up areas, the footage serves as a reminder that this year’s Call of Duty lets players take advantage of near-future technology. These can be seen in futuristic tools like the Echo Unit hologram decoy as well as Scorestreaks, such as the D.A.W.G. quadruped robot and the remote-controlled Rhino soldier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Classic Call of Duty Scorestreaks like the RC-XD, UAV, Care Package, and more are back, too, with players now able to unlock Overclock upgrades that can improve their usefulness in unique ways. The UAV, for example, has Overclock options that equip it with a flare for missile defense and lower its score cost, while the Rhino gains access to an improved radar and extended runtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch, of course, still has more up its sleeve, but today’s Black Ops 7 multiplayer reveal really pulls back the curtain on what players can expect when beta early access begins October 2 and at launch. While the beta will only allow access to a limited selection of the content available when Black Ops 7’s November release date arrives, we at least know which of the 18 launch maps players can try out in a few weeks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Scorestreaks</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Maps, Modes, and More</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 7 will launch with 16 Core 6v6 maps. Six from that lineup will be included in the beta, with three returning from 2012’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. You can see the full list of Core maps, as well as the two 20v20 Skirmish maps, below.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Core 6v6 Maps</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Blackheart (Beta)</li><li>Cortex (Beta)</li><li>Exposure (Beta)</li><li>Imprint (Beta)</li><li>The Forge (Beta)</li><li>Toshin (Beta)</li><li>Colossus</li><li>Den</li><li>Flagship</li><li>Homestead</li><li>Paranoia</li><li>Retrieval</li><li>Scar</li><li>Express (Returning from <em>Black Ops 2</em>)</li><li>Hijacked (Returning from <em>Black Ops 2</em>)</li><li>Raid (Returning from <em>Black Ops 2</em>)</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Skirmish Maps</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mission: Edge</li><li>Mission: Tide</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Maps</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As per usual, a new Call of Duty means fan-favorite modes have been refreshed, with new modes for players to look forward to, too. Multiplayer mainstays like Team Deathmatch, Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Hardpoint will be available to play during the beta, with Free-For-All, Gunfight, Kill Order, Control, and Search and Destroy following at launch. There are also Face Off versions of many of these modes, giving players an option to experience classic modes while tuning down the chaos thanks to disabled Scorestreaks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main new mode given the spotlight today is Overload. Also available during the beta, the multiplayer option will see players tasked with bringing an Overload Device to control zones. It flips respawns on as teams guard their device carrier, suggesting teamwork will be an important element in order to achieve victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 7 sticks with tradition by offering new and returning modes, but there are even more gameplay-focused changes for longtime fans to learn, too. The three-Perk system, for example, is getting a facelift with a tweak called Hybrid Combat Specialties.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These are activated when pairing Perks from different categories, allowing players to flex their creative muscles by mixing and matching different Perks for unique upgrades. Some examples laid out by Treyarch include the red-and-blue Scout Specialty, which keeps players’ position temporarily concealed after a bullet elimination, as well as the blue-and-green Operative Specialty, which charges Field Upgrades with stealth kills. Treyarch’s Black Ops 7 multiplayer reveal breakdown also includes a first look at a feature that allows friends to share weapon builds with each other with Build Codes, while also granting the ability to access Gunsmith within the Firing Range in Multiplayer itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has a release date of November 14, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S. Those hoping to for a closer look at how Treyarch has updated its formula for this year’s Call of Duty can pre-order to play the early access beta from October 2 – 5, with the open beta following for all from October 5 – 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-major-game-faces-this-issue-activision-steps-up-war-on-pc-cheaters-ahead-of-black-ops-7-launch"><u>how Activision plans to tackle cheaters</u></a> when Black Ops 7 launches in a few months.

Admittedly, performance on Switch 2 isn't the best--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/io-acknowledges-hitman-performance-issues-on-switch-2-promises-fixes-are-coming/1100-6533116/">but fixes are on the way</a>--and this is a Game Key Card version of the game, so you'll need to have a chunk of free space on the Switch 2 SSD to store the game on.</p><p>You'll also get exclusive--and stylish--DLC, that you can use to dress Agent 47 up like a Mario or a Luigi cosplayer on the Paris fashion circuit.</p></div>                      </div><p>So what makes Hitman so great? Following the mixed reception to Hitman: Absolution, IO Interactive went back to basics with the next chapter in the series. The soft reboot of Hitman was released in an episodic format, and it was followed by Hitman 2 and Hitman 3 in short succession. Improvements from the sequels were retroactively applied to the older games, and the entire experience plays like a toybox for assassins.</p><p>Each mission gives you a target to pursue and execute--don't worry, they're always terrible people or actor Sean Bean--and the magic here comes from figuring out how to make each assassination look like a freak accident. There are opportunities to get rid of your marks with ballistic or neck-snapping methods, but it's far more fun to use killer Yoga, sabotaged race cars, or a vegan cake to deliver some karmic justice. The Hitman games have also been supported with several pieces of substantial post-launch content over the years</p><p>With this version of the game, you're also getting more than just dozens of highly replayable levels. Several modes like Contracts, Escalation, and the roguelike Freelancer will push your skills and your lethal creativity to the limit.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Skate</em> was a video game first released back in 2007 that wasn't particularly interested in the waning days of "skate culture", in so much as it had once existed through the lens of the Vans Warped Tour, Jackass and <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>. It was just a game about you, a skateboard and a public space.</p><p>Which meant it never achieved the same cultural (or commercial) success of the aforementioned Tony Hawk series, but it never wanted to. If Activision's games were about licensed music and weird costumes and fanciful stages, playing like a combo-obsessed fighting game, <em>Skate</em> was the opposite. It was all about the <em>skating</em>; it gave players a control scheme that felt like a simulation, was immensely satisfying to master and was rewarded with cult status as a result.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="skate. Game Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-53C6963x1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Skate </em>did not need to come back. It didn't need any more sequels, or remasters, or remakes, because despite its age it was still perfect, a video game truly representative of its time and place. But the brand carries weight, even after all these years, and publisher Electronic Arts exists these days solely to extract value from the things it owns. So in 2025 we have an all-new <em>Skate </em>game to play, and let me tell you, it fucking <em>sucks</em>.</p><p>The game is a marketplace shakedown in search of an audience. It's the Hello Fellow Kids meme stretched over 8.18GB of hard drive space. Its writing sounds like something penned by a marketing intern after four cans of Monster, its premise--that an AI is following you around telling you when you've unlocked a new tanktop in the skate store--closer to <a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-display-ai-rayban-glasses-ai-fail-demo-lmao-look-at-this-huge-dipshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something Mark Zuckerberg would demo on a stage</a> than anything you'd associate with skateboarding.</p><p>Like just tonally, in terms of letting this run in front of you, it's physically painful to sit through, in a way I haven't experienced since <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k23-2k-review-kotaku-mycareer-impressions-myteam-1849528793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last time I subjected myself to an <em>NBA 2K</em> career mode</a>. Everyone you meet in this game feels like a theater kid improvising as a serial Linkedin poster. The stages have the sanitised energy of an Olympics breakdancing venue based on a <em>Fortnite </em>map.</p><p>I hate everything about it! This game is deeply unpleasant to simply be around, and so the stuff it does do well--it's got blooper potential, the overall controls are similar to the originals and there are some interesting open-world stages where you can pull off some incredible stunts--don't matter. I will not talk about it here and will never explore any of that stuff because I would rather lick the paint off my door than see another lootbox screen or hear a robot tell me to collect my DaKs prize package. </p><figure><figcaption>If you're asking yourself why EA bothered bringing Skate back as a free-to-play game, this is why</figcaption></figure><p>You do not need to play this, you do not need to subject yourself to this, you're better than this! If you need to skate around doing tricks there are plenty of <em>Skate</em>-inspired clones, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-au/games/store/skate-2007/C3QWNCV55VLL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original is available for Xbox</a> or, if you're on PC, you know, you could just <em>find a way</em> to play it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-charlie-kirk-recreations"><h3>Why Major Events Like Charlie Kirk’s Death End Up On Roblox</h3></a><p>'It’s impossible to know who’s doing it for the lulls and the clicks and who’s doing it because they’re radicalizing'</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ea-skate-review-impressions]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Sometimes the difference between nailing that first-time shot or shanking it in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26 </a>comes down to what camera you’re using. With the wrong settings, working out where your support runners are or shots on goal can feel like a real pain.</p><p dir="ltr">But by carefully curating your camera settings to benefit you--and your setup--you can gain the upper hand in pretty much any game mode. So to help you win more games, we’ve been experimenting to find the best camera settings in EA Sports FC 26.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best camera settings for Ultimate Team</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>UT Competitive Camera:</strong> Disabled</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Single Player Camera:</strong> Co-op</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Multiplayer Camera:</strong> Co-op</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height:</strong> 20</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Zoom:</strong> 0*</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The <strong>co-op camera </strong>gives you the best view of the pitch, in our opinion. It’s a wide angle that gives you visibility on both halves, making it easier to spot player runs and target better through balls.</p><p dir="ltr">We’ve opted to max out the height of the camera to provide a more top-down view, while zoom is zeroed to give you the most visibility. However, if you’re playing on a large TV or sitting far away from your screen, you might want to increase the zoom level to make it easier to play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572413-best-camera-settings-fc-26.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4572413" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572413-best-camera-settings-fc-26.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4572413"></a><figcaption>Personalised camera settings make all the difference in online competitive Ultimate Team games, so spend your time learning what works for you.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572413-best-camera-settings-fc-26.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We’ve disabled the UT Competitive Camera, which is new to the game, only because we found it too distracting. The setting is meant to give you more visibility of the pitch while still showing off the stadium and its atmosphere. However, we’re here to win games--not look at the stands.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best camera settings for Rush</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Rush Camera:</strong> Rush Tactical</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height:</strong> 20</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Zoom:</strong> 0</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It’s a similar story for Rush. We’ve changed the camera from the default broadcast to Rush Tactical to improve overall visibility and provide more of a top-down view.</p><p dir="ltr">With only 10 players on a pitch at one time, you need to make use of the space around you - and you can only do that if you can actually see where the space is.</p><p dir="ltr">So those are the best camera settings in FC 26--in our view, at least. You’ll see lots of professional players and streamers playing with different settings online, but the important thing is to play around with them yourself to find what works for you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A newly discovered bug in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">open-world looter shooter <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is letting players use a specific legendary gun to fling themselves across large sections of the game’s map. It looks wild and could be useful for speedrunners. But Gearbox is watching the glitch and might, if needed, fix it to avoid technical problems.</p> <p>On September 19, Twitch streamer and content creator Bahroo shared a video of himself playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-tips-borderlands-4-guide-help-better-loot-gold-keys-side-quests-tricks-2000626554"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> while pulling off a technique known online as “Cricket Jumping.” The bug relies on a legendary handgun known as the “Noisy Cricket” and its powerful kick, which sends players flying backward. The gun itself is a reference to the <a href="https://meninblack.fandom.com/wiki/Noisy_Cricket">tiny gun with the same name seen in the ’90s sci-fi comedy film<em> Men In Black</em>.</a> Normally, this isn’t the most useful trait. But if you tab out or pause the game at the right time while charging up a shot with the Noisy Cricket, you can send yourself flying for miles. It’s wild to watch in action.</p>  <p>Cricket Jumping has been a known bug since at least September 16, <a href="https://youtu.be/g9qh_8N4QU0">as demonstrated in this short video</a> uploaded by YouTube user Platinum. But it wasn’t until Bahroo and other bigger streamers and creators began sharing videos of the technique that it caught on more and became more publicly known. And that attention eventually got Cricket Jumping spotted by <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s creative director Graeme Timmins. While you might assume someone from Gearbox would not be happy about this bug, Timmins seemed open to not patching it out, provided it doesn’t break the game.</p>

 <p>“I’ve got my eye on this,” replied Timmins to a video of the bug on Twitter. “My only worry is streaming issues or if this introduces instability. Not out to ruin people’s fun, but can’t have it cause tech issues. For now, tho, not going to do anything until proven issues arise.”</p> <p>So for now, it seems like Gearbox is going to let people Cricket Jump all around Kairos, assuming it doesn’t ruin the game for other players or introduce some nasty, less cool bug. Besides, I imagine <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">Gearbox has a lot more to fix in <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> right now, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">horrible console performance problems</a>, and isn’t too concerned about a silly super jump bug.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Our first trailer for the next <em>Star Wars</em> movie <a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542">has arrived</a>&nbsp;and it looks incredibly forgettable. Fans are picking apart a 90-second clip of <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> and mourning the franchise’s loss of visual identity. Is Disney’s take on the sci-fi galaxy far, far away cooked, or is this just how a movie about a dude in a helmet and a green puppet is going to look in the year 2025?</p> <p>Is the <em>Mandalorian and</em> <em>Grogu</em> trailer bad-looking? Yes. Is that sort of what I expected from the post-Disney+ entertainment industrial complex in the age of streaming? Also yes. Does any of this matter? Not to me. I did not stick around through three increasingly mediocre seasons of <em>The Mandalorian</em> for the second coming of Akira Kurosawa. I am coming to the movie to see some weird-looking aliens, goofy robots, and flashy lasers blow some stuff up. Even by those standards the teaser was a C minus, but the latest example of <em>Star Wars</em> mediocrity has some fans fully crashing out.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t want to sound negative but this trailer makes the movie feel more like a filler episode of the TV show.

My favorite, though, is this summary: “50% of the comments: Jimmy Kimmel and the Empire, 49.9% of the comments: This Looks Like Season 4, 0.01%: Somehow Razor Crest returned!” Folks on Reddit are taking things more in stride. “Kinda looks like it’s just supposed to be fun, which I totally dig,” reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMandalorianTV/comments/1nnlzpw/the_mandalorian_and_grogu_official_trailer/">the top reaction</a>. “Like if it’s just a movie length episode I’m down with that.”</p>

 <p>That is about what I expected as well. I think it’s partly a testament to how much the Disney <em>Star Wars</em> shows, even when they’re bad, have looked like big-budget productions that <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> movie just looks like a feature-length episode. I also think people are being a bit dramatic in rushing to judge a teaser for a film about back-bench characters who didn’t exist until just a few years ago against the most iconic stills across decades of original movies. It also feels like people have forgotten that Jon Favreau is directing.</p> <p>What are the most memorable shots that come to mind from <em>Elf</em>, <em>Zathura: A Space Adventure</em>, and <em>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</em>? I’ll wait. He’s not that type of director. The most visually arresting 60 seconds of footage he ever recorded was himself cooking a grilled cheese in <em>Chef</em>. He brings other virtues to his filmmaking, most of which are probably hard to get across in a 90-second teaser where almost no one talks. That is not a defense of <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>, but it’s a point worth keeping in mind when judging the pre-release marketing for a movie about a stoic cowboy and his green muppet baby that’s literally called <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-battle-of-hoth-board-game-review.1304820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s difficult to say what’s more exciting, a new game with a fresh setting and approach, or one built upon the gleaming DNA of a predecessor. Star Wars: Battle of Hoth certainly owes much of its appeal to Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, but it also bears an obligation to the classic World War II board game <a href="https://www.daysofwonder.com/game/memoir44/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memoir '44</a>. Publisher Days of Wonder has effectively taken that 20-year-old design and used it as a retrofitted vehicle to facilitate the most iconic Star Wars land battle on film. The results of this experiment are a lithe and approachable board game focused on dramatic action and brisk play.</p><div catalogid="bd7dc246-295d-44bb-b335-3884b5990eae" id="228251"><div id="228251" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: Battle of Hoth Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitching this as Memoir '44 reskinned to Star Wars is accurate. Original designer Richard Borg returns, enlisting the help of Adrien Martinot to adapt the hex-and-miniatures <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">wargame</a> to this beloved sci-fi series. This uses the same back-and-forth system where players take turns playing cards and then activating units. The framework is simple to grasp and it’s effective in establishing constraints, limiting which troops you can maneuver and attack with each turn. This models the chaos and uncertainty of control and command during conflict, but it also forces tough tactical decisions. All in all, it’s a smart system that elicits drama with minimal overhead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player has their own dedicated faction deck. On your turn, you play a single card from your hand which denotes one section of the board. The map is divided into thirds, including the left flank, center, and right flank. In addition to indicating one of these areas, it also lists a certain number of units in that area you can activate. Activated units move and then activate by chucking small pools of dice. It’s exceedingly straightforward and intuitive. What’s delightful is in how it restricts you at inopportune times, such as not allowing you to act on the right flank when your infantry squads are getting pounded and need support. Furthermore, you don’t know what cards your opponent is holding, mimicking a fog of war element, so it’s difficult to gauge where the counterattack and aggression will come from next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a scenario-driven game with a hefty 17 total missions. Victory is decided by whoever hits a certain victory point threshold first, with the bulk often coming from destroying opposing units. One quirk of this system is that units do not lose combat effectiveness as they degrade, and a victory point is not scored until they're entirely vanquished. This abstraction may annoy those seeking realism, but it’s an effective device for stoking drama. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the most interesting moments in the game are when you’re forced to decide whether it’s worth it to play a less efficient card but one which allows you to activate that Snowspeeder squad as it’s hanging on by a thread. If you wait another round or for a more potent option, it may be too late and your unit could be gone. This works both ways, as you will often want to target portions of the battlefield that are weak, especially if you believe your foe will retreat one of their softened units and seek cover. Timing is important. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All in all, it’s a smart system that elicits drama with minimal overhead.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The dice system is smooth. You chuck a certain amount based on your unit and the range to the target. Generally, attackers hit harder the closer they are to the enemy. When rolling, you’re looking for either the symbol of the unit type you are attacking – such as infantry and vehicle – or a universal hit which affects all units. Damage is tracked by removing miniatures, allowing for quick upkeep and only a modicum of maintenance that is mostly frontloaded during setup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asymmetry between the factions only just crosses the threshold of meaning. Empire infantry has an extra health, showing their increased numbers in the assault on Hoth. Snowspeeders move fast but they only hit hard if they're close. Probe droids are difficult to hit but fragile. AT-ATs are menacing, laying down a substantial three die attack up to three hexes away, and also requiring a special confirmation roll when receiving damage to destroy them. This highlights one of the games' both positive and weak traits in that it’s extraordinarily swingy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there is a certain level of decision making, randomness has a large effect on the game’s outcome. The cards you draw and rolls you make are very important. There are precious few ways to mitigate the die rolls, such as seeking cover for defensive bonuses, so much of the experience is determined by the fickleness of luck. This aspect is even more prominent than in Memoir '44 and its other spinoffs, as the battlefield here is shrunken. While this is a positive in that you are in the action immediately, it’s also a concern in that it limits your ability to maneuver and outposition your foe. Instead, it seems like you're side-to-side, ready to unload your cannons immediately. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s obvious this experience was carefully crafted with intention. The smaller board and limited unit variation allows for a very quick experience with a suggested age range of 8+. Battle of Hoth absolutely is a hit with the younger crowd, and it will succeed at introducing those younglings into the genre of wargaming. This doesn’t mean it’s a failure for those wanting something more robust. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As has become trendy lately, this game includes what feels like a few small expansions. Each side has three leaders that may optionally be included in any scenario. You choose one of your three leader options, such as Han Solo or Vader, and then shuffle their trio of special cards into your activation deck. These add some neat effects and desired variance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the scenarios are somewhat diverse, they often feel as though they’re just modified setups of a standard pitched battle. Occasionally you have to control certain positions or focus on different areas of the board, leading to few surprises. However, there is an expanded option which adds a substantial amount of richness to the experience. Included in this base game are two full-blown campaigns which feature branching scenarios based on which side wins, as well as incremental upgrades that influence future sessions. There is also an abbreviated narrative which follows along with the prescribed Hoth storyline. As a method of play, this is actually a pretty neat framework that adds some oomph while not detracting from any of the core systems. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As has become trendy lately, this game includes what feels like a few small expansions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This penchant for including expanded content is an approach that can be directly correlated to similar behavior found in crowdfunded titles. Tossing in expansion content immediately to add perceived value is a common philosophy now, and we are seeing it occur in direct-to-retail games with increasing frequency. This works particularly well here, as it enhances the game’s replayability and fills out the experience for long-term engagement.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s important to note that this is primarily a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player experience</a> with one person fielding the Rebels and another the Imperials. As it says on the box, it can go up to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a>, but this mode of play is unsatisfying and best ignored. It accomplishes this by splitting each side and dividing it between two players. There’s simply not enough there for a meaningful tactical game to emerge, and it ends up feeling more staid and sluggish than the standard duel format. I could see this serving the purpose of teaching a small group of inexperienced gamers, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">young children</a>, but that use-case is limited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While designer Richard Borg has used the core system of Memoir '44 across numerous titles from various publishers, there’s an interesting aspect to Days of Wonder taking this classic game and reshaping it with the Star Wars property. It’s a signal of this game transitioning to a younger pop culture focused audience. The infatuation with World War II is primarily found in older generations, with Star Wars existing as a more universal influence. The popularity of this setting is the biggest weight behind the design, and it’s a cultural nod towards something more omnipresent and attractive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Battle of Hoth is ultimately, exactly what I expected. It’s a solid design built upon a sturdy pre-existing foundation. Care and attention to detail is evident, as the setting comes alive despite the game’s simplicity and high level of abstraction. This will certainly garner a large number of fans, and they should be excited to see that this is listed as the first in the Galactic Battles series. This indicates there will be more titles coming. There are plenty of options such as the battle of Endor, the skirmish on Naboo, and even perhaps heading to space with the large-scale assault on the Death Star II. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aRMXk8?object_uuid=0288fe86-b92d-4be9-bc8e-085c1b0d32ae&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0FGDFQW6G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWElL7?object_uuid=0288fe86-b92d-4be9-bc8e-085c1b0d32ae&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Asmodee</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 22, 2025 7:58 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">I’m not sure Battle of Hoth will cause anyone’s head to explode like the Echo base shield generator, but it is a very successful design that is deserving of praise. It’s effective across a wide spectrum of players, and serves as a lightweight entry into the realm of wargaming.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-battle-of-hoth-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming, at its core, is just a series of puzzles: some <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-save-room-attache-case-puzzle-inventory-1848875111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meditative</a>, some <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/533198/split-fiction-review-pc-ps5-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maddening</a>. <a href="https://neal.fun/not-a-robot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>I'm Not A Robot</em> </a>splits the difference, turning the mundane act of proving your humanity into a spiraling test of pattern recognition that quickly escalates from a simple checkbox task into esoteric brain teasers that feel less like website security and more like psychological warfare.&nbsp;</p><p>Created by <a href="https://neal.fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neal Agarwal</a>, <em>I'm Not A Robot</em> is a free-to-play riff on the CAPTCHA format, where players are tasked with completing randomized puzzles that include typing distorted text, clicking on traffic signs, spotting Waldo in a mural, or playing Simon Says on a soundboard. Streamers, ever the masochists, have turned it into a speedrunning meta to flex their cognitive prowess in front of their thousands of viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>But I am no streamer. I’m a casual gamer with bills to pay and sleep to chase. So I played <em>I'm Not A Robot</em> the way any normal person should: not testing speed, but my mental fortitude. I kept playing, advancing past each level until I either “won” or gave up. Spoiler alert: the latter came first. Yet, somewhere during the funky image text and pattern test to vibe check my humanity, I learned a few things about myself, namely, that I am a fallible human being and not nearly as good at logic puzzles as I’d hoped.&nbsp;</p><p>Glass half full, here’s a quick rundown of some positive things I learned about myself before we get to my unmaking.&nbsp;</p><p>Numerous puzzles where I was tasked with driving a car into a parking space had me discover that the tips I remembered from a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@autoclara/video/7217442900559269163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok video</a> about parking translated perfectly to pulling off a parallel parking job, even through the directional keys on my keyboard. Having a touchable laptop screen also came in handy with drawing a perfect circle with my fingers on the screen. My eyes aren’t a slouch either, leading me to breeze past a puzzle where I was asked to single out which green square wasn’t like the others. Another challenge that surprised me was a test to accumulate and dump enough stocks, which I guess I can attribute to half paying attention to the brain-numbing parts of HBO’s <em>Industry</em>. Other challenges that stumped me in the early going simply boiled down to me reading instructions too quickly and missing the “not” part of its tasks or the “only” part of a specific row—a human error, making me not a robot.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But the cracks in my gamer facade began to show. The first logic test that stumped me was a sliding tile puzzle asking me to assemble a stop sign; these always stumped me for a bit before fiddling with them and coming up with my own logic. What I wasn’t expecting was a CAPTCHA knowledge check for <em>Minecraft</em>, asking me to make a diamond pickaxe. Reader, I’ve only played the game once in high school, so I was out of my depth. This took a while, something I’m not proud to admit as a games journalist. In so doing, I discovered that left and right clicks do different things in <em>Minecraft</em> with relation to sorting and splitting up inventory, which helped me stumble upon what I’m sure every five-year-old with an iPad already knew about how many sticks and diamonds a diamond pickaxe makes. Et viola, I forged myself a diamond pickaxe. <em>I'm Not A Robot </em>proved to be a slow boiling frog challenge at this point, but one where the count supporting that I am not a robot was still going strong.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I'm in danger. <span></span><span>Neal.Fun</span></figcaption></figure><p>But by level 34, I hit a wall—a math puzzle. In it, <em>I'm Not A Robot </em>tasked me with selecting all nine squares of algebra-ass equations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9NkW8MoJ6g&amp;pp=ygUeaSdtIGJhY2sgaW4gdGhlIGJ1aWxkaW5nIGFnYWlu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I haven’t seen since high school</a> and ordering them from least to greatest. Both the angel and devil on my shoulder noped out on this one. So, out of desperation, I pulled out a tactic any cornered gamer would desperately deploy in this situation: I started guessing. Clicking at random like a scrub who penciled in C on an SAT because “I haven’t selected that in a while,” I prayed that brute forcing my way through the math puzzle would carry me through. Obviously, the infinity symbol would be the last choice (I’m not that dense). Still failed. And with that, my journey to prove I wasn’t a robot came to an end.&nbsp;</p><h2>However</h2><p>I’d reckon my inability to solve such a fucked up math question while blinking away sleep proved exactly what this whole sisyphean charade sought to answer: I am still human. I am not a robot. So jokes on you, Agarwal. You didn’t best me, my friend. I won by the human act of quitting while I was ahead and throwing the double bird to a gaggle of math equations.&nbsp;</p><p><em>I'm Not A Robot</em> didn’t just test my logic skills, it also challenged my resolve. Along the way, the game presented some clever and inventive puzzles to break up its stumpers. My favorite were out-of-the-box CAPTCHA puzzles (one literally) where I herded ducks back into their square grid or played whack-a-mole. While I didn’t beat it, I was reminded that being human can mean failing creatively, overlooking a crucial detail in instructions, and telling math problems to fuck off forever. The last of which might be the most CAPTCHA-proof trait of all.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Correction 9/22/25, 4:30pm:&nbsp;</strong>A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the title of the game.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-skate-review-impressions"><h3>No Thank You</h3></a><p>'I would rather lick the paint off my door than see another lootbox screen'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-charlie-kirk-recreations"><h3>Why Major Events Like Charlie Kirk’s Death End Up On Roblox</h3></a><p>'It’s impossible to know who’s doing it for the lulls and the clicks and who’s doing it because they’re radicalizing'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/i-am-not-a-robot-captcha-puzzle-game]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jimmy-kimmel-live-is-back-following-disney-boycott.1304796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tomorrow, Jimmy Kimmel will return to host his late-night show after it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">“indefinitely” put on hold on September 17</a> by Disney following remarks he made about Charlie Kirk in the wake of the conservative commentator’s assassination earlier this month. The decision prompted a large amount of backlash from fans, actors, and comedians, and led to calls for a Disney boycott.</p> <p>On September 22, Disney and ABC confirmed <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-kimmel-live-return-abc-1236374942/">via a statement shared with the press</a> that <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> will return to the air following a near-weeklong hiatus that came after the comedian spoke about Kirk’s assassination and his thoughts on how some Republican politicians, including President Trump, and other conservative commentators acted in the days that followed the shooting.</p> <p>“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” said Disney and ABC in a statement. “It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”</p>

 <p>Since last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-mark-hamill-pedro-pascal-marvel-star-wars-2000627564">Marvel and<em> Star Wars</em> actors like Pedro Pascal and Mark Hamill have spoken out publicly</a> against Disney and ABC’s decision to suspend production on Kimmel’s popular late-night talk show after he joked that many members of the “MAGA gang” hit a new “low” after many of them tried to “score political points” from Kirk’s assassination. He also directly called out Trump’s awkward and cold reaction to Kirk’s death when responding to reporters’ questions about how he was holding up. At no point, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-jimmy-kimmel-said-late-night-show-charlie-kirk-2025-9">as documented extensively</a>, did Kimmel joke about Kirk’s death. Yet that didn’t matter. FCC Chairman and Trump loyalist Brendan Carr threatened to investigate ABC and pull its broadcast licenses over Kimmel’s comments. So Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Dana Walden and CEO Bob Iger <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/jimmy-kimmel-decision-disney-dana-walden-bob-iger-1236547651/">capitulated instantly and shut the show down</a>.</p>

 <p>“Giving a bully your lunch money is only a temporary down payment for future bullying,” said Hamill.&nbsp; “We ALL need to step up for the First Amendment. By-the-way, for the record, this ex-Disney employee finds Jimmy Kimmel very talented and funny.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/Michael_Eisner/status/1969088566098870363">Even former Disney CEO Michael Eisner</a> condemned Iger and Disney’s handling of the Kimmel situation, posting on Twitter: “The ‘suspending indefinitely’ of Jimmy Kimmel immediately after the Chairman of the FCC’s aggressive yet hollow threatening of the Disney Company is yet another example of out-of-control intimidation.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, thousands of people shared screenshots of them canceling their Disney+ subscriptions and threatening to boycott future Marvel and <em>Star Wars</em> movies and shows. In response, Disney seemingly tried to use a trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542"><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>&nbsp;to distract people</a> and change the online conversation. But that didn’t seem to work. Now, after all that, Disney has reversed course and is, for the time being, not letting Carr and Trump push them around. We’ll see how long that lasts and if Kimmel is forced to apologize on air or not when his show return’s Tuesday night on ABC.</p>
