            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/splodey-review-precision-platformer-based-on-explosive-momentum<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Platformers are where many gamers got their start - <em>Mario, Crash Bandicoot, LittleBigPlanet, Lucky </em>- the list goes on. Graduating from that to the precision platformers like <em>Super Meat Boy</em> is the next step. <em>Splodey </em>from Send It Studios takes this a step further by creating a precision platformer with no jump button.</p>

<p>In <em>Splodey </em>the player takes on the role of a wizard with exploding potions. Traversing around normally the wizard has a pretty slow movement, and as I stated above, they can't jump. How the wizard gets around this though is by using their exploding potions to propel them.</p>

<p>Starting in a hub space the first challenge you'll face is trying to reach the first batch of levels…</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splodey-level-select.jpg?itok=zZ8LzAqD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splodey-level-select.jpg?itok=AeUdmQf1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once you unlock further worlds it's a platforming challenge to even reach them</figcaption></figure><h2>Reverse Momentum Pixel Platforming</h2>

<p>When I first heard of this game I was very interested in the idea of a "platformer without a jump button", after seeing some gameplay I thought it might play a bit like <em>No Time To Explain</em> but it is so much harder.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>No Time To Explain</em>, where at any point you can alter the trajectory of the gun that is pushing the player character the momentum of the wizard in <em>Splodey </em>is wholly dependent on the trajectory of your initial explosion.</p>

<p>If you want to fly high then you'll need to aim directly down, if you want to cross a great distance then you need to fire a potion at a very flat angle, or be against a wall. Once in the air firing another potion will do nothing to affect your flight path.</p>



<p>This is a tough movement style to learn, controller is definitely recommended, but as you are forced to chain jumps, and added momentum there are so many satisfying levels that you'll complete and watch the replay in awe of your own prowess.</p>

<h2>Beat Levels, Unlock Worlds, Obtain New Challenges</h2>

<p>The core gameplay is completing each individual level by reaching the portal at the end. In the beginning, the hurdles you face are just ledges and pits, forcing you to precisely make your way over or past them, but as you continue between the different worlds different obstacles will begin to appear.</p>

<p>Just when you start to feel you've gotten the hang of spikes a new world will introduce repeating turrets firing out arrows, or blocks that you can only stand on for a certain amount of time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splodey-falling-level.jpg?itok=Z7v6XDf8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splodey-falling-level.jpg?itok=S9oX0F_M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some levels have you attempting to reach floors past what you can normally see</figcaption></figure><p>Playing this game was a constant uphill struggle, just when I felt I had started to understand a mechanic or had gotten good at precisely throwing a potion while parachuting so I didn't hit spikes the game would immediately put me in my place.</p>

<p>Lengths of levels were something that did begin to get on my nerves. As each level is so bite-sized it's understandable you could get through them in seconds before moving on. I found a lot of the levels would have a gimmick or plan to it but then would add one more step or two to the end that would make things especially frustrating.</p>

<p>One of the best examples of this is a room with low ceilings and arrows that you need to get through with short hops. To get through one corridor would be easy, two or three a bit more of a pain, but having to get through five corridors like this felt like a bit much.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splodey-momentum-level.jpg?itok=R_oQ8VJf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splodey-momentum-level.jpg?itok=s0Ey-rtE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maintain momentum and make precise jumps through portals to launch yourself through portals</figcaption></figure><p>That being said, those levels where the gimmick requires just that bit more perfection will be the ones that gamers looking for a difficult platformer will really eat up.</p>

<h2>Extra Challenge On Top Of Your Challenge</h2>

<p>While playing there are also Souls in the shapes of flying skulls for you to collect (normally in hard-to-reach places), gold coins that can be earned by completing levels in a certain time frame, and hidden bonus levels that turn the challenge up to eleven.</p>

<p>The two collectibles contribute to new character skins and potion colors respectively but don't alter gameplay, those challenge levels are not for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>I'm a fan of a lot of precision platformers, like <em>Super Meat Boy </em>or <em>Celeste</em>, but the core mechanic of directed explosions to jump was a lot to wrap my head around. <em>Splodey </em>does a great job of taking something we have seen before but to a whole new level and if you're a fan of tough platformers this is one you should be looking into.</p>

<p>While the levels themselves are challenging, and sometimes a bit too long, done successfully it's a fast process. This lends the game to a pick-up-and-put-down kind of gameplay style, which is great for when you get a bit too fed up with a game and need to put it down for a bit.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Splodey&nbsp;</em></strong><em>was reviewed on PC via Steam, using a copy provided by the developer over the course of 5 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

            <h2>Review Summary</h2>
                    
                <p>
                            Splodey does a good job of creating a unique twist on the Precision Platformer genre and, while I do think smaller individual challenges would be better, those who are into the genre will likely enjoy.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-7th-citadel-spiritual-successor-to-the-7th-continent-is-back-on-kickstarter-for-a-limited-time.889680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24171548/7th-citadel-kickstarter-solo-cooperative-adventure-release-date-price<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="LHOB9E">Given the nature of the work that I do here as Polygon’s tabletop editor, I end up playing an awful lot of board games by myself. Not board games that you <em>should</em> play by yourself, mind you. Instead of luxuriating with the cardboard equivalent of the Times’ Sunday crossword, I look more like <a href="https://youtu.be/SdGlrC0oL_A">Bugs Bunny playing baseball</a>. That’s why I’m excited to get my hands on <em>The 7th Citadel</em>, among the best modern solo board games. It’s also pretty great as a cooperative experience.</p>
<p id="xjYlmI">Published by <a href="https://shop.seriouspoulp.com/us/">Serious Poulp</a>, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/return-to-the-7th-citadel-explore-build-you-are-the-hero"><em>The 7th Citadel</em></a> is the descendant of <a href="https://shop.seriouspoulp.com/us/games-in-english/78-core-box-english-3760212172618.html"><em>The 7th Continent</em></a>, a Cthulhu-inspired board game that made waves back in 2015 with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/the-7th-continent-explore-survive-you-are-the-hero">a €1.2 million campaign</a>. That one I’ve played quite a lot, and I admire its depth and complexity. Players take on the role of explorers who must use their survival skills to prevail against otherworldly odds. But the game itself is just a big box of numbered cards. The system, inspired by <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> books<em>, </em>uses those numbered cards — nearly 850 of them in the base game — to tell an elaborate story. Then, at the end of the adventure, you end up with a table covered in a charming isometric map made from the cards you’ve drawn.</p>
<p id="I9Lrus">Not only does the game work exceedingly well as a solo experience, I’ve also played it more or less hot-seat with other members of my family. While I have the attention level to see it through to the end, I’ll often be joined at several points along the way by other explorers. It’s a delight. </p>
<p id="rgvDP5">Meanwhile, Serious Poulp kept on publishing. It blew the doors of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/the-7th-continent-what-goes-up-must-come-down">its next campaign in 2018</a>, which included a reprint and a big expansion. All told, it earned <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/2/16842204/tabletop-games-are-exploding-on-kickstarter-video-games-are-flat">over $7 million dollars</a>. That effort was later followed up, in 2020, with <em>The 7th Citadel</em>, a dark medieval-inspired tale with nearly identical mechanics. That one pulled in more than €3.2 million.</p>

<p id="VDahu8">Now the design team of Ludovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter are back for another reprint. This one includes <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/return-to-the-7th-citadel-explore-build-you-are-the-hero">a lavish new version of <em>The 7th Citadel</em></a><em> </em>and, like the reprint campaign for <em>The 7th Continent</em> from 2018, also includes a hefty expansion, as well as the promise of more stretch goals as the campaign progresses.</p>
<p id="hG68bl">Here’s a bit from the press release about how it differs from its forebears:</p>
<blockquote><p id="tskAOX"><em>The 7th Citadel</em> differentiates itself from its predecessor by bringing lots of new elements to the table. First of all, it has its own original universe to explore: <em>The 7th Citadel</em>’s story takes place in a post-apocalyptic medieval world called “The Collapsing Lands”. Players will step into a dark world filled with mysterious Necrodruids, monstrous plants, and the even more dangerous Burrowers, in a fight for survival spanning multiple adventures called Threats. In terms of mechanics, <em>The 7th Citadel</em> offers exciting new additions such as an evolving world map, customizable Action decks, the possibility for players to develop their own Citadel between scenarios, and much more.</p></blockquote>
<p id="CnbrTA">While I may not pony up for the campaign myself, it’s certainly on my radar once it hits retail. But if you’d like to get yours sooner, move fast. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/return-to-the-7th-citadel-explore-build-you-are-the-hero/description">The campaign</a> only runs from today until June 19. Copies start at about $54, with delivery expected by Nov. 2025.</p>

So it’s perhaps surprising that the same design team of Marco Maggi and Francesco Nepitello are responsible for big strategy <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board games</a> on both subjects. Their Tolkien game, 2004’s War of the Ring, is a widely recognised classic, marrying asymmetric maneuver warfare with the rich narrative possibilities of the novel. </p><div id="201625"><p><h3>Dune: War for Arrakis</h3></p></div><p>Now they’re hoping to repeat the same acclaim using some of the same mechanics in Dune: War for Arrakis, as the houses Harkonnen and Atreides fight for control of the desert planet.</p><h2>What’s in the Box</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/20240527-185634-1717526165653.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>As a CMON game, one of the big draws in this big box is the big selection of miniatures, and Dune: War for Arrakis doesn’t disappoint. There are three trays of figures, which range from generic and elite soldiers for both sides in multiple sculpts, to detailed miniatures of all the main characters from Dune, including Paul Atreides and Baron Harkonnen. There are also some big, chunky miniatures of vehicles like harvesters and carryalls, and bigger, chunkier miniatures of the famous sandworms that infest the desert planet.</p><p>While the figures are the main draw here, production values are high across the contents of the box. The board, depicting the inhabited areas of the titular planet and the deeper desert regions around it, comes in two full-sized halves to match the epic scale of the action, lavished with artwork that makes the most of the beige hues that are enforced by the desert geography. There’s a sheet of good quality cardboard tokens to punch, a big bag of custom dice and several decks of glossy cards.</p><p>For such a visual feast it is, perhaps, surprising that beyond the board the art is pretty sparse. Most of the cards are bare, while the character cards have ink sketches of their subjects rather than full color. There are also some player boards to help each player track their game state, and these are surprisingly flimsy, especially given the full-on production treatment on show elsewhere. However, even these minor let-downs are perfectly functional and clear, attractive graphic design makes up for the lack of card art.</p><h2>Rules and How It Plays</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/20240527-105750-1717526327106.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Like the designer’s other best-known titles, this uses an action <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">dice game</a> system. Both sides get a handful of these dice to roll, four for the Atreides and eight for the Harkonnen, and the faces that come up indicate what actions you can take. Most are fairly self-explanatory: strategy and leadership both let you move and attack with your forces, under slightly different circumstances, while deployment lets you add troops to the board, and Mentat actions let you draw cards. If you have named leaders—characters from the franchise—in play then their cards tend to power up these basic actions, giving you more options.</p><p>It’s a great system, so much so that it’s surprising it’s not been copied more by other designers. The actions you roll are critical, so that initial spill of dice across the board is heart-stopping. But whether you get what you wanted or not, there’s a lot of creative strategy involved in trying to make the best of what fortune has given you. You way want to deploy before you attack, for example, or if you’re short on military options, perhaps fishing for cards might give you what you need. Every choice has a knock-on effect, every strategy needs to be flexible to cope with the whims of fate, and every time one player spends a die, their opponent will need to reconsider their choices on the fly. It’s brilliant.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/20240527-105056-1717526534736.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Whatever you choose, your picks then feed into the second layer of this interesting meat-grinder. Like most of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a>, Dune: War for Arrakis gives both players competing priorities and not enough troops or actions to cover them all. The Harkonnen have a very clear military and action advantage but, to maintain it, they must harvest and deliver spice else the Emperor will withdraw support in the form of locking up some action dice. Those deliveries are very vulnerable to raids by the Atreides troops, which, while fewer, can survive in the deep desert. But to win, rather than just survive, the Harkonnen player must find and destroy enemy settlements hidden in the desert, while their opponent needs to fulfil missions that vary each turn and find the ecological testing stations that dot the board.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>At around two hours for a game, it’s long enough to feel epic, but not too long to tax your patience or your free time.</p></div><p>So, for both sides, when you attack, you inevitably leave yourself short on defence. Choosing the balance is central to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> and tactics of the game, and boils down to how well you use your cards, troops and action dice, and read the situation on the board. Initially, the Harkonnen player seems incredibly dominant starting with more troops, ornithopters to move them, and having unlimited reinforcements compared to a paltry eight deployment actions over the entire game for their opponents. </p><p>Combat is dice based and this random, but a lack of combat effects in the card decks means weight of numbers usually tells. While this can feel repetitive, it aids in planning strategy, and the Harkonnen will likely steamroll over the first few settlements very fast. But their flow of spice, and with it their access to dice, will stutter, and their troops will suffer if left exposed in the desert. Then the Atreides can start to make use of their much more flexible arsenal, including command of the giant sandworms, and turn the tide.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/20240527-103958-1717527153575.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Not that that prolongs the action past its welcome. Games like this, with fairly complex rules, narrative aspirations, and bags of miniatures, have a reputation for playing long, but Dune: War for Arrakis is a very welcome change in that regard. At around two hours for a game, it’s long enough to feel epic, but not too long to tax your patience or your free time. There might even be time to swap sides and re-rack for a rematch. It’s secret here is simply the rapid manner in which players accrue victory points. </p><p>Each settlement has a secret value between one and three, and the Harkonnens need just ten to win. Meanwhile, the Atreides have a secret win condition based on three different victory pools and their missions, too, will be scoring on every turn. The hidden aspects of both ensure there’s a tense finish to every game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/20240527-140322-1717528194068.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Despite the detailed miniatures and thematic trappings, narrative is one area where the game falls down. Yes, the spice and the worms and other iconic trappings of the franchise are all here, but this is very much a wargames, and there’s little sign of the politics and treachery that characterize the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-books-in-order">novel series</a>, let alone its explorations of ecology, gender dynamics and other issues. It’s also notable that very little coherent story emerges from the play, besides the obvious one about the cut and thrust of powerful attacks and heroic defences. This might all sound a tall order for a game, and it is, but this design team managed to tick all those boxes against the source material of their previous effort, War of the Ring.</p><h2>Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Jdp1e" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/8B4ed" target="_blank">Get it at Asmodee Store</a></li></ul></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 4, 2024 7:08 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Comparisons to War of the Ring are going to be inevitable and, in truth, Dune: War for Arrakis has neither the strategic nor narrative richness of that game. But it takes half the time to play and is less complex while hitting many of the same mechanical highs, so it’s very much a trade-off. Gamers who want more deterministic strategy may also be put off by the number of dice involved, but that action dice system gives the game a rare combination of dynamism and strategic heft as you’re forced to roll with the punches. If you have the time, and the considerable asking price, this is a great head-to-head conflict game that gives players a taste of much heavier wargames in a reasonably approachable package.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There was little doubt that <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>was going to be a talked-about show when it debuted this season. It’s got a little bit of everything: action, comedy, creature design, and originality. But having those qualities and doing them well are two different things.</p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">Keeping the monster-mashing action and honestly surprising comedic moments in balance <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kaiju-no-8-is-the-feel-good-monster-mash-we-need-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can be tricky</a>, especially for the voice actors lending their talents to these characters. So when I was invited to sit down with three actors behind three leads in <em>Kaiju No. 8</em>, I wanted to explore how they manage those tonal contrasts.</p> <figure data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Kaiju No.8 | DUB TRAILER" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsAKMsUjaK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">As it turns out, the dynamics are part of the fun. Actors <a href="https://x.com/NazeehTarsha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nazeeh Tarsha</a> (Kafka Hibino/Kaiju No. 8), <a href="https://x.com/askforabigail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abigail Blythe</a> (Kikoru Shinomiya), and <a href="https://x.com/ninjamac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam McArthur</a> (Reno Ichikawa) all bring something of their own to their roles, and a recurring notion was the range of depth and emotion they get to explore. Here’s our full conversation with the cast.</p> <p data-characters="48" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false"><strong>How did you first get introduced to <em>Kaiju No. 8</em>?</strong></p> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="852" data-injectable="true"><strong>Nazeeh Tarsha </strong>(Kafka Hibino/Kaiju No. 8): “My introduction was through various friends that have consumed the original run. I mean, still ongoing, of course. But you know, every so often you hear someone say, ‘Man, this. This manga is like, so awesome.’ And it’s like, oh, okay, cool. Like, maybe I’ll like, check it out every now and then. And then the reintroduction came when, you know, the audition came for the show.”</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true"><strong>Abigail Blythe </strong>(Kikoru Shinomiya): “Yeah, same here. I had seen some people talking about it online, some voice acting friends, of how they were so excited for the adaptation. And I was like, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s gonna be a thing.’ And then I read the first five chapters for the audition, and then I got a feel for the project, and I became really excited. I thought it was really cool.”</p>
 <p data-characters="527" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true"><strong>Adam McArthur </strong>(Reno Ichikawa): “Yeah, it’s always, I think, it’s like our job as actors to kind of keep an eye out for things that are kind of coming down the line, and things that might be a good fit for us, audition-wise and stuff like that. So yeah, it was kind of the same thing. Alejandro Saab, who voices Kaiju No. 9, is a massive fan of <em>Kaiju No. 8</em> and I think he’s the one who I first realized was talking a lot about this series, and all that stuff. So learned kind of about it from him, really.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>© JAKDF 3rd Division © Naoya Matsumoto/SHUEISHA</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true"><strong>What have y’all enjoyed the most about working on this project? What has stuck out to you the most about <em>Kaiju No. 8</em>, specifically?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true"><strong>Abigail: </strong>“Well, considering this is like my first lead, getting to explore all of the parts of her character development on-screen, I get to – since she has more screen time – I get to play the softer moments, the more comedic moments, her in action, and get to just explore all of these ranges, which is just such a treat for an actor. So that’s been most exciting for me, and just a dream come true, getting to play the entirety of like, emotional depth of a character is just, it’s so exciting.”</p>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><strong>Adam: </strong>“Yeah, I think for me, it’s just like, it has everything. Everything from amazing animation and character design, amazing music, amazing characters. It’s got a lot of like, action, but it also has a lot of humor. It’s just been, like, refreshing to see sort of like, a new shonen take. Yeah, like a new take on the genre. And, yeah, it has something for everybody. I think that’s kind of like my favorite part.”</p>
 <p data-characters="489" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true"><strong>Nazeeh: </strong>“For me, it’s the amount of heart that exists within the production on all aspects, you know, Between the writing, between the original Japanese performances, between the English direction, the castmates, the amount of passion that’s going around in all aspects in order to bring the story, I think, is one that makes it truly a delight to work on. Because it’s not something that’s inherently available within every production that we work on.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>© JAKDF 3rd Division © Naoya Matsumoto/SHUEISHA</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="721" data-injectable="true"><strong>I find that <em>Kaiju No. 8</em> has a distinct amount of comedy to it, for an action series – what you would normally consider like, a more-traditional action series – but it has a lot of comedy to it. Everyone I talk to is like, wow, it’s funnier than I thought it would be. Do you find that balancing the action and comedy is difficult, or is it easy for y’all to kind of switch between those two vibes?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="892" data-current-count="892" data-injectable="true"><strong>Nazeeh: </strong>“Every time I get in the booth, it’s always a countdown timer of how many seconds before I immediately have to start screaming or shrieking or go into some sort of tonal whiplash. And it doesn’t last more than that. It’s always like, two lines in, here we go. Um, balancing it is definitely a little bit of a challenge, but you kind of learn to navigate it, especially thanks to our director, Shawn Gann, who does a fantastic job of sort of breaking the scenes down for us, letting us kind of experience them. And then separating the beats and the tonal shifts so that, you know, we kind of segment it a little bit, so that it’s a little easier to tackle. But there are times where it’s… there’s nothing you can do, you are going from a hardcore kaiju punch to all of a sudden, comedic nipple peeing. Like, it is what it is. [<em>laughs</em>]”</p>
 <p data-characters="986" data-current-count="986" data-injectable="true"><strong>Adam: </strong>“Yeah, I think that I think that a lot of that, like tonal like that the vast range and tone is sort of an anime specific, you know, it’s specific to the anime, to anime genre, you know. Any anime kind of has stuff like that. So I think we’ve all, you know, been in the genre long enough and been working on things to kind of understand at least, conceptually, what that’s going to require of us as voice actors when we’re in the booth. But then there’s the technical side of it when you’re in there. And like Nazeeh said, like, our director Shawn will break things down where you know, if it’s too fast, or you’re going from like, you know, screaming like you’re blocking bullets with your voice to a thought filter, where basically like, your character’s monologuing but it’s all inside their head, he’ll break it down so you can take it in chunks. And the power of editing makes us all sound amazing.”</p>
 <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true"><strong>Abigail: </strong>“Exactly. I mean, it’s definitely a workout for your larynx. It’s going up and down all the time. But Shawn is great at navigating it. And I think also just the nature of ADR, as we are like dubbing actors, we have grown to be highly adaptable to any circumstance that is thrown at us because we are acting on the fly constantly. And we, everything that we do is very much like cold-reading and improv, so we have been adapted to be ready for circumstances like this.”</p>

 <p data-characters="689" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true"><strong>Nazeeh: </strong>“I absolutely adore every aspect of Kafka. I’ve said this time and time again, he is just like, the embodiment of the human condition. He’s got the comedy that comes into play, the sort of goofiness of his personality, with a person having fun. He has the tone of a person who kind of has life experience, and kind of got into complacency, then had renewed aspirations, and just kind of goes through the entire spectrum of human emotions. And more than anything else, he’s also loyal to a tee, as exhibited by how often he tries to protect everyone. So yeah, I don’t think there’s a single aspect about Kafka that I don’t vibe with.”</p>
 <p data-characters="704" data-current-count="704" data-injectable="true"><strong>Abigail: </strong>“On the same level, Kikoru is actually, the more that I delve into her character, I noticed that she was a lot – I was a lot like her. Like, perfectionist, hard to relax, doesn’t always work well with others in a team aspect because you’re always thinking like, ‘I have to make sure that everything comes out perfect.’ I had those troubles growing up, not so much now because I’ve grown, but when I was her age, definitely. Emotionally withdrawn, very guarded. A lot of those qualities, I relate a lot to myself. So being able to play those into her character, and not just the negative ones but the positive ones too, have been really cathartic.”</p>
 <p data-characters="898" data-current-count="898" data-injectable="true"><strong>Adam: </strong>“Yeah, with Ichikawa, he’s just a good boy. He’s just like a loyal, good boy. It’s been really cool, sort of… He’s unique though, in that I do feel like there’s a lot bubbling underneath. We’ve yet to find out why he sort of is the way he is, we haven’t got an Ichikawa backstory yet in the anime. So I’m very excited to explore more of his past and to see sort of what led him here, and why his drive to be great is what it is, and why he wants to be a part of the Defense Force. But then also why he takes to Kafka so quickly, you know. I think that it’s really cool, and a testament to his character and how good of a boy he is that, you know, he sort of looks up to Kafka right away, but also does it in a way that he wants to keep him safe and make sure that he doesn’t have to let this Kaiju out and all that stuff.”</p>

 <p data-characters="677" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"><strong>Nazeeh: </strong>“Yeah, no, it’s really, really fun. Sort of exhilarating. Vocally taxing, I will also say. [<em>laughs</em>] But like I said, you get to explore the entire range of human emotion through it. And it’s not often that you have a character, especially a protagonist of a shonen-like anime, where he is the comedic relief of his own show. And then all of a sudden, you get this sort of just like, hardcore, you know, fighting protag that we’re all used to in various media. But yeah, no, it’s super fun being able to explore all that, and it’s very rewarding being able to pull off those like, moment-to-moment scenes and those beats, yeah.”</p>

If the name doesn’t give it away, then the Tricky meter and colorful snowflake icons littered across the demo’s single course sure will. That isn’t, strictly speaking, a problem, and if you’re as big a fan of <em>SSX</em> as me, then the overt homage is exactly what pulled you in in the first place. But it’s a bold move to take so much directly from your inspiration when you might not live up to it.</p><p>The demo, now available on Steam, gives you access to a single character on a single course. You can try your hand at a time trial or a trick competition, in the same way that <em>SSX Tricky</em> offered races and freestyle competitions. The course currently available is a simple snowy track down a mountain surrounded by large trees and populated with jumps and rails, very much like an early track you might race down in <em>SSX </em>or <em>SSX Tricky</em>. The similarities are so strong that immediately upon starting my first run down the course, I was struck by how much my muscle memory took over. </p><figure id="" data-id="7f04dc53a3356c910ad1faa2a27b2982" data-recommend-id="image://7f04dc53a3356c910ad1faa2a27b2982" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A snowboarder soars through the air towards a giant yellow snowflake" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A snowboarder soars through the air towards a giant yellow snowflake" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nathan Dearth</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7f04dc53a3356c910ad1faa2a27b2982" data-recommend-id="image://7f04dc53a3356c910ad1faa2a27b2982" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A snowboarder soars through the air towards a giant yellow snowflake" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Switching between the <em>Tricky Madness</em> demo and <em>SSX Tricky</em>, I quickly confirmed a few things that my muscle memory had suspected. <em>Tricky Madness</em> is a much faster game, not in the speed at which you go down the mountain but in the speed at which you pull off tricks. Doing spins and flips feels incredibly fast-paced, which I only had a problem with when attempting the game’s equivalent of Uber tricks (which are just called Uber tricks here as well). The issue is that in some ways, performing these special tricks currently feels too easy, whereas the slower pace of tricks in <em>SSX Tricky</em> made Uber tricks feel like a risky endeavor.<br></p><p>Furthermore, I can’t get over <em>Tricky Madness</em>’ current steering controls, which are mapped to the left stick. Once you press the A button on an Xbox controller to prepare for a jump, you can’t steer but instead must prepare the direction you will spin in the air by pressing on the d-pad. Switching on the fly between the left stick and d-pad when going from steering to trick preparation is a little cumbersome at the moment, and I yearn for the ability to both steer and prepare for tricks on the d-pad like in <em>SSX Tricky</em>. Therein lies the biggest problem of <em>Tricky Madness</em>: the game feels <em>so much</em> like <em>SSX Tricky </em>that those moments where it deviates from its inspiration become unnerving. But again, this is just a demo and these things are very much in an early stage of development.</p><p>The more time I spent with<em> Tricky Madness</em>, the more I appreciated its clear understanding of and love for <em>SSX</em>. While the game’s art isn’t quite as poppy as that of its inspiration, the demo’s singular course still gives you a sense that it would feel right at home amongst <em>SSX</em> courses. That feeling grows even stronger as you poke at the edges of the course in search of secret routes. I was glad to discover a handful of shortcuts that helped me shave seconds off my time, and even a hidden half-pipe that gave me the perfect venue to pull off a series of tricks in seamless succession. </p><hr><p><em>Tricky Madness</em> doesn’t have a release date yet but the full version promises eight full courses and characters (who will be voiced and have unique tricks), a campaign and free-roam mode, and a voiced DJ to fully evoke the <em>SSX Tricky</em> experience. After my time with the limited demo, I can’t definitively say if <em>Tricky Madness</em> is the <em>SSX</em> successor we’ve all been waiting for, but I can say that it has given me hope it will earn that title.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Members of the Legendary Computer Bugs Tribunal, honored guests, if I may have your attention? I would, humbly, submit a new contender for your esteemed judgment. You may or may not find it novel, you may even deign to call it a "bug," but I assure you, you will find it entertaining.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://www.nethack.org/"><em>NetHack</em></a>. It is one of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/ascii-art-permadeath-the-history-of-roguelike-games/">the all-time roguelike</a> games, and I mean that in the more strict sense of that term. The content is procedurally generated, deaths are permanent, and the only thing you keep from game to game is your skill and knowledge. I do understand that the only thing two roguelike fans can agree on is how wrong the third roguelike fan is in their definition of roguelike, but, please, let us move on.</p>
<h2><em>NetHack</em> is great for machine learning…</h2>
<p>Being a difficult game full of consequential choices and random challenges, as well as a "single-agent" game that can be generated and played at lightning speed on modern computers, <em>NetHack</em> is great for those working in machine learning—or <a href="https://underactuated.mit.edu/imitation.html">imitation learning</a>, actually, as detailed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09423">Jens Tuyls' paper</a> on how compute scaling affects single-agent game learning. Using Tuyls' model of expert <em>NetHack</em> behavior, Bartłomiej Cupiał and Maciej Wołczyk trained a neural network to play and improve itself using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>.
</p><p>By mid-May of this year, the two had their model consistently scoring 5,000 points by their own metrics. Then, on one run, the model suddenly got worse, on the order of 40 percent. It scored 3,000 points. Machine learning generally, gradually, goes in one direction with these types of problems. It didn't make sense.</p>
<p>Cupiał and Wołczyk tried quite a few things: reverting their code, restoring their entire software stack from a Singularity backup, and rolling back their <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">CUDA</a> libraries. The result? 3,000 points. They rebuild everything from scratch, and it's still 3,000 points.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><figcaption><p><em>NetHack</em>, played by a regular human.</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>… except on certain nights</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/cupiabart/status/1793930355617259811?s=46">detailed</a> in Cupiał's X (formerly Twitter) thread, this was several hours of confused trial and error by him and Wołczyk. "<span>I am starting to feel like a madman. I can't even watch a TV show constantly thinking about the bug," Cupiał wrote. In desperation, he asks model author Tuyls if he knows what could be wrong. He wakes up in Kraków to an answer:</span></p>
<p><span>"Oh yes, it's probably a full moon today."</span></p>
<p>In <em>NetHack</em>, the game in which the DevTeam has <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/The_DevTeam_Thinks_of_Everything">thought of everything</a>, if the game detects from your system clock that it should be a full moon, it will generate a message: "You are lucky! Full moon tonight." A full moon imparts <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Time">a few player benefits</a>: a single point added to Luck, and werecreatures mostly kept to their animal forms.</p>
<p>It's an easier game, all things considered, so why would the learning agent's score be lower? It simply doesn't have data about full moon variables in its training data, so a branching series of decisions likely leads to lesser outcomes, or just confusion. It was indeed a full moon in <span>Kraków</span> when the 3,000-ish scores started showing up. What a terrible night to have a learning model.</p>
<p>Of course, "score" is not a real metric for success in <em>NetHack</em>, as <a href="https://x.com/CupiaBart/status/1794614271281905955">Cupiał himself noted</a>. Ask a model to get the best score, and it will farm the heck out of early-stage monsters because it never gets bored. "<span>Finding items required for [ascension] or even [just] doing a quest is too much for pure RL agent," Cupiał wrote. Another neural network, <a href="https://github.com/maciej-sypetkowski/autoascend">AutoAscend</a>, does a better job of progressing through the game, but "even it can only solve sokoban and reach mines end," Cupiał <a href="https://x.com/CupiaBart/status/1794440727117668776">notes</a>.</span></p>
<h2>Is it a bug?</h2>
<p>I submit to you that, although <em>NetHack</em> responded to the full moon in its intended way, this quirky, very hard-to-fathom stop on a machine-learning journey was indeed a bug and a worthy one in the pantheon. It's not <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/worlds-first-computer-bug/">a Harvard moth</a>, nor a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jemorris/humor/500-miles">500-mile email</a>, but what is?</p>
<p>Because the team used <a href="https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html">Singularity</a> to back up and restore their stack, they inadvertently carried forward the machine time and resulting bug each time they tried to solve it. The machine's resulting behavior was so bizarre, and seemingly based on unseen forces, that it drove a coder into fits. And the story has a beginning, a climactic middle, and a denouement that teaches us something, however obscure.</p>
<p>The <em>NetHack</em> Lunar Learning Bug is, I submit, quite worth memorializing. Thank you for your time.</p>

Aside from storage space, these two MacBook Airs are identical. Powering the action is the M2 chip, making it great for gaming, photo editing, or tackling school or work projects. If Amazon sells out, Best Buy has also discounted both models, but you'll pay $20 more.</p>                      </div><p>Outside of the great chip, you'll get a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display, 8GB RAM, and a 1080p FaceTime HD webcam to chat with family or duck into a video conference.</p><p>Rounding out the spec sheet for the MacBook Air M2 is a slim chassis that weighs less than three pounds, a battery that gets you up to 18 hours of juice, and a speaker system with support for spatial audio. Toss in the responsive Magic Keyboard and Touch ID for quick access, and it's easy to see why the MacBook Air is so popular for students and professionals alike. The M2 MacBook Air certainly isn't meant to be a dedicated gaming machine, but the vast majority of games that offer Mac support should run great.</p><p>This isn't the only Apple product on sale today, so if you're looking to snag premium gear for cheap, now is a good time to shop. The MacBook Air with M2 chip has more than enough power for most users, but it's not the newest MacBook Air.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/e3-2013-mario-talking-crowd-work-charles-martinet-riffing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>E3 nostalgia is not a habit I like to indulge in. This is because I am mostly a video person, and as a result my primary interaction with the show was carrying a heavy camera and tripod and doing damage to my spine and back that’s now catching up to me. But I do have one specific memory that will stay with me until my dying days. When memories of my children fade, when my bones are weak, I will forever remember the floating head of Mario doing crowd work to a room of journalists.</p><p>E3 went through a lot of different phases, shifting back and forth between being exclusively a trade show, more of an enthusiast show, and then being unquestionably dead. E3 never worked as a public-facing event because the sheer amount of time needed to wait in line to see one high profile game made it impractical to anyone except fans who live and die by a single series. It was slightly less dysfunctional as a press event; it wasn’t great, but it had a kind of internal logic to it that made sense.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Evolve -- The Making of Goliath (Timelapse)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkdOLbBr4ps?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Stuff like this used to be more commonplace, but now you'd never see it. </figcaption></figure></div><p>At one point in E3’s history, there was a premise that the games press was important, a concept cultivated to explicitly flatter the egos of the most pliable, which led to an arms race of increasingly baffling and expensive decisions around show promotion and keynote presentations. One year there was a life-sized model of the monster from the game <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolve_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Evolve</em></a> (it also appeared at PAX), and from time to time I will daydream about what happened to that thing. Maybe Turtle Rock Studios still has it, maybe its consistent parts are locked in an abandoned airplane hangar like the Ark of the Covenant, or maybe it was torn apart and put into a landfill.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GamesBeat: Mario greets the E3 press" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1q0DjOD51nA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Thank you VentureBeat for actually capturing this, my footage is sadly lost to time.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In 2013, I was waiting in line before a Nintendo keynote presentation with all of my gear. It was a loose queue of journalists and guests waiting to be seated. What followed was one of the weirdest 10-20 minutes of my entire career: Above the waiting area, hovering like Big Brother, was the smiling face of Mario projected on a screen. It did not seem pre-recorded but rendered live, with its mouth movements connected to what sounded like Charles Martinet doing crowd work with every journalist there.</p><p>“Oh hello, it’s-a me Mario,” the voice boomed. He started calling out individual journalists by name, like they were his colleagues. “Oh look it’s-a Michael Mcwhortor from Po-ly-gon,” he said, firing off a list of whoever was there to the crowd’s amusement and confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>It was surreal, and baffling. The appeal of Mario is his brevity, but Martinent was a ham and loved to riff. His take on the character came from him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwMYbngTImc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rambling Italian-sounding gibberish into a mic.</a>&nbsp;In effect, Martinet's role as Mario began with riffing for a system like this.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Charles Martinet Discusses Becoming the Voice of Mario - Part 1" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZwMYbngTImc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Apparently Martinet got the role of Mario specifically to riff in a real time animation system.</figcaption></figure></div><p>“Brian Crecente!” his voice boomed. Maybe it’s my memory embellishing itself, but I can hear him say that name clearer than anything else in my life. It’s one thing to remember PR people from mixers; it’s another to see the personification of a character you’ve known since childhood act like he’s familiar with the concept of journalism generally and games journalism specifically, and is on a first name basis with people in the industry. In reality, it was very probably a PR person drip feeding Martinet a string of names and outlets to read off, but the result was wildly disorienting.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="E3 Floor- Mario Talking/Interacting" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLeBSnXFYDs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Another angle. One day I will find the entire thing.</figcaption></figure></div><p>“I believe this happened at a Tuesday morning event, because the show floor opened at noon,” <a href="https://x.com/chelseabot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chelsea Stark</a> of Polygon told me, recalling her first E3 via email. “There were a bunch of press in Nintendo's booth, and we were all there to see <em>Super Mario 3D World</em>, I think. Mario spent so much time shouting out press names, some I knew, many I didn't. I definitely remember him saying ‘oh it's-a Stephen Totilo,’ and also Chris Kohler.”</p><p>"It was my first E3, and I'm a huge Nintendo mark, so I was excited, but I was also a bit lost." Jeff Grubb recounted. "I didn't know what to expect. We all filed into what I think was the Nintendo booth and we just had to stand there while Mario yelled at us. Or, I guess he wasn't yelling -- Mario doesn't yell. But he was just making noises and saying hi to random people."</p><p>"And these were names I recognized. I remember it feeling a bit like the Two Minutes Hate or like a religious congregation. We were all under the alter of Mario, who is real and whose love is real. It must've stuck with me because I remember it better than I do any of the games I saw that year."</p><p>I recorded as much as it was expedient to record, keeping in mind I had to make room for demos, but he just kept going, an inexhaustible fountain of riffs and names and people. This was not content made for public consumption, it was just a baffling choice that Nintendo had decided to make. So I didn’t end up posting it: It was too weird, it wasn’t really news, and I didn’t know how to frame it aside from “check out this very confusing thing Nintendo did,” which in retrospect would have been a solid angle. And now I have no idea where that footage is. I regret not properly archiving it to this very day.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Real Time Mario at the 1992 SCES" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R1t6iNG28zI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The oldest example I could find of a live Mario face rig. Another similar video appears <a href="https://youtu.be/RfRZxc9vkyM?si=XsY4DxA0WxP54YGo">here</a>. </figcaption></figure></div><p>Apparently this bit is ancient. The oldest footage I can find of Martinet riffing as Mario’s disembodied head is 1992 and involved putting a full face rig on him. Footage also exists from 2004, with an updated workflow. Multiple videos of <a href="https://youtu.be/9ihWsOcbS_E?si=xshgfwg-INlDhm0y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this setup exist.</a> This apparently predates the opening splash screen of <em>Mario 64</em>, and I can draw a straight line spiritually from that to the weird AI Mario that <a href="https://aftermath.site/mario-ai-nintendo-store-nyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nathan visited at the Nintendo store</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Charles Martinet Mario booth E3 2004 E3 Insider with interview and behind the scenes look" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CLGaiNf13Uk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The Mario rig seems to appear over multiple years, here it is in 2004 without the intrusive face rig. </figcaption></figure></div><p>I don’t feel nostalgia for E3, for Mario’s disembodied head, or for any of the moves that PR used to pull, but it did seem to come from a distinctly human place. If you are being charitable you could say that it was goofy and charming, a sign of a healthier time in an industry with the capacity for novelty. None of that exists now. The industry is in the toilet, E3 is long dead, and what has emerged to replace it is hollower and sicker. Summer Game Fest does not have the juice, no matter how much Keighley attempts to will it into being, in part because companies just don’t spend money that way any more, because they’re too busy pulling the wiring out of the walls to sell the copper. I have never been less certain of the future of this industry, but it’s instructive to look at its baffling, goofy past.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mario Introduces Nintendo DS" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4u-NlGq1jKw?list=PLDLNOtaQ_Pkfsb_k_a5HPcEJyC-XzPvNC" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>More footage of Mario riffing.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Anyway, the damnedest thing I’ve ever seen.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171296/normal-raids-unlock-roulette-list-tiers-gear<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="jdk8Rl">Just like any other MMORPG,<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a> has raids. These eight-player boss fights are broken up by difficulty, with<strong> normal raids</strong> being the versions you can clear for loot and story and savage raids being the ones that drop best-in-slot gear and mounts.</p>
<p id="I6mSit">Below, we explain how normal raids work, where to unlock every normal (and savage) raid in <em>FFXIV</em>, and where to exchange loot for each raid series.</p>

<hr id="AuyD5H">
<h2 id="YxH2IK"><strong>FFXIV normal raids and normal raid roulette, explained</strong></h2>
<p id="UZ9NsM">Normal raids are <strong>eight-player boss fights</strong> that typically slot into a rich storyline in each expansion. There are typically 12 fights to each raid series released over the span of a single expansion; each of an expansion’s three patches drops four fights. </p>
<p id="9ZFslK">Normal raids typically reward unique gear that are close to best-in-slot at the time of launch, and the savage difficulty versions of these fights (usually referred to as savage raids) do drop the best-in-slot gear for the time. Savage raids are typically seen as <em>the</em> end-game content — with ultimate raids being even harder content that only the top percentage of players complete, but those are almost an entirely separate thing.</p>
<p id="HQ2647">Once the gear becomes outdated a few patches later, it’s effectively only good to be used as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22384023/glamour-how-to-unlock-dresser-plates-prisms-quest">glamour</a>.</p>
<p id="a544DT">Rather than getting armor pieces straight-up, you’ll get <strong>specific drops that can be traded in for gear</strong>. The normal drops trade at the following rate:</p>
<ul>
<li id="YMU0h7">2 lenses/helms for head armor</li>
<li id="mGhGaN">4 shafts/armor for body armor</li>
<li id="YinlYn">2 cranks/gauntlets for hand armor</li>
<li id="txS5kF">4 springs/chausses for leg armor</li>
<li id="ZDcPRI">2 pedals/greaves for feet armor</li>
<li id="eZYV4u">1 bolt/bangle per accessory</li>
</ul>
<p id="NtxznP">The most recent set of raids may have raid drop restrictions on them, meaning you can only claim one drop from each fight in that set per week. Completing the last fight in each tier for the savage raids also rewards a special <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14/22382215/mount-unlock-chocobo-flying-level-requirement">mount</a>.</p>
<p id="QB6Y2t">Unlocking at least two raids from any series (except “The Coils of Bahamut”) will unlock <strong>normal raid roulette</strong>, which will give you EXP and other goodies in exchange for queueing into a random normal raid.</p>
<p id="Fg62VN">As usual with post-game content, you’ll need to beat a bulk of or all of the base game or expansion’s story to unlock it. For example, to do the Omega raids in <em>Stormblood</em>, you’ll need to complete the main scenario quest “Stormblood.”</p>
<hr id="l7X2tN">
<h2 id="60Xgwa"><strong>Where to unlock the A Realm Reborn raids, ‘The Coils of Bahamut’</strong></h2>
<p id="DVGsas"><em>A Realm Reborn</em>’s raid series is unlike any other raid in that there are 13 fights, referred to as “turns” and only four of the fights are available in savage.</p>
<p id="oAyeKE">To unlock the coils, talk to <strong>Urianger </strong>in <strong>The Waking Sands</strong> (Western Thanalan) to start the quest “Primal Awakening.”</p>

I’m not an expert. I don’t claim to be one. But I do think I can offer some tips for both new players and vets about how to play better while also having fun and helping your team. </p><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,196181,196345" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><h2 id="h33812"><a id=""></a><strong>Hit the practice range</strong></h2><p>While you might want to jump right into the action of <em>XDefiant</em>, I recommend all players hop into the game’s practice range. Here you can test out the various weapons in the game, get familiar with controls and how <em>XDefiant </em>feels, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-year-1-all-factions-leak-datamine-rabbids-maps-1851513219&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-year-1-all-factions-leak-datamine-rabbids-maps-1851513219">even spot possible teases</a></span> for future seasons. </p><h2 id="h33813"><a id=""></a><strong>Stick to the “noobs playlist” at first</strong></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598"><em>XDefiant</em></a></span><em> </em>offers up a “Welcome Playlist” for players under level 25, and I recommend sticking in here for a while so you aren’t matched up against high-level players with more unlocked gear, weapons, and attachments. Once you feel comfortable with <em>XDefiant </em>and have unlocked some stuff, feel free to check out the normal playlists before reaching 25, but don’t feel pressured right at the start to hop in with everyone else. </p><h2 id="h33814"><a id=""></a><strong>Feel free to use the pre-made classes</strong></h2><p>Like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>XDefiant</em> lets you create custom classes made up of different weapons, explosives, and attachments. But early on, before you have a lot of stuff unlocked, I recommend using the game’s pre-made classes. These come with some stuff already unlocked and let you progress towards earning new attachments and weapons, too. </p><h2 id="h33815"><a id=""></a><strong>Switch to your pistol to run much faster</strong></h2><p>Anyone who has played <em>CoD </em>or other similar shooters likely knows this already, but you should switch to your pistol when you need to get across the map quickly. In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-new-fps-xdefiant-servers-matchmaking-ps5-pc-1851492107&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-new-fps-xdefiant-servers-matchmaking-ps5-pc-1851492107"><em>XDefiant</em></a></span><em> </em>you run really, really fast with a handgun out and it can help you cross some of the bigger maps in seconds. But…</p><h2 id="h33816"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t always sprint</strong></h2><p>I get that sprinting is fun and fast and feels good. I get it. But I recommend you don’t sprint all the time. Sometimes it’s better to be walking around a corner instead of running as you can quickly pull out your gun and aim down sights (ADS) to take out a foe. I love to go around corners slowly while snapping into ADS right as I clear the wall, as it usually lets me ambush other that are players hopping or sliding around.</p><figure id="" data-id="8a76fb5088019bbc9a7758d5f0ebb01d" data-recommend-id="image://8a76fb5088019bbc9a7758d5f0ebb01d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows characters from XDefiant.

You should play around with all the factions and their various abilities to get a feel for how they play and which ones you prefer. </p><h2 id="h33818"><a id=""></a><strong>Change factions based on the map and mode</strong></h2><p>Don’t feel like you have to stick with a faction forever. They operate more like heroes in a hero shooter and you should be switching between them depending on the map, the mode and the current situation. </p><p>For example, when I play Escort, I tend to pick the <em>Ghost Recon </em>Phantoms faction and use the blitz shield to push the objective forward. But when I play Hot Shot—a Team Deathmatch-like mode—I usually pick a Third Echelon aka<em> Splinter Cell </em>character so I can use the intel suit to help my teammates (and myself) pinpoint enemies as they run around the map.<br></p><h2 id="h33819"><a id=""></a><strong>Once you find a weapon you like, focus on it</strong></h2><p>As you use different weapons, you’ll progress through various firearm challenges—like getting 20 headshots with a rifle. These challenges often unlock new guns to play around with and you should check them out. </p><p>But once you’ve tried some and found a few you like, I suggest focusing on those weapons while playing matches. Doing this will help you level up your guns quicker and earn new attachments. Sure, feel free to shake things up if you need to, but by using a small selection of weapons you’ll quickly unlock more attachments to make them even better.<br></p><h2 id="h33820"><a id=""></a><strong>Vote on a map!</strong></h2><p>It’s hard to spot, but while waiting for players to join and the next match to start, you can actually vote for the next map. This option is somewhat hidden on the right side of the far-too- busy-looking lobby screen. Often I’m one of the only people to vote, letting me decide what maps to play and which ones to avoid. I love democracy!</p><figure id="" data-id="3ab7cdb5693447afda1b9a81337026fb" data-recommend-id="image://3ab7cdb5693447afda1b9a81337026fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the map voting screen as seen in the XDefiant lobby.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h33821"><a id=""></a><strong>Remove modes you dislike from matchmaking</strong></h2><p>While you can just pick a mode and play that and only that, <em>XDefiant </em>offers the option to create a custom playlist and pick which modes you want to play and which you want to avoid. Take advantage of this to avoid modes you hate or just don’t enjoy, while focusing on modes you like and do better in. </p><p>Just keep in mind that you might need to wait longer for matches if you choose to include fewer modes in your custom playlist. However, in my testing, this never delayed things for <em>too long</em>.<br></p><h2 id="h33822"><a id=""></a><strong>Use fire and spider drones to counter shields</strong></h2><p>I’ve seen some players complain that the blitz shield is too powerful. And the first time you encounter one of these mostly bulletproof shields it might seem broken. But there are a few ways to counter them. You can use firebombs if you pick the Cleaners faction to burn the shield carrier. You can also use the spider-drone if you’ve unlocked the Dead-Sec (<em>Watch Dogs</em>) faction, too. Sticky grenades are also useful for taking out an annoying shield. </p><h2 id="h33823"><a id=""></a><strong>On smaller maps try using a shotgun</strong></h2><p>I don’t see a lot of players using shotguns in <em>XDefiant </em>and I get why. The shotguns in this game don’t have great range and on many maps, you’ll lose in medium-range firefights. However, on maps like Arena which are smaller, shotguns can become deadly murder machines capable of wiping a team in seconds. Give ‘em a shot! </p><h2 id="h33824"><a id=""></a><strong>Please, remember the objective</strong></h2><p>This isn’t a game about kills. This is a game about playing the objective. Please, do that. Standing back at spawn and not pushing the escort payload forward doesn’t help anyone but the enemy team. You can still snipe, but try to take a moment to spawn with an SMG and run forward to push the objective, too.</p><hr><p>Now that you have some useful tips and tricks, feel free to hop into <em>XDefiant </em>out now on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. But please don’t use the tips on how to break shields against me, a player who loves my armored blitz shield and uses it all the time to rack up objective points. That wouldn’t be very nice.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A little indie game is taking the gaming world by storm right now. By little, I mean the size of your character because you play as a toy in Hypercharge Unboxed. The recent shooter, which is phenomenal, by the way, is available on PC and Xbox. But can you play Hypercharge Unboxed on Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hypercharge-unboxed-on-game-pass">Can You Play Hypercharge Unboxed on Game Pass?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, while the game is available to purchase and play on Xbox, Hypercharge Unboxed is not yet available on Xbox Game Pass. Could that change in the future? Certainly, but there’s no word about a Game Pass release for the multiplayer shooter.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-hypercharge-unboxed">How Much is Hypercharge Unboxed?</h2>



<p>If you can’t wait for Hypercharge Unboxed on Game Pass, you can buy the indie shooter for relatively cheap. It’s certainly not the cheapest indie game on the market, but it’s a lot of fun for the price tag.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Edition ($29.99)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hypercharge Unboxed</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Complete Edition ($39.99)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hypercharge Unboxed</li>



<li>Supporter Pack</li>



<li>Breaker &amp; Mightus Pack</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-hypercharge-unboxed">How Big is Hypercharge Unboxed?</h2>



<p>Being an indie game, we don’t expect a massive file size for Hypercharge Unboxed. Thankfully, that’s true. The game requires just under 8GB of space on your system, and it benefits from an SSD due to the competitive shooter aspect of its gameplay.</p>



<hr>



<p>Speaking of Game Pass, did you hear about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-coming-game-pass-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 coming on day one</a>? While we wait for all these upcoming releases, now is the time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-disney-games-on-ps5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The House of Mouse has churned out excellent games for PlayStation in recent years, whether they’re programmed exclusively for the PS5 or PS4 titles that can be played on the PS5 as well. Whichever version you have, you can experience the same magic playing fun Disney games as you can get from watching any Disney movie or show. </p><p>Now that Disney owns Marvel, Star Wars, and various other franchises, more games than ever seemingly fall under the 'Disney' umbrella. Below, we've outlined five of the best Disney (or Disney adjacent) titles you can play on your PS5 right now. You can also check out our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-games">best PS5 games</a> overall.</p><h2><strong>Disney Dreamlight Valley</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Disney Dreamlight Valley is the perfect life sim game for Disney Adults who <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-is-a-game-like-animal-crossing">love Animal Crossing</a>, can’t get enough of Stardew Valley, and wish to interact with their favorite Disney characters outside of the theme parks. You play as a custom avatar that works to bring the titular land back to its former glory after it's plagued by the Forgetting, a supernatural event that caused some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/disney-dreamlight-valley/Every_Character_in_Disney_Dreamlight_Valley">Disney characters living in Dreamlight Valley</a> to lose their memories and others to flee to their homeworlds as a result of the Night Thorns.</p><p>Although rebuilding Dreamlight Valley and constructing homes for the people who left takes a lot of hard work and resources to forage for, you get to befriend every Disney character you meet, even the villains. The game provides a pretty chill experience that you can share with the whole family sitting on your living room couch.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review"><em>review of Disney Dreamlight Valley</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2><strong>Kingdom Hearts 3</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Although it was released on the PS4 in 2019, Kingdom Hearts 3 pairs remarkably well with the PS5 thanks to Square Enix making its graphics more enhanced than its predecessors. The game follows Sora on yet another adventure with Donald and Goofy to regain his Power of Waking after failing his Mark of Mastery exam in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance; Riku and King Mickey searching for Aqua, Terra, and Ventus; and Kairi and Lea (formerly Axel of Organization XIII) training to become Keyblade wielders themselves — all in preparation for the final battle against Master Xehanort.</p><p>In addition to new gameplay mechanics such as Attraction Flow and Athletic Flow, Kingdom Hearts 3 has worlds inspired by Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Big Hero 6, Tangled, and Frozen (complete with the obligatory “Let It Go” cutscene). It also has the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-3-re-mind-dlc-review">Re:Mind expansion</a>, adding more meat to the main game’s story and offering you the chance to test your mettle against the data versions of Organization XIII members and the mysterious Yozora. If you’re up for the challenge, that is. </p><p>Overall, it's an excellent installment in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-games-in-order">Kingdom Hearts franchise</a> and worth playing while we wait for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/24/kingdom-hearts-3-review-ps4-xbox-one"><em>review of Kingdom Hearts 3</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2><strong>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A Grammy Award winner for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is considered to be the the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-games">best Star Wars games</a> ever made.

The PS5-exclusive title centers on Peter Parker and Miles Morales struggling to balance their personal lives with their superhero duties as new threats loom over New York City, including Kraven the Hunter, whose supernatural powers turn the city into a hunting ground for superheroes, and the Venom symbiote which, as in Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man 3, turns Parker into a bully and threatens to destroy his relationships.</p><p>The game picks up where <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-miles-morales">Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a> left off, and employs multiple elements from its predecessors, plus extra features such as new web-based gadgets and <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvels-spider-man-2/All_Marvel's_Spider-Man_2_Suits">Spidey suits</a> tailored to each Spider-Men and their play styles, including the Venom suit for Peter.

The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-free-ps5-games">free-to-play PS5 game</a> plays the same as Mario Kart, only the racetracks are themed after the worlds of each racer’s films and franchises, such as Mickey and Friends, Mulan, Monsters Inc., Beauty and the Beast, Frozen, and Pirates of the Caribbean; and minor characters serve as Crew Members to their respective racers to boost their stats (i.e. Orange Bird plays Crew Member to Figment).</p><p>Disney Speedstorm has all the makings of a good crossover racing game save for the gacha-esque microtransactions — something other racing titles like Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing and Mario Kart 8 didn’t have to resort to.

The original soundtrack is also dynamic, meaning you can hear the remastered music when you're playing in remaster mode and the low quality version when playing in classic mode.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171289/star-wars-sith-boring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Dz0hob">In the esteemed circles of People Who Think Too Much About <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/">Star Wars</a>, there is a persistent and popular diagnosis of what ails the franchise. It’s got to do with the Jedi: Frankly, they’re boring. The fact that they have laser swords does a lot to mitigate this; <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22320227/disney-star-wars-fans-lightsabers-tiktok">people love a laser sword</a>. The magic powers are also cool, cool enough to tolerate the idea that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/12/13/21012853/the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-buddhism-star-wars-philosophy">one must become an ascetic to obtain them</a>. Their interior life, however? It’s not very sexy — which is probably why the big Jedi stories of the films involve the temptation of the Dark Side. </p>
<p id="EOt356">This is the uphill battle faced by stories like the forthcoming Disney Plus series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24105856/it-looks-like-star-wars-is-finally-getting-its-watchmen-in-the-acolyte"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>, which will be the first live-action Star Wars show to dive into the world of the Jedi at their peak. It’s got a bit of a leg up thanks to its murder-mystery structure and its wuxia-influenced action, and perhaps it will be successful in surmounting this challenge. Jedi, however, are not the real problem. The problem is that the Sith are boring, too. </p>
<p id="YyPpN3">Like the New England Patriots in the late Tom Brady era, no fictional group has ever won so consistently yet remained so dull. Their primary appeal is mostly twofold — cooler Force powers (lightning, choking) and sick accessories (masks, the color red). Going just by the movies, the Sith hardly make sense — motivated by lust for power and a grave threat to the galaxy, yet there are only two, per Yoda? Come on. </p>

<p id="75qykK">One of the funnier bits of old Expanded Universe Star Wars lore came from fan-favorite writer Drew Karpyshyn’s efforts to explain the so-called Rule of Two, and how a massive force of selfish strivers can even function if everyone wants to usurp the person above them. The result, the Darth Bane trilogy, is a fun read about a Sith’s rise to power that doesn’t originate from any inherent malice, but great talent gone sour in the margins of society. The short of it: Once upon a time there was a ton of Sith, until the conniving and powerful Darth Bane found a way to wipe out all the competition so he could rebuild the order from scratch. Unfortunately, the books depict the Sith at their peak as just as monastic as the Jedi, only super into recreational cruelty and beating each other’s ass.</p>
<p id="DCkmoX">This is especially amusing considering the central thrust of Anakin Skywalker’s fall from grace is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/1/5/21050442/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-ending-kylo-ren-prequels-anakin">love for Padmé Amidala</a>, forbidden under the Jedi Order and the fulcrum by which he is turned by Palpatine into becoming Darth Vader. It doesn’t actually seem any better on the other side, pal! Just virgins, all the way down. </p>
<p id="hjngs3">To paraphrase the late Roger Ebert, this sucks! Maybe the Jedi are locked into their dogma — exploring that is a <em>whole</em> other essay — but why can’t the Dark Side users have a little swagger, an interior life with interesting motivations, the freedom to move through the world independently, their selfish schemes enhanced by the Force? It’s baffling that the Sith, like their light-aligned counterparts, get very little on-screen interiority. They are merely the extra-crispy version of Original Recipe Jedi, and reading or watching stories about them just feels like following a bunch of slightly edgier nerds. Or, perhaps more accurately, the very religious. </p>

<p id="5arV1A">The end result is that just about anyone in Star Wars feels a million times more interesting than a Jedi or Sith. Hell, <a href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/51653/darth_vader_2015_1">Kieron Gillen and Salvador Larroca’s <em>Darth Vader</em> comic</a> introduced evil counterparts to C-3PO and R2-D2 and they practically stole the damn show.</p>
<p id="J996D5">Current canon doesn’t really have a deep-dive exploration of the Sith, instead preferring to root around the margins of the Force-sensitive populace like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23840577/star-wars-ahsoka-witches-of-dathomir-clone-wars">the Witches of Dathomir</a>, or establishing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22969575/star-wars-inquisitors-explained">the Inquisitors</a> as a new branch of baddies that operate under slightly different rules. This could be a great opportunity — maybe even one <em>The Acolyte </em>might explore — to introduce a dimension that Star Wars has been lacking. </p>
<p id="z527lr">Love it or hate it, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/12/16749732/star-wars-review-the-last-jedi-rian-johnson-luke-rey"><em>The Last Jedi</em></a> articulated the potent idea of the Jedi religion as extremely limiting to the story potential of the franchise. While <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/12/21/21031872/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-spoiler-easter-egg-credit-guide-box-office"><em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></a> didn’t quite run in the same direction, it arguably agrees that the way forward is something more nuanced than the hard moralistic lines previously drawn for the Jedi. The same is true for the Sith. Villains are important in stories — interesting, engaging villains only drive heroes to become more compelling in response as they struggle to meet the challenges posed to them. The grand, operatic paragons of good and evil worked quite well for the epic sweep of the films, but as Star Wars gets narrower and (hopefully) deeper on television, some of those rules could stand to get bent a little. </p>

<p id="w1jBcr">The most memorable moment in Hiromasa Yonebayashi’s <em>Secret World of Arrietty</em>, based on Mary Norton’s Borrower books, isn’t dynamic or explosive. It’s a hushed, drawn-out experience where the biggest action is a character stopping to gape. Arrietty is a Borrower, a doll-sized girl whose equally teeny family lives inside the walls of a human family’s vast country house. At 13, she’s permitted to accompany her taciturn father Pod into that house for the first time, on a quiet raid to get some supplies: a single sugar cube and a single tissue.</p>
<p id="iGL7dN">On paper, the sequence might play like a thrilling heist movie, with Arrietty fighting off an immense, aggressive cockroach, ziplining up a narrow vertical space, and rappelling off a cabinet to the ground far below. But these events play out softly as a sweet coming-of-age ritual. Pod silently supports his daughter and smiles at her daring, and Arrietty alternates between boldness and nervousness. And then there’s the moment where she emerges into the vast empty space of a human kitchen for the first time, after a movie largely spent at mouse level, or in comfortingly well-appointed, close spaces. In that moment, she’s like a human standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon, and Yonebayashi manages to make everyday kitchen items look alien and monstrous as she takes them in with intimidated wonder. <em>—Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="c5XNoY">Director Hayao Miyazaki sets the tone for his period fable <em>Porco Rosso</em> early on — even before the titular bounty hunter arrives on the scene to deal with some air pirates who have kidnapped a group of schoolgirls, the audience has learned that they’re buffoons. The kidnap victims are actually pretty enthused about getting to hang out with pirates, whooping in delight when they arrive and marveling at the skulls painted on their planes. (“It could use some blood!”) It’s a perfect mix of characters, as the pirates kidnap the whole class because “it’s not nice to separate them from their friends,” and the schoolgirls cause havoc on their planes, going through their food and weapons, and popping up in the gun turret. Even when the girls are rescued, they cheerfully say goodbye to the pirates, who grin and wave back in turn. It’s just cute! <em>—Karen Han</em></p>

The story flashes between adult Taeko, taking a break to the countryside to reevaluate her life, and young Taeko during small, important moments in her childhood — like the time her father splurged on a pineapple for the family. They all gather around for the ceremonial chopping, and tuck in under the winter kotatsu to try this exotic treat together. But the pineapple isn’t ripe; it’s hard and unpleasant, and the excitement drains away into a quiet, disappointed evening, with Taeko trying to convince herself it’s everything she was hoping for.</p>
<p id="aukWHP">I have a (now fond) childhood memory of feeling immense shame when I learned that for Victorian people, oranges were a rare, treasured delicacy. Here I was, a kid taking these beautiful little suns for granted just because they were easy to come by. This scene reminds me of that memory, not because of the fruit connection, but because small childhood moments like this reverberate forward and change who we are. An unripe pineapple is the disappointing fulfillment of a dream, but it’s also a fleeting bad feeling that we will one day consider fondly. Adult Taeko wonders if she has stayed true to her childhood dreams, but the truth is that dreams are like pineapple; sometimes they’re underripe. —<em>Jenna Stoeber</em></p>

It’s so understated: the protagonist, Chihiro, is just crossing a field of grass to return to her former life. But her friend Haku’s message to her not to look back, and the quiet reprise of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/27/21271852/spirited-away-music-joe-hisaishi-hayao-miyazaki-studio-ghibli-one-summers-day">the theme from the beginning of the film</a> bring up a well of emotion that encompasses everything Chihiro has gone through to save her parents. Working in the bathhouse, cleansing the River Spirit, dealing with No-Face, traveling to Zeniba, remembering that Haku has once saved her life — it all comes rushing back as Chihiro walks away, thanks to the music, the subtle animation of Chihiro’s expression, and the purple tie that remains in her hair. <em>—KH</em></p>

<p id="BYOA3G">Isao Takahata’s imaginative but heartbreaking 1994 movie <em>Pom Poko</em> has always been one of Studio Ghibli’s hardest sells in the U.S., because it relies on so many pieces of Japanese folklore that other cultures don’t share. To begin with, the main characters are tanuki — raccoon-like Japanese animals legendarily famous for shapeshifting, trickster mischief, and cheery hedonism, all summed up with their giant transforming testicles. In <em>Pom Poko</em>, a group of tanuki facing extinction because of human industrialism take one last shot at persuading the local townsfolk to fear and respect their power: the creatures mount a playful spirit-parade, taking on the form of a variety of gods and monsters from Japanese myth. The sequence is spooky and colorful, but it finds its best expression in a moment where two drunken salarymen reminisce about and dismiss their childhood belief in monsters, while missing the wild rumpus going on all around them. <em>—TR</em></p>

<p id="lrTamR">Viewers could be forgiven for not realizing <em>My Neighbors the Yamadas </em>is a Studio Ghibli film. Its style is a distinct departure from that of most of the studio’s films, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21272659/studio-ghibli-movies-isao-takahata-grave-of-the-fireflies-princess-kaguya-only-yesterday">director Isao Takahata</a> opting for an aesthetic reminiscent of yonkoma manga comic strips, giving the film the feeling of being sketched in faded pastels rather than inked. The characters are played mostly for humor throughout the film, and are presented as squat and compact. But that changes in one breathtaking sequence in which the father, Takashi, dons a hardhat and confronts a gang of bikers plaguing the family’s quiet block with their bullying antics. </p>
<p id="mM45t7">Once Takashi leaves the gate in front of his home, the entire style of the film shifts. The backgrounds, which throughout much of the film remain the empty beige color of a printed page, are suddenly fully sketched and inky with night. Takashi is rendered in a less-cartoony fashion, taller and more precisely drawn. He walks slowly, hesitantly, and a film typically filled with light comedy suddenly takes on an aura of dread. He’s a middle-aged man who could be badly hurt if the encounter goes awry. The bikers are sinister-looking and hulking in this style, and one image, of Takashi caught in a biker’s headlights, is both ominous and breathtaking. The spell is broken once Takashi’s wife, Matsuko, and mother, Shige, join him in the street. The style reverts to cartoon previous mode as the normally punchy Shige attempts to appeal to the bikers’ egos with gentle admonishment disguised as praise, asking them to be heroes instead of villains. The bikers, fed up with the situation, depart into the night, leaving the family unscathed and prepared to return to their cartoony lives. <em>—John Maher</em></p>

<p id="jLDumA">Hayao Miyazaki’s first film under the Studio Ghibli banner features a lot of visual elements that later became studio signatures — lush green landscapes, energetically sincere child characters, frantic bodies piled on each other in pitched battle, and so forth. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/25/21269323/castle-in-the-sky-studio-ghibli-movies-hayao-miyazaki-villains-explained"><em>Castle in the Sky </em>is largely conventional animated storytelling</a>, with cartoonish characters contrasted with elaborate, painted naturalistic backdrops. At least until protagonists Pazu and Sheeta have to fly through a hurricane to reach the flying city of Laputa. Suddenly, the action becomes strange and stylized, with dragon-like lightning bolts writhing around the children’s airship, and motion lines distorting the action. The color largely drops away, and Pazu spots his father’s ghost ahead of him, urging him on. It’s a lovely, dreamy sequence that feels entirely separate from the rest of the movie, visually and conceptually — appropriate for a sequence where everything changes for the characters. <em>—TR</em></p>

<p id="rNDNt1">A great deal of Hayao Miyazaki’s 2023 feature <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> plays out on what seems like a highly symbolic level — it’s an <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>-like fable full of metaphorical references to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797923/how-do-you-live-boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki-review">Japanese folklore and to Miyazaki’s own boyhood</a>, run through the filter of an imaginative mind. There’s plenty to unpack in this movie, but no scene is as emotionally fraught and visually surprising as the sequence where the protagonist, Mahito, finally encounters his heavily pregnant stepmother in the depths of the subterranean world he’s been navigating, acknowledges her as his mother (though how to read that is up to the viewer, given the many possible interpretations), and tries to rescue her from the strange, alien world that’s taken her hostage. It’s a dizzying, mysterious sequence, but an intensely emotional one as well. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="KBNeBw"><em>The Tale of Princess Kaguya </em>ends with a breathtaking encounter with divinity, something like <em>Wings of Desire </em>played backward and dappled with watercolors. As a cloud of deities arrives to return Princess Kaguya to heaven, she protests. They feel she’s experienced enough of mortal life, but she disagrees, and hopes for a last moment with her parents. They all cry together, until a magical robe makes Kaguya forget her mortal life. The human light in her eyes flashes out as her parents fall gently to the ground, sobbing and holding each other. Most encounters with the sublime emphasize rapturous joy or enormous terror, the alien construction of things beyond our understanding. <em>Kaguya</em> shows the fine line between the chaotic, paradoxical mix of emotions that make us human and the unspeakable, humbling might of creation itself. <em>—Max Genecov</em></p>

<p id="zAZGjT">One of the few scenes from <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em> that is almost an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21273827/howls-moving-castle-studio-ghibli-movies-diana-wynne-jones-adaptation">exact transcription of the novel it’s based on,</a> the breakfast scene also captures a moment of what normal looks like in the film’s fantasy world. That isn’t the wizard Howl and the shy teenager Sophie walking through air in the early part of the film, or Howl turning into a monstrous creature later on. It isn’t Sophie’s hair turning to starlight, or the witch who cursed her succumbing to a curse herself. It’s a cozy morning scene, except a magical fire demon happens to be making the eggs. As the movie progresses, these scenes of normal domestic life — the cleaning, the market trips, the laundry — become all the more important as Howl begins to lose his grip on humanity. Sophie, Calcifer, Markl, and this life they’ve created inspire Howl to stay and defend it. On a less thematic note, this scene contains some signature Ghibli food: the most delicious slices of bacon and the best-looking eggs ever to grace a screen. <em>—Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="PIUk6F">In the years before the second world war, Jiro Horikoshi, a gifted Japanese airplane designer, has been troublingly associated with a German ex-pat who’s critical of the Nazi party. Hunted by the Japanese secret police, Jiro hides himself in the home of his supervisor at Mitsubishi. His fiancee, Naoko, has been recovering from tuberculosis in a sanatorium, but the affliction will kill her, just as it killed her mother. Against all guidance, Naoko takes a train to Jiro. So the pair can live together in the engineer’s household, they agree to wed immediately, that night in that house, with the supervisor and his wife as the only witnesses. Jiro waits with his boss in a cold room. Outside, they see the warm glow of a paper lantern escorting Jiro’s soon-to-be wife. She’s frail, barely able to stand on her own. Snow falls. They marry. The clock ticks toward tragedy. <em>—Christopher Plante</em></p>

<p id="Ph2Cko">So much of Studio Ghibli’s work is about interactions between humanity and nature, whether it’s violent and competitive, or marked by curiosity and wonder. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/26/21270255/my-neighbor-totoro-best-studio-ghibli-movies-watch-2d-animation-vs-3d-animation-disney"><em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> falls on the idyllic end</a>, as young sisters Satsuki and Mei meet and befriend the local forest spirits. After Satsuki lends the biggest one her father’s umbrella during a rainstorm, he politely offers a gift in return: a packet of seeds, which the girls plant in the garden at home. Then he and his smaller compatriots show up in the middle of the night to make the seeds grow to a house-dwarfing height, and he takes the girls on a flying trip to celebrate. </p>
<p id="F3Gt9H">Hayao Miyazaki’s films are often dark and serious, delving into the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/29/21274695/studio-ghibli-movies-magic-price-spirited-away-princess-mononoke-howls-moving-castle">transactional nature and cost of magic</a>. But here, there’s just pure childhood wonder, and a fantasy of flight come true. It’s all summed up in the moment where the little totoros and Mei cling to the biggest Totoro’s fur for their flight, but Satsuki, the older and more responsible sister, pauses. Is she really invited to take advantage of this giant teddy bear’s fluffy, flying tum? When she accepts that she is, and jumps aboard, her glee makes her seem a lot younger, and it’s a callback to every moment in our lives that makes us feel like kids again. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="mTveTW">Toward the end of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/26/21270987/kikis-delivery-service-best-studio-ghibli-movies-hayao-miyazaki"><em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em></a>, the Kiki finds herself struggling with her powers. But when her friend Tombo is in danger — dangling from a zeppelin’s mooring line, high above their city — she knows she has to do all she can to save him. This action-packed scene is the closest thing to a climax that<em> Kiki’s Delivery Service</em> has, and it’s made all the more triumphant because the previous segment of the movie focused on Kiki’s struggles with her powers and her loneliness. The film’s end sees her finding a new sense of purpose and realizing that she’s made a new set of connections. She’s able to fly once again. In the beginning of the movie, she took to the skies alone and landed in a city full of strangers, but at the end, she flies with all eyes on her, and lands to victorious cheers. <em>—PR </em></p>

<p id="Je2dzI">In Miyazaki’s <em>Ponyo</em>, the titular little fish-girl wriggles her way free from her wizard father and rushes to find her 5-year-old human friend Sōsuke. But when she inadvertently releases her father’s store of magic, the sea roils and rises, her fish-sisters mutate into vast beasts, and a huge storm overtakes the land. None of this fazes Ponyo, who shifts rapidly between forms as she runs along the waves, chasing Sōsuke and his mother along a flooding oceanside road, oblivious to the danger she’s putting them in. It’s a wild, expressive chase scene, with Ponyo’s excitement and joy mixing with the humans’ concern about survival. And the surging, out-of-control ocean is a particularly stunning bit of Ghibli magic, especially as it shifts back and forth between waves and giant fish, just as so many other things in the film slip seamlessly from one shape to another. <em>—TR</em></p>

<strong>5. “Country Roads” singalong, </strong><em><strong>Whisper of the Heart</strong></em>
</h2>

<p id="2ysYv1">Compared to other Studio Ghibli films, there’s little fantasy in <em>Whisper of the Heart</em>, a coming-of-age story following a few months in the life of 14-year-old Shizuku as she takes final exams and figures out what she wants from her future. Navigating the deep pangs of adolescent loneliness, Shizuku is drawn to a little antiques store and a mysterious boy named Seiji, who keeps checking out the same books from the library as she does. As the two get to know each other, Seiji reveals his passion for violins, and Shizuku, an aspiring writer, tells him she’s translating John Denver’s country classic “Take Me Home, Country Roads” for their upcoming graduation. Though nervous, she shares her translation with Shizuku, who plays along with her, and the two are joined by some of his grandfather’s friends. It’s a joyful moment, the two awkward teenagers drawn together and made comfortable by music. Each of them offers the other a glimpse into their inner selves — and it’s all done with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21273717/take-me-home-country-roads-song-movies-studio-ghibli-whisper-of-the-heart">certified banger</a>. <em>—PR</em> </p>

Four-year-old Setsuko is a bundle of joy, even after her mother is killed. She finds beauty in a bomb-shelter hideout, and savors meager meals alongside her big brother Seita. The audience might hope that everything will be all right — but they know from the movie’s opening scene that it won’t be. Setsuko eventually dies from malnutrition, and as her spirit fades, director Isao Takahata cues a soft soprano elegy in her name. The music plays over scenes of Setsuko at her most innocent, crafting, pretending, and running amok in the grass. The cost of war is not just life, Takahata tells us with elegiac grace, but life that could have been. <em>—Matt Patches</em></p>

<strong>3. San vs. the settlers, </strong><em><strong>Princess Mononoke</strong></em>

<p id="9NO4zF">Ghibli’s humanity-against-nature theme returns again in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/27/21271782/princess-mononoke-hayao-miyazaki-best-studio-ghibli-movies-themes"><em>Princess Mononoke</em></a>, but this time it’s much more literal, as a group of exiled and outcast humans build an outpost in the forest and set out to tame it, and the spirits of the forest fight back. Chief among them: San, a human girl raised by wolves, who in a daring mid-film raid, charges into the midst of the human settlement and tries to kill their leader, Lady Eboshi. It’s a thrilling action sequence, but it’s complicated by the fact that Eboshi is expecting San and isn’t remotely intimidated by her. And it’s further complicated by the cursed, dying warrior Ashitaka, who interferes in ways no one was expecting. It’s a three-way push-and-pull situation, with plenty of literal explosive power, a lot of surprises, and full of beautiful moments like the one where San pauses for a long moment between swift attacks and stands in profile atop a building, masked and confidently alone. <em>—TR</em></p>

<p id="9M1MyX">There’s a tremendously poignant journey toward the end of <em>Spirited Away</em>, and writer-director Hayao Miyazaki makes it even more powerful by placing it right after a tremendous amount of hubbub and mess. When human protagonist Chihiro invites a spirit called No Face into the yokai bathhouse where she’s working, he goes on a rampage, devouring everything in sight (including her co-workers) until she feeds him a magic healing dumpling that makes him vomit it all up again. Cue several minutes of frantic chasing, as he simultaneously dissolves into goo and pukes up voluminous waves of gunk. She takes it all in stride because she’s entirely focused on something else — a journey to meet a witch and save a friend.</p>
<p id="E7Od2D">So the crowded, rococo busyness of the bathhouse’s interior, and all the dark and grotesque miasma of No Face’s sickness abruptly gives way to pure, serene blue, as Chihiro escapes the  bathhouse, walks along flooded train tracks to a station that’s nothing more than a concrete slab in the middle of a ceaseless ocean, and boards a train full of shapeless, shadowy ghosts. Joe Hisaishi’s gentle piano score here does powerful work of setting a tone of contemplative peace after a whole lot of hullabaloo. This entire movie is a journey for Chihiro, but this sequence makes that literal, capturing both the excitement of heading into a new place and the wistfulness of leaving an old one, not to mention the peaceable state of being between spaces, with nothing to do but wait and take in the shifting scenery. <em>—TR</em> </p>

<p id="XEDrM5">The landmark sequence that gave Ghibli a lot of its most memorable iconography hasn’t lost any of its power. <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> is a charming children’s fantasy that slips comfortably between the mundane world and the spirit world, as young sisters Satsuki and Mei encounter blobby, furry forest spirits that often seem alien, but are entirely benign. In <em>Totoro</em>’s most lyrical sequence — which is really saying something, in a movie so full of memorable moments — the sisters try to meet their father’s bus during a rainstorm, so they can hand him an umbrella as he gets home. But he’s late, and the wait drags on past a cheery late afternoon and into a tenebrous night.</p>
<p id="eJCUX3">Then a familiar giant creature shows up, waiting for its own bus. Everything about this sequence is delightful: the familiar way Mei turns from a ball of restless energy into a cranky, sleepy dead weight. The dozy look on Totoro’s face as he waits for the bus. His bearish curiosity over Satsuki’s umbrella. The sheer delight he takes in the noise of rain hitting it, and his outsized response. The gently plodding score, which conjures up the feeling of this great dozy beast operating at a different pace from the humans he meets. So much of Ghibli’s work is about encounters with magic, whether that means actual legendary creatures of power, or the simple magic of engine-powered flight or sunlight in a field. <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> reliably mixes fantasy wonder with ordinary child wonder, and finds them both equally marvelous, but never more so than in the rain sequence. <em>—TR</em></p>

<p>Every now and then, an indie title that’s so unique comes along, and it blows us away. Stray is one such title. How many other games allow you to explore a dystopian cyberpunk city as a stray cat with a talking robot companion? I can’t think of any others. Everyone should enjoy this game, but with that in mind, is Stray on Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-stray-on-game-pass">Can You Play Stray on Game Pass?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Stray isn’t currently on Xbox Game Pass. There’s a chance it will come to Game Pass in the future, but it’s not there now. If you want to play the indie adventure game, you’ll have to buy a copy.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-stray-on-xbox">How Much is Stray on Xbox?</h2>



<p>If you can’t miss out on Stray, you’ll be happy to know it’s not an overly expensive adventure game. You can purchase a copy of Stray <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/stray/9NMPDQ2NRX34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Xbox for $29.99</a>, though publisher Annapurna Interactive often hosts sales in which the title goes as low as $19.97.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-stray">How Big is Stray?</h2>



<p>Another huge plus to Stray is its relatively small file size. You can download the entire game, which only requires a little over 6GB of space on your system’s hard drive. I recommend downloading the game to an SSD on a PC for the best performance, as the city is quite detailed.</p>

<p>When discussing the MMORPG genre, one name usually gets mentioned due to its social, world, and mount mechanics. That game is Guild Wars 2. The free-to-play MMORPG continues to bring in crowds of players monthly, and those numbers will increase soon enough because of the recent Guild Wars 2 announcement. Here is what we know about the Guild Wars 2 new expansion coming later this year!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-guild-wars-2-s-new-expansion">What is Guild Wars 2’s New Expansion?</h2>



<p>The upcoming expansion to Guild Wars 2, Janthir Wilds, which<strong> launches August 20</strong>, features a whole lot of additional content to expand the MMORPG in all the right ways. Namely:</p>



<ul>
<li>A new weapon — Spears</li>



<li>Player housing (Homestead)</li>



<li>Unique, challenging encounters</li>



<li>New storylines, quests, and characters</li>
</ul>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds - Expansion Announcement" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EK3DCrUtjNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Guild Wars 2 announcement trailer showcases plenty of new lands we’ll explore, including a bit on the brand-new weapon and even more on Homesteads. I can’t tell you how much I adore player housing in an MMORPG. </p>



<p>I may not play Guild Wars 2 frequently, perhaps once every few months, but this feature alone will ensure I return for the upcoming expansion!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-how-to-check-new-world-server-population-and-status">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-check-new-world-server-population-and-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Check New World Server Population and Status</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-janthir-wilds-cost">How Much Does Janthir Wilds Cost?</h2>



<p>Like with past Guild Wars 2 expansions, <strong>Janthir Wilds costs $24.99</strong>. For a reasonable price, players receive two unique zones: Lowland Shore and Janthir Syntri, probably the most distinctive of the two with its mystical storm systems rampaging through the zone.</p>



<p>Furthermore, we can tame a new mount type: Warclaws. Like other mounts in the game, Warclaws feature unique movement and traversal mechanics that we can enhance over time. </p>



<p>Lastly, the expansion features a few significant updates the team plans to launch between August 2024 and Summer 2025.</p>

<p>"Our Hope is always the same with Destiny games, expansions, seasons, DLCs, exotic missions, secret missions, in-game events, merchandise," he said. "We genuinely Hope you enjoy the time you spend with it. Anything we've made or will make, that's the Hope."</p><p>Fans noted that he capitalized the word "hope" three times, and think that Smith is hinting at Destiny 3. It's currently unknown whether The Final Shape will be the last expansion for Destiny 2, but Bungie said that it's <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/destiny-2/the-final-shape-preview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">far from being the end of the game</a>.</p><p>Bungie is already working on a reboot of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon series</a>, this time as a multiplayer extraction shooter. It was revealed in May 2023 and doesn't have a release window yet. Back in 2019 when Bungie split with Destiny's previous publisher, Activision, an analyst predicted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-3-coming-in-2020-analyst-predicts-amid-bun/1100-6464340/" data-ref-id="1100-6464340">Destiny 3 would be released in 2020</a>. Clearly, that didn't happen, but Destiny 3 could still be possible within the next several years.</p><p>Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion is now available for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.

The sale on Nintendo’s fancier version of its long-in-the-tooth Switch console runs until tonight at midnight ET or once Woot sells out. And it’s possible Woot will <em>not</em> run out of stock this time around because demand for a Switch is not what it used to be. Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">sold so many Switch consoles</a> that it feels like everyone who wants one — and their parents — surely must own one by now.</p><div><p>It’s true that the Switch came out over <em>seven</em> years ago, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">a successor is confirmed by Nintendo to be announced by April 2025</a>. But even though the Switch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23473152/nintendo-switch-console-games-performance">feels pretty dated</a>, that doesn’t mean it’s not worth buying in 2024. There is a vast back catalog of games to pick from if you’ve never owned a Switch, and the OLED model with its excellent seven-inch screen is one of the best ways to enjoy them (if you prefer to play in portable / handheld mode). The Switch’s massive library includes games that now feel like institutions unto themselves, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953834/thats-a-lotta-mario-kart"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/28/23811665/masahiro-sakurai-smash-bros-without-me"><em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a> as well as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23921168/nintendo-switch-2-super-mario-wonder-zelda-totk">a plethora of excellent triple-A games from last year</a> and some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey">really great indies</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-switch-steam">that landed just recently</a>.</p></div><div><p>The Nintendo Switch OLED may look the same as the original model, but it features better audio, a seven-inch OLED display, and an improved kickstand that spans the entire length of the device.</p></div><p>So don’t count the Switch OLED out just yet, even if we’re all yearning for a Switch 2 or Super Switch or whatever Nintendo chooses to call it, with full backward compatibility and upscaling to be announced soon. (Please allow me to fantasize while I catch up on playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros.

            <p>
Just Cause creators, Mad Max developers and Rage 2 co-developers Avalanche Studios have announced that they will lay off 50 developers - nine per cent of their global workforce - and close their New York, USA and Montreal, Canada studios in order to "ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company". 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/avalanche-studios-group-expands-to-montreal">announcement post</a> doesn't go into much detail about either the reasons for the layoffs or how exactly Avalanche will be supporting the departing staff, adding only that "our focus is now on supporting all Avalanchers through this challenging time" and that "we're grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to creating incredible gaming experiences for our players." 
</p>
<p>
Avalanche's Montreal studio had been open for all of eight months. The studio was founded in October 2023 after Avalanche acquired and integrated Monster Closet, who were themselves founded in 2021 by former developers of such headliners as Halo, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed.  Avalanche's New York studio, meanwhile, dates back to 2011. 
</p>
<p>
Avalanche as a whole turned 20 in 2023. Their current projects include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-developers-announce-open-world-smuggling-game-contraband">Contraband for Xbox Game Studios</a> - an open world co-op game about smugglers with a focus on vehicular battling, set in the fictional Southeast Asian region of Bayan in the 1970s.
</p>
<p>
The layoffs follow hard on the heels of a unionisation agreement for Avalanche staff in Sweden. In April, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-100-staff-at-just-cause-developers-avalanche-have-unionised">Avalanche entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Swedish labour organisations Unionen and Engineers of Sweden</a>, with a view to "[standardising] frameworks around essential areas such as salaries, benefits, employee influence and career support". The deal will take effect in 2025, and Swedish Avalanche workers are now in the process of hashing out the specifics with management. It's not clear how, if at all, this relates to the decision to shutter the New York and Montreal offices.
</p>
<p>
The studio closures fit a larger pattern of games industry mass layoffs over the past year or two that have been widely attributed to a mixture of "overambitious" expansion during the lockdown gaming boom, technological innovations/gimmicks such as NFTs not paying off, general economic upheaval, and a desire for returns on investment that are increasingly hard to square with the sheer expense of developing a blockbuster videogame.</p>
<p>That's a very compressed summary that doesn't take into account how circumstances may vary between studios - Avalanche are not Microsoft, for example, who started the year by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">laying off almost 2000 people</a> after spending $68.7 billion on the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. As Alice B wrote at the time, "shrinking headcount is often one of the first things a business does when it has eaten a smaller, weaker one."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/adventure-forge-hands-on-preview-the-power-of-creation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While games like Minecraft and Roblox made user-generated content games popular, this unique type of game, which relies on the user's creativity, is not new at all. From the classic RPG Maker series to Media Molecule's Little Big Planet series and the underappreciated Dreams and Super Mario Maker, players have had the chance to try their hands at game creation countless times.</p>
<p>None of these games, however, focused specifically on narrative-driven games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/adventure-forge-qa-with-jordan-weisman-unleashing-creators-with-a-no-code-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure Forge</a> does. The powerful tool created by Endless Adventure promises to change the world of user-generated content games by offering users everything they need to create complex narrative games without knowing how to code.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/unnamed.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Adventure Forge platform, whose creation is led by Jordan Weissman, the man behind the Battletech and Shadowrun tabletop games, was developed to create a true game creator economy, eliminating the barriers to entry for aspiring creators. As such, it features no-code tools optimized for creating and innovating games within the narrative games genre, ranging from interactive fiction to visual novels, dating sims, and deep isometric RPGs. The tool will ship with four different Universes, which include all the assets required to create a full narrative experience, such as textures, character models, sounds, and so on. But the system is designed to allow the user to go wild with their creativity, as seen in some of the test games that will be available with the Steam Next Fest demo starting next week. Oni was developed during one of the game jams the developers held, and it features some unique visuals and different minigames that showcase the tool's versatility.</p>
<p>While the no-code tools offered by Adventure Forge streamline game development, they are still somewhat complex and require some time to understand. Thankfully, Endless Adventure will offer on the <a href="https://adventureforge.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> some quick and to the point tutorials to get started. These tutorials only cover the basics, such as creating isometric and 2D scenes and implementing conversations with multiple outcomes using the assets belonging to a few Universes, so it is up to the user to use these basics to create more complex narrative experiences. As such, the tool is relatively easy to use, as once I followed the tutorials, I had a decent understanding of how Adventure Forge works.</p>
<p>As such, in around 40 minutes or so, I was able to create a very short dialogue sequence set in a sci-fi world, complete with some basic exploration mechanics, a 2D dialogue sequence in a visual-novel style with multiple choices and different outcomes. It isn't anything complex, but the relative ease with which I could do so with absolutely no game-creation experience proves how everyone will be able to use Adventure Forge with some time and patience to create games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/unnamed-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This simple sequence I created only scratched the surface of what Adventure Forge can do. Isometric scenes, for example, can be fully edited with custom-made locations, lighting, and events that can be triggered by interacting with specific tiles, such as dialogue sequences, camera changes, and so on. In 2D scenes, it is possible to control pretty much every aspect of the visual presentation, such as window placement, character states triggered by different dialogue choices, backgrounds, and so on. One amazing feature Adventure Forge comes with is the ability to test out single sequences on the fly, allowing the user to iterate their games with extreme ease. Coupled with the powerful audio and lighting tool, which grants the user more control over their creations, the possibilities are truly endless and likely even beyond what the developers thought possible.</p>
<p>During a recent presentation, the Adventure Forge development team showcased a project featuring a turn-based combat system created just using the current logic tools. While enemy AI had yet to be developed, and the interface was very basic, the development team was considerably impressed by what was achieved, which they did not think possible at the time. As such, it is clear how creativity will be the only limit when using Adventure Forge's powerful tools.</p>

<p>It is not yet known when Adventure Forge's early access version will be released, but soon enough, users will be able to try out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2466590/Adventure_Forge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo</a> during the aforementioned Steam Next Fest, which will be held from June 10th to June 17th. The demo will also feature two narrative experiences created with Adventure Forge: the sci-fi story The Icarus Experiment and the fantasy world of Oni, which do an excellent job showcasing the possibilities offered by the tool created by Endless Adventure.</p>

<p id="YUfyPb">By completing <em>The Final Shape </em>campaign on Legendary difficulty, you will receive the following rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li id="UZs7Fv">Gear set fixed at 1960 <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23375994">Power level</a> (20 above the soft cap, 30 below the Powerful gear cap)</li>
<li id="Ayjx8g">Exotic armor</li>
</ul>
<p id="IUK2cP">As well as the above, like <em>The Witch Queen </em>and <em>Lightfall</em>, it’s also <strong>you’ll receive a second chest after each major campaign encounter</strong>, which will grant you additional loot to help get you to the soft cap faster — useful if you want to break away from the campaign at any point to play other activities.</p>
<p id="Z15JsV">In summary, by completing the Legendary campaign will give you a healthy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23375994">Power level</a> advantage, both from bonus rewards earned during each mission, and a fixed Power level set once the credits have rolled.</p>
<h2 id="H1EAMX"><strong>How difficult is the The Final Shape campaign, and can you play Legendary solo?</strong></h2>
<p id="6qmhrk">For solo players, these harder story missions are designed to <strong>scale with your Fireteam</strong> — meaning the difficulty will adjust to the number of players, allowing you to run the campaign solo if you choose.</p>
<p id="U0DCqa">The elephant in the room — whether you’re playing in a Fireteam or not — is the difficulty of the Legendary campaign for <em>Lightfall, </em>which was criticized by fans for being more difficult than <em>The Witch Queen</em>. The good news:<strong> The difficulty appears to have been scaled back </strong>— in part due to ‘raid-lite’ puzzles replacing demanding combat challenges.</p>
<p id="Bq40Dl">“I was able to solo the missions I played on the max difficulty without any real struggle, despite playing at a different mouse sensitivity than I’ve been aiming with for years,” explained service writer Ryan Gilliam in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164318/campaign-mechanics-raid-final-shape-interview-bungie">our hands-on preview with the campaign</a> ahead of release. “I’ve soloed the other Legendary campaigns as well, but there are some spikes in a few of those missions that had me sweating a bit, even in the comfort of my own home. It feels like Bungie has taken some of that combat difficulty and injected it into the puzzles instead — which is great for non-raiders, but might disappoint some endgame players.”</p>

<p id="ylEpM5">Even with the adjusted Legendary difficulty this time, it’s worth coming prepared with a build prepared to help you survive more challenging encounters. Hunters, for example, could consider using equipment and mods focused on boosting invisibility so you can hide from enemies to recover your shields.</p>
<p id="EdlxYW">For returning <em>Destiny 2 </em>players, it’s likely you’ll also have a range of crafted or god roll weapons and high-stat gear to give you the upper hand. <strong>For new players</strong>, the challenge of Legendary will be more significant without a decent loadout. If you cannot join other players who can help “carry” you through the campaign, it’s worth considering doing a Legendary run at a later time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-diablo-4-season-4-end-date-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>If you ask anyone currently playing Diablo 4 Season 4, they’ll likely tell you this is the best season to date. This is how the ARPG should have launched last year. It took some time to reach this point, but most of us remain pretty addicted to the core gameplay loop this time around. With good reason, too! It’s fantastic leveling a character to 100, but it’ll end soon. Here is what you should know about the Diablo 4 Season 4 end date!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-diablo-4-season-4-end">When Does Diablo 4 Season 4 End?</h2>



<p>The Diablo 4 Season 4 <strong>end occurs on August 6, 2024</strong>. You still have another two months to enjoy the entirety of Season 4, and that’s enough time to level each class to level 100 multiple times over.</p>



<p>I know people who have leveled each class to max already, and now they’re just grinding The Pit for additional loot and bragging rights.</p>



<p>Personally, I’ve been playing rather casually this season due to other responsibilities, and I’m still at level 75 on my Barbarian. I cannot recommend this season enough!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-class-should-you-play-in-diablo-4-season-4">What Class Should You Play in Diablo 4 Season 4?</h2>



<p>While most classes will prove viable in Diablo 4 Season 4, a few stand a cut above the rest—namely, the <strong>Minion Necro</strong>, <strong>Dust Devil Barbarian</strong>, and <strong>Heartseeker Rogue</strong>. </p>



<p>As someone who plays Barbarian every season, I’m running a mixture of Upheaval and Charge. I’m having an absolute blast blowing through entire mobs in a mad dash forward alongside my ancestors. Follow up the initial charge with a flaming Upheaval that ignites the ground in front of you, and you will have a recipe for clearing areas quickly and spectacularly!</p>



<p>However, most people would recommend the Necromancer this season. They’ve received a significant buff to their minions, allowing players to clear dungeons while basically never lifting a finger off your movement controls.</p>

<p data-characters="240" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It looks like <em>Call of Duty</em> could reportedly be part of the the Esports World Cup. New data uncovered today indicates <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> and <em>Warzone </em>tournaments for a total prize pool worth almost $3 million may be hosted as part of the event.</p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">Dexerto’s Jacob Hale <a href="https://x.com/JakeHaleee/status/1798021527008678101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that lines of HTML were found on the tournament’s website, indicating that the Esports World Cup may host events for <em>Call of Duty</em> . According to the leaked image, the <em>Warzone </em>tournament would have a $1 million prize pool and runs from July 3 through 6. Meanwhile, the <em>MW3</em> portion would have a $1.8 million prize pool and takes place from August 15 through 18. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Sources: Call of Duty could feature at the Esports World Cup, with tournaments in both MW3 and Warzone totalling an almost $3m prize pool.</p><p>These lines of HTML were found on the tournament's website this morning before being deleted &amp; I've verified with several sources. <a href="https://t.co/zPoYpHRO4p">pic.twitter.com/zPoYpHRO4p</a></p></div>— Jacob Hale (@JakeHaleee) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeHaleee/status/1798021527008678101?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="590" data-current-count="890" data-injectable="true">The 2024 Esports World Cup is a tournament series with the largest combined prize pool in esports history, totaling over $60 million. It features at least 20 events in 19 different titles. Originally, the Esports World Cup Foundation <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/sport/esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted a similar tournament</a> called Gamers8, but Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund stepped in and is taking over the competition for the first time this summer. 30 organizations from five different regions have already been confirmed as official participants, but the competition <a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-lgbtqia-characters-tournament-saudi-arabia-1851411189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has received backlash</a> because of Saudi Arabia’s involvement. </p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false"><em>Call of Duty League </em>organizations 100 Thieves and FaZe Clan have already agreed to participate in the tournament, but it remains to be seen if other CDL teams will follow suit. As for <em>Warzone</em>, there are far fewer organizations involved, and in most cases, it will fall on individuals to decide if they want to compete or not. </p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">Activision has not yet confirmed the dates for the latter stages of the World Series of Warzone. The qualifying stages take place from June 4 through 12. The Esports World Cup and <em>World Series of Warzone </em>are unlikely to overlap, but several teams will most likely compete in both competitions. </p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Meanwhile, the Call of Duty League Championship weekend runs from July 18 through 21. Usually, the regular roster shuffle starts after the final tournament of the year, as contracts expire and players are free to join other organizations. However, it’s possible that some teams will stay together if there’s another prize pool to compete for.</p>
