			<p>The <strong>29th annual DICE Awards</strong> are set for <strong>February 12, 2026</strong>, and the <a href="https://www.interactive.org/awards/29th_dice_awards_finalists_93k3p1.asp">full list of nominees has been revealed</a>, with an unsurprising list of games leading the way in nominations. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">Ghost of Yotei</a></strong> lead the pack with <strong>eight nominations each,</strong> while <strong>Dispatch</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> tie for second place with <strong>six nominations each</strong>. All four titles are also nominated for the big prize, <strong>Game of the Year</strong>.</p>



<p>The DICE Awards are hosted every year by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, with the nominees and winners picked by an academy of more than 30,000 members of the video game industry. Similar to the GDC Awards, this is an awards show that is chosen by the developers, and made for developers to celebrate each other's work and lift up the latest and greatest in the video game industry.</p>



<p>Basically, if you think that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards</a> are nothing but a popularity contest and that the games' media critics who make up the judging panel don't know what they're talking about and/or you think they're only focused on trailers for new games and not focused enough on the actual awards themselves, then the DICE Awards are what you'll want to pay attention to.</p>



<p>Coincidentally, four out of the five choices for DICE's Game of the Year appear on <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Wccftech's Best of 2025 list.</a> </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other notable nominees include Blue Prince, which has five nominations, including one for Game of the Year, and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which has four nominations. </p>



<p>Some of the major differences between the DICE Awards and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">other major awards shows</a> that've already passed are the fact that Hollow Knight Silksong and Hades 2 are left off the Game of the Year list, with the former getting only one nomination and the latter getting three. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 also came up short with only three nominations, and Donkey Kong Bananza got two.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-wins-game-of-the-year-at-dice-awards-2025/">Last year's big winner was Astro Bot</a>, which took home five wins, including Game of the Year. Helldivers 2, Balatro, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle also came up with multiple wins, with four, three, and three awards each, respectively. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-minigames-remake-trilogy-3-game-2000658234</link>
            <guid>1400953</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake</span></i><span>’s third and final entry is still years away, but Square Enix is actively developing whatever comes after 2024’s </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>. The sequel was notoriously </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-mini-games-best-worst-ranked-1851340606"><span>minigame heavy</span></a><span>, and while the </span><i><span>Remake </span></i><span>trilogy already felt like it was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-remake-mini-games-third-game-1851272221"><span>straining to make three games out of one</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s reliance on minigames to pad the length really pushed things past the limit. Other than </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ending-cloud-aerith-sephiroth-1851374178"><span>its divisive ending</span></a><span>, it’s probably the most widely derided part of the game, but it doesn’t sound like this criticism has deterred Square from this approach.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbrBjFZabUE"><span>an interview with </span><i><span>GamerBraves</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Rebirth </span></i><span>director Naoki Hamaguchi was asked about </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s inclusion of heaps of minigames, with interviewer Sean Lim noting that some players felt the onslaught interrupted the game’s pacing. Hamaguchi said that the team’s intention was to not only shake up what the player was doing throughout </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s lengthy runtime, but also pay homage to the original </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>, which had its fair share of minigames as well.</span></p>

  <blockquote><p><span>So, that’s not a unique problem for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</span></i><span> only. A lot of games, aside from the main theme and main story progression, also have the side games and the minigames built into them. So, we don’t think we’re unique in that aspect. So when you’re playing the game and you’re going through the main story progression, as well as the intended game design, you tend to fall into this trap of having the same tempo. So, you tend to get bored playing it. To sort of combat this and keep that fresh feeling of going through the game, that’s why we introduced these minigames, to sort of add a diversity of experience as you’re playing the game, to keep up the good rhythm, so to say. So we understand when you introduce these different facets, some people would play it and really enjoy it, but some people would rather just get on with the main story. So it’s sort of a calculated move on our part to include all these different facets of the game. Whether it’s the amount of minigames or the pacing [with which] we introduce them, so on the creator side, it’s sort of something we have taken into account when we do the game design.</span></p> <p><span>So the original </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span> also had lots of minigames, and it was very famous for that. So, when [we] were entrusted with doing the remake, [we] sort of wanted to keep that spirit of the diversity of play within the title, so that people can have lots of different experiences the same way they did with </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I can appreciate wanting to be true to the original RPG’s minigames, but </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s obvious use of it as filler goes far beyond reimagining. It would be helpful if each diversion was good, but they varied from the good as hell </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-queens-blood-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-1851312733"><span>Queen’s Blood card game</span></a><span> to the infamous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-cait-sith-box-throw-mod-remove-1851744876"><span>Cait Sith box throwing segment</span></a><span>. Walking through </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>’s open world was like trying to cross a minefield where the most obnoxious, unskippable landmines were waiting for you if you stepped in the wrong direction. </span></p>

 <p><span>Hamaguchi doesn’t say if this will persist into the next </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake</span></i><span> game, but he has said elsewhere that the third game will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-part-3-remake-length-how-long-2000637274"><span>be more concise</span></a><span>, so hopefully that means&nbsp; the minigames get dialed down a bit in the final chapter. Or let Sephiroth strike me down.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> sales over the holidays reportedly fell short of those recorded by the console's predecessor back in 2017, during its first end-of-year season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As revealed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_NUBDTG8_4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, Switch 2 sales in the US and within key markets in Europe fell behind the equivalent pace of Switch 1 — something an unnamed senior Nintendo source blamed on a "complicated" economic climate today, and the "absence of a major Western game" during the year-end period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That particular analysis will likely raise eyebrows among Nintendo fans, as the company launched the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> during the period — albeit to a more muted critical response than the franchise's beloved original trilogy. Nintendo has so far made no announcement on how that game has fared.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Business reports that US Switch 2 sales over the holiday period were down around 35% versus the Switch 1's sales performance back in 2017. In the UK, a similar comparison saw Switch 2 lagging Switch 1 by 16%. Even in Nintendo's homeland of Japan, Switch 2 holiday sales couldn't match Switch 1, and were down by 5.5% over the year's final nine weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In France, 2025's final tally of Switch 2 sales was down by "over 30%" versus the amount Switch 1 notched up back in 2017, meanwhile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While these numbers may take some of the shine off of a successful first year for Switch 2 overall, it's not all doom and gloom. Switch 2's lifetime sales in Japan are still above what Switch 1 managed in its first year, with less time on sale. And in the UK, Switch 1 continued to sell well enough that it made up Switch 2's holiday sales deficit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking ahead, Nintendo has a smattering of first-party games already planned for 2026, including Mario Tennis Fever, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book and Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave, as well as Switch 2 upgrades for Super Mario Wonder and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. There's also the FromSoftware exclusive The Duskbloods to look forward to, and the promising-looking Pokémon Pokopia life sim.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But as the Switch 2 prepares to celebrate its first anniversary in June, all eyes will be on Nintendo to roll out a truly new blockbuster entry in one of its biggest franchises. Back in 2017, Switch 1's first year was marked by the launch of both Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo has not released a major new 3D Mario platformer since, while it will soon be three years since the arrival of 2023's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 1's other top-selling titles include Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Animal Crossing: New Horizons — and for now, there's no suggestion a big new entry in either franchise is forthcoming. Smash Bros. series boss Masahiro Sakurai has only just finished work on Kirby Air Riders, while Nintendo is opting to update New Horizons for Switch 2 this year, as previously mentioned. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could we see a new 3D Mario in 2026? Nine years on from Super Mario Odyssey, now feels like the right time. And then there's Pokémon, which celebrates its 30th anniversary next month. Could we get a glimpse soon of the series' long-awaited 10th generation? The arrival of these titles would certainly help Switch 2 keep its momentum, following last year's explosive launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Earlier this week, GTA 6 watchers were unsettled when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier noted that the game might not be as "content complete" as Rockstar has said in the past, and he didn't rule out another delay. Some fans took that as if GTA 6 was already pushed back again, which is why Schreier has stepped forward to clarify his comments.</p><p>During a recent appearance on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EANk4uOn68ddip6pKliqY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Button Mash</a> podcast, Schreier said, "The last I heard, [GTA 6] was still not content complete. That is to say people were still finishing things up, still finalizing levels, and missions, and seeing what is going to make it into the game." He added that he doesn't "think anyone at Rockstar can tell you, with 100% certainty, that they will make it out in November."</p><p>Schreier responded to reports based on his comments by reiterating that he "wouldn't be shocked if GTA 6 'does' come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as [Red Dead Redemption 2]." He also characterized some of the reports as, "a complete misunderstanding of what I said."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbw6vt7l3s25" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifmmw55edle55ebrtjxurpv4qjqd4af2eggqctnleafiyz5jz2saq" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><div><p>This is a complete misunderstanding of what I said, which is that I wouldn't be shocked if GTA6 *does* come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as RDR2. Of course another delay is possible. It's a video game.

For now, Rockstar has yet to commit to a price for GTA 6.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled to be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 19.</p>

<figure data-uuid="491ff96f5f5a9"><a title="Call of Duty Switch 2 Poll" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/491ff96f5f5a9/call-of-duty-switch-2-poll.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>With rumours of the never-ending <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/call_of_duty_finest_hour">Call of Duty</a> franchise's imminent appearance on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/rumour-call-of-dutys-nintendo-release-is-apparently-on-target-for-2026">once again doing the rounds</a> — following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo">a 10-year agreement</a> to bring the series to Nintendo platforms as part of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, no less — we've been busy pondering just which of these storied shooters we'd like to see ported onto our new(ish) favourite platform first.</p>
<p>Yes, we know it's not going to work like that, most likely. We can't see them dropping a greatest hits first off, or even going with anything that'd make a bad first technical impression, so perhaps the newer stuff is out of the conversation. Also, this writer is of the opinion we're 100% going to see <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/call_of_duty_warzone">Warzone</a> as an opening gambit.</p>
<p>However! There's still plenty of fun to be had in discussing which one exactly we'd prefer to see arrive first, especially given there's so many diverse and exciting entries in a 22-year-old series that's all about shooting stuff at its core.</p>
<p>For me, it's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/call_of_duty_infinite_warfare">Infinite Warfare</a> all day long, easily my favourite of the lot. I'd also choose <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/call_of_duty_wwii">WWII</a> before any of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_black_ops_ii">Black Ops</a> entries (yep, I said it), and even <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/call_of_duty_advanced_warfare">Advanced Warfare</a> would have been a grand old time had it not been for the Spacey sourness.</p>
<p>Enough about us, though (or me, even), we want to hear which of the following mainline Call of Duty games <em>you</em> would like to see on Switch 2. So take a gander at them long, long list of options below, and give your fave a click. Do it for Roach.</p>

"Your dedication and expertise in our judging process, and your work in selecting the best games of 2025, is truly appreciated. And on behalf of all of us at the Academy, I extend my congratulations to all of our finalists. Each of these games has impressed us through its creativity, artistry, and technical achievement, and we look forward to celebrating your accomplishments at the 29th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards."&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the D.I.C.E. Awards are voted on by a panel of judges who are all game developers, which differs from other shows, like Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/every-winner-at-the-game-awards-2025-the-complete-list">The Game Awards</a>, in which the panel of judges is made up of media outlets (like <em>Game Informer</em>).

Awards.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWSPKRXpwUI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWSPKRXpwUI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>You can find the full list of nominations for every award below:&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Outstanding Achievement in Animation</strong></h3><ul><li>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</li><li>Ghost Of Yōtei</li><li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li><li>South of Midnight</li><li>The Midnight Walk</li></ul><h3>Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction</h3><ul><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</li><li>Dispatch</li><li>Ghost Of Yōtei</li><li>The Midnight Walk</li></ul><h3>Outstanding Achievement in Character</h3><ul><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Esquie</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Maelle</li><li>Dispatch – Courtney/Invisigal</li><li>Dispatch – Robert Robertson III/Mecha Man</li><li>Ghost Of Yōtei – Atsu</li></ul><h3>Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition</h3><ul><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Ghost Of Yōtei</li><li>Herdling</li><li>Mario Kart World</li><li>Sword of the Sea</li></ul><h3>Outstanding Achievement in Audio Design</h3><ul><li>Arc Raiders</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</li><li>Ghost Of Yōtei</li><li>Lumines Arise</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><h3>Outstanding Achievement in Story</h3><ul><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Consume Me</li><li>despelote</li><li>South of Midnight</li><li>The Drifter</li></ul><h3>Outstanding Technical Achievement</h3><ul><li>Arc Raiders</li><li>Assassin's Creed Shadows</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>DOOM: The Dark Ages</li></ul><h3>Action Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>Absolum</li><li>Arc Raiders</li><li>DOOM: The Dark Ages</li><li>Hades II</li><li>Ninja Gaiden 4</li></ul><h3>Adventure Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Dispatch</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Ghost Of Yōtei</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li></ul><h3>Family Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>LEGO Party!</li><li>LEGO Voyagers</li><li>Lumines Arise</li><li>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</li><li>POPUCOM</li></ul><h3>Fighting Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>2XKO</li><li>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</li><li>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</li><li>WWE 2K25</li></ul><h3>Racing Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>EA Sports F1 25</li><li>Kirby Air Riders</li><li>Mario Kart World</li><li>Wheel World</li></ul><h3>Role-Playing Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2</li></ul><h3>Sports Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>PGA Tour 2K25</li><li>MLB The Show 25</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>Rematch</li></ul><h3>Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>The Alters</li><li>Drop Duchy</li><li>Europa Universalis V</li><li>The King is Watching</li><li>StarVaders</li></ul><h3>Immersive Reality Technical Achievement</h3><ul><li>Ghost Town</li><li>Hotel Infinity</li><li>Marvel's Deadpool VR</li><li>Star Wars: Beyond Victory – A Mixed Reality Playset</li><li>Unloop</li></ul><h3>Immersive Reality Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</li><li>Ghost Town</li><li>Marvel's Deadpool VR</li><li>The Midnight Walk</li><li>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</li></ul><h3>Outstanding Achievement for an Independent Game</h3><ul><li>Baby Steps</li><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Consume Me</li><li>despelote</li><li>Dispatch</li></ul><h3>Mobile Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>Persona 5: The Phantom X</li><li>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</li><li>What The Clash?</li><li>Where Winds Meet</li></ul><h3>Online Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>Arc Raiders</li><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Mario Kart World</li><li>Marvel Rivals</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><h3>Outstanding Achievement in Game Design</h3><ul><li>Arc Raiders</li><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Hades II</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Öoo</li></ul><h3>Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction</h3><ul><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Ghost of Yōtei</li><li>Hades II</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li></ul><h3>Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>Arc Raiders</li><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Dispatch</li><li>Ghost of Yōtei</li></ul><p>And those are all the nominations for the 29th annual D.I.C.E.

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>During a November 2025 investor call, CD Projekt CFO Piotr Nielubowicz</span> <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf"><span>implied</span></a><span> the existence of an unannounced product (via</span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion"> <i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span>), saying, “Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year.”</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>CEO Michał Nowakowski also chimed in about a mystery project in a Q&amp;A session following the presentation, telling investors that a majority of the workforce at support studio Fool’s Theory is working on it (via</span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-secret-expansion-rumors-swirl-after-cd-projekt-hints-at-new-content"> <i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>), later noting this amounted to over 100 developers.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Polish Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski last month</span> <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk"><span>forecasted</span></a><span> a “paid add-on” with a budget of 52 million PLN (or around $14 million USD), scheduled for release in May 2026 (via</span><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/new-witcher-3-dlc-expected-in-early-2026-to-set-up-the-witcher-4-3297731"> <i><span>Dexerto</span></i></a><span>). “The release should kick off the actual marketing campaign for </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span>,” Chrzanowski added, according to a rough machine translation.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>The heart of Chzanowski’s prediction has to do with CD Projekt Red’s corporate incentive program for the studio, </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year"><i><span>Eurogamer </span></i><span>reports</span></a><span>. “Currently, PLN 700 million [£144m] is needed to meet the first threshold, with only five quarters remaining,” Chrzanowski explained. “This implies the need for something significantly larger than just another update or a version for a niche platform.”</span></li> </ul> <h2>Why <em>Witcher</em> fans are talking about Zerrikania</h2> <p><span>Fast-forward to January 8. </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-expansion-reports-continue-now-with-discussion-of-a-possible-dune-style-location"><i><span>IGN Poland</span></i></a><span> reports local sources had previously known about a potential expansion to </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span> for years. Furthermore, early rumors indicated the developers were at some point possibly interested in using an isolated, desert region known as Zerrikania as the add-on’s setting. Zerrikania is located to the east of the Northern Kingdoms (i.e. where most of </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span> video game series takes place) and, according to</span> <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wonders_of_Zerrikania"><span>an in-game book</span></a><span>, is home to dragon worship, tattooed “warriors maids,” and man-killing flies. Scary.</span></p>

 <p><span>With </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> planned to release</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310"><span>no sooner than January 2027</span></a><span>, it wouldn’t be shocking if CD Projekt wanted to fill the gap with something to tide fans over, especially if the long-awaited sequel slips into the next console generation. Of course, this is all still speculation, but the evidence is certainly building up to </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>One thing we do know for sure is that sometime this year, </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span> is getting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-mod-support-ps5-xbox-final-patch-1851783100"><span>mod support on consoles</span></a><span>. The update was supposed to arrive last year but slipped to 2026. Hopefully that’s not all CDPR has planned. </span></p>

<p>Lingering sales of the original Switch might also be contributing to the relatively weak holiday performance for the Switch 2. In the UK, at least, the older console is still selling well enough to buoy Nintendo’s <em>overall</em> holiday hardware sales in the country to 7 percent higher than what the company achieved in 2017.</p>

<p>That said, the transition from record-setting launch sales to relatively underwhelming holiday sales is a worrying sign for the Switch 2’s market momentum. A lack of system-selling Switch 2 exclusive games could explain that movement. In 2017, the October launch of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> built holiday excitement for the Switch on top of earlier hits like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. For the Switch 2, holiday releases like <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> don’t seem to have had as much impact as early system sellers like <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>.</p>
<p>Thus far, Nintendo’s planned 2026 schedule doesn’t seem primed to offer many big-name exclusive software to turn things around. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ok4hm6/nintendo_2026_graphic_update/">The year’s first-party lineup</a> is currently anchored by standard sequels for second-tier franchises like Yoshi, Mario Tennis, and Fire Emblem, alongside slightly upgraded “Switch 2 Edition” re-releases of popular Switch games. Aside from Nintendo’s own titles, the planned 2026 release of FromSoft’s <em>Bloodborne</em>-esque <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/switch-2-games-so-far-the-big-the-indie-the-unexpected-bloodborne-successor/"><em>Duskbloods</em></a> as a Switch 2 exclusive could make some fans of the company’s Souls-like games take a second look at the hardware.</p>
<p>Nintendo is likely to announce more Switch 2 exclusives and ports in the coming months, of course. Having a few system-selling blockbusters in that slate could be crucial to propping up the Switch 2’s sales now that pent-up launch-window demand seems largely satiated.</p>

Eurogamer's report suggests that the drive to release something new this year is because CD Projekt Red is behind sales goals that would trigger financial incentives for its employees.</p><p>That program has been <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentioned by the company itself</a>, which stated in a 2025 investor's call that, "There is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results and increasing the likelihood of achieving the earnings condition for the first stage of the incentive program."</p><p>The report from IGN Poland offers some speculative details about what The Witcher 3 expansion may contain, including Zerrikania, "an exotic desert region to the far east of The Witcher 3's current map." Blood and Wine did refer to the Zerrikanian Manticore School, which could be followed-up on if the report is accurate.</p><p>For now, neither report is confirmed.

This balance will begin to lean more toward Switch 2 in the coming years as more and more people upgrade, but the remarkably high install base for Switch means that Pokémon games its successor will, for the time being, struggle to keep up.</p>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows</h2><p>Developer: FromSoftware | Release Date: December 3rd, 2025</p><p>Written by Joe Allen</p><p><em>Forsaken Hollows</em> offers more of what made<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em> so strangely compelling, which is to say more opportunities to fail.</p><p>The expansion’s new map (which is technically a Shifting Earth condition, yes, but it’s pretty transformative) is a labyrinthine maze of crystals, chasms, and vertiginous falls, and new bosses like the Lord of Blood and the Demon Prince give no quarter.</p><p>Two new classes slot nicely into proceedings as well, especially the Scholar, which plays a support role you won’t find anywhere else in <em>Nightreign</em>’s already-diverse cast of playables.</p><p>All of this gloriously difficult adventuring culminates in two new Nightlords, both of whom provide a different challenge for you and your two buddies (or randoms), necessitating that special mixture of forward planning and seat-of-your-pants, howling improvisation that <em>Nightreign </em>excels at.</p><p>In short, if you liked <em>Nightreign</em>, you’ll almost certainly like<em> Forsaken Hollows</em>, and hey, more of the same ain’t no bad thing in this case.</p><picture>

In 2025, <em>Voyagers </em>released, which was a massive update to the game. Truly amazing just how much this continues to evolve over the years.</p><p>The biggest part of this update brought fully customizable ships to the game. You probably saw some of the meme ships people created posted somewhere on social media, as we now have the tools to make pretty much whatever we want. That includes the interior of the ship as well, which you can walk around after stylizing it however you want.</p><p>Beyond just the look, there's a lot of utility you can put in your ship as well, and can even fly around with your friends on missions or just exploring. All in all, <em>Voyagers </em>was a huge update that brought a lot of life to <em>No Man's Sky</em>.</p><picture>

This DLC returned Indy to the Vatican with a smaller side-adventure to take on.</p><p>While the DLC didn't have as much chance to explore an open hub area, what it did have was the kind of historical intrigue and tomb delving that best suits the third act in most Indy adventures. Platform through tunnels, clobber those trying to stop you, and navigate through a series of puzzles to learn a bit more about the mysterious Nephilim.</p><p>Above all is Machina Games' ability to make incredible set pieces to explore, and hearing Troy Baker's fantastic Harrison Ford impersonation.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179</link>
            <guid>1400812</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Companies pumping hundreds of billions in investment into new generative AI tools and LLM models promote it as a sea change technology that will be as revolutionary as the introduction of the desktop computer. Even some game industry figures believe it will usher in a new era in which games are made better, quicker, and more cheaply, democratizing development for creatives without hundred-person teams behind them. For indie publisher Tim Bender, the recent explosion in AI slop has been nothing but a headache. “If I sound frustrated, it’s because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult.”</p> <p>The label he helps run as CEO, Hooded Horse, struck gold after signing the medieval base-builder mega hit <em>Manor Lords</em>, but its library of published games has grown far beyond it in the past two years with releases like the Lego-like tower-defense game<em>&nbsp;Cataclismo</em>, the economic management sim <em>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</em>, and the 4X sequel <em>Endless Legend 2</em>. Being strategy games isn’t the only thing they all have in common. They also all adhere to a strict ban on generative AI art.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 is getting accused of using Gen AI. <a href="https://t.co/fa2E79X8as">pic.twitter.com/fa2E79X8as</a></p> <p>— Shooter Intel (@ShooterIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShooterIntel/status/2003067393141346461?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I fucking hate gen AI art and it has made my life more difficult in many ways…suddenly it infests shit in a way it shouldn’t,” Bender told me in a recent interview. “It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, ‘no fucking AI assets.'”</p>

 <p>It turns out that just saying no to gen AI is the easy part. Actually trying to enforce a ban is where things can get tricky. There’s no magical machine you can put a game through to detect if it has generative AI content in it. Platforms like Steam, which require disclosures for the use of such content, basically operate on good faith that developers will be honest about what’s in their games. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> briefly had AI placeholder art in one part of the game at launch before it was eventually pulled, but that box on the Steam page was never checked.</p>

 <p>Production can be messy enough even within small studios. Development teams working with freelancers or outsource companies, as many indies do, will have an even harder time maintaining checks throughout the production pipeline to weed out any gen AI art usage.</p>

 <h2>“[Gen AI art] is cancerous”</h2> <p>“We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, ‘Okay, well, maybe what I’ll do is for this place, I’ll put it as a placeholder,’ right?” Bender told me. “Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they’ll think, ‘It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.’ But if that gets done, of course, there’s a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “because of that, we’re constantly having to watch and deal with it and try to prevent it from slipping in, because it’s cancerous.”</p> <p>Hooded Horse, which already this year helped usher the grand strategy sci-fi game <em>Terra Invicta</em> out of Early Access and into its 1.0 release, employs two full-time artists who help with all of the publisher’s marketing art, which can include appearances in showcases and announcements for things like Xbox Game Pass launches. “It would be a betrayal of them to work with anything that is using gen-AI art, like, I wouldn’t be able to face them if we had that right. And we’re absolutely committed ethically, for all the reasons you know, against this,” Bender said.</p>

   <p>His point of view isn’t one you hear a whole lot among the video game industry’s giants. EA is all in on the potential for AI to make its loot-box-driven sports franchises even more lucrative. Embark Studios, maker of last year’s mega-hit <em>Arc Raiders</em>, continues to shrug off complaints about the game’s use of generative-AI voice performances.</p> <p>“We don’t use AI to not have to hire people or replace people or job groups or voice actors,” CEO Patrick Söderlund recently told <em><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-target="true">GamesBeat</a></em>. “People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players. I realize it is an intricate subject and discussion.”</p> <h2>It’s about good ethics, not bad PR</h2> <p>There’s also a sense among some developers that everyone else is rushing to embrace the AI revolution, and anyone who doesn’t will find themselves left behind in a landscape that’s increasingly competitive and hostile to new game releases. “Korea is reportedly one of the countries where ChatGPT is used most actively,” Sean Kim, the co-CEO of <em>Lies of P</em> publisher Neowiz, told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2026/01/05/ceo-of-lies-of-p-publisher-neowiz-talks-2025-overture-expansion"><em>Game Informer</em></a>. “It’s hard to find a game company here today that isn’t using AI in some way. At the very least, companies are using either ChatGPT or Gemini.”</p>

 <p>Even some acclaimed GOTY winners have been captured by this mindset. “Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make,” <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> director Swen Vincke posted <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649">on X last month</a>. “In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Holy fuck guys we’re not "pushing hard" for or replacing concept artists with AI.</p> <p>We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do.</p> <p>I was asked explicitly about concept art…</p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Larian Studios cofounder was responding to controversy that had erupted over previous remarks that suggested gen-AI would be used in the making of the studio’s next RPG, <em>Divinity</em>. Vincke promised no gen-AI assets in the finished game but suggested artists might experiment with it during the exploratory phase of development. For Hooded Horse, the issue with gen AI isn’t just about skepticism over its usefulness or potential backlash from players, it’s about the moral issues surrounding tools trained on plagiarizing other people’s work.</p>

 <p>“When it comes to gen-AI, it’s not a PR issue, it’s an ethics issue,” Bender said. “The reality is, there’s so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won’t allow it in the game, and if it’s ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It’s a shame that it’s even necessary and it’s a very frustrating thing to have to worry about.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This year, after half a decade away, <em>Star Wars</em> returns to theaters with <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-grogu-trailer-reactions-2000627675">The Mandalorian and Grogu.</a>&nbsp;</em>But after that movie, 2027 will see another <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-starfighter-mia-goth-ryan-gosling-shawn-levy-1851783918"><em>Star Wars</em> entry hit theaters: <em>Starfighter</em></a>. According to the film’s director, <em>Deadpool Vs Wolverin</em>e’s Shawn Levy, one scene in the upcoming sci-fi sequel was filmed by superstar Tom Cruise. Really.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/movies/shawn-levy-star-wars-stranger-things.html">In a new interview with </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/movies/shawn-levy-star-wars-stranger-things.html">The New York Times</a>,</em> Levy talked about the pressure he’s under making <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOtlyDdDxnw/">a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie starring Ryan Gosling,</a> as well as the excitement of getting to work on the sci-fi mega-franchise. He also told the newspaper that various big names have visited the <em>Starfighter</em> set, including Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise. The most surprising bit? Cruise actually ended up filming a bit of the movie after Levy made a joke about the mayor of Hollywood grabbing a camera.</p>

 <p>As Levy tells it, Cruise arrived on set in November and after getting welcomed by the cast with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-games-ps2-n64-mobile-final-reckoning-1851781905"><em>Mission Impossible</em></a> theme song, started watching as Levy set up a lightsaber duel in a muddy lake. Levy joked to Cruise to get in and help with the cameras, and apparently, the superstar takes everything at face value. So he reportedly grabbed a camera and hopped into the water, ruining his shoes in the process, in order to get the perfect shot.</p>

 <p>“Now, when you see the movie,” Levy told the <em>NYT</em>,&nbsp; “you’ll know that part of it was shot by Tom. I mean, how cool is that?”</p>  <p>It’s wild, for sure, but the more interesting information is Levy confirming a lightsaber duel in <em>Starfighter</em>. Many had wondered if the Jedi would appear in this film, which is set a few years after <em>Rise of Skywalker.</em> And while a lightsaber duel doesn’t confirm Jedi are involved, it does make it seem far more likely that some Force-wielding folk will be showing up in <em>Starfighter</em>.</p>

 <p>The question now is who will be swinging those laserswords and why? Is <em>Starfighter</em> actually (secretly)<em> Star Wars Episode 10</em>, as some fans have wildly speculated? Or will two people who have no history with a lightsaber be fighting in a swamp? Is Rey showing up in this movie? We’ll have to wait until next year to find out. Let’s hope Tom Cruise is a good cameraman.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1ef35c9de0909"><a title="Operation C 35th Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ef35c9de0909/operation-c-35th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Konami</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back in the 1980s, and more specifically 1987, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/contra">Contra</a> in its original coin-op form was a game so awe-inspiring in its action, its graphics, and its weapons (you never forget you first spreader) that everyone who was anyone — which meant I was out from the get-go-- was to be found down their local arcade pumping coins into the bleeding thing on repeat.</p>
<p>It felt amazing to play (once I finally got my turn) in its smooth side-scrolling platforming, fast action, and tough baddies, and it also smashed the general action movie vibe of the time, which was basically big dumb muscle men shooting everything that moved with impunity.</p>
<p>Yes, this was a game that laid the foundations for a whole load of arcade shooters to come down the road, and it still stands as one of the very best of the lot, even when you add in stuff like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/neogeo/metal_slug">Metal Slug</a>. So we're in good company.</p>
<p>To have this sort of experience in your house was the dream, then, and it was a dream duly realised on the NES with a stonking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/contra">Contra</a> port that actually bettered the OG arcade. Man, I wish I'd had a NES back in the day. I had to wait all the way until <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-play-this-one-particular-snes-game-every-xmas-as-a-personal-tradition">Street Fighter 2 on SNES for my first arcade parity moment of joy</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, we all know Contra, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/super_contra">Super Contra</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/contra_iii_the_alien_wars">Contra III: The Alien Wars</a> and all the rest. They're stone cold classics. But today is the turn of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/operation_c">Operation C</a>, a Game Boy sequel to Super Contra that was the very first handheld adventure in the series. And it's a cracker. Yes, it is. A cracker that's now 35 Earth-years old!</p>
<p>We gave Operation C <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2009/08/operation_c_retro">an 8/10 back in 2009</a> (which makes my gilding of its lily much easier, thanks), concluding that, "This is without a doubt a Contra game more worthy of its title than, say, certain PlayStation entries. It hits on most of the aspects that make a good entry: challenging gameplay, tight controls, varied enemies, killer arsenal, macho tunes, big bosses."</p>
<p>Correct! And quite besides the fact that Operation C nails everything it needs to in terms of its levels and action, besides the fact I can whip it out on my Game Boy to this very day and crack into a game that still plays and controls well (or you could just play it via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/contra_anniversary_collection">Contra Anniversary Collection</a>), the <em>really</em> dazzling aspect here is just how early in the Game Boy's life we got such a fully-fledged and impressive entry.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:5506 @ 1767901427 -->

<p>Nintendo's iconic handheld had only been around for two years and here we had it presenting players with a Contra adventure, complete with its signature side-scrolling <em>and</em> top-down levels, with the only fly in the ointment being that you couldn't have another player join you for co-op shenanigans. Hey, I would have taken that deal on more than a few Switch ports over the past few years.</p>
<p>Booting into Operation C now, three-and-a-half decades after the fact, and around 30 since I last played it, well, there's an overwhelming sense of sadness at the waste I've made of my life since I last saw its start screen - but perhaps that's another article for another time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's a game that genuinely still captivates, and with just five levels in total to blow through, it's very doable if you have a little time on your hands. Heck, it's slightly easier than other Contra games, so you might even get somewhere in this one. You never know.</p>

<p>This smart handheld version did well in carefully rejigging aspects such as more complex background and level details to keep things running smoothly without removing any of the tricks and traps that made side-scrollers like this so exciting and novel at the time. Yes, moving elevators were <em>very</em> exciting in a video game in the 1980s - what of it?</p>
<p>Weapons fire off nice big bullets that are easy to track to their target, and even though Contra pros might notice the gameplay a tad slower (to help with the Game Boy's ghosting-prone screen), this really is a proper entry in every regard.</p>
<p>Happy birthday, Operation C! Now, where did I put that piece of paper with the Konami code on it? I've heard it unlocks stage select mode.</p>

<p>Lilien and WhisperGames are promising "realistic courtroom mechanics where you must follow proper procedure" in <em>The Real Face of a VTuber</em>, so that's where it and <em>Ace Attorney </em>diverge, apparently. I love <em>Ace Attorney</em>, but it's never been within "Objection!"-shouting distance of a real courtroom.</p><p>Additionally, where <em>Ace Attorney </em>tells a linear story peppered with opportunities to present evidence and interrogate witnesses, <em>The Real Face of a VTuber </em>will feature "nonlinear storytelling" and a host of endings based on who you accuse of the crime.</p><p>In fact, according to the two studios, "only 1.6% of the players testing the game uncovered the real culprit", so this is very much a "hardcore whodunit", they say, despite the game's "cute aesthetic".</p><p>If that sounds intimidating, though, don't worry; you can switch on optional hints from your clerk if you want to proceed through <em>The Real Face of a VTuber</em>'s story more smoothly. Naturally, those hints are optional, so more independent sleuths can turn them off.</p>

              <p>A mistake we’ve all been making in our responses to the rise of AI slop is deriding it on the basis of its embarrassing mistakes and nauseating uncanniness. The reality is that the tech is improving at an astonishing rate, going from seventeen-fingered body horror images to borderline-convincing live-action film in just a couple of years. It will get better still, and all the while remain an uncreative and immoral act of plagiarism and wanton destruction of both the environment and creative jobs. So while a new AI-generated video doing the rounds showing a fake live-action trailer for a <em>Legend of </em><em>Zelda</em> movie might still have much to mock, that’s really not the issue here. The issue is how clearly it reveals the entire gen-AI grift.</p> <p>The self-named “PJ Ace,” CEO of [grits teeth] viral AI video company Genre.ai, has <a href="https://x.com/PJaccetturo/status/2008559114704875888">posted a thread to X</a> to boast about how he was able to make a trailer for a <em>Zelda</em> movie in just five days, and for only $300, using a suite of AI tools within Freepik. There’s so much to unpack here, but let’s start with the video itself.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo took 40 years to give us a Legend of Zelda movie.</p> <p>I made this in 5 days on a $300 budget. </p> <p>It looks like a $300M blockbuster.</p> <p>Let me show you how I made this in 5 simple steps inside of Freepik: 🧵 <a href="https://t.co/DgkdPDPyGA">pic.twitter.com/DgkdPDPyGA</a></p> <p>— PJ Ace (@PJaccetturo) <a href="https://twitter.com/PJaccetturo/status/2008559114704875888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>You know, when it comes to making the most immediate criticism of the footage, I can’t really improve on the reaction from <em>New York Times</em> tech writer Mike Isaac:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">incredible narrative work if your audience largely lacks object permanence <a href="https://t.co/o5FSDY4Khr">https://t.co/o5FSDY4Khr</a></p> <p>— rat king 🐀 (@MikeIsaac) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/2009003874686996706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Like pretty much every so-called AI film you’ll see, characters will change their appearance from shot to shot, because generative AI has no concept of what it’s generating, and so cannot compare one moment to the next. Hence, despite some moments of utterly convincing photorealism, this whole two-minute slopfest makes no coherent visual sense. I mean, go ahead and pick your favorite fake actor who shows up throughout.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658176">© PJ Ace / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yet, as flawed as that is, this is <em>way</em> better than videos we were seeing just last year. These faces are at least similar (if still obviously different, from nose and mouth shape to complexion), given they’re all based on the same “reference material” (pictures of real actors who weren’t asked), and this element of the tech will also get better, fast.</p>

 <p>And let’s not be in denial. There are moments in this clip that are&nbsp;<em>really</em> impressive given that they were entirely created by computerized plagiarism. That’s in some part due to the fact that a human put a vague amount of effort in, rather than just leaving a machine to run away with its own delusions unguided, as “Ace” lays out in his thread. It did, after all, take five days to put together, and a whole bunch of money was spent on credits to speed up the processing. There are also moments that look embarrassingly poor, the sorts of things that would see a real trailer dragged across the internet until the film’s creators promised to go back and fix things.</p>

 <p>So, altogether it took $300, five days, three different AI tools, and one boiled ocean. And for what? No, seriously, for what?</p> <h2>Sloppy Drivel</h2> <p>I’m not going to argue this took away jobs. Pajamas Ace was never going to make this mock trailer if it involved standing up, let alone casting, lighting, make-up, set building, VFX, post-processing, editing rushes, and the huge amounts of money it would have taken to create the above <em>without</em> all the shitty bits. The bits like the awful-looking blood, crappy Moblin animation, that moment where Link looks like a cartoon at the end, and his apparently just shooting Ganon with a single arrow to win. Oh, and my favorite bit is when Link fires that arrow and, rather than the arrow moving, Link’s hand just explodes instead.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658189" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658189"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658189">© PJ Ace / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But of course, this is also all about the <em>potential</em> of destroyed jobs, of sacrificing hands-on creativity, human inspiration, improvisational talent, and tangible reality for the sake of sloppy drivel that superficially looks like cinema. You know every movie studio head is watching this garbage and having dollar signs appear in their eyes with a loud “ker-ching!” like they’re a cartoon pig, wondering how long it can be before they can do away with the pesky expenses of dolly grips, second-unit assistant directors, and most of all, those infuriating actors and directors with their heads full of ideas. This is about an existential threat to an entire industry.</p> <h2>Degenerative AI</h2> <p>Getting back to that original X post, let’s go through it line by line because it reveals so, so much about the AI-brainwormed:</p> <blockquote><p>“<span>Nintendo took 40 years to give us a Legend of Zelda movie.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>Um, no, that’s not true&nbsp;<em>at all</em>. Nintendo didn’t want to make a&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda</em> movie until very recently, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-movie-mario-switch-marvel-1851000791">announced this intention in 2023</a>. Last year <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-nintendo-lead-actors-benjamin-ainsworth-1851786373">we received casting information</a>, and toward the end of 2025 <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-live-action-movie-link-bragason-ainsworth-leak-2000644816">we saw sneak glimpses from filming</a>. The final film is <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-delay-date-nintendo-avengers-secret-wars-1851784080">due to be released in May 2027</a>, meaning short of any further delays, Nintendo will have taken <em>four</em> years to give us a&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda</em> movie. Let alone that it’s silly to pretend the five days to make this rubbish would be comparable to the 40 years since&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> was created.</p>

 <blockquote><p><span>“I made this in 5 days on a $300 budget.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>A computer made it, with PJ rearranging AI-generated images using the likenesses of the movie’s real-world actors without permission. There wasn’t a “budget,” that was just how much he spent on tokens by the time it was done.</p> <blockquote><p><span>“It looks like a $300M blockbuster.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>It looks like an Uwe Boll movie trailer, lasting less than two minutes, with no discernible plot or character development. It in no sense, from any angle, looks like a $300 million blockbuster, and nor does it look like the trailer for one. It’s very technically impressive stuff given how dreadful gen-AI clips were a couple of years back, but that is very much it.</p>

 <p>And it’s all part of the grift. Scour X and you’ll find thousands of examples of people’s thrown-together gen-AI “trailers,” and precisely zero 110-minute movies. (Don’t actually scour X, to be clear, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/">because&nbsp;<em>fucking hell</em></a>.) This tech is only capable of creating the implication of something real and never the real thing itself. It’s a tissue-thin veneer, all promises and no delivery.</p> <p>A trailer is a promise of a movie to come. A gen-AI trailer is the final product; an empty, plotless, largely incoherent collection of striking clips, edited together in a way that matches our understanding of the language of trailers, and as such is engineered to tell our brains that it’s a taster of something far larger and more significant. It’s a con, a wheeze, and it’s always the act of those invested in the gen-AI industry rather than impassioned creators with a story to tell.</p> <p>These clips will get better and better, look more and more realistic, and the result will be a more convincing promise with exactly the same lack of any delivery. Our new friend PJ Ace and the legions of AI bros congratulating him in the replies on X won’t be going on to make a full-length movie using these tools, because that’s a whole different act, one born of creativity. Scanning a bunch of <em>Zelda</em> assets and a couple of actor’s faces, then arranging the results in the shape of something that reminds us of a trailer, is the opposite—it’s cynicism.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>No one saw the success of Ball X Pit coming. It’s a big win for Kenny Sun and Devolver Digital that the ball-bouncing title has been such a success, and to celebrate this achievement, the first free expansion is on the way—the Regal Update due for release.</p>



<p>The name doesn’t give much away, but in essence, you descend deeper into a pit and use an assortment of balls to bat away foes and bring home resources and success. The deeper you delve, the harder it gets, and the formula has been a rip-roaring success. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-devs-announce-3-free-content-updates-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball X Pit</a> has cleared 1 million in sales (and counting), and it’s just getting started.</p>



<p>Time to find out what’s known about the Regal Update.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-ball-x-pit-regal-update-coming-out">When Is Ball X Pit Regal Update Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Start the countdown. Credit to Kenny Sun</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>January 2026 is the launch window for the Ball X Pit Regal Update, and while the exact date isn’t known, this is confirmed to be the release window for the Regal update.</strong></p>



<p>A post on the Ball X Pit <a href="https://x.com/BALLxPIT/status/2008986900657565711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page was posted on January 7 to reassure game owners about the first proper new content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re back at full speed for our first free DLC release this month! More details are coming soon, but for now, we can confirm it will bring features many of you have been asking for since launch.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s January 8, as of writing, which means there shouldn’t be too many more days now between the debut of the update. Stay tuned for further updates and details on its arrival.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-included-with-ball-x-pit-regal-update">What’s Included With Ball X Pit Regal Update?</h2>



<p><strong>Kenny Sun hasn’t specified exact details for the Regal Update, but it promises community-driven features and at least two new characters.</strong></p>



<p>A general outlook on incoming features was revealed in the BALL x PIT Roadmap 2026 video. Updates include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Balls</li>



<li>New Evolutions</li>



<li>New Buildings</li>



<li>New Characters</li>
</ul>



<p>There will be stuff in addition to this. It’s not made clear if all of these will appear in every update.</p>



<p>Ball X Pit came out of left field to be one of the year’s best and most fun indie games. Do you think we’ll see any more updates after the initial three? What could a sequel improve upon?

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">I spoke to Knight last year about making Phasmophobia</a>, and I was surprised by how difficult the game's gigantic success was to deal with. It was the business admin he struggled with, such as setting up a company and paying server costs and hiring people. Mundane stuff, but stuff that pulled him away from actually making the game.</p><p>Knight now has a team of 30 people at Kinetic to help him, though - plenty of people to finally complete Phasmophobia and get the game to version 1.0. It's been in early access for over five years now. But this year's the year, and the 1.0 release will be a big one.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/">In a Steam update post for Phasmophobia</a> on 25th December, Kinetic wrote: "Our aim with the 1.0 launch is to be able to, as a team, look at Phasmophobia after many years of updating, iterating and evolving and know we’ve fulfilled our vision for the game.</p>
<p>"Our horror update will be the meatiest part of the 1.0 release and will give even the most seasoned Ghost Hunter a host of new scares and surprises. While we aren’t going to share too many details on it as we want that 1.0 release to feel as fresh and exciting as the original release did, keep an eye out for a few details throughout the year.</p>
<p>"Phasmophobia 1.0 will launch in 2026 for all players, across all available platforms at the same time."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Ubisoft announced Wednesday it will close its Ubisoft Halifax studio and lay off 71 people. Ubisoft's closure of the <em>Assassin's Creed: Rebellion</em> and <em>Rainbow Six Mobile</em> studio comes just weeks after a group of 60 employees voted to unionize with Communications Workers of America's Canadian affiliate, CWA Canada. Seventy-four percent of the staff voted yes to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-halifax-workers-form-a-union?ref=aftermath.site"><u>unionize</u></a> and create a wall-to-wall union including producers, designers, artists, testers, and researchers.</p><p>CWA Canada Local 30111, the chapter the Ubisoft Halifax workers joined, also includes more than a hundred workers at Bethesda Game Studios.</p><p>"Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs," a Ubisoft spokesperson said in a statement to Aftermath. "As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance."</p><p>The Ubisoft spokesperson did not specifically address the closure's relation—or not—to the recent union vote.</p><p>CWA Canada president Carmel Smyth said in a statement to Aftermath the union will "pursue every legal recourse to ensure that the rights of these workers are respected and not infringed in any way." The union said in a news release that it's illegal in Canada for companies to close businesses because of unionization. That’s not necessarily what happened here, according to the news release, but the union is "demanding information from Ubisoft about the reason for the sudden decision to close."</p><p>"We will be looking for Ubisoft to show us that this had nothing to do with the employees joining a union," former Ubisoft Halifax programmer and bargaining committee member Jon Huffman said in a statement. "The workers, their families, the people of Nova Scotia, and all of us who love video games made in Canada, deserve nothing less."</p><p>Ubisoft Halifax started as Longtail Studios, which was founded in the early 2000s by Ubisoft cofounder Gérard Guillemot. In 2010, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-11-03-ubisoft-quebec-adds-longtail-studio.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>several studio members were absorbed into Ubisoft</u></a>, and by 2015, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-acquires-longtail-studios?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ubisoft had acquired Longtail Studios entirely</u></a>. That's when it became Ubisoft Halifax. Before joining Ubisoft, the studio was best known for its work on the Rocksmith franchise; under Ubisoft, it focused squarely on mobile games. Ubisoft Halifax was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260107214109/https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/studio/halifax"><u>quickly removed from the Ubisoft website on Wednesday</u></a>. IGN reported in 2023 that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-ubisoft-union-that-almost-was-the-untold-story-of-longtail-studios?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Longtail Studios tried to unionize in 2008</u></a>, but ultimately failed.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft has been cutting costs over the past several years: laying off staff, canceling games, and shutting down studios. <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/33qBiRpCj1Z9Ib5bbfbg5r/0c7fff607779c63e137037bc5c95a000/Ubisoft_H1_FY26_Slideshow_vF.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>In November</u></a>, Ubisoft shared in its earnings report that it intends to continue to reduce its fixed costs—to reduce costs by an additional €100 million by the 2027 fiscal year—on top of the €200 million reduction it had already enacted. Part of that reduction was a decrease of roughly 1,500 employees in the 12 months prior to the November earnings report. Not all of those departures were layoffs, however.</p><p>Ubisoft required a $1.25 billion investment from Tencent last year, too, to spin off the company's most successful franchises: Rainbow Six Siege, Far Cry, and Assassin's Creed. That initiative is called Vantage Studios, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-ceo-charlie-guillemot/"><u>led by Charlie Guillemot and Christophe Derennes</u></a>. "Vantage Studios represents a first step in Ubisoft's ongoing transformation," <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7GvucOgSm41HwFaXt2ADX1/ubisoft-launches-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ubisoft said in a news release from October</u></a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo hits its first hurdle</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="e04c98416aacb"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e04c98416aacb/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A few weeks back, we covered news that the US suffered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-us-suffered-its-worst-november-since-1995-in-terms-of-hardware-sales">its worst November since 1995</a> in terms of console hardware sales. Well, as reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stumble-over">The Game Business</a>, the Switch 2 wasn't immune, with sales down by 35% in the US compared to what the original Switch delivered in the same period during 2017.</p>
<p>Things are <em>slightly</em> better in the UK, though not by much. When comparing the same periods, the Switch 2 was down by 16% compared to the original Switch. It does, however, seem like a lot more people bought the Switch 2 during its first few months on the market, as overall sales for 2025 were actually up by by 6% compared to the Switch (which was also released a full 14 weeks earlier too, by the way).</p>
<p>Over in France, which is typically one of the strongest regions in Europe for Nintendo, Switch 2 sales for the Christmas period were down by "over 30%" compared to the Switch. This means that the UK actually saw stronger console sales than France over the same period.</p>
<p>Sales in Japan were also down, though admittedly not by much. We actually have solid figures here, too, with the Switch 2 shifting a total of 1.32 million consoles during the last nine weeks of 2025, while the Switch managed a total of 1.39 million during the same period in 2017, resulting in a decrease of around 5.5%. Similar to the situation in the UK, overall Switch 2 sales for the year in Japan were up by 11% compared to the Switch's launch year.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is doing remarkably well, then, and has already nailed the record as the fastest-selling console of all time. But as noted by an unnamed senior Nintendo employee when speaking to The Game Business, the "complicated economic landscape” mixed with higher price points and “the absence of a major Western game” means that the Switch 2 hasn't enjoyed quite as strong a Christmas period as the company might have hoped.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how things pan out in 2026. Nintendo is currently lacking a major "must-have" title for the Switch 2, with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</a> headlining the line-up so far. However, if rumours of a potential <strong>Pokémon Gen 10</strong> release later this year turn out to be true, then we reckon Nintendo might have the Christmas 2026 period in the bag.</p>
