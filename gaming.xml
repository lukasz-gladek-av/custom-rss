            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-darktide-unlocked-and-loaded-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fatshark has released the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>Unlocked and Loaded update a day earlier than expected, and it's bringing all kinds of goodies with it, including an itemization rework and more.</p>
<p>Several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-machine-god-update">updates</a> have already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-darktide-traitor-curse-update-celebrates-anniversary-with-new-content">released</a> for&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>since it launched all the way back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40000-darktide-release-date-pushed-back-once-again">in November 2022</a>, but this one looks to be significantly more ambitious than many of the shooter's previous content drops.</p>
<p>Part of Fatshark's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40000-darktide-2024-plans">ambitious roadmap</a> for&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>in 2024, the Unlocked and Loaded update's first (and, arguably, biggest) change is a total rework to how weapon progression and itemization work in&nbsp;the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-darktide-unlocked-and-loaded-update-enemy.jpg?itok=WTGeOMnh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-darktide-unlocked-and-loaded-update-enemy.jpg?itok=0CmUypik 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The latest&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>update is bringing big itemization changes.</figcaption></figure><p>Two new systems are being introduced in this update, namely Mastery and Power. Mastery allows players to gain experience in their weapon of choice, unlocking new rewards and perks as they use that weapon in missions.</p>
<p>Power, meanwhile, lets you spend resources at the Shrine of the Omnissiah in order to improve your weapon. This, in turn, lets you boost base stats, allowing weapons to reach their "maximum potential", according to Fatshark.</p>
<p>Unlocked and Loaded also introduces a brand new mission type in the form of Operations, which are intended to "provide a shorter and more cinematic experience". The first of these, Rolling Steel, sees you stopping a train hijacked by cultists.</p>
<p>Other new features in this update include a socially-oriented Party Finder to help you find like-minded&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>players, as well as a new time-limited special event, Unrelenting Hordes, that's running until October 10th.</p>

<p>The full list of changes in the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>Unlocked and Loaded update is extensive; so extensive, in fact, that Fatshark has spread the changes across four pages in its patch notes, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1361210/view/4653997209640960080" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can check out here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/warhammer-40000-darktide/9NT3WC6RKBVQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

Instead it will now come out on February 14, 2025 instead. Publisher Ubisoft blamed the delay on “soft” sales from <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and said it would be using “learnings” from that game in order to improve the latest <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game ahead of its new release date.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“We realize we need more time to polish and refine the experience, pushing further some of our key features,” Ubisoft announced through its Assassin’s Creed social media account on Wednesday. The company elaborated more in a press release aimed at investors that cited “soft” sales from Star Wars Outlaws as part of the reason for pushing the game back from its original November 11 launch. </p><p>“While the game is feature complete, the learnings from the <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title,” it read. “This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles.”</p><p>In addition, Ubisoft is revising <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadow</em>’s seasonal content plans. Instead of granting early access to players who purchase the more expensive Deluxe edition, all owners of the game will be able to play at the same time starting on February 14. In addition, anyone who pre-orders the game will get the first seasonal expansion for free rather than needing to purchase a separate upgrade to access it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation’s new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/25/first-look-report-ps5-pro-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> discusses the latest performance and fidelity upgrades for PS5 Pro Enhanced games, including Horizon Forbidden West, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, GT7, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-arriving-on-november-7">PS5 Pro Enhanced Games Arriving on November 7</h2>



<p>Horizon Forbidden West and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will feature new Enhanced modes on November 7, the launch date of the PS5 Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horizon Forbidden West’s Pro Performance mode will produce the same high frame rate as the stock PS5’s Performance mode while providing the fidelity of the stock Quality mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth’s Enhanced Mode on the PS5 Pro will maintain a frame rate of 60FPS and leverage the power of PSSR to provide a resolution on par with the Graphics mode.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-other-ps5-pro-enhanced-games">Other PS5 Pro Enhanced Games</h2>



<p>The Last of Us Part 1 and 2 Remastered will also offer a new PS5 Pro-specific mode that will upscale 1440p to 4K via PSSR super-resolution while maintaining a stable 60fps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insomniac will provide PS5 Pro enhancements for all four games released on the PS5: Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Players will find a new Performance Pro Mode in these games, running the title at 60fps while providing 4K resolution and ray tracing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avalanche Studios uses the PS5 Pro to enhance the ray tracing quality for Hogwarts Legacy through a new Fidelity Ray Tracing Mode, which will be available at launch. The new mode will add raytraced shadows and enhance raytraced reflections while targeting a stable 30fps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GT7 will release a few new PS5 Pro-focused rendering modes in November, including a Raytrace Priority Mode that will add new car reflections. GT7 will also include an experimental 8K/60fps mode for “hyper-crisp, hyper-clean visuals.” Players will need a display that supports 8K to test this feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>F1 24 is another PS5 Pro-enhanced game that will upgrade its quality mode to introduce ray tracing effects, offering a more realistic and immersive experience on rain-soaked courses.

                <p>Readyverse Studios, the technology and content studio founded in part by Ready Player One author Ernest Cline, has announced a partnership with Oscar-winning special effects and prop company Wētā Workshop, and has revealed the first visuals for its upcoming "multi-genre" battle royale game, Open.</p><p>New Zealand-based Wētā Workshop is of course best known for its work on The Lord of the Rings and Avatar franchises, and will work with Readyverse to "shape the visual and narrative foundation" of Open. Readyverse also announced it's partnered with <a href="https://neotokyo.codes/citizen-news" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neo Tokyo</a> to bring its IP characters, called Citizens, to Open.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373060-screenshot2024-09-25at8.05.49am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373060" data-ratio="0.56051990251828" data-width="1231" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373060-screenshot2024-09-25at8.05.49am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373060"></a><figcaption>A new look at the world of Open</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4373060-screenshot2024-09-25at8.05.49am.png"></figure><p>As announced previously, Open is modeled in part on Ready Player One, in that it will offer a virtual world filled with recognizable IP. Some of the partners that have been announced already include DeLorean, Reebok, and Cool Cats.</p><p>Readyverse co-founders Aaron McDonald, Shara Senderoff, Dan Farh, and Cline said in a joint statement that teaming up with Wētā allows the team to create content never before seen in gaming. "It's an honor to build our vision hand-in-hand with the best," the team said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIdV-YurOJM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JIdV-YurOJM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wētā's Richard Taylor said working with Readyverse has allowed it to "explore a visually stunning and incredibly immersive world unlike anything we have done before."</p><p>Open is in development now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It's a third-person battle royale game featuring environments inspired by media nostalgia. It will offer competitive and cooperative play modes, and aims to be a "defining" metaverse game that also incorporates web3 technology to allow for "asset interoperability and digital ownership."</p><p>Readyverse has not released any gameplay footage of Open as of yet, but keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>Open is in development at Walker Labs in partnership with Readyverse. People working on the game previously worked at studios like Epic, DICE, Microsoft, PlayStation, Remedy, EA, Ubisoft, and Lucasfilm.</p><p>"I was trying to imagine the coolest possible future version of the internet and video games and conflate it together," Cline said at SXSW this year, as reported by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/gaming-business/open-is-a-metaverse-experience-coming-from-ready-player-one-creators-readyverse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>. "And what the future would be like in 30 years. A ton of my experience was with the early days of the Internet, which felt like this new frontier. It was an egalitarian technology that everyone could use and have access to."</p><p>Readyverse isn't the only company attempting to create a so-called metaverse. Epic Games has been doing this for years through Fortnite, which features all manner of different licensed content from Metallica to Darth Vader and John Wick and Lego. Disney <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-it-invested-1-5-billion-into-fortnite-and-what-it-hopes-to-achieve/1100-6525584/" data-ref-id="1100-6525584">recently invested $1.5 billion into Epic to basically create Disney World inside Fortnite</a>.</p><p>"It's going to take on a life of its own and really quickly transcend what it is today. It's become very clear over the past few years that we're in this steep growth curve that's being driven by that," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-future-could-be-a-bigger-seamless-world-and-more-players/1100-6525024/" data-ref-id="1100-6525024">Sweeney said of Fortnite's metaverse ambitions</a>. "This medium is emerging at an astonishing rate, and I think people have no idea how awesome it's going to be by the end of this decade. But when you look at all the best capabilities of the top game engines, look at all the work being created for top movies in the film industry, all the work of all the car makers and of all the other storytellers and creators of all different kinds of games, and envision what the world is like when all of that comes together into a socially connected united economy which everybody can participate in, that's going to be a whole new world. And that's what we're very excited about."</p>

While the 168 million global subscriptions present a significant opportunity for broader reach and steady revenue, developers are treading carefully.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A July 2024 survey of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/om123391/game-developer-collective-survey-july-2024-trends-in-design-accessibility-and-inclusion">Game Developer Collective</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reveals that while many developers are optimistic about including their games in subscription services, few are tailoring the design of their games specifically for these platforms. No doubt, the slowing uptake of game subscription services post-pandemic has been a key factor in this restrained approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is in contrast with the experience of other industries, such as music, where streaming services have had a significant impact on songwriting, with artists adapting to fit algorithms and playlists. The key difference is that music subscriptions account for over two-thirds of industry revenue, compared to less than 10% for games – meanwhile, game developers face a far more opaque payout model.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the survey, 35% of game developers believe it’s likely that their current game will be added to one or more subscription services. However, when asked if subscription models have influenced the design of their current game, only 13% indicated that subscription services have had any impact on their development process. A striking 80% said these services had no influence at all. These numbers reveal a gap between interest in inclusion and active adaptation to the unique requirements of subscription platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Limited design adaptation points to industry hesitation about subscriptions</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Uncertainty about how subscription services will impact developers’ revenue models long-term is likely at the core of this cautiousness. The most successful subscription platforms, like Xbox Game Pass, often provide developers with lucrative upfront payments in exchange for including their games in the service. But for smaller titles or those without obvious blockbuster potential, the ambiguity around whether their games will be selected for a subscription service makes it hard to rely on subscriptions as a revenue stream.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games designed with subscription models in mind need to hook players quickly, as subscribers have access to a large library and can easily move on if they aren’t engaged early. A separate consumer survey conducted by Omdia found that four in ten subscribers try new games for only 30 minutes or fewer before deciding to commit. Yet, 80% of surveyed developers were reluctant to make substantial design changes, like front-loading exciting content right at the start of the game, that might favor these platforms (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>see chart above</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Opportunities offered by subscriptions remain alluring to developers</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the reluctance to change game design, the overall appeal of subscription services cannot be denied; 35% of developers expect their current game to be added to a subscription service (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>see the chart below below</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). Developers recognize the potential to reach a broader audience, particularly through services like Xbox Game Pass, which boasts over 34 million of subscribers worldwide. For some developers, inclusion in these services provides exposure to players who may not have encountered their games otherwise. The lure of increased discoverability and the potential for long-tail revenue has led some studios to start exploring these platforms, even if they aren't overhauling their design strategies just yet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, these benefits are tempered by the slow subscriber growth all platforms are experiencing. After the pandemic-induced surge in 2020 and 2021, subscriber growth has slowed significantly, and while steady growth is still expected in the years ahead, the massive consumer adoption some industry players envisioned remains distant. While subscriptions will generate $19.4bn in 2024, this will still make up just 8.8% of global games content revenue this year, according to Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/om124566/game-subscriptions-and-cloud-gaming-market-forecast-report-202428">latest report on the game subscriptions market</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But while subscriptions will not dominate the games market, they will complement a diverse range of monetization approaches. Therefore, the path forward will likely involve cautious experimentation – balancing the allure of subscription platforms with the economic realities of game development.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Principal Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">George is a regular contributor to Game Developer and a principal analyst at Omdia, leading research into games and AR/VR markets.

            <p>
Ubisoft has announced a dramatic delay to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which will now launch on 14th February 2025 instead of its previously planned arrival this November. 
</p>
<p>
The publisher has always targeted the year's key holiday sales period for its Assassin's Creed blockbusters, making this move highly unusual. In a statement, Ubisoft blamed a "softer than expected launch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a>", and said was acting now based on "learnings" from that game.  
</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will now launch on Steam on day one - a move the publisher has indicated will continue with other releases going forward. </p>
<p>In another change, Shadows will now ditch the franchise's established season pass model. The game's first expansion will be granted free to anyone with a pre-order, however.</p>
<p>"While the game is feature complete, the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide
additional time to further polish the title," Ubisoft said in a statement today. "This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles."
</p>
<p>Today's delay also marked Ubisoft's first comments on the performance of Star Wars Outlaws, which it says had received a "solid" critical response that had not translated into sales. </p>
<p>"In response to player feedback, Ubisoft's development teams are currently fully mobilised to swiftly implement a series of updates to polish and improve the player experience in order to engage a large audience during the
holiday season to position Star Wars Outlaws as a strong long-term performer. The game will be available on Steam on 21st November."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/heart-electric-is-a-hero-shooter-from-a-dice-veteran-behind-battlefield-and-star-wars-battlefront<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
A veteran of Battlefield and Star Wars Battlefront development has founded a fresh studio to launch Heart Electric, a new take on the hero shooter genre. 
</p>
<p>
Niklas Fegraeus, who served 15 years at DICE, announced the founding of Stockholm-based startup Modoyo last month. Now, the first gameplay footage of its debut project has also been revealed. 
</p>
<p>
Heart Electric - whose immediate look is bright and fun, if basic - hopes to stick a defibrillator to the embattled hero shooter genre, which recently saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">the failure of Concord</a> even as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">Valve's own effort Deadlock waits in the wings</a>.

<p>
How does it all work? Well, the idea is that each Heart Electric match begins with four teams of four heroes in their own base with a set amount of revives. You can go all out and simply take down opponents, which adds to your revive pool, or work more tactically to storm another team's base and steal their revives from them.
</p>
<p>
The idea is that with four small teams, the balance of gameplay can shift over the course of a match, and deciding who to target or work together with at a specific point is key. "Victory depends on reading the pulse of the battlefield," a press release states.
</p>
<p>
There's no firm release date yet, but you can sign up for a playtest now via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2392980/Heart_Electric/">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-upgrade-adds-mandatory-psn-account-requirement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite this being one of the most controversial decisions made in the PC ports of their PlayStation games, Sony is doing it again. The PC version of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PC will add a mandatory PSN account requirement. The decision to do this in their previous games has already had Sony under fire by the masses, and it seems that they haven't read the criticisms, or they would stray from making such a decision.</p>
<p>While the<a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launching-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/"> PC upgrade</a> will come with benefits, this serves as a huge inconvenience to those who don't want to have to make a PlayStation account to play their PC game. Once you have a PlayStation account set up for the game, it will come with a PlayStation overlay with Trophy Support, as well as its own set of features which includes support for ultra-wide resolutions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the upgrade will use performance-enhancing technologies such as NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3.1 with frame generation. All of this information will be covered in another blog post at a later date.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-is-coming-to-ps5-pc-october-31-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post released on the PlayStation</a> website after the announcement, Jan-Bart Van Beek discusses the decision to remaster the game and how it came to be. Jan-Bart van Beek is the Studio Director, as well as the Studio Art &amp; Animation Director at Guerilla. To help remaster the game, Nixxes got involved and has been leading the charge on remastering the game. Nixxes was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment in July 2021, with the specific job of bringing PlayStation games to PC. They have worked on port developments for games such as Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut.</p>
<p>The Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster will of course have the technological improvements and visual enhancements. Still, this version of the game will also include The Frozen Wilds, which is the huge expansion created for the game, adding extra environments, weapons, and machines for you to explore.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered has also been announced to come with native support for the Playstation 5 Pro. The game will utilize all of the features of the PlayStation 5 and the DualSense controller by adding custom haptics to make it more tactile and immersive. The blog post states that the game will allow you to access your old save games from the older version, allowing players to dive into a New Game+ or utilize the Photo Mode available.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will be available on PC via Steam or the Epic Game Store, priced at $49.99. Although those who previously owned the PS4 or PC version of the game can get the remaster for $9.99, those who have a disc-less console and own the previous iteration on a disc won't be able to access the upgrade offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253649/ps5-pro-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Eight years ago, PlayStation lead architect Mark Cerny showed me the power of the PS4 Pro in this very room. Today, I’m checking out the new PS5 Pro instead — and feeling some major déjà vu. </p><p>Like before, Sony is showing journalists a room full of screens at its PlayStation US headquarters just outside of San Francisco, playing 11 games side by side on both the original hardware and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24240801/ps5-pro-details-playstation-event-september-2024">the guts of the new $700 Pro</a>. Like before, you’ll pay a hefty premium for graphical improvements rather than new titles. Like before, games will need to be patched to give you most of those boosts, and not all patches will be equal.</p><p>And like before, those improvements are <em>seriously impressive</em> if your TV is close enough to your couch. This time, it brings out details like individual blades of grass, improves the density of particles onscreen, unlocks optional 8K and ray tracing modes, and even reduces the distracting shimmering that often popped up in games on the original console. </p><p>Michiel van der Leeuw, technical director on all the <em>Horizon </em>games, shows me how much smoother <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> can be on the PS5 Pro, how much sharper now that it’s sampling textures that render more crisply, and how it no longer needs to display the same ugly clouds.</p><p>“It was as if a pair of dirty goggles had been lifted from my eyes,” <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/playstation-4-pro-4k-tv-games-checkerboard-rendering/">I wrote in 2016 about the PS4 Pro</a>. I get the exact same vibe from <em>Horizon</em> and most other PS5 Pro Enhanced games I’m trying now. </p><div><p><figcaption>Horizon Forbidden West<em> technical director Michiel van der Leeuw shows me another scene, where the PS5 Pro loads this dino’s skin at higher quality, sooner, than the PS5 below.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I’ll get into more details below, but I want you to know my conclusion <em>isn’t</em> quite the same as it was eight years ago. While it’s clearly better than the PS5, I’m not yet sold. That’s mostly because Sony is charging several hundred dollars more than last time — but also partly because I had to stand so close to the 4K screen to get that eye-popping result. </p><p>Sony’s demos keep us so close to the TVs it’s impossible not to see improvements, with fixed-length wired controllers encouraging us to stay nearby. When I step back anyhow, the PS5 Pro’s graphical improvements get harder to make out. Some disappear at six feet, most of them at 10 feet, in game after game. That’s a bit further than I measured with the PS4 Pro vs. PS4 eight years ago.</p><p>But if you’re the kind of person who already sets your PS5 games to “Quality” or “Fidelity” or “Graphics” mode rather than “Performance,” I bet you’ll see a huge increase in smoothness with the PS5 Pro no matter how far away you sit. Some went from utterly choppy to downright buttery for me on the PS5 Pro, with almost all the visual quality (if not more) than the original PS5’s fidelity modes.</p><p>The biggest surprise for me, though, was seeing a console that can offer so many of the immersive benefits of ray tracing without massive slowdowns. It’s unlikely many games will <em>add</em> ray tracing modes specifically for the PS5 Pro, but Formula One racing game <em>F1 24 </em>already had them — and it now lets you drive at an upscaled 4K and 60fps with them turned on. </p><p>When producer Simon Lumb flicks ray-traced graphics on and off for me, it feels like the whole image comes to life. Suddenly, the car’s crash-protection halo casts realistic shadows on the bodywork; reflections naturally appear in puddles on the track and on the car’s shiny hood; windows appear to refract light.</p><div><p><figcaption>Demon’s Souls<em>’ smoky boss barriers now have more particles — an interesting feature of Sony’s PSSR. </em></figcaption></p></div><p>Both <em>F1 24</em> and <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> will let you choose other modes instead of ray tracing. They can optionally use the PS5 Pro’s extra horsepower and AI upscaling to offer an 8K picture (for the few and proud with 8K TVs), or a smoother 120Hz mode at 4K upscaled resolution instead. But now that I’ve experienced it, I’d pick ray tracing every time. </p><p><strong>Quick note</strong>: if a developer says their game is running at “4K” resolution, you should know that’s not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison with other “4K” games. In every case, the PS5 Pro is outputting<em> </em>a 4K picture to your TV thanks to the magic of AI upscaling, with all the crispness that provides. The game’s internal render resolution may be quite a bit lower, though, and it <em>varies</em> as you play, all of which can affect the end quality.</p><div><p><strong>Just for transparency’s sake:</strong></p><div><ul><li>Sony didn’t grant us an interview about the PS5 Pro, so we weren’t able to answer any new questions about the hardware itself. </li><li>Sony wouldn’t let us touch the new console hardware. </li><li>The demos were technically running on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-playstation-5-dev-kit-photo-sets-tongues-wagging">PS5 devkits</a> representing the PS5 and PS5 Pro, not the consoles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24249600/ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-photos">in my photos</a>. Scott Stein tells me <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/">his early preview at <em>CNET</em></a> also did not run on the console in his photos. This isn’t entirely unusual for new hardware: I once reviewed an Xbox 360 game on a Microsoft-provided devkit. </li><li>We couldn’t take photos or video close to the screens, in case you’re wondering why we didn’t do so.</li></ul></div></div><p>Developers tell me that Sony’s PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling can keep up with all of that, turning a 720p image into a 4K one on the fly at 59.94 frames per second — but 720p upscaled to 2160p may not look as good as 1440p upscaled to 2160p, of course. Some developers might still want to sacrifice frame rate for resolution if Sony lets them. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/16/24131799/sony-ps5-pro-enhanced-requirements-ultra-boost-mode">A leaked document suggests they might</a>, but Sony has not confirmed.)</p><p>Also: while developer after developer tells me the PS5 Pro provides “the best of both worlds” with fidelity and performance, the PS5 Pro doesn’t <em>quite</em> offer double the performance of the original console — so some small sacrifices are being made.  </p><p>For example, Insomniac’s <em>Spider-Man 2</em> actually runs at a lower render resolution in its new PS5 Pro “Performance Pro” mode than it does in the “Fidelity” mode on the original PS5. While I <em>vastly preferred</em> the PS5 Pro experience, it does lead to some interesting edge cases where fine detail on certain objects (like windows on distant buildings) might not be quite as easy to make out. </p><div><p><figcaption>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart <em>technical director Mike Fitzgerald</em> <em>shows me how picture quality has improved — at a slight expense of crowd density.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>With <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>, the same developer took a different tack: if you look closely, there are actually fewer spectators in the stands in the PS5 Pro’s “Performance Pro” mode compared to the vanilla PS5’s “Fidelity” mode. Still, the game looks both smoother and crisper thanks to the PS5 Pro changes, so it’s hard for me to complain. More detail in some areas too!</p><p>When developers do have to choose, several tell me they decided to prioritize “stability,” fixing the most glaring sacrifices they had to make on the original console. But some games will ship with their original Performance and Fidelity modes, too, in case you prefer them. </p><p>And a few games really do look like the best of both worlds: I couldn’t find a single sacrifice in my short time with <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth — </em>the hair and fine details on PS5 Pro even exceed the original PS5’s “Graphics” mode.</p><p>We’re looking forward to getting a PS5 Pro in for testing so we can do a full review. Meanwhile, I’ll leave you with some rough notes on each game I saw!</p><div><ul><li><strong><em>Demon’s Souls</em>:</strong> One single PS5 Pro mode that targets 60fps at a PSSR-upscaled 4K resolution — may not always hit 60 but feels very smooth for a FromSoftware game. Will retain old modes, too. Lots of extra souls-like particle effects thanks to PSSR! Can see flagpoles on a castle in the distance from Boletaria Bridge that aren’t visible on the original PS5, as long as I’m no further than five feet from the TV.</li><li><strong><em>Dragon’s Dogma II</em>:  </strong>PS5 Pro mode currently hitting 55–60fps VRR in the city, capped at 60fps outside, at PSSR-upscaled 4K resolution. Wouldn’t discuss internal resolution.</li><li><strong><em>F1 24</em>:<em> </em></strong>1440p render resolution, PSSR-upscaled to 4K at locked 60fps. Ray-tracing mode also 4K, locked 60fps. 4K120 and 8K60 modes, too. On original PS5, had to run at half-res internally to hit 4K60, so 1440p is an improvement.</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>:<em> </em></strong>One single PS5 Pro mode at PSSR-upscaled 4K60, variable internal resolution. Best showcase game for the PS5 Pro, as the original PS5’s performance mode looks muddy by comparison. Can clearly see scratches on Cloud’s sword from five feet that are invisible in original PS5’s performance mode; can barely make them out at eight feet. </li><li><em><strong>Gran Turismo 7: </strong></em>Four PS5 Pro modes: prioritize ray tracing, prioritize frame rate, 8K mode, 120Hz 4K mode, all using PSSR for upscaling and all targeting 60fps; 8K mode slightly sharper than 4K. Ray tracing mode clearly lets cars show reflections of one another. </li><li><strong><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>: </strong>Three PS5 Pro modes: fidelity, fidelity + ray tracing, performance. PS5 Pro perf mode has more detail than original PS5 perf mode. Ray tracing looks impressive, now includes ray-traced shadows and more detail in reflections. All modes dynamic internal resolution, but now capped at 80 percent of 4K rather than 67 percent of 4K. </li><li><strong><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>: </strong>One single PS5 Pro mode at PSSR-upscaled 4K60, based on “higher than 1440p” variable internal resolution. Will also offer old PS5 modes. On original PS5, offered 1800p checkerboard based on lower internal resolution. Far less distracting shimmering on distant details, increased texture detail (all textures one mipmap crisper), increased shadow filtering quality in faces, and more.</li><li><em><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2: </strong></em>One single PS5 Pro mode at PSSR-upscaled 4K60, based on lower render resolution than original Fidelity mode. Considering a “Fidelity Pro” mode as well. Shimmering cleaned up dramatically at distance. </li><li><strong><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>: </strong>One single PS5 Pro mode at PSSR-upscaled 4K60, based on “generally a tick or two higher” internal render resolution than on PS5. (Original render resolution varied but minimum ranged from 1080p to around 1280p depending on mode.) Small details like bits of confetti don’t disappear as easily; reduced shimmering on details.</li><li><strong><em>The Crew Motorfest</em>: </strong>One single PS5 Pro mode at PSSR-upscaled 4K60. Increased load distances, shadow distances, but can’t quite tell the difference at racing speeds. Increased internal resolution too, though: I can make out a spoiler’s carbon fiber texture at five feet from TV, which I can’t see on original PS5. </li><li><strong><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>: </strong>One single PS5 Pro mode at 4K60, PSSR-upscaled from 1440p. On original PS5, only offered native 4K30 or 1440p60. It’s clearly far sharper than 1440p60 (the grass!) and far smoother than 4K30. Some slight details in the original native 4K30 arguably look better. </li></ul></div><p><em>Photos by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, it turns out this wasn’t just a tribute to the caped crusader on Batman Day, but a tease for a long-standing collaboration between <em>Sonic </em>and the comic book company.</p><p>Late in the showcase, Sega’s chief brand &amp; business officer for the <em>Sonic</em> series Ivo Gerscovich revealed the collaboration will include a five-issue comic series that will roll out monthly starting in March 2025.

Gerscovich said Sonic, Shadow, and the rest of the cast will be teaming up with the Justice League while also dressing as them, so it doesn’t sound like Sonic and friends are taking the place of the DC heroes. Maybe each comic will show <em>Sonic </em>characters working alongside the superheroes and learning a thing or two.

Let’s go down the list.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="67bcbf9fbc340674f733ac0c0c0a0a9e" data-recommend-id="image://67bcbf9fbc340674f733ac0c0c0a0a9e" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith presents Shadow as Batman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith presents Shadow as Batman." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="67bcbf9fbc340674f733ac0c0c0a0a9e" data-recommend-id="image://67bcbf9fbc340674f733ac0c0c0a0a9e" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith presents Shadow as Batman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Looking at the list, a few of these collaborations are natural fits. Putting Shadow, the dark, brooding hedgehog as Batman is one of those crossovers that just makes sense. One notable part of Shadow’s Batman design is that his red stripes have been recolored to a gray similar to the hero’s costume. He still has his iconic, rocket-powered jet shoes on top of the cape and utility belt, but they have also been recolored to give him a uniform, night-appropriate look.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0dcc37d69d95a52d662f49c41e18756d" data-recommend-id="image://0dcc37d69d95a52d662f49c41e18756d" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Knuckles as Superman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Knuckles as Superman." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0dcc37d69d95a52d662f49c41e18756d" data-recommend-id="image://0dcc37d69d95a52d662f49c41e18756d" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Knuckles as Superman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While you might expect Sonic to wear the Superman cape and tights as an optimistic juxtaposition for Shadow as Batman’s brooding nature, Knuckles as Superman makes a ton of sense. The echidna has been characterized by his strength over the years and can glide just like Superman flies. The design looks like a much more straightforward redesign than Shadow’s, mostly just putting Knuckles into the suit without a ton of notable changes. He does keep his sneakers, however, which are now a solid red, without the yellow mid-sections.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eef33ebc42f67ffdecf71da2609a0aa4" data-recommend-id="image://eef33ebc42f67ffdecf71da2609a0aa4" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Amy as Wonder Woman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Amy as Wonder Woman." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eef33ebc42f67ffdecf71da2609a0aa4" data-recommend-id="image://eef33ebc42f67ffdecf71da2609a0aa4" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Amy as Wonder Woman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Amy’s Wonder Woman design marries her silhouette with the hero’s maximalist iconography and palette. She keeps the dress she’s known for, albeit colored with the red, blue, and gold theme synonymous with the Amazonian hero. The skirt is adorned with stars and the “WW” logo is spread across the top. Her hammer also has the hero’s logo on it, which I’m glad to see is still here as opposed to replacing her iconic weapon with Wonder Woman’s Lasso of Truth. There’s already so much of Wonder Woman in this design, so it’s good to see part of Amy’s personality still shining through. In place of her own hairband, Amy now wears a gold one with a red star in the center much like Wonder Woman’s, and dons a red cape with a golden trim. It’s definitely one of the busier designs of the bunch, but Amy’s never been one to do something halfway.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0779f60022c245b5c694f5b53b71d80" data-recommend-id="image://c0779f60022c245b5c694f5b53b71d80" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Sonic as The Flash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Sonic as The Flash." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0779f60022c245b5c694f5b53b71d80" data-recommend-id="image://c0779f60022c245b5c694f5b53b71d80" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Sonic as The Flash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Again, this is one of those that just makes sense when you hear it. The blue blur’s gotta go fast, so he’s naturally going to be cosplaying as DC Comics’ speedster. All things considered, Sonic’s Flash costume is pretty tame. If you didn’t know any better, you’d think he was just a fan’s red hedgehog OC. Every inch of his blue fur has been covered with a red costume with gold lightning bolts etched into the material. He also has little lightning bolts next to his ears to represent Flash’s “wings” seen on his mask in most modern depictions. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2f9dbb34139d1cd0903b7130fd3a7eba" data-recommend-id="image://2f9dbb34139d1cd0903b7130fd3a7eba" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith and Ivo Gerscovich present Silver as Green Lantern." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith and Ivo Gerscovich present Silver as Green Lantern." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f9dbb34139d1cd0903b7130fd3a7eba" data-recommend-id="image://2f9dbb34139d1cd0903b7130fd3a7eba" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith and Ivo Gerscovich present Silver as Green Lantern." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This combination also makes sense, but it is probably the least remarkable of the designs. Silver’s psychic powers are a hop and skip away from using a powerful ring to create anything you can imagine, so he’s a solid fit to wear a Power Ring and join the Green Lantern Corps. But yeah, he’s got the green torso piece with the logo on his chest and black spandex on his arms and legs, but there’s not much else to this. Glad to see Silver getting some love, though.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="10ba66d60f09f6d08694a1f280408be0" data-recommend-id="image://10ba66d60f09f6d08694a1f280408be0" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Tails as Cyborg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Tails as Cyborg." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10ba66d60f09f6d08694a1f280408be0" data-recommend-id="image://10ba66d60f09f6d08694a1f280408be0" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Tails as Cyborg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Rounding out the cast is Tails as Cyborg. This one might seem out of left field at a glance, but it makes sense given that he’s the most technically knowledgeable of the group. He’s also already been an android in the <em>Sonic Prime</em> animated show, so fans are probably used to seeing him with a robotic body. He’s shown with most of his body having been replaced with mechanical parts with the exception of half of his face and his two tails. His left hand is a four-fingered claw, but Cyborg is able to transform parts of his body, so we’ll likely see Tails’ extremities take different forms in the comics.</p><hr><p>The <em>Sonic </em>X DC collaboration will also include merchandise (clothes, toys, collectibles, etc.) that will be released in the fall of 2025. While Gerscovich didn’t get into specifics, Sega and DC plan to continue the crossover into 2026, but it’s unclear if that means more comics, merchandise, or perhaps something not mentioned during the presentation. The animated teaser sends the mind wandering about a possible animated miniseries or something along those lines. But in the meantime, <em>Sonic </em>fans are already getting an animated miniseries in the form of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-anime-expo-1851580851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-anime-expo-1851580851"><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations: Dark Beginnings</em></a></span>, which will follow Shadow the Hedgehog’s origin story.

Missing features, adding frustrating bugs, and lacking upgrades across certain platforms made it feel like a lackluster port of all-time classics. Konami is trying to make good on that commitment a year later, however, with a 2.0 update that improves a lot, at least on PC.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.konami.com/mg/mc/news/us/en/update_200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mc/news/us/en/update_200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The patch will be out on PC first</a></span>, arriving alongside a trading card and badge for the<em> Metal Gear</em> collection on Steam. The release for other platforms will follow at a later date. A big addition for <em>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</em> on PC is the ability to finally customize the resolution in the settings menu. There are also new optional upscaling techniques that should improve the sharpness of the game at various points. The in-game movies can also be swapped to a clearer image or keep the original look. </p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em> is getting similar new settings options, including adjustable controller schemes and alternate keyboard layouts. The further upscaling techniques that can be applied seem to make a decent different, letting players take for advantage of their hardware to boost the visual crispness. The proof will be in the results players actually get once the updated version of the collection is installed. Hopefully it hasn’t broken anything else in the process.</p><p> “We’re also worried about how <em>Vol. 1</em> had a pretty rough launch,” Konami’s Noriaki Okamura recently said in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b86pccn_5SE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b86pccn_5SE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Metal Gear</em> Production Hotline</a></span> livestream. “We’re going to do everything we can to not repeat that [with Volume 2].” </p><p>Konami is also working on a <em>Master Collection Vol. 2</em>. Even though we don’t know what’s in it yet, it would likely include <em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, the second-to-last <em>Metal Gear </em>game that director Hideo Kojima worked on, which has been trapped on the PlayStation 3 with no backwards compatibility options  for nearly two decades. The Japanese publisher also has a remake of <em>Snake Eater </em>called <em>Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta</em> that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819?_gl=1*5lsrse*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzI3MDM0NC45MS4xLjE3MjcyNzQ3MjguNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819?_gl=1*5lsrse*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzI3MDM0NC45MS4xLjE3MjcyNzQ3MjguNjAuMC4w">looks pretty and very faithful to the original</a></span>, but still doesn’t have a release date. </p><p>Either way, it’s nice to see that in addition to honoring the legacy of its back catalog, Konami is also willing to go back and fix its mistakes after launch. After all, <em>Master Collection Vol. 1</em> will likely be the main way people have to access these games for many years to come. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The PlayStation 5 Pro seems like a tough sell, especially to players who already own the original PS5. That's a sentiment I had going into a preview event for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/">PS5 Pro</a> and one I still have after spending a few hours with the new console.</p><p dir="ltr">If I didn't already have a PS5, then the PS5 Pro would be on my shortlist--the level of detail it brings to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/">Pro-enhanced games</a> like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Horizon Forbidden West is incredible, catapulting the experience of playing a game so that it now gets performance mode-style frame rates with fidelity mode-style graphics. And, of course it does. The PS5 Pro's hardware is superior to the base PS5--it should make games look better. But nothing at the event convinced me I needed to go out and get a Pro the moment it launches. It's clear that, for now at least, the base PS5 is still perfectly serviceable when it comes to playing PlayStation's first-party titles. I'm more than content to save my $700. For my full thoughts on my time with the PS5 Pro, watch the video embedded below.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The PS5 Pro Surprised Us In Our Hands-On</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">To better understand how the PS5 Pro is impacting how PlayStation's first-party studios will be developing their games going forward, I spoke with Sony Interactive Entertainment senior principal product manager Toshi Aoki. We also discussed the technical details and the development of PS5 Pro, such as the implementation of the console's cooling systems to ensure the Pro doesn't run hotter than the base PS5 despite the boosts to the GPU.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Does the PS5 Pro alleviate anything on PlayStation Studios? In terms of the work that they're doing with their games, does this console help them at all?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Toshi Aoki</strong>: Well, developers always want more. Whatever we give them, they actually use it up, which is a great thing because we are here to support the creators to create and realize their visions. The more range or options they have, the happier [they are]. And when the creators are happy, they create awesome games, which then makes the players happy. It creates that great flywheel, and we want to make sure that we keep that creative vision coming and flowing. I think that's a great direction that we're going with together with the developers.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>A lot of PlayStation games support both performance and fidelity modes. With the PS5 Pro, what happens with those modes? Is there still a noticeable difference choosing one over the other? Or do they now behave virtually the same?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It will differ per game depending on what modes they already had and how [their respective developers] want to showcase [the game] to the players. So far, we've [mostly] seen [developers] mainly [realizing] that you don't have to make that choice [anymore]. That there is one mode that gives you both of the benefits. That's kind of the target the teams are going forward with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372400-14_ff7rebirth_0915_pv_fix_png_jpgcopy%281%29-e47dkrbja.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372400" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372400-14_ff7rebirth_0915_pv_fix_png_jpgcopy%281%29-e47dkrbja.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372400"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was the most impressive game I saw running on PS5 Pro.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372400-14_ff7rebirth_0915_pv_fix_png_jpgcopy%281%29-e47dkrbja.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Just from the games that I've seen so far, it seems like there's a range of differences between games--Marvel's Spider-Man 2 only had a few differences, for example, whereas Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart had a more noticeable transformation between the standard PS5 on performance mode and the PS5 Pro. Is there one game in particular folks should check to see the greatest difference between what the PS5 and PS5 Pro can do?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I honestly like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-looks-sharper-and-more-detailed-on-ps5-pro-report/1100-6526560/">That one probably has the biggest jump</a>, when you look at PS5 and PS5 Pro. Again, it'll differ per game of course, so it's difficult to say what's good and what's even better. I think Final Fantasy is a good showcase that you should try out.</p><p dir="ltr">[Rebirth] is a game where I think when we see the screenshots, it's always coming from the fidelity mode. But if you are the person who wants to switch to 60fps, the visuals do get downgraded to meet the hit. I think [performance mode] is the choice that the players are taking, and that's where we want to give players the best of both worlds.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>As someone who likes to position all of his consoles together next to the TV so they look pretty but has to make sure they all have enough air flow, how hot does the PS5 Pro get, especially since it's doing a lot more than the original PS5?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Our cooling system is all designed to make sure that it is at the same level as the PS5. You can see it later when you see the actual [console], it is slightly bigger and has more vents, so that we have more airflow.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372402-4205224-spider3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372402-4205224-spider3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372402"></a><figcaption>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 looked pretty much the same on PS5 and PS5 Pro but I could see far-off skyscrapers more clearly on the latter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372402-4205224-spider3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I'm someone who bought the PS5 on day one, and I pretty much only play it for PlayStation first-party exclusives--is the PS5 Pro a console for folks like me?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Well, it is for the enthusiasts, the most engaged players. Which could be our initial early adopters who purchased the PS5. Also, people who have not come yet, maybe on other devices, but would want to play on the big-screen TVs. Have that capability on the console now that would shift over. We're not targeting just like the current PS5 owners, that's not it. It's more for the game enthusiasts who want to have that gameplay experience, which could be new users as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Given the higher specs of the PS5 Pro, is there now a higher benchmark for PlayStation studios to play with when designing games with performance and fidelity modes? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">Well, we can't speculate about the future. But, from history, when creators get more things to play with, they do [tend to] push the boundaries and go for more. Because I think from a creative perspective, they have so many ideas. They want to add so many details, so many gameplay details as well, the smoothness side as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The reality of 60 frames per second is that you have to write a lot of pixels or have AI upscalers do it for you. I think [studios] will still push the performance of the devices that they're on. I think that will continue. Right now, I think the PS5 Pro will be the new benchmark that they'll be targeting, and our hope is that the best game experience is going to be on the PS5 Pro.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372407-alfabetajuega-horizon-zero-dawn-310717.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372407" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372407-alfabetajuega-horizon-zero-dawn-310717.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372407"></a><figcaption>I'm eager to see how the new Horizon Zero Dawn remaster plays on PS5 Pro.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372407-alfabetajuega-horizon-zero-dawn-310717.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What's the thing that you're most excited about for players to see and experience when they get their hands on this new console when it comes out?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Well, definitely when they play a game, they just really get immersed in it. That's our target: having players play the game and then just love playing it without that trade-off that they might be making right now or [making a] selection they might be [forced] to make right now... That will really make me happy.</p>

            <p>Nexus mods user iArtorias has removed their handy mod that let players bypass PSN for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> on PC.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarök was hit by negative Steam reviews upon its release that took aim at Sony's controversial requirement for PC users to link to a PSN account. PC players being PC players, however, came up with a mod which could be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-mod-removes-sonys-controversial-psn-linking-requirement">used to negate Sony's controversial PSN linking requirement</a>. The mod did this by removing the PSN overlay.</p>
<p>However, its creator iArtorias has now removed the mod from Nexus, with no explanation given at the current time.</p>

<p>According to the Nexus Mods social media account, iArtorias removed the mod themselves, and the site had nothing to do with this decision.</p>
<p>"By the way: We've noticed that the popular PSN-bypass mod for God of War Ragnarök has been removed from our site by the author, and so we've reached out to find out why," the account shared on X.</p>

<p>If you click through to the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description">mod</a> now, rather than being met with all the details on how to install and such, you are instead greeted with a message that reads: "The mod you were looking for couldn't be found."</p>
<p>When I looked through the mod's page earlier this week, there were requests from other users asking iArtorias to create a similar mod for the likes of the recently-released PC version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. It seems uncertain now if iArtorias will consider this a viable option.</p>
<p>At time of writing, there is no indication on whether the mod's removal from Nexus Mods was to do with Sony, however Eurogamer has asked for comment.</p>
