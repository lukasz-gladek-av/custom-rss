		<p>The Venn diagram of people who like tanks and people who like giant mechs might not just be one circle, but it’s probably close enough that it will feel like you’re looking at one of those red and blue 3D pictures without the glasses on. So, having already covered the land, sea and air battles of World of Tanks, Warplanes and Warships, it makes perfect sense that Wargaming’s next game would go all mecha. Enter the Steel Hunters.</p>
<p><iframe title="STEEL HUNTERS - GAMEPLAY REVEAL" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMtdbfsXiY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set in a post-cataclysm world, in which Starfall has polluted the world (because we clearly weren’t doing a quick enough job of it) and forced mankind to evacuate and live in space stations, you’ll play as a Hunter sent back down to the planet to try and harvest Starfall for all the energy and resource it can provide the orbital populace.</p>


<p>It’s a pretty generic premise, and don’t expect to be too surprised by the genres that Wargaming is targeting here, either. This is a blend of hero shooter, battle royale and extraction shooter. But… mechs are pretty dang cool.</p>
<p>Six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, their gigantic mechs keeping them safe from the elements, and handily helping you absolutely massive as you stomp around the world and come across towns, bridges, cars and other manmade structures that have now been left abandoned.</p>


<p>At launch there’s seven hunters to choose from, with the very standard Razorside an all-rounder with frag grenades and a shield recharge ability. Much cooler are the two quadrupeds Ursus and Fenris, who have missiles and greater mobility as their advantages. Heartbreaker is then a sniper stealth assassin, Prophet a glass cannon who’s best staying away from the fight and summoning drones, while Trenchwalker is the combat medic with a grenade launcher.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better than two or four legs? How about eight! Weaver is an arachnid that’s all about territorial control, deploying one-way shields and being able to switch to a minigun mode that slows movement but allows you to put down a lot of firepower.</p>
<p>There’s a good, solid mixture of different archetypes here, and Wargaming will have plenty of ideas of new mechs to add down the line. What’s also important is how they work together. You’ll always drop and fight as a pair, so having Trenchwalker, Prophet or Weaver could be great for their various forms of second line support abilities alongside a faster-moving Fenris to quickly show force to enemy teams.</p>

<p>Still on the planet are drones that you will want to attack to gain loot from them, whether that’s a boost to shields, energy cells (which feed an in-match experience system), repair kits and more. Each mech has unlockable abilities as you gain experience and work up through five levels –&nbsp;level 3 unlocks the second ability. There’s some potential here for different builds to emerge that can add to the player synergies and tactical choices as well.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of your tactics will be determined by the game mode. Starfall Harvest has you heading to try and capture and hold towers that will give bonuses to radar, buffs and the like. Mid-game events will also spice things up with a Tag Hunt, where you need to collect the tags of fallen Hunters, and this can lead to unlocking the Colossus if you collect enough –&nbsp;this will transforms you into an even bigger mech for a short amount of time, which can be a powerful bonus.</p>

<p>It will all come to a head with a final extraction phase, as you need to reach the extraction point and hold the position until time runs out or you defeat all the remaining teams. A tiny bit disappointing, only one pair can extract and win, so there’s none of the social mind games of The Division’s Dark Zone, though it will still build up to a natural fever pitch at the end.</p>
<p>In contracts to their empire of historical wargames, Steel Hunters will be quite the change of pace. From tanks with tracks to big stompy mechs, and from pitched battles to a PvPvE game mode that latches onto all the buzzword multiplayer genres currently dominating gaming, will this start a bold new era for the company?</p>
<p>Well, the proof will be in the playing, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/wargaming-reveal-giant-mech-battler-steel-hunters-10-day-playtest-now-on/">a playtest is now on from 12th to 22nd December</a>, ahead of a wider launch next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Every edition of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards</a> needs a headliner announcement, and this year, it was Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Don’t recognize that name? You shouldn’t, it’s a new IP, but you will recognize the developer – <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naughty Dog</a>.</p>
<p>The first teaser trailer for Intergalactic is light on details, but we are introduced to Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who’s tracking a quarry to the dangerous planet of Sempiria. Most of the trailer is focused on showing off Jordan and Naughty Dog’s always-cutting-edge facial animation tech, but we do get a hint of what gameplay might be like at the end of the video as we see our hero taking on a robotic enemy with a laser sword. So, it looks like the focus is on melee combat and the inhospitable planet hints at perhaps survival elements. But enough of my preamble, take a look at Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for yourself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Consider me intrigued! We’ve known for a while that The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann’s next thing would be a new sci-fi IP, and this is obviously it. We don’t know yet if Druckmann is actually writing and/or directing Intergalactic but his name is attached to a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/12/announcing-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog post</a> that reveals a bit more info about the game…</p>
<p><em>“Intergalactic stars our newest protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. In fact, anyone who’s flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps – at least for now. What we can tell you is that this game lives up to the Naughty Dog tradition of creating an emotional, character-driven epic journey. Our narrative goals are rivaled only by our gameplay ambitions. This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.</em></p>
<p><em>Jordan is played by the talented Tati Gabrielle, who leads a stellar cast (pun intended!). Eagle-eyed players might spot some of the other cast members in the trailer. We’ll reveal more of our ensemble down the line. Our incredible voyage into the cosmos also needs an equally incredible soundtrack. As tremendous fans of their work, I’m excited to announce our collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who’ll be scoring Intergalactic! The guys are cooking, and the trailer is just a small tease of their work for the game.”</em></p>
<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet has been announced for PS5. A release window has yet to be revealed.</p>

Capcom are working on a sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/okami">Okami</a>, the wonderful 2006 Zelda-like in which you play a sun goddess in a wolf's body, roaming a world of ink and parchment. It’s being co-developed by M-TWO Inc, Machine Head Works Inc and CLOVERS Inc, and directed by original Okami game director Hideki Kamiya. I am tickled pink, I tell you. Find a trailer below.

There’s not much to share at this stage - the game doesn't even have a formal title - but we do have a little blurb from Capcom. Here it be: “Okami is a game critically acclaimed for its unique world, heartwarming story, and exciting adventures. Now, a new adventure in the same vein as Okami has been set in motion.”</p>
<p>The trailer is a departure from the sumi-e-inspired visuals of the original game – it’s gaudier and, er, hairier. Perhaps a bit too busy for comfort, next to the crowded but crisp scrollwork of the first one. But there are plenty of familiar sights: the goddess Amaterasu herself, galloping through verdant fields, the spinning Reflector dish on her back, and the Celestial Brush dropping cheekily into view at the end.
</p><p>
I was not expecting a new Okami game in this, the year 2024. (I wasn’t expecting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-the-capcom-action-rpgs-first-new-instalment-in-almost-20-years">a new Onimusha</a>, either. Good job, Capcom.) The first one is perhaps less good in hindsight – it’s messy in a way Zelda isn’t, with some stodgy action-RPG elements and some repetitive fights. But my goodness, it has vision and heart and imagination in spades. I still play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLMLXfwUJrk">the intro movie</a> now and then to perk myself up. I never did get round to playing Ōkamiden, the Nintendo DS spin-off. Time to change that, perhaps.
</p>
<p>It's something of a homecoming for Kamiya, who left Capcom to co-found PlatinumGames back in 2006. Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bayonetta-director-hideki-kamiya-is-leaving-platinum-to-work-on-new-projects">he left Platinum to go independent</a>, commenting that he would "continue to create in my Hideki Kamiya way". He's been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/06/17/hideki-kamiya-hints-at-okami-2-and-bayonetta-3-5950079/">hinting about ideas for an Okami sequel</a> for years.</p>

But as we reflect on the last 12 months, we also get several trailers for games that are coming out in the future. If you weren’t able to catch the show and just want the highlights of what world premieres were there, here’s a rundown of every trailer and announcement made during The Game Awards 2024.</p></div></div><div><p>The pre-show began with a new <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>game. The series returns to its side-scrolling roots with <em>Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</em>, coming in summer 2025.</p></div><div><p>Next up is <em>One Move Away, </em>a “cozy” game that has you trying to fit a bunch of items into tight spaces as you move from one home to another over the course of several years. It’s launching in 2025.</p></div><div><p><em>Slay the Spire II</em>’s first gameplay premiered at the pre-show. The deckbuilding roguelike’s early access period is set to begin in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Mint Rocket showed off <em>Dave the Diver in the Jungle</em>, a follow-up to last year’s surprise hit. The teaser trailer was short, but did confirm the game will come out in late 2025.</p></div><div><p><em>Deus Ex </em>lead Warren Spector’s next project, <em>Thick as Thieves</em>, is up next. The first-person, parkour-based heist game is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div><div><p>Bandai Namco revealed a new <em>Pac-Man </em>game that makes the <em>Secret Level </em>episode based on the original arcade superstar make a lot more sense. The side-scrolling action game <em>Shadow Labyrinth </em>includes some <em>Pac-Man </em>iconography, but is a wholly different beast. It’s launching in 2025 on Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div><div><p><em>Steel Paws</em> is a new mobile game from <em>OutRun </em>creator and&nbsp;<em>Shenmue </em>lead Yu Suzuki. We didn’t see any in-game footage, but it did have an animated trailer announcing it will only be available through Netflix’s app.</p></div><div><p>Next we got a new look at the upcoming <em>Lord of the Rings </em>management sim <em>Tales of the Shire</em>. The footage is narrated by streamer CozyK, and showcases some of the cooking and home decoration mechanics. The game will launch on March 25.</p></div><div><p>Following up cozy with chaos is a cinematic trailer for <em>Stalcraft X Operations</em>, which will launch in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Up next is <em>Midnight Murder Club</em>, a game seemingly about making rich people kill each other for sport? It has a crossplay beta going on between PlayStation 5 and PC, and will enter early access in February.</p></div><div><p><em>Kyora </em>is a multiplayer adventure game in which you and your friends go digging through mines and seemingly discover something frightening in the depths below. It’s coming to Steam early access.</p></div><div><p><em>Sifu </em>developer Sloclap premiered its next game <em>Rematch</em>, a soccer game that has a similar visual style to the martial arts game the studio released in 2022. It definitely looks more arcade-y and stylish than your more traditional football games like <em>FIFA</em>.</p></div><div><p>Wrapping up the pre-show is <em>Solasta II</em>. The tactical RPG will enter early access in 2025, and has a demo coming “soon.”</p></div><div><p>The first game of the show proper was <em>The Witcher IV</em>. The game stars Ciri, Geralt’s adopted daughter. CD Projekt Red revealed the game with a cinematic trailer showing Ciri save a woman from some horrible beast, only to send her home to a monster of a different kind. </p></div><div><p>Damn, they’re really frontloading the show this year. Next up is <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. It’s a co-op game set in the <em>Elden Ring </em>universe and is coming in 2025. There are some notable traversal elements like parkour and flight that make it look more fast-paced and fluid than some of the studio’s past work. </p></div><div><p>To bring us all back down to earth, we got an announcement that <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth </em>is coming to PC on January 23, just under a year after the game first launched on PlayStation 5.</p></div><div><p>After a trailer for <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, a game that is already out, we got a cinematic trailer for the cat lovers in the house. <em>Catly</em> is a Steam, Switch, and mobile game that features cats, and that’s about all I can tell you from that trailer. This was immediately followed by a trailer for <em>Path of Exile II</em>. I guess some of the ads are more overt than others.</p></div><div><p>Nevermind, there’s still cool things happening. Next is a new game from genDESIGN, led by Fumito Ueda, the lead behind <em>Ico</em>, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, and <em>The Last Guardian</em>. It seems like he’s going the science fiction route this time. It doesn’t have a title yet. Alright, cool. I will be seated.</p></div><div><p>Obsidian showed up with a very cheeky, action-packed trailer for <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. The sequel will launch in 2025 and will have “everything that should have been in the first game.” Including “more action, more weapons, and more...graphics?”</p></div><div><p>Hazelight’s Josef Fares took the stage and said some things that would definitely have been bleeped out on live television in talking up the studio’s newest game, <em>Split Fiction</em>. Like previous releases from the studio, it’s a cooperative game, but its vibe is much different from <em>It Takes Two</em>, and it takes place in a virtual reality split between both a fantasy and science fiction world. It seems to follow the gameplay structure of <em>It Takes Two</em>, however, with each section centering a different gameplay mechanic. Like previous Hazelight games, you’ll only have to buy the game once to play it with a friend. It launches on March 6.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a2cb4e2b03d6b80469eef7dc8c5e0cb1" data-recommend-id="image://a2cb4e2b03d6b80469eef7dc8c5e0cb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amir Satvat gives his speech while TGAs' hosts watch from the sidelines." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amir Satvat gives his speech while TGAs' hosts watch from the sidelines." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Game Awards / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a2cb4e2b03d6b80469eef7dc8c5e0cb1" data-recommend-id="image://a2cb4e2b03d6b80469eef7dc8c5e0cb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amir Satvat gives his speech while TGAs' hosts watch from the sidelines." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Keighley surprisingly had an entire segment dedicated to addressing the widespread plague of video game industry layoffs in the past year. He also took the time to spotlight Amir Satvat, who gave a tearful speech discussing the state of the industry and his efforts to help people find work after losing their jobs over the past few years.</p></div><div><p>All right, well, that was heartwarming. Time to get back to blowing shit up. Next was <em>Steel Hunters</em>, a mech combat game which showed off some pretty sick gameplay. Its PC beta test is available now.</p></div><div><p>Following all that mayhem was a drastic shift in tone with <em>Blackfrost: The Long Dark II</em>. The melancholy trailer included an announcement that the game will launch in early access next year.</p></div><div><p>One of the announcements we knew about coming in was the first gameplay reveal for <em>Borderlands 4</em>. It started with a cinematic trailer and I thought they might be ditching the cel-shaded style of previous games, but when the actual gameplay started it looked much more like a <em>Borderlands </em>game. It’s gotta be better than the movie, am I right?</p></div><div><p>With apologies to the Tifa stans, <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s Clive Rosfield is coming to <em>Tekken 8</em>. A 72-hour early access period to play the character begins on December 16.</p></div><div><p>Next was a trailer for <em>Splitgate 2</em>, which is coming in 2025.</p></div><div><p>After an ad break and a musical performance, <em>Yakuza </em>developer RGG Studio revealed that a new <em>Virtua Fighter </em>is in the works, and more information will be coming during a stream on December 13 at midnight eastern time. So...in a few hours.</p></div><div><p>Next up is <em>Project Century</em>, a new game from RGG Studio set in 1915 Japan. We don’t know much about it yet, but it seems to bring in some of the beat-em-up antics of the <em>Yakuza </em>series.</p></div><div><p>After Hideo Kojima presented the award for best game direction to <em>Astro Bot</em>, we got a cinematic trailer for the new <em>Turok </em>game called <em>Turok Origins</em>. This was followed by a brief bit of gameplay showing off the shooting mechanics and dinosaur fights.</p></div><div><p><em>Helldivers 2 </em>got a new update called <em>Omens of Tyranny</em>, which shadow-dropped during the show. </p></div><div><p>Next was a trailer for <em>Warframe</em>’s upcoming <em>1999</em> expansion, which launches tomorrow.</p></div><div><p>I’m sorry, I’ll get to what was shown in a second. But does <em>Palworld</em>, a game that’s officially in legal trouble for copying <em>Pokémon</em>, seriously have what looks almost exactly like the Psychos from <em>Borderlands</em> running around the game, too? Anyway, it’s getting a new expansion called <em>Feybreak</em> on December 23.</p></div><div><p>We also got a new trailer for <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, though there was a brief question of whether or not it was for that game or <em>Genshin Impact</em> in the <em>Kotaku </em>Slack.</p></div><div><p>Capcom was up next with a reveal of a new <em>Onimusha </em>game called <em>Way of the Sword</em>. There wasn’t any gameplay, but it had a pretty dope cinematic trailer. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox Series X/S in 2026.</p></div><div><p>The Russo Brothers made an appearance to reveal a bloody cinematic trailer for <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>. The game is set to launch on March 27.</p></div><div><p><em>Arad</em>, an open-world action RPG set in the <em>Dungeon &amp; Fighter </em>universe, was revealed with a cinematic trailer of pretty anime characters going on adventures, fighting monsters, and doing magic...all set to an Atomic Tom song, for some reason.</p></div><div><p>Next up we have a new look at <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, the upcoming entry in the open-world zombie series from Techland. Back is the series’ building-spanning parkour, as well as a whole lot of ways to violently kill zombies. The game is coming out in summer 2025.</p></div><div><p>Netflix showed up briefly to tease <em>Squid Game Unleashed</em>, a new game launching on December 17 based on the streaming service’s smash hit whose second season is coming soon.</p></div><div><p>Ghost Town Games, the developer behind <em>Overcooked</em>, revealed a new game called <em>Stage Fright</em> with a teaser trailer that ended up being a fourth-wall-breaking bit that extended into The Game Awards’ venue. It’s a cooperative game made in collaboration with <em>No Man’s Sky </em>developer Hello Games.</p></div><div><p>The new <em>Game of Thrones </em>RPG <em>Kingsroad</em> made an appearance at The Game Awards, and it includes the likenesses of several characters from HBO’s adaptation. The game is set to launch in 2025.</p></div><div><p>After another ad break (which included a look at&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>coming to PC on April 3), we got a new look at heist game <em>Den of Wolves</em>. The game will enter early access at some point, but the window they gave in the trailer was just “202...”</p></div><div><p>Hoyoverse showed up with a new trailer for <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>’s new character Astra. The team also showed a new trailer for <em>Honkai Star Rail</em>’s <em>The Eternal Land </em>update. </p></div><div><p>Keighley said “we are far from done” before bombarding us with a bunch of ads. But then we got a cool little tease of Shadow the Hedgehog in a car in a new entry of <em>Sonic Racing</em> called <em>CrossWorlds</em>. He seems to be driving into some kind of portal, which makes me wonder if this is going to be some kind of crossover game.</p></div><div><p>Another game we knew we’d see during the show was <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>. We saw a bit of the crime drama’s cinematics, but not much in the way of gameplay. The game will launch in the summer of 2025.</p></div><div><p>Aaron Paul and Laura Bailey took to the stage for an extremely awkward  interaction as they introduced&nbsp;<em>Dispatch</em>, an upcoming superhero management adventure game by ex-Telltale developers. It will launch in 2025.</p></div><div><p>The penultimate big announcement of the night was a surprise. Capcom announced a new sequel to <em>Okami</em>, its beloved 2006 <em>Zelda</em>-like. Hideki Kamiya is returning to direct, but it sounds like the game isn’t even in production yet,&nbsp;so we probably won’t see that for a few years.</p></div><div><p>The final announcement of the show was a new science fiction game from Naughty Dog, the developers of <em>The Last of Us</em>. After over a decade of alternating between <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em>, the studio is finally working on something new called <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>. The game is being directed by Neil Druckmann, stars <em>The Last of Us </em>show actor Tati Gabrielle, and will feature a score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With your teammates in tow, Den of Wolves allows players to mount stealth operations and other "unauthorized errands" on behalf of their clients while navigating the futuristic Midway City. But sometimes, plans are just going to go off the rails and you'll have to shoot your way out of trouble.</p><p>Den of Wolves isn't an open-world game, but the the mythology and history of Midway City will drive the narrative. According to 10 Chambers' Simon Viklund, it's meant to be "a believable city of the near future where late-stage capitalism has gone rampant, and corporations set the rules." Players begin as a blank slate before diving into the criminal underworld and making alliances in addition to taking jobs on the black market.</p><p>The teaser stopped short of announcing when early access will arrive, but Den of Wolves is already available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818140/Den_of_Wolves/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to wishlist on Steam</a>.

            <p>A sequel to Okami is in the works, thanks to a partnership between Capcom and Hideki Kamiya's new studio, Clovers.</p>
<p>The news of a sequel was announced at this evening's Game Awards, with a rather beautiful teaser trailer. "Okami sequel project is underway," reads the short blurb. "Okami is a game critically acclaimed for its unique world, heartwarming story, and exciting adventures. Now, a new adventure in the same vein as Okami has been set in motion."</p>
<p>You can check out the teaser for Okami's sequel below, which is still a while away from release. "It will be some time before we greet you again, but we really hope you look forward to this project," reads <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/o-kami_newproject/en-us/">Capcom's page</a> on the Okami sequel.</p>

<p>Clovers with an s is not to be confused with Clover, the studio which developed Okami and which Kamiya was a part of. This studio was unfortunately shuttered not too long after Okami's debut. Earlier this year, Kamiya said Okami was a "huge failure" in terms of initial sales, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okamis-initial-sales-were-huge-failure-says-director-hideki-kamiya">had it been more successful, Clover "would have probably continued"</a>.</p>
<p>After its initial launch in 2006, Okami was ported to the Wii with motion controls, before a HD version was released. We were full of praise for this version on its release.</p>
<p>"It's a classic game and an essential part of any collection, especially in this flawless, gorgeous reissue. And it casts you as a character like no other in a world like no other," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-hd-review">Eurogamer's Okami HD review</a>.</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

            <p>
A month after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-developing-another-virtua-fighter-game">casually dropping the bombshell</a> another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a>'s in the works, Sega has officially unveiled its long-awaited franchise revival to the world - all during a Game Awards blow-out that also saw it dusting off its Sonic Racing series for another dash around the track, plus a brand-new game from the studio behind Like a Dragon, this time set in 1915.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Virtua Fighter, it's fair to say a new instalment has been a long time coming. 18 years have now passed since the series' most recent numbered instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a> - with Sega having riffed on that particular entry across various remasters and revisions since then. But at long last, an all-new Virtua Fighter game is on the way. Details are limited at presented - other than the fact it's being developed by Like a Dragon's Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio - but more will be revealed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVRktI34LfU">special VF Direct</a> later today.

<p>
And speaking of Like a Dragon, Sega's also teased a new game from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio that bears some striking similarities with the hugely popular crime series. It's a third-person action game with real-time combat set in a open city, this one whisking players back to 1915. Again, there's not much more to report (Sega's just referring to it as Project Century right now), but at least we know there's more Like a Dragon-style action to look forward to once Pirate Yakuza arrives in February next year.

<p>
And as for Sega's final The Game Awards announcement, it's the return of knockabout karting series Sonic Racing, which is poised to receive its first new instalment since 2019's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a>. Unfortunately, there's not much to report about this one either, beyond the fact it's called Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, but Sega is promising "new roads await" and that it's "coming soon". So why not enjoy its 15 second trailer while we wait for more information?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-next-big-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Naughty Dog’s next new game and franchise is Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a game that will see the studio leap into the realms of science fiction with a setting thousands of years in the future.</p>
<p>The name might sound familiar, as a trademark that Sony registered a little while back. This game has been in development since 2020 and is expected to launch for PlayStation 5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7TVPoxwi74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Intergalactic casts players as Jordan A. Mun (played by Tati Gabrielle), a bounty hunter stranded near Sempiria, a planet that was cut off from the rest of the galaxy hundreds of years ago. There’s a pretty simple goal here, it seems, to collect bounties, and to escape orbit and get out into the real galaxy once more.</p>
<p>“Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps,” Neil Druckmann said, revealing the game on the PlayStation Blog. He continued,&nbsp;“This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.”</p>

<p>The focus will be just as much on characters and emotional storytelling as Naughty Dog’s last few games, with a broad ensemble cast that’s yet to be revealed – we’d put money on Troy Baker having some role, though. The soundtrack will come from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, as you can hear in the trailer.</p>
<p>The game leans in on retro-futuristic tech, with a snazzy Porsche space ship, featuring more than a few CRT screens, Sony multi-disc CD player, puffy Cyberpunk-y jackets, and all the rest. Plenty of familiar fodder, but we’re very keen to see how Naughty Dog can weave a rich tapestry around this – after all, The Last of Us is an all-time great game, but it’s built around a very zombie apocalypse adjacent world and setting.</p>

		<p>Almost nineteen years after it’s release we have news that Capcom’s classic game Okami is getting a sequel. It seems very early in production and is just called Okami Sequel but we do know that Hideki Kamiya will be creating it with his studio, Clover Studio.</p>

<p>Hideki Kamiya has worked pm Resident Evil 2 (1998), Devil May Cry (2001), Viewtiful Joe (2003), and Ōkami (2006) for Capcom, and then went on to found Platinum Games and create Bayonetta (2009) and The Wonderful 101 (2013).</p>

		<p>Adhoc Games had a reveal trailer for Dispatch at The Game Awards, a superhero workplace comedy from the writers and directors of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a>.</p>

<p>Starring Aaron Paul as a de-suited Robert Robertson, AKA Mecha Man, he has to adapt to life without powers, but still with a role to play. He joins the superhero dispatch center and ends up in charge of rehabilitating ex-supervillains back onto the straight and narrow. Also amongst the cast are Laura Bailey and Jeffrey Wright.</p>
<p>There will be segments where you manage sending out heroes to answer calls for help, as well as juggling the roster of heroes that you have, managing their particular skills and abilities as they unlock, but there’s also plenty of other points where you delve into office relationships and chat to people.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/okami-is-getting-a-sequel-with-hideki-kamiya-once-again-taking-the-reigns.1060398/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Late last year, Devil May Cry and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya made the surprising announcement that he was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the studio he co-founded, PlatinumGames</a>. At the time, we didn’t know what Kamiya’s next step might be, but now we do. Tonight at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards</a> we got a first peek at a revival of another beloved Kamiya creation – Okami.</p>
<p>At present, the new game doesn’t have an official title, it’s simply being referred to as “Okami Sequel.” The brief teaser trailer shows Amaterasu running across a large open field, perhaps implying the new game’s world will be expanded compared to the original. While the visual style of the game has been updated somewhat, it still definitely has a “painted” look. And yes, at the end we get the words “Game Director Hideki Kamiya” so now we know why he left Platinum. The new game will be produced at Kamiya’s new studio Clovers, a revival of sort of Clover Studio, which created the original Okami. But enough of my preamble, check out the teaser for yourself, below.</p>

<p>Like most folks with good taste, I enjoyed Okami a lot, so I’m definitely excited to see a new one. Here’s hoping Kamiya has another classic in him. Here's a bit more information about the project, directly from Capcom...</p>
<p><em>"The Okami sequel project is underway!! Okami is a game critically acclaimed for its unique world, heartwarming story, and exciting adventures. Now, a new adventure in the same vein as Okami has been set in motion.</em></p>
<p><em>Hideki Kamiya, director of the original Okami, will be the director of this project, which is being co-developed between studios that include various staff members of the original Okami: M-TWO Inc., Machine Head Works Inc., and CLOVERS Inc., which Hideki Kamiya is a member of.</em></p>
<p><em>What will the new adventures of Amaterasu and company be like? It will be some time before we greet you again, but we really hope you look forward to this project."</em></p>
<p>Platforms and a release date for the Okami Sequel have yet to be announced. What do you think? Excited to break out the paintbrush again?</p>

            <p>Naughty Dog have announced their long-gestating new game, and their first in a long while that's not a sequel. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is a science fiction bounty hunter game set on a mysterious isolated planet, and the first cinematic trailer is below.

<p>"Intergalactic stars our newest protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," explains <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement">a Naughty Dog blog post</a>. "In fact, anyone who’s flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit."
</p>
<p>Intergalactic has apparently been in development since 2020 and has a soundtrack by Atticus Ross. Otherwise, Naughty Dog are keeping a lot about the game secret for now, only say that they're aiming to make "an emotional, character-driven epic journey" with the "deepest gameplay" of any of their games so far. Maybe that means it's set in a hole.
</p><p>I like the appearance of recognisable brands in the trailer above - Porsche, Adidas, Sony of course. I imagine that can't continue once you touchdown on a strange, remote planet, but it never fails to tickle me when Person Be In Future, but Future Person Knows Things I Know. I'm a simple animal.
</p>
<p>I like less, of course, that this is currently only coming to PlayStation 5. I think it's a safe bet that we'll get it on PC eventually, but there's no guarantee as to when.

            <p>I'm a big fan of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a>, which pit Sonic and pals against a stable of characters from Sega's other games, including Total War and Football Manager. I'm less of a fan of Sonic's other kart racing exploits, but I'm still cautiously interested to learn he's getting back behind the wheel. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was just announced.

<p>Well, that's brief. And doesn't show Sonic - it's current favourite Shadow that's getting behind the wheel in the short teaser trailer above. Apparently we'll learn more about the game in 2025.
</p>
<p>Perhaps that will include who is making it. There's no developer logo on the trailer above bar Sega themselves. The most recent game in the series, 2019's Team Sonic Racing, and its predecessor Racing Transformed, were both the work of Sumo Digital - although it's been a long time and the more recent wasn't well received, so I doubt it's the same folks doing it this time.
</p>
<p>In any case, the idea suggested by the title "CrossWorlds" gives me hope I'll be able to race against that weird headless Football Manager Man again.</p>

<p>Naughty Dog has announced its next game, Intergalactic The Heretic Prophet, at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>The game description reads, “The Heretic Prophet is the newest franchise in development for the PlayStation 5 console from Naughty Dog, the studio behind acclaimed series like The Last of Us and UNCHARTED. Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.”</p>



<p>Last month, Naughty Dog head honcho Neil Druckmann confirmed that Troy Baker will have a leading role in the upcoming game. Baker, who is best known for playing Joel in Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us has also played the likes of Indiana Jones in Machine Games’ latest hit Indiana Jones and The Great Circle.</p>

<p>Crimson Desert has a new release window. During The Game Awards 2024, developer Pearl Abyss announced that Crimson Desert will launch in late 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>In addition to the announcement, players got a look at a brand-new trailer for the game. You can check that out for yourself below.</p>

<p>“Crimson Desert is an upcoming open-world action-adventure which will make a global release on both console and PC,” the game’s description reads. “An epic of survival with a focus on immersive storytelling and intense action, Crimson Desert follows a group of struggling mercenaries and the many characters who cross their paths in the vast continent of Pywel. This is a world where heroes are made, but not without incredible hardship, pain and perseverance.”</p>



<p>Recently, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-wanted-crimson-desert-as-ps5-exclusive-but-pearl-abyss-declined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed that Sony had wanted</a> Crimson Desert as a PlayStation 5 exclusive. However, Pearl Abyss turned the company down after it was decided internally that self-publishing the game “would be highly profitable”.</p>

It’s a third-person shooter at its core, but it incorporates gameplay elements seen in MOBAs, extraction shooters, and hero shooters with the main hook being the hulking mechs you control called Hunters. You play in competitive objective-based matches in teams of two against multiple other duos (for a total of up to 12 players and six teams per match) and with AI-controlled enemies around the map, making it a PvPvE-style game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Steel Hunters - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was able to check out a hands-off demo of Steel Hunters and saw the game in action prior to getting unveiled at The Game Awards. It’s an intentionally slower-paced game with more of an emphasis on tactics rather than twitch-shooting skills, although it does carry many similarities to shooters that inspired it. Multiple capture points are spread across the three different maps available, and emergent side objectives pop up throughout a match which can lead to loot and items that'll help you in combat. Players can also come away with cosmetic items that persist for their Hunter if it can be extracted at a final standoff in a match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunters are essentially the Hero characters with unique playstyles through their own main weapon, set of skills on cooldown, and style of mobility. For example, Fenris is a speedy wolf-like mech that’s nimble while Heartbreaker is a long-range sniper. You also have a combat medic in Trenchwalker and a spider-like tank in Weaver, and ability-focused strategist with Prophet and your prototypical run-and-gun Hunter with Razorside. (You can see all the Hunters available in the beta in the screenshots in this article.) All the Hunters are said to have a level of tactical synergy regardless of which ones are paired together on a team, and players need to use their strengths in tandem to get the most out of their Hunters in matches.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s an intentionally slower-paced game with more of an emphasis on tactics rather than twitch-shooting skills.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the monetization model, Wargaming isn’t straying too far from what’s seen in its other games. Hunters will be highly customizable from a cosmetic standpoint, but each will also have their own progression tracks to unlock different abilities and modifications to customize to a loadout. Wargaming stated that nothing that can be purchased with real money will give players a competitive advantage. However, there will be ways to pay to accelerate progression (essentially time-savers). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You will start with three Hunters available and must either play to make progress towards unlocking new Hunters or pay to unlock them. There will also be a battle pass and seasonal content similar to other live service games; however, the exact details of how these systems work are still to be determined.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A closed beta for Steel Hunters is active now and runs until December 22, which you can sign up for on the <a href="https://steelhunters.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Steel Hunters website</a>. An open beta is planned for 2025, but there is no set date or release window yet. The beta periods and initial release will first come to PC, but Wargaming is planning on having a console version at some point afterward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Higham is IGN's Tech Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At Thursday's Game Awards, Saber Interactive officially announced Turok: Origins — a "new evolution" of the classic dinosaur-hunting franchise that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/03/12/turok-dinosaur-hunter">first debuted on the Nintendo 64 and PC in 1997</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a marked shift for the franchise, Turok: Origins will feature third-person action instead of being a first-person shooter.

One of the biggest announcements at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">The Game Awards 2024</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign is sure to shock fans of FromSoftware’s Souls games. This three-player PvE game is unlike anything the legendary developer has made before, and it’s fair to say it’ll raise more than a few eyebrows across the internet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of the game’s reveal, IGN’s Tristan Ogilvie got the chance to play Elden Ring Nightreign (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it">check out our impressions here</a>) and interview game director Junya Ishizaki to find out where this surprise departure from the hugely successful Souls formula came from, how it all fits in with Elden Ring itself, and whether it should be considered a live service game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Read on for Ishizaki’s answers to these questions and a load more. And if you haven’t already, be sure to check out IGN’s Elden Ring Nightreign hands-on preview for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> This game is a huge surprise to me. I can imagine it's going to be a huge surprise to the fans next week. So I'd really like to hear about the initial kind of concept, and how you kind of came up with the idea, for the game, in the beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki:</strong> As a developer, I had many ideas for what could potentially be new games during the development of the past titles I've worked on, including Elden ring. This time I stepped up as a new director, I was given the opportunity to direct this idea for Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've always been seen as a company that makes these Soulslikes or this kind of traditional formula of Soulslike games and so I saw this as an opportunity to do something different. To challenge both myself and the company to build something new while still using what we've cultivated with our previous titles. Also personally, I enjoy these co-op multiplayer experiences and I wanted to make something that was very much focused on that with Nightreign. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> On that note, are there any specific games that you have sort of inspired you in the creation of this game in terms of other co-op multiplayer games?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>I enjoy a whole manner of games, from shooters to board games and MMOs. So basically we’re taking inspiration from a whole range of genres and titles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> It also felt like sort of because of the intense pacing of this game compared to Elden Ring, or at least the way that I played Elden Ring which was quite cautiously, it almost feels like you're speed running, especially with wall jumping and stuff like that. I'm just wondering if the speedrunning community has also been an influence on the creation of this game as well?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>It would be a lie to say there's nothing like that that's inspired Nightreign or that there is some inspiration there. I enjoy these elements of not just Souls games but other games where you have these challenging elements, or speedrun tactics. It's not just applied to speedrunning, it's like optimising the gameplay from the player's perspective, how to best optimise the experience and get the most out of it and clear it in the best way possible or the quickest way possible. I enjoy those elements and I feel like this is a good opportunity to share my love for that with players. I’m glad if this sort of idea is coming through in Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Definitely. Has Miyazaki-san had any input in the game or is he strictly hands-off on this project?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>So initially I took the idea to Miyazaki-san, who gave it the green light. He was a little involved in that initial concept phase of the game but after that he gave full reign to me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Full Nightreign?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Indeed, thank you. [laughs]</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Does the the lore of Nightreign tie into the stories of Elden Ring or Shadow of the Erdtree, or even a possible Elden Ring 2? Or is it completely standalone?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>We'd like fans to think of Nightreign as an Elden Ring spin-off, first and foremost. The story is completely separate and parallel to the world of Elden Ring’s. If you had to tie it in some way, we had the events of the shattering in the original game. After the events of the shattering, this is a completely separate branch of the Elden Ring story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We understand that there's a great deal of emotional attachment to the story of Elden Ring that a lot of the fans have, so we didn't want to encroach on that too much. We wanted it to coexist with the existing story. And for players both familiar and new to enjoy both of these stories separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> So does this mean that George R. R. Martin has no influence on Nightreign’s story or world? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>That’s correct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> It seems that, given recent news, it's possible that Nightreign could potentially be From Software's last multi-platform game. Do you have any thoughts on the potential Sony acquisition of From Software?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>To be perfectly honest, we just don't know right now at the moment where the discussion currently is at. If it's taking place, we're not privy to it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> What about the possibility of Nightreign coming to Switch 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>I'm afraid we know nothing about the Switch 2 at this point either. So it's difficult to say right now. Sorry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Sure. [Laughs] Back to the game, one thing that wasn’t clear to me yesterday. Do you have to play it online in a group of three, or can you also play it solo or in a duo?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>The game is designed to be played as a three-person team, but you can play it as a solo player. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Oh, great. Or in a pair?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>No, it's either one-player or three-player. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> And in one-player does the enemy health pool scale?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>That’s correct. The reason that we went with a three-player focus was that we wanted to retain that sense of accomplishment you get from battling a boss together or from conquering a map together and that sense of enjoyment, but we wanted to recreate that in a fresh way. And we felt like focusing on a three-player co-op experience would provide a brand new sense of accomplishment with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Why was three the magic number?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>This was largely a game balancing decision, rather than a game design decision. So it came as development progressed. You know, we found that while we wanted each player to have that sense of accomplishment, that sense of rewarding co-op gameplay, this was like a sweet spot with three players in order for it not to feel too overwhelming or too busy. It allowed each player to go off on their own potentially and cover a bit of the map but also to you know that final experience coming together, that was three players felt like the sweet spot eventually. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> This is your first time as a game director. What have been your previous roles at From Software?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>I’ve been involved with development on From games since the original Dark Souls where I was a level designer. And on Bloodborne, I was level designer cum battle designer, and on Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring I was combat designer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> One thing I used a lot in Elden Ring are Spirit Ashes. Those are less important in Nightreign given you have human-controlled characters to support you, but are there still Spirit Ashes to be found in the game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>They do exist in some capacity but it's a little different to how they played in Elden Ring. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> How so?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>So there are going to be eight playable characters in the final game and one of those characters uses a Spirit Ash sort of spiritual buddy as a gameplay mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> One of the sort of big selling points of this game mentioned in the presentation yesterday is that it’s more approachable to newcomers. But it’s still quite challenging, so are there any further assists you can toggle on, such as starting a session at a higher level or something?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>We don't have any such assist features or settings included. We put a lot of faith in our players regardless of their skill level. We believe that anybody can beat these games, if they just go in with an open mind, and a will to try.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also incorporated the Relic system where you get these rewards from each run as you experienced yesterday, and even from a mildly or less successful run, you can get these relics and gradually upgrade your roster and build up these characters for your next session. So we hope this gives players an incentive to keep on trying. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I’m curious about the three-day structure and how it came about?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Initially when we set out to make Nightreign, we wanted what we're calling a condensed RPG experience. We wanted to take all those elements from Elden Ring that players enjoyed like the exploration, the building of the character, fighting tough bosses, the sense of discovery, and condense that into a shorter, tighter play session.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also we wanted to include this idea of having peaks and valleys to the gameplay. So there's got to be a flow in there, bring the players up for the highs, and then it gets a little easier and they get to enjoy this gradual flow to the gameplay. And again this was a balance decision that came through development, but eventually that settled on a three-day structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> My squad eventually beat the final boss on the third day after numerous attempts, and then immediately afterwards we played through it again and beat it a second time and it was a lot easier. How will the finished game be structured, is there an incentive to play through it again, or will you unlock more bosses or harder versions of previous bosses?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>So there's going to be eight boss types of final bosses in the final game. And as you progress through, these will be gradually unlocked and become available to fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Right, but if you were to just redo the same one, it's not a harder version of that boss to fight or anything like that? It's always the same boss, each time you get back to it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Something like these new game plus elements or subsequent play elements. We're currently still considering how to field that I guess. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Do you think it’s risky at all, at this point, to launch a new multiplayer game, given other recent failures like Concord or Suicide Squad? The landscape is quite challenging in the multiplayer space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>We don't tend to look at the industry and base our game design or our concerns on what's going on in that sort of, more general sense. We feel like if we're making something we're passionate about and that we want to make and that we enjoy playing, we trust the users will share in that experience and hopefully enjoy it as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, we want to be clear that Nightreign is not like a live service game. Once you you buy Nightreign you get the complete package, everything is unlockable out of the gate. So we want it to be clear that this is what we wanted to make. It's not intended as a live service game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Great, thank goodness. So, just going back to the presentation yesterday. I believe you said that it's just the one randomised map based off Limgrave. Is that the case for all eight bosses, there’s no map that’s a variation on Caelid or anything like that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>So there will not be a whole new map type depending on the boss you select, but there will be some quite drastic changes to the map that occur as you progress through the game. The reason for this, we wanted to keep this experience quite condensed and concentrated on this “another” Limgrave, so that players could learn and adjust and create that most optimised play to enjoy that sort of new sense of accomplishment and discovery with Nightreign. Learning within those confinements is what we aimed for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> So that's where the volcanoes and meteor strikes and things will come in as the map evolves?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Yes, that's correct. Those elements are supposed to encourage those repeat plays and change up the session each time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> And so is there an ultimate boss to fight who is behind the night tide?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Yes, there is a final boss, at the end of it and they do have a some sort of connection to the night tide and the encroaching night. So we hope players look forward to discovering that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Are there any other sort of modes planned, like a PvP battle royale or anything like that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Currently there are no plans. We wanted to first and foremost concentrate on this  three-player co-op experience. So that's the main focus for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I'm curious about Murk. I know you can spend it in between sessions at the Roundtable Hold, but that wasn’t a part of the build we played so I’m wondering what you can buy with Murk?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>So with Murk you'll be able to purchase new Relics. You'll also be able to perform Relic Rites, which allow you to switch around the colour coding for each character. So, potentially give different characters new Relics. You’ll be able to purchase gestures and you'll be able to purchase new character skins as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Speaking of the character classes, I found the four different ones that we played with yesterday were really quite unique compared to the base classes from Elden Ring. Was that the case from the beginning or did the game begin with, you know, Warrior and Samurai, stuff like that and then that kind of evolved from there?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>So the reason, first of all, just some context for having these set characters was we wanted to create this multiplayer experience that you could just jump into very quickly and casually without worrying too much about character creation or character build off the bat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, with that, as the kind of initial staple for the design, we set about designing these different characters and their specialities. And quite quickly we landed on their unique skills and ultimate arts, and we figured that we wanted a more of an action gameplay focus rather than landing them in a sort of preset type of character like there's the mage or there's the warrior or there's the tank. We wanted them to each feel quite unique in their gameplay and in their skills and abilities from the get-go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Will each character have their own storyline? Or is it just one storyline that every character goes on?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Yes. Each character has their own backstory, that players can uncover and interesting quirks to their gameplay that evolve as well. So we hope players look forward to that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> In terms of the backstory, is that just experienced through the codex at the Roundtable Hold?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>There will be other elements as well for players who enjoy that sort of side of this game to uncover the character's backstories and things. It won't just be limited to the codex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> There was a character in the presentation that I don't think was one of the ones that we played that was said to be able to raise slabs of rock out of the earth and then use them as a springing off point to do attacks or something like that. Is that one of the unannounced characters?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Yes, of course, that character will be available in the full release. He will be playable in the final version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I’m curious about the random nature of the map. It seemed like the initial landing area was always kind of more or less the same with the same ruins to quickly get some XP, but then it seemed a bit more random beyond that. Is that by design to make sure that players get off on the right foot?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>So the random elements in each session basically come down to anything you find dotted around the map. So the weapons, the enemies that appear, the bosses that appear, the random events that take place, and the points of interest, the key locations that pop up around the map. So these are generally randomised throughout each session. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> When you say key locations, you mean like castles and camps and things like that? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Yes, these things will be changed up from session to session, but they all stay the same from one day to the next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I found that I only used the Spectral Hawk maybe once or twice. I'm just curious at any point during development was there the thought of letting players use it manually at any time like the glider in Breath of the Wild? Or was it always going to be a fixed point, designed to be shortcuts to very specific directions or locations?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>We did try a more freeform approach to using the Spectral Hawk to get around initially. But we found eventually that felt surprisingly like a chore, and it also kind of inhibited the freedom of approach that the rest of the game provides. So when the players could be kind of challenging themselves to go off in this direction or choose this route because they've chosen this boss fight and that's sort of what they've got available to them at this moment, they would instead be able to ignore a lot of the map, they'd end up taking very similar routes or they'd end up just flying around for the sake of it. And they would sort of just impede on that intended game design. So we decided to keep it a little bit more streamlined, a little bit more confined to what you experienced yesterday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> That makes a lot of sense. One that I did use, I used to reach a giant that was on a rooftop of a castle. It seemed very deliberately placed in that regard, or was that just a coincidence?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Yeah, it is something similar to what you describe. When we designed it, we had in mind, something like a choice between directions. When you make the decision to make a big movement in one direction of the map, it's like, well, okay I'll choose this Spectral Hawk, or this Spectral Hawk. This was intended to roughly guide the player in these directions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> The Fell Omen kept spawning in as a random event in a few of the sessions that we played yesterday, and we eventually just started luring it towards a site of grace so we could just keep re-upping our health and flasks while we fought it. Do you consider that cheating or is it a legitimate strategy?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>It's kind of cheating but seeing as though it was of your own volition and agency, I think we'll give you that one. You’re allowed that [laughs].</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Thank you. I really love Duchess’ skill, the Restage, where she repeats the most recent attack landed on a targeted enemy. It did seem a little overpowered the way we were using it, like having the Guardian do a big swooping ultimate attack and then immediately Restage it for huge damage. Is that something that’s still being balanced?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Yes, of course. It’s still in the tuning stages. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Is the Restage skill a guaranteed hit every time, or can some enemies dodge it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Yes, it will definitely hit in this current iteration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> The red corpses that are great sources of loot, who do they represent?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>So this is Nightreign's unique, asynchronous online element. This is actually gear left from a previous player who died in that spot. So it's their way to leave their mark on the world and influence the session of another player even if they happen to fail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> So similar to Elden Ring, will we see players actually running around while they’re still alive, or do they only appear as dead bodies?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>You'll see the phantoms running around occasionally but you won't see messages left by other players like in Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Presumably that’s because messages take too long to put down, and you want to keep things as streamlined as possible?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Yeah, there’s not a lot of time to stop and write a message, I think, as you experienced yesterday. That’s basically the intent there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Do enemies respawn after the first day of a cycle?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>No, there's no respawning between days and no respawning when you visit a side of grace either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Is there going to be cross platform support?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Similar to the original Elden Ring, there will be cross-generational play but not cross-platform play. So PS4 players can play with PS5 players, and Xbox One players can play with Xbox Series S and X players, but not between platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> The heavenly area where the third day boss fight took place was that unique to that Gladius boss or is it always the same on the third day for each boss?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>This area is common, it's like a common battleground or pre-battleground area to the final boss of the third day for each boss. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> That boss seemed to be called Tricephelus in the menu but then Gladius when we fought it. Why is that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>So, the name of the boss that you select in the menu is actually a different separate name from the one that you see when you actually fight it. That’s intentional. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> It seemed like every time the Fell Omen would spawn in as a random fight, we'd always get the Draconian Tree Sentinel at the end of day two, and it was only when it didn't that we got Margit the Fell Omen as the day two boss. Is that an intentional thing? Can you only fight each boss type a maximum of once per three days?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>For this particular build and session, this was intentional for these bosses to come together, or for that likelihood to happen. But in the full game there'll be a lot more variation in number and types of bosses to appear together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> It seemed like the boss at the end of day one was always either the Centipede monster or the Demon pairing, but that won’t be the case in the final game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>Yes. In the final release it will be a lot more random, with a greater pool of potential bosses to pull from. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> If it’s less predictable it sounds like it will be a lot harder. Do you intend Nightreign to just be a one-off, or are you hoping that this style of game, not necessarily under the Elden Ring banner, but that this style of game will become a staple for FromSoft in the future?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>We don't really have a plan in terms of, oh we're going to make more spin-offs or this is going to be a one-off time one-time thing. This was purely sort of happenstance of me wanting to direct my own game and wanting to use Elden Ring and that battle design that I took part in as a base to this game, and my interest in online co-op games as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So this just all came together nicely to build on what we'd cultivated with Elden Ring. So that's why this is a spin-off. I can't really say for sure where we'll go in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Any final thoughts?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>So I created Nightreign to be a new thrilling type of gameplay with that familiar sense of accomplishment and overcoming tough odds that players are familiar with. So I hope these two things come together and provide a fresh and fun experience. So please look forward to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Absolutely, I’ve definitely had a great time with it so far. Thank you very much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki: </strong>That's great to hear. Thank you so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

While it has a few quirks, namely where its display lenses are concerned, they’re just a handful of holdovers from the previous generation. The rest of the device is built like a proper Meta Quest 3, and for the price of $299.99, there’s no reason to turn it down if you’re looking to jump into VR or upgrade from an older device. As far as performance goes, it can even outshine the Quest 3 in terms of maintaining high framerates while playing demanding games and apps – all while keeping the battery charged longer – and that’s a huge compliment for a VR headset we’re now calling 'entry-level'."</p></div><p id="final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-for-3499"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for $34.99">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for $34.99</h2></p><div catalogid="5a3123d7-e406-4ef6-85f6-874d529bae7e" id="213406"><div id="213406" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review</a>, RPG expert Michael Higham wrote, "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion as both a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth, and as an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long. After 82 hours to finish the main story and complete a decent chunk of sidequests and optional activities, there's still much to be done, making this pivotal section of the original feel absolutely massive. Minigames, sidequests, and other enticing diversions fill the spaces of its vast and sprawling regions, painting a new and more vivid picture of these familiar locations. But more than just being filled with things to do, Rebirth is often a powerful representation of Final Fantasy VII's most memorable qualities. It does fumble the execution of its ending, getting caught up in the mess of its multiple twisting timelines, but new moments and the overarching journey manage to evoke a deeper sense of reflection in spite of that. So, for as flawed as parts of how this classic has been reimagined might be, Rebirth still stands out as something both thrilling and unexpectedly impactful."</p></div><p id="star-wars-outlaws-xsx-for-3799"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Star Wars Outlaws (XSX) for $37.99">Star Wars Outlaws (XSX) for $37.99</h2></p><div catalogid="5a3123d7-e406-4ef6-85f6-874d529bae7e" id="213407"><div id="213407" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws (XSX)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In our Star Wars Outlaws review, Tristan Ogilvie wrote, "It’s ironic that Kay’s ship is called the Trailblazer, since there’s actually not a whole lot of ideas in Star Wars Outlaws that haven’t been done before in other action and open-world adventures. Instead, it’s quite like the Millenium Falcon: a bucket of bolts held together with repurposed parts and prone to breaking down, but at its best it’s more than capable of jolting your pleasure centres into Star Wars fan hyperspace. A clever syndicate system brings real weight to almost every task you choose to undertake, some of which have creative quest designs that can often conjure up some genuinely stunning blindsides. Having a pal like Nix at your side the entire time not only adds an extra dimension to Kay’s fairly generic smuggler character, but also gives her an enhanced set of useful abilities. But even he can’t quite make its stealth and combat feel any less rigid and repetitive, and the odds of avoiding the many glaring technical issues present at launch are 3,720 to one. But you probably didn’t want me to tell you the odds."</p></div><p id="silent-hill-2-for-4748"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Silent Hill 2 for $47.48">Silent Hill 2 for $47.48</h2></p><div catalogid="5a3123d7-e406-4ef6-85f6-874d529bae7e" id="213408"><div id="213408" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Silent Hill 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, in our Silent Hill 2 review, horror fan Mr. Ogilvie wrote, "Silent Hill 2 is a welcome modernisation of a survival horror masterpiece. It smoothly polishes down the rough edges of the original game’s combat while taking a piece of heavy grit sandpaper to scuff up every rust and mold-covered surface of its nightmarish environments, successfully making them appear far more abrasive and menacing to explore. Previously primitive boss battles have been transformed into substantially more intense encounters, and its intimidating audio design kept me acutely aware that every fog-cloaked street I walked down could quickly hurry me towards my own dead end. It does feel a little padded out in parts, and I do wish that Bloober Team had streamlined some of its more convoluted puzzle sections to prevent the story’s momentum from sagging on occasion. Still, intermittent pacing problems aside, Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror."</p></div><p id="samsung-oled-4k-s90d-tv-for-949"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung OLED 4K S90D TV for $949">Samsung 48" OLED 4K S90D HDR Smart TV</h2></p><div catalogid="5a3123d7-e406-4ef6-85f6-874d529bae7e" id="213409"><div id="213409" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG 48-Inch Class OLED 4K S90D Series HDR Smart TV</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you need a TV, this one's on sale for 41% off.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">From the discovery of sprawling, subterranean otherworlds to the startling second phases that completely turned the tables in so many of its boss fights, 2022’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> was a mesmerising action RPG adventure that surprised players at almost every turn. Now, more than two years later it appears that developer FromSoftware isn’t done with pulling the rug out from under the feet of its fanbase just yet, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-a-standalone-co-op-spin-off-the-game-awards-2024">surprise reveal</a> of Elden Ring Nightreign, a standalone co-op spin-off that takes the cautious dungeon crawls of Elden Ring and turbocharges them into propulsive, slash ‘n’ dash speedruns. After spending some six hours of hands-on time with this bold new spin on FromSoftware’s own Soulslike formula, I can confirm that Nightreign is shaping up to be something truly unique. If Elden Ring was one of 2022’s biggest chart-topping hits, then Nightreign would appear to be its dance floor-filling remix – chopped up, intensified in beats per minute, and designed to both excite fans of the original and broaden its appeal to the masses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Initially when we set out to make Nightreign, we wanted to create what we're calling a condensed RPG experience,” says Nightreign’s game director Junya Ishizaki. “We wanted to take all those elements from Elden Ring that players enjoyed like the exploration, the building of the character, fighting tough bosses, the sense of discovery, and condense that into a shorter, tighter play session.” (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service">Read more in our FromSoftware interview</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how Nightreign breaks down: Imagine stepping back into the opening area from the original game, only nothing in the landscape seems to be where you remember it. Also, there are three of you now, and everything seems to be happening at a much faster pace. That’s Nightreign in a nutshell. You squad up with two other players at the start of each round, get dropped into a densely-packed alternate reality chunk of Limgrave that has both its enemy types and the placements of its castles and forts randomly shuffled around at the beginning of each session, and its up to you and your squadmates to build up from your lowly level-one character status as fast as possible by harvesting runes and weapons as you slash and dash through every enemy-filled camp and castle that you come across.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Brand-new boss types like the Centipede Demon, a towering, twisting swarm of disgusting limbs prone to detaching body parts in an attempt to divide itself and conquer my crew.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s the big rush? Well, each session of Nightreign is structured as a three-day cycle, with each in-game day taking about 15 minutes to complete. At the start of the first day you can pretty much pick any direction to point your team in – dropping pins on the map to highlight points of interest to the rest of your squad – but as day approaches night the space you can operate in narrows, and you’re liable to be killed by acid-like rain should you find yourself caught for too long beyond the perimeter of the rapidly shrinking circle on the map known as the ‘ring of reign’. (In that regard Nightreign is a bit like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, only with more medieval forts and knights, and considerably less TikTok dances.) </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the ring of reign reaches its smallest diameter at the end of the day a boss fight is triggered, one which you and your team will be much better equipped to tackle if you’ve made the most efficient use of Nightreign’s daylight hours boosting your individual character stats and arsenal. Like the rest of Nightreign’s enemies, these end of day bosses are always randomised, and during my repeat runs I experienced clashes with familiar returning nasties like a Demi-Human Queen and Demi-Human Swordmaster tag-team, and a hard-as-nails stoush with a Draconian Tree Sentinel flanked by a pair of Carian Knights. That's along with some brand-new boss types like the Centipede Demon, a towering, twisting swarm of disgusting limbs prone to detaching body parts in an attempt to divide itself and conquer my crew.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the day one boss dealt with, day two begins and the ring of reign rescinds, allowing your squad to take a breath, regroup, and then resume ransacking the map for upgrades in preparation for the more challenging boss encounters to come at the end of days two and three. It’s a structure that allows for a gradual build of tension before a palpable sense of accomplishment and release with each boss felled. Over time my squadmates and I became a well-oiled machine as far as getting the balance right between beelining for churches to snatch up valuable HP flasks, and taking down the more major overworld enemies like dragons and hippos in order to get maximum rune boosts for buck before the map was cast into darkness once again. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Squad Goals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We were also able to eventually settle upon the best combination of heroes for our group. You see, Nightreign doesn’t feature the lengthy list of generic character classes that the original Elden Ring did, and players won’t have to Google the difference between vague-sounding archetypes like the Prisoner and Wretch when they first hop in to play, for example. Instead, Nightreign offers eight different heroes to choose from, each with very clearly identified strengths and weaknesses in order to make it as easy to pick up and play as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Four were playable in the preview build. Wylder is an all-rounder hero type with a good balance between speed and attack power, Guardian is a burly tank type with heavy attacks and increased damage resistance, Duchess is a nimble type with fast attacks and a killer quickstep ability, and Recluse is a mage type with ranged magical attacks. Ishizaki did hint at two more characters that will be playable in the final game, including one who will have the ability to raise a pillar of rock out of the earth to climb up and snipe arrows from, and another who will have command of their own Spirit Ash, which I very much like the sound of since I relied on those summonable spectral bodyguards in order to beat almost every boss fight in the original game. (Yes, I’m a coward.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, each character features a unique skill and ultimate attack that both operate on cooldown timers. Wylder is able to use his hook shot skill to either reel in smaller enemies, a la Scorpion in Mortal Kombat, or to quickly zip past the swinging arms of a major boss in order to sneak a few strikes in from behind. Guardian is able to conjure up a mini tornado to knock swarms of enemies off their feet, while Recluse can put a marker on an enemy so that every time that enemy is attacked, the damage is siphoned into boosts for her own HP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These unique abilities are all extremely useful in their own right, but finding ways to combine them with the special moves of your squadmates is key to surviving Nightreign’s toughest enemy encounters. One strategy that my squad grew to rely on quite heavily was to unleash a damaging ultimate attack on an enemy, such as Guardian’s swooping divebomb, then immediately follow it up with Duchess’ Restage skill, which basically creates an instant replay of the last attack landed and allows you to double the total amount of damage inflicted. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gladius is just the first of eight major bosses to take down in Nightreign, each with their own three-day cycle leading up to them. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s in finding killer combinations of moves such as these that the co-op focus of Nightreign really shines, and it eventually allowed my squad to progress – after multiple failed attempts – through to the third day of the cycle, which climaxed in a fight against a snarling, cerberus-like beast called Gladius. This triple-headed hell hound is capable of powerful, wide area attacks with a chain-like whip, and it can also split into three individual wolves that forced my team to coordinate and queue up skills and ultimate attacks with painstaking precision in order to overcome it.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gladius is just the first of eight major bosses to take down in Nightreign, each with their own three-day cycle leading up to them. In addition to the randomisation of enemy types and structures, further wrinkles will be introduced into each boss cycle such as live volcanoes and forests full of rot in an effort to prevent the landscape from ever growing too predictable. That’s along with random events like meteor strikes, swarms of giant ants to fend off, and the surprise invasion of powerful tormentors in an attempt to impede your progress. During my hands-on my team was regularly stalked by Margit, the Fell Omen, who you likely remember as the butt-kicking bouncer found outside Elden Ring’s Stormveil Castle, and having him pursue me across the map like some sort of Tarnished terminator was a consistently terrifying experience – especially on the occasions I found myself isolated from the other two members of my power trio. (It's worth noting, you can absolutely take on invading bosses like Margit, and beating them rewards you with a 'Favor of the Night', which is a random buff like boosting your maximum HP or increasing the recharge speed of your ultimate attack.)</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Reigning It In    </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the approachability of its roster of playable characters, Nightreign has polished up a lot of Elden Ring’s more abrasive edges to make it a far more friction-free experience. A new wall-jump move allows you to quickly hop up and over steep sections of the terrain, while the removal of any fall damage means you can lunge off cliffs or down dark holes without stopping to study your surroundings for safe platforms. You only need to walk near a site of grace to top up your health and flasks, and if you want to spend some runes to level up you just button mash through pages of auto-levelling that best suits the base traits of your chosen character, rather than having to agonize over whether you should allocate a point to faith or dexterity, for example. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all gives each session the feeling of being shuttled along in an intense speedrun. There are also distinctive-looking trees to find scattered around the map which, when interacted with, launch your character into the air and allow them to glide over long distances while dangling from the claws of a spectral hawk. I found these particularly useful for getting fast access to lucrative rune-farming spots, like the time I skipped a castle crawling with basic soldier types and flew straight to its roof – where a giant troll awaited.      </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the complete absence of any equip load weight management. New weapons are found either in treasure chests or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a>-style loot drops after a fight, and you can equip up to three armaments per hand without worrying about how they’ll affect your movement speed. You also don’t really need to worry about ever being underlevelled for any particular weapon, either – if you find it, you can generally pick it up and use it – and the passive effects of any given weapon such as lightning attacks or boosted stamina regeneration will apply to your character while they’re in your arsenal whether you’re wielding them or not. Meanwhile, you don’t need to collect and equip new armour at all, instead you can find and collect various buffs to damage resistance and the like by hunting through sorcerer’s towers or mining caves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Death is not necessarily the end in Nightreign, either. If you find yourself downed you have a ‘near-death’ meter that appears above you, and your squadmates must attack you while you crawl along the ground until the meter is reduced and you can return to the fray. It may sound slightly odd to basically kick a friend while they’re down, but it’s a system that works quite well – particularly since you can use ranged attacks like magic or crossbows to revive a downed squadmate from a distance without the risk of putting yourself in harm’s way. In fact, I found that it can also be a solid strategy to keep your ultimate attack up your sleeve as a potential revival tool – during one boss fight I found both my partners wiped out at the same time, and I was able to revive them both in one literal fell swoop by blasting them with Guardian’s divebomb. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign is thankfully a little more lenient on you during the day. If you die before you can be revived by a squadmate, you're able to respawn with full health – you're just penalised one level of your character's progression, which can admittedly be fairly costly given that the highest level I ever reached during the three-day cycle was level 14. However, although you can revive downed players during an end-of-day boss fight there are no actual respawns during these climactic moments, and should all three of you be wiped out at once it's the end of the session and you must restart day one with everyone back at level one. So you need to stay on your toes in order to keep the rest of your squad on their feet whenever possible.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You need to stay on your toes in order to keep the rest of your squad on their feet whenever possible.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In between sessions you return to the Roundtable Hold hub, where you can practise your attack combos in the training yard, study up on enemy strategies and character lore in the codex, or spend the currency you earn from each run – known as ‘Murk’ – to buy character emotes and customisable skins from the merchant. It’s in the Roundtable Hold that you can also configure each character’s relics. These are permanent attribute buffs that are unlocked after each session, and you can slot three of them into each character to further tailor them to your playstyle – one relic might boost a character’s maximum HP and allow them to deal extra damage with throwing knives, for example, while another might substantially boost attacks from heavy thrusting swords, which is handy if you favour the Godskin Stitcher or the Bloody Helice. Longterm FromSoftware fans will recognise these relics as being reminiscent of Bloodborne’s blood gems.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s no doubt that elements of it are inspired by the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a>, it needs to be said that Elden Ring Nightreign is not a live service game. Once you buy it you get access to the complete package, and there are no battle passes or microtransactions to contend with. It can also be played in singleplayer should you wish to stay offline, with enemy health pools that scale down so that it’s not too overwhelming for solo players (although curiously, there are currently no plans to allow players to play in pairs). All this is to say is that fans shouldn’t be concerned that Nightreign is at any risk of being dead on arrival like recent notable disasters such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-day-before">The Day Before</a>, and certainly the team at FromSoftware seems very confident in its multiplayer offering regardless of the fates that have befallen other online-only launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We don't tend to look at the industry and base our game design or our concerns on what's going on in a more general sense,” says Ishizaki. “We feel like if we're making something we're passionate about and that we want to make and that we enjoy playing, we trust the users will share in that experience and hopefully enjoy it too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who has sunk hundreds of hours into Elden Ring, both in the original 2022 game and this year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>, I can confidently say that FromSoftware is onto something truly spectacular with Nightreign. Cutting throats at breakneck speed with a pair of friends in tow has been a consistently exhilarating experience so far, and especially gratifying when you work together to topple its fiercest bosses using each character’s special abilities in tandem. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> diehards may well be quick to dismiss it as some sort of Elden Ring: Arcade Edition due to its heavily streamlined settings, but the potential scope of its relic system still leaves plenty to tinker with for fans who want a bit more stop and think along with their hack and slash. Assuming the developers can throw enough randomised elements to keep each three-day assault feeling fresh, then Elden Ring Nightreign could well provide an exciting change of pace for existing fans, and an enticingly accessible entry point for newcomers when it launches sometime in 2025.   </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Discovering their stories are about to be stolen by a sinister tech company, they need to figure out how to escape "through the very worlds that they created."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With each level jumping between a sci-fi world and a fantasy world, Split Fiction also promises unique mechanics for every level, including dragons that emerge as hatchlings before growing into "full-ass dragons" that can "fly around and kick ass."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fares confirmed that, as with previous Hazelight games, you will only need to buy one copy of the game to enjoy it co-op with a friend. The Friend's Pass feature is actually being pushed further, as Split Fiction will see crossplay options enabled for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC via Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's what Hazelight is about," explained Fares. "No loot boxes, no microtransactions, and no bulls--t. You just get the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction is being published by EA under its EA Originals label, just like It Takes Two and A Way Out before it. It's coming to PC and consoles on March 6, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Split Fiction - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty of pressure on Split Fiction after how well It Takes Two was received. It Takes Two netted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-review">a 9/10 review score here at IGN</a>, with our reviewer calling it "a spectacular co-op adventure that lays down a path of great gameplay ideas and uses it to play a giddy game of hopscotch." It also won Game of the Year, Best Family Game, and Best Multiplayer Game at The Game Awards 2021, along with numerous other awards at other shows. There's currently a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dwayne-johnson-executive-produce-it-takes-two-movie">film adaptation underway</a> at Amazon Studios, produced by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, IGN went <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-first-preview-we-played-josef-faress-new-co-op-game">hands-on with Split Fiction</a> ahead of today's reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also visit IGN’s expanding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced"><u>round-up of everything announced at The Game Awards 2024</u></a> for an overview of all of today’s news and announcements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.
