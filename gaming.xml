		<p>Wildlight has released a brand new patch for Highguard with the main feature being a brand new mode. That mode is Raid Rush in which two teams of five take turns to defend and attack bases, with the addition that there is no looting phase. Instead, between rounds players will be able to upgrade weapons and equipment by interacting with the Trader at their base, with equipment changing between each round. 3v3 Raids have been disabled while Raid Rush is active.</p>

<h2>Highguard Raid Rush update patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Comeback Kill&nbsp;</b>– Grab a kill after going on a death streak of 3 or more and get rewarded 2 Vesper per death, on top of the 3 for the kill. You’re back in the game!<wbr></li>
<li><b>Reviver Amulet</b>&nbsp;– bonus revive speed reduced from 50% to 15%.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li><i>Dev Note: We feel like the speed of a Reviver Amulet revive was creating too much safety for mid-combat revives.</i><wbr></li>
<li><b>Smuggler’s Den</b>&nbsp;– added more defender respawns<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Weapon Balance Updates</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Vanguard –&nbsp;<b>Reducing accuracy and controllability – it’s too dominant across long ranges</b><wbr></li>
<li>Dynasty –&nbsp;<b>Buffing damage to provide a better tradeoff for the challenging recoil. It now takes one fewer bullet to kill against blue, purple, and gold shields</b><wbr></li>
<li>Corsair –&nbsp;<b>Reducing the delay before the recoil pattern resets, so that the Corsair can be fired more quickly without sacrificing accuracy</b><wbr></li>
<li>Longhorn –&nbsp;<b>Increased fire rate to make the Longhorn more versatile, making it more viable at medium and close ranges.</b><wbr></li>
<li>Longhorn (Repeater) –&nbsp;<b>Hipfire accuracy buffed to satisfy the end game power spike feeling</b><wbr></li>
<li>Viper –&nbsp;<b>Reducing controllability when using the 2x Optic in order to balance out its long range power</b><wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed some wall geo you could walk through at Belltower in Kingdom<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed Firing Range base select being too short</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirms-layoffs-just-weeks-after-launch/">Wildlight confirmed layoffs just weeks after launch&nbsp;</a>of Highguard. We enjoyed in our first look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/28/highguard-review-in-progress/">Highguard</a>. Dom said,<em> “Highguard’s first steps into the PvP arena are confident and unashamed, despite what the angry voices on the internet might tell you. The slightly odd mix of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six and He-Man actually makes for a good time, and there’s so much room for more to happen here. That will take time, and I hope that it finds the audience it needs to thrive.”</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-guides-tips-grace-leon-spider-2000674068</link>
            <guid>1447468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-leon-grace-capcom-ps5-pc-2000673329"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span> is basically two games in one, and both its protagonists have different tools and rules to follow as you swap between them over the course of its campaign. With that in mind, we have a few tips that should come in handy as you head back into Capcom’s horror series on February 27.</span></p> <h2><b>If you can’t enter a room, assume it’s for the other character</b></h2> <p><span>Throughout </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>, there will be stages where both playable characters, Grace and Leon, will walk through the same space. When playing as one character, you might not be able to access a room, open a cabinet, or use an item. The game does a decent job of using flavor text to communicate when you won’t find a solution to these problems with your current character, but that doesn’t mean these locations and items are useless. Sometimes something only works for Grace, or Leon can use his axe to pry open a door. Just remember these oddities when you inevitably walk near them again as a different character.</span></p>

 <h2><b>The map is very generous about marking supplies</b></h2> <p><span>When playing as Grace, supplies are limited and can be the difference between getting through a room with all limbs intact and meeting an untimely demise. Luckily, if you’re running low on bullets or herbs to heal with, </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>’s map is pretty generous about marking those items even if you don’t see them when you’re passing through a room. There were several points when I opened up the map and saw that I’d overlooked an herb in a different room and went back to grab it before heading into an area full of zombies. So if you’re ever hurting for healing or bullets, just open the map and you can probably find some stashed away somewhere.</span></p> <h2><b>Try to have a knife at all times for collecting purposes</b></h2> <p><span>One of the collectibles you’ll find in </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> are dancing raccoon bobbleheads hidden around various areas. You’ll hear them rattling if you’re in the right room, but you’ll have to destroy them with either a bullet or a melee weapon to “collect” them. With <a href="https://kotaku.com/leon-kennedy-resident-evil-requiem-hot-thirst-trap-2000673666">Leon</a>, this is pretty simple because he always has his hatchet on hand. For Grace, whose sections are defined by scarcity, simply striking a collectible could cost you. Don’t waste a bullet if you don’t have to. Grace is able to craft a makeshift knife out of scraps you’ll scoop up while exploring. Not only is it helpful for fighting off zombies that get to close, but they can also be used as a quick melee attack to strike both enemies and the raccoon collectibles without wasting ammo.</span></p>

 <h2><b>If you have arachnophobia, this game is not for you</b></h2> <p><span>No need to get into spoilers here, but if you have a debilitating fear of spiders, I’m sorry to say that </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> has an entire segment that will make your skin crawl. Just something to be aware of until someone inevitably makes an arachnophobia mode mod.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Use the crafting menu, not items</b></h2> <p><span>There’s a whole crafting section of the pause menu, and it streamlines the mechanic of combining items to get something better. If you so choose, you can use the inventory tab to do some trial and error and try to find recipes, but the crafting tab makes this much more simple by listing not only the recipes you know, but automatically listing what you have the components for. Old </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>heads might like the feeling of manually sifting through your inventory, but if you want to save time and headache, there’s a whole menu for you.</span></p> <h2>It’s better to stun an enemy than kill them as Grace</h2> <p>Because ammo is so limited in Grace’s sections, you’re better off using what little resources you have to stun an enemy, rather than wasting bullets trying to take them out. A few shots to the head or kneecaps will typically put a zombie in a stunned state, which will allow you to shove them to the ground and run past them. It’s not a permanent solution, but it’s a more strategic one that will benefit you in the long run when you have more bullets to use.</p>

 <h2><b>Get upgrades before you leave an area</b></h2> <p><span>In some sections, you’ll be able to secure upgrades for things like your health, damage output, and inventory space. For Grace’s segments, these are things you have to find in locked rooms or in areas that have them in secured cases you’ll unlock by inserting coins you find. These upgrades won’t be available to you in future acts, as </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>changes locations a few times over the course of the story. So if you see a permanent upgrade behind a locked door, try to unlock it before you progress the story too far.</span></p> <h2><b>Don’t neglect your storage case as Grace</b></h2> <p><span>Grace’s inventory is much more limited than Leon’s. Whereas he has a case that you can manage by repositioning items so they’ll fit, Grace has fixed slots for various items. She’s able to place items in storage cases found throughout each area, however, and if you’re not using an item such as a weapon you don’t have bullets for or a component for a recipe you don’t have every piece to, stash them away so you don’t have to discard items you might still want to use due to lack of space.</span></p> <h2><b>Don’t forget the quick turn</b></h2> <p><span>I completely spaced on the quick turn for most of my first playthrough of </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>, even though it’s usually part of my muscle memory for these kinds of games. Don’t make my mistake. If you need to quickly turn around to either run away or reposition yourself in a scrap, pressing back and either circle or B will make Leon and Grace do a 180, rather than slowly turning to run away.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Defeating enemies with one character might help you as the other</b></h2> <p><span>Part of the whole “Grace and Leon share the same space” deal is that taking out zombies as one can help the other more easily get through an area when you swap over. More often than not, you’re playing as Grace first in an area, so it can sometimes be better to leave an enemy for Leon and his superior firepower to handle, but if you find something particularly annoying and want to take it out before you proceed, the other character will no doubt be grateful you did.</span></p> <h2><b>There’s one benefit of first-person for Grace</b></h2> <p><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>is playable in both first- and third-person, and the game recommends you play Grace’s sections in first person and Leon’s in third. I played both in third-person because that’s just my general preference in most games, but there is one slight advantage to playing in first-person for Grace. When you play in third-person, Grace will stumble as she runs away from monsters to amp up the drama, but this detail doesn’t play out in first-person so you aren’t disoriented as she falls down. I’ve seen some folks say speedrunners will probably opt for first-person because this will shave off a second or two of time because you won’t have to get back up off the ground during those sequences.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Either read up on </b><b><i>Resident Evil 2 </i></b><b>or watch a walkthrough</b></h2> <p><span>If you’ve come into the </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>series recently or </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>is your first game in the series, it’s worth playing </span><i><span>Resident Evil 2</span></i><span> beforehand, or at least reading or watching a summary or walkthrough. </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>has pretty direct callbacks to a lot of old </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> lore, but none is more prevalent than its connections to </span><i><span>Resident Evil 2</span></i><span>, and being aware of Leon’s past will help drive some segments home.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-patch-note-mode-ps5-2000674000"><em>Highguard</em>‘s developers</a> have spoken openly about how the game’s looting and raid mechanics <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">were loosely inspired by the crafting survival sim <em>Rust</em></a>, but a new report shows the game was originally conceived of as something quite different. Developers hoped to even potentially launch a single-player mode to explore the hero shooter’s fictional background more, but funding ran out sooner than anyone expected.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc">A new report by <em>Bloomberg</em></a> lays out<em> Highguard</em>‘s evolving design and why it was so intent on sticking to a potentially fatal PR strategy of staying in stealth mode until a disastrous Game Awards 2025 reveal. Originally designed to be a survival-focused shooter in the mold of <em>Rust</em>, things weren’t congealing the way the team had hoped. Two years in, they pivoted to a more competitive-shooter-focused design. The survival crafting elements were streamlined into the game’s current idea of a “raid shooter.”</p>

 <p>Wildlight Entertainment reportedly explored matches of up to four teams before eventually settling on just 3v3. The result is giant maps with a big focus on looting and mining resources, a concept which <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646">feels empty and underbaked</a> in the final version of the game that launched last month. Despite releasing to over 100,000 concurrents on Steam, nobody stuck with the game.</p> <p>An open player beta might have caught these issues, but the team was reportedly committed to launching <em>Highguard </em>via a shadowdrop as Wildlight’s veteran staff had done with <em>Apex Legends</em> back in 2019. Multiple developers told Bloomberg that “hubris” was to blame for them not changing course sooner, thinking that past success was indicative of <em>Highguard</em>‘s future chances in an ever more crowded and hostile multiplayer gaming market.</p>

 <p>[If players were shocked that Wildlight had layoffs just weeks after launch, well, so were developers at the studio. One of the most revealing pieces from the<em> Bloomberg</em> report is that staff thought they had months of runway to ship content and respond to player feedback to potentially improve the game. Instead, the majority of the studio was laid off almost immediately after the game didn’t succeed.</p>

 <p>Some speculated that Tencent’s funding was contingent on launch metrics that <em>Highguard</em> fell way short of. The company’s TiMi Studio Group <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-wildlight-tencent-funding-layoffs-servers-2000669790">still hasn’t publicly acknowledged</a> that it helped ship the “self-published” game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New details from an insider reveal that Sony PlayStation might stop releasing its single-player titles on PC. </p>



<p>Multi-platform releases have become increasingly common in recent years, with Xbox participating more actively in this strategy than PlayStation. However, many PlayStation exclusives have also made their way to PC. It appears that this may change in the future, as PlayStation seems to be leaning toward maintaining more exclusive titles.</p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-s-strategy-could-see-live-service-games-come-to-pc-while-single-player-exclusives-don-t">PlayStation’s Strategy Could See Live-Service Games Come to PC, While Single Player Exclusives Don’t</h2>



<p>During the latest episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/pl/podcast/why-phil-spencer-retired-and-whats-next-for-xbox/id1507834679?i=1000751690666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Triple Click Podcast</a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-the-sense-i%E2%80%99m-getting-is-that-sony-is-backing-away-from-putting-their-exclusive-console-traditional-single-player-stuff-on-pc.1447141/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>), Jason Schreier discussed PlayStation seemingly considering stopping its single-player games from coming to PC. Schreier stated that he thinks the strategy for them is “live service games are coming to PC,” while he’s getting “the sense” that they are “backing away from putting their exclusive console stuff like traditional single-player stuff on PC.”  </p>



<p>Schrier mentioned that it wouldn’t be surprising if Marvel’s Wolverine never comes to PC. Even if it eventually does, players would likely understand that a PlayStation is necessary to play the game, “at least for the indefinite future”. He also expressed uncertainty about how successful the PC releases have been.</p>



<p>When asked why PlayStation would revert to a strategy that seems to “put something back in a bottle,” along with the potential consequences of such a move, Schrier replied that they never release games on PC simultaneously with console launches. He pointed out that “PC releases were always just kind of late to the party.” He added that he doesn’t think it was successful in the first place and doesn’t think going back to the console-only strategy would be “that big of a blow”. </p>



<p>In the same ResetEra <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-the-sense-i%E2%80%99m-getting-is-that-sony-is-backing-away-from-putting-their-exclusive-console-traditional-single-player-stuff-on-pc.1447141/page-6#post-151851202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thread</a>, Schreier clarified that this is “not speculation.” He explained that certain topics may surface during a show before he has the chance to publish a story about them. He also mentioned that more information on this topic should be available soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Dream Of Titanfall 2's Gauntlet Is Alive In VHOLUME]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/vholume-game-titanfall-2s-gauntlet-indie-parkour/</link>
            <guid>1447456</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p><em>Titanfall 2</em>’s <a href="https://titanfall.fandom.com/wiki/The_Pilot's_Gauntlet?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">gauntlet</a> is a singular location. It is technically a small tutorial and obstacle course, one that instructs you on the unique traversal mechanisms of the game. But when Respawn made it they added a twist, a timer and leaderboard, and over the years people have gotten unreasonably good at breaking it. Nothing is quite like <em>Titanfall 2</em> generally, and the gauntlet specifically, except the beta release of <em>VHOLUME</em>, which is one of many reasons why I must urge you to play it if you haven’t.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UpKeDz64jh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="10.7 Second Gauntlet | Titanfall 2"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Back to the streets that raised me.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The movement in <em>VHOLUME</em>, an moody indie parkour simulator,<em> </em>instantly brings to mind<em> Mirror’s Edge</em> – it is impossible not to, given the game’s sheer influence on the first person parkour subgenre – as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike_surfing?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Counter-Strike</em> surfing</u></a>. You are in a concrete alley of impossible buildings and walkways suspended miles in the air, and the game instructs you to go forward. If you follow the path organically to the end, you are looped squarely back where you started and, just like <em>Titanfall 2’s</em> gauntlet, the game tells you your time. From here you may continue to challenge the loop again against an online leaderboard. Each run is uploaded to a common database, and you can load the ghost of any other runner into it. The game will also begin to unlock several options, including a fast shortcut to the roofs above, and another area called the “conapts.” There is also a Discord you can join, should you choose to live the life of the runner.</p><p><em>VHOLUME</em> is developed by Nathan Grange, Niels Tiercelin and Léonard Lemaitre. Lemaitre co-created the free exploration adventure game <em>Babbdi</em> and the hyperspeed indie arena shooter <em>STRAFTAT</em>. If you have played neither and own a PC I urge you to play both. Though tonally quite different than this game, DNA from both has found its way into <em>Vholume</em>.<em>&nbsp;</em></p><figure><figcaption><span>STRAFTAT is a no-brainer download.</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>STRAFTAT </em>in particular is a must download – it is a grotesque indie take on <em>Quake III Arena</em> and <em>UT2004. </em>It is a tonal cousin to <em>Cruelty Squad, </em>set entirely to Jungle bangers, and costs you nothing except maybe the reasonable and entirely optional DLC packs. Few games have done as good a job of simulating the spirit of a LAN party of teens in 2004 constantly playing a free demo because none of them can afford to pay retail.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>Heaters.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><em>Vholume</em> is not a full game yet, but I have hopes for what it will become. The beta is more a proof of concept, an amalgamation of buildings someplace in the tonal and architectural liminality between <em>Ico</em> and <em>Half Life 2</em>. It is that sand colored, Lebbeus Woods-by-way-of-Source-Engine texture that is both unearthly and instantly familiar if you ever owned a GeForce card. <em>VHOLUME’s</em> Steam page claims it is a “melancholic first-person parkour adventure set in a dystopian brutalist city where bureaucracy turns a simple task into an odyssey.” <em>VHOLUME’s </em>beta is a raw and unfinished space, but the vibes have never been finer. The structures are rough and alien, like <em>City of Lost Children, Blame! </em>or <em>Texnolyzed.</em> An ambient track by 1000eyes coos in the background like a Buddhist prayer machine.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Running.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have been thinking about <em>Titanfall 2 </em>slightly more than usual. Part of this is the avoidable <a href="https://aftermath.site/highguard-studio-developers-laid-off/"><u>collapse of <em>Highguard</em></u></a>, but also because of the tacit way that <em>Titanfall 2</em> haunts everything anyone involved with it will ever do again. So many parts of that game are precious and singular, and no game moves like it. The r/titanfall subreddit has, over the years, devolved into a self-depricating support forum for people who know the difficulties of getting another game like that, but have to hope in their hearts that they will.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Oh hell yeah that's the stuff.</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is a hauntological nature to this obsession that I share, an unknowable counterfactual of what could be if they made another <em>Titanfall</em> instead of doing literally anything else, like a free to play hero shooter. Like <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, I cannot say they would be happy with what they would eventually get, because games exist in a specific context, and getting the juice back and having the game be a hit is less achievable than any of us would like, doubly so when you consider how rough a launch <em>Titanfall 2</em> itself had.&nbsp;</p><p>What is perhaps more reasonable is that someone else might find a sliver of what made that game special, even the tutorial, refine it, and make something wholly new from that. I cannot say as of now that <em>V</em> will succeed, but the soul of the gauntlet lives on in its beta.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>This looks like that one weird hotel outside of Heathrow Terminal 4.</span></figcaption></figure>

            <p>
I'm finding Surgent Studios, the developer of Tales of Zenzera: ZAU and Dead Take, increasingly difficult to pin down, though, not in a bad way. Those two games are a far cry from one another in both atmosphere, genre, and mechanics, and now the studio's next game is something completely different once again: FixForce, an extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a>, a combination of words that might finally pin down Those Types of Games.
</p>
<p>
By Those Types of Games, I mean the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, Peak, and the many others that have followed. Extraction platformer might better apply to the latter there, but I think it's closer, and much less annoying a term, than friendslop. Anyway, FixForce! Is a game where you and five friends find yourself in a flooded, post-apocalyptic but quite colourful city, where you must venture forth to find parts to fix various machines and gizmos.

<p>
To navigate said world, you must use things like wooden pallets, girders, and other miscellaneous items to build bridges, stairs and the like. You do so using a drill-wrench, which is basically just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a>'s gravity gun, albeit you can freeze things in place to make those makeshift platforms. Upon finding all the relevant parts and fixing up those machines, you can clock out and get out of there, and the cycle begins anew.
</p><p>
You'll of course find plenty of risks, but you're a robot so it's alright if your head literally comes off; friends can carry your head or body around in such situations and put you back together, say, in the event of an evil robot blowing you up, or you get too much water in your system.
</p>
<p>
On first viewing of the trailer, I did get some light Ratchet and Clank vibes about it outside of the obvious Lethal Company and Peak influences, and all three of those are cited on the game's Steam page funnily enough. Alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/garrys-mod">Garry's Mod</a>! So I was close with the Half-Life reference.
</p>
<p>
I do wonder, and worry, about the staying power of These Types of Games, but the pseudo build-your-own-platformer quality of FixForce does have a charm to it that I think gives it just enough appeal to stand out. And it's not too long until it has a chance to prove itself, as it's due out in early access next month, March 12th. You can wishlist it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3933150/FixForce/">here</a>.

            <guid>1447387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Ta ra, turn-based</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've grown used to the <strong>Disgaea</strong> series' tried-and-tested tactical gameplay on Nintendo consoles over the last ~20 years, but the next game promises something a little different. In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-mayhem">Disgaea Mayhem</a>, it's all about the action.</p>
<p>NIS America has today announced that this action RPG spin-off (which launched in Japan as '<strong>Kyouran Makaism</strong>' last month) will be launching in the West on Switch 1 &amp; 2 at some point this summer.</p>
<p>The headline feature that we need to mention here is, yes, Mayhem lets you take <em>direct control</em> of the on-screen action. Using an arsenal of weapons, you'll slash, shoot and explode enemies as you would in any other ARPG — quite the departure from the tactics that we're used to from the series.</p>
<p>There's a touch of something vaguely <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Warriors</a>-esque about the gameplay footage shown in the above reveal trailer, and even though we're not completely sold on the visuals as they stand, we've got to commend the switch-up. And yes, it's officially labelled as a 'spinoff', so don't worry about the core gameplay loop being gone for good.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screens from NIS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Magichange into Action</strong>: Take direct control of the combat in this action RPG spinoff of the Disgaea series! Beat down hundreds of enemies with classic Disgaea weapons, including the sword, gun, fist, and axe!<br>
<strong>Grind Up to Get Down</strong>: It wouldn't be Disgaea without the ability to get stronger. Head to the Item World to power up your equipment, reincarnate for higher base stats, or grind out levels to make sure you're at the top of the food chain!<br>
<strong>Satisfy Her Cravings</strong>: It takes a demon to feed a princess! Princess Tichelle loves her flan, and N.A. loves a paycheck. By working together, they can both get what they want! Dessert brings people (and demons) together in this light-hearted tale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Limited Edition physical release is now available to pre-order from the <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/disgaea-mayhem-limited-edition?variant=42797437812784">NIS America online store</a> for <strong>$99.99</strong>. Alongside a boxed copy of the game (Game-Key Card for Switch 2), this release includes a collector's box, artbook, CD soundtrack, acrylic stand and keychain.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2d9b33209a1b9"><a title="Disgaea Mayhem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2d9b33209a1b9/disgaea-mayhem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We've already had a taste of the Disgaea series on Switch 2 with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">7 Complete</a>, which launched in October 2025. While we found it to be quite the time sink, with most of the biggest additions being tethered to the post-game, we described Complete as "every bit as great [as Vows of the Virtueless] and stands tall as the ultimate, feature-complete iteration of the game" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">our review</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for a more specific Mayhem release date in the coming months, with our fingers crossed that NIS America can keep the Disgaea good times a-flowing.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/resident-evil-requiem-pc-performance-analysis-tuning-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don't have the PC</a> to play <strong>CAPCOM</strong>'s new <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong> game, but you'd really love to experience it anyway? If you have a solid Internet connection (and live in a supported region of the world), <strong>NVIDIA</strong> can give you the chance through its <strong>GeForce NOW</strong> cloud platform, and they're also bundling the game with new 12-month Ultimate memberships. For the record, a year-long GeForce NOW Ultimate subscription sets you back <strong>$199.99</strong>, but the game itself is <strong>$70</strong>, which you'd be saving if you were planning on buying it anyway.</p>



<p>With GeForce NOW Ultimate, you'd have access to <strong>nearly all of the game's features available to GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU owners</strong>: NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, and path tracing. The only thing not supported right now on the cloud is the new <strong>DLSS 4.5 second-generation transformer model</strong>, which debuted on local GPUs earlier this year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of features that the GFN Ultimate membership offers over the Free and Performance tiers:</p>



<ul>
<li>8-hour gaming sessions</li>



<li>Up to 5K resolution</li>



<li>Up to 240 FPS (360 FPS on RTX 5080 servers)</li>



<li>First priority access to the queue</li>



<li>16 vCPU cores 56 GB DRAM</li>



<li>Surround 7.1 audio</li>



<li>DLSS Frame Generation</li>



<li>NVIDIA Reflex</li>



<li>Cloud G-Sync</li>



<li>GeForce RTX 5080-class performance </li>



<li>DLSS Frame Generation (Multi-Frame Generation on RTX 5080 servers)</li>
</ul>



<p>Here's a tease <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-requiem-encyclopedia-evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from our Resident Evil Requiem review</a>, penned by Nathan Birch:</p>



<p><em>Resident Evil Requiem is the Every-Evil, as Capcom has taken all the things they've done with the franchise over the past decade or so and stitched them together into a towering monster of a survival horror game. Parts of this game are the best, scariest, and most intense this series has ever been, other parts are merely alright, but no part of the game is bad and it's all very distinctly Resident Evil. While it won't be everyone's new favorite, Resident Evil Requiem should hit enough right notes for most fans.</em></p>



<p>Besides CAPCOM's latest entry in the renowned survival horror series, <strong>here's the full list of new GeForce NOW games joining the library this week</strong>:</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <p>The team behind 2D side-scroller God of War: Sons of Sparta has shared details on how to access the game's two player co-op content without finishing the main story first.</p>
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta was announced and shadow dropped earlier this month on PS5. Developed by Mega Cat Studios in partnership with Sony Santa Monica, it is a retro-inspired canon story all about Kratos and his brother Deimos in their youth at training at the Spartan Agoge (which was very "brutal").</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>On its debut earlier this year, many had assumed the game would be able to be played in single player, or as a two-player co-op experience, due to the wording on the PlayStation Store which said the game was suitable for "1-2 players". However, it turned out this was only partly accurate, as the co-op gameplay was actually a roguelike challenge mode which was only accessible <em>after </em>Sons of Sparta's main story had been completed.</p>
<p>This led to a certain amount of disappointment among the God of War community. Comments like "this might be legit false advertising" and "locking co op behind beating the full story is such a weird call" soon <a href="https://x.com/SonySantaMonica/status/2022393739986244098">peppered Sony Santa Monica and Mega Cat Studio's social media</a>. But, it now seems that the Sons of Sparta team has heard these cries, and sought to remedy the situation by providing a code players can enter on the start menu which will unlock the separate endgame roguelike challenge mode from the off.</p>
<p>And that code? Well, it's:</p>
<p><strong>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, L1, R1, Touchpad</strong></p>
<p>If you pop that in, you will then get a new option on your menu which will allow you to access Sons of Sparta's The Pit of Agonies, which can be played solo or in two-player local co-op.</p>
<p>As for what The Pit of Agonies is all about, well the reason the team initially decided to keep it as endgame content is because it is apparently very difficult. But, if you are up for it, this challenge mode will present you with different enemies and reward pools each time you play. You can check out a trailer about it all below.</p>

<p>As well as this Sons of Sparta, the original God of War trilogy is getting remade. However, this particular project is still in the early days of development, so don't expect anything more soon. "As we look to the future, we also want to invest in the past and tend to the series' roots that got us to where we are today," Sony said earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">announcing the remakes</a>.</p><p>"We know that remaking the Greek saga has been a frequent request – the genuine, passionate interest from fans to see the original games return is something we're very thankful for and can’t wait to share more when the time comes!"</p>

Pokémon is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-30-super-bowl-spot-lady-gaga-and-jigglypuff-performance">30 this week</a>. Stardew Valley is 10! Coincidence? YOU DECIDE. Our focus here, though, is developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's smash-hit farming game, which is celebrating its major birthday milestone with a special video featuring, among other things, a look at its forthcoming 1.7 update.
</p>
<p>
Stardew Valley launched for PC on 26th February, 2016, meaning today, specifically, marks its tenth anniversary. And Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2026717852162732412">confirmed he had a bit of a treat planned for the occasion</a> on social media earlier the week. Officially, the video - which is set to air at 7pm in the UK this evening - is a "retrospective and new spouse reveal", which will include some old pre-release footage of the game, with Barone providing commentary.
</p>
<p>
He'll also be talking about the many updates Stardew Valley has received over the years, which brings us to that "spouse reveal". Last August - despite previously saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">there'd be no more Stardew Valley updates</a> until after the release of his next game, the Haunted Chocolatier - Barone revealed he'd <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-will-be-getting-another-update-after-all">had a bit of a change of heart</a>. Then, back in February, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-getting-new-marriage-options-better-children-in-next-update">teased the forthcoming 1.7 update</a> would include upgrades to the children of Stardew Valley, making them "a little more interesting", as well as two new marriage candidates for players to woo. And it's the latter we'll be meeting tonight.
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much all there is to report until after Barone's anniversary video airs. So if you fancy meeting your new potential life partners, you'll be wanting to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geiTg6Z7w3A">point your face at YouTube</a> starting 7pm GMT/8pm CET/11am PST. 
</p>
<p>
As for the long-awaited Haunted Chocolatier, Barone <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-alive-the-game-is-still-in-development-stardew-valley-creator-concernedape-gives-update-on-haunted-chocolatier">recently revealed</a> that work on his next game, originally announced back in 2021, had been "very productive lately". There's still no whiff of a release date yet, however, with Barone only saying it'll "come out when it's done."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco is continuing their string of re-releases with the launch of <em>Tales of Berseria Remastered</em>. Originally out for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PC, this year marks ten years since the game was first available.</p><p>While <em>Tales of Berseria</em> isn’t necessarily old enough to warrant a full overhaul, the <em>Remastered</em> version includes many of the same quality of life updates found in the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-spirited-journey" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em></a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-xillia-remastered-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em></a>. These include things like access to the Grade Shop right away, which lets players boost the gameplay experience.</p><p>They’re nice additions to have and make one of the more standout entries in the series even better.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><br><em>Tales of Berseria</em> tells the story of a woman named Velvet who, in a series of tragic situations, loses her family. Left with her ailing younger brother, the pair live in a quiet village with her brother-in-law Artorius.&nbsp;</p><p>As time passes, the calamity that killed her family returns. Known as the Scarlet Night, daemons are brought to their village once again – and this time it’s Velvet’s brother Laphicet who gets tangled up in a sacrificial ritual.&nbsp;</p><p>It turns out Artorius has bigger plans, and Velvet gets tangled up in them too, resulting in an element called Daemonblight infecting her arm and turning her into a Daemon known as a Therion – a being that can eat and absorb other daemons.</p><p>Tossed into prison with revenge on her mind, Velvet’s story picks up three years later when she’s freed along with fellow prisoners who form an unlikely band of bad guys to get back at Artorius for his role in the state of the world.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p><br>Along the way, Velvet meets up with the likes of other daemons, witches, and spiritual beings known as malakhim. Together, they’re tasked with defeating the Exorcists with the greater goal of eventually stopping Artorius.</p><p>There’s a lot of drama along the way, and <em>Tales of Berseria</em> doesn’t shy away from darker themes – there’s nothing heroic here. But that works to its advantage, and one of my favorite things about the story is peeling back the layers of these characters and seeing them as more than just villains.</p><p>It’s really, really ambitious, and the payoff is certainly worth the nearly 50 hours it takes to reach the conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>In between all that, <em>Tales of Berseria</em> has a more action-specific battle system. That is, it’s approached more like a hack and slash game in terms of pushing buttons for combos, and a lot of this can be customized in the Artes menu depending on how you prefer to play.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-berseria-remastered_20260224171819.jpg?itok=nggFbWSd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><br>Known as the Liberation-Linear Motion Battle System, each character can use a number of physical or magic attacks, with the player controlling Velvet and the other party members operating through the CPU. Skills are assigned to each button and can be chained through pressing them in succession, like a typical combo.</p><p>Each character also uses what’s called a Soul Gauge, which can stack up to five souls and deplete when Artes get used and then recharge as the battle continues. It's definitely a more involved battle system, but getting the hang of each skill and building up those skills is plenty satisfying.</p><p>While <em>Tales of Berseria</em> sticks to the four character party in battle, additional characters can be swapped in or out with the press of the d-pad. Characters can also be given stock commands, such as going all out or putting up more defense.</p><p>Outside of battle, there are various other things to keep you busy, like gear customization, cooking, ship exploration, monster hunts, card-based minigames, and some sidequests that populate near the end of the game. There’s not a huge variety, but it’s at least something in addition to the main quest.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><br>On the visual side of things, <em>Tales of Berseria</em> is about what you’d expect from a game that already existed on PS4 and PC ten years ago. That is to say, there’s not much in the way of visual upgrade other than making it run on PS5, and I did notice some glitches here and there. Specifically, some low-resolution textures, blinking lighting, and it seems like the element that makes up the save point isn’t scaled properly, and that really stood out to me.</p><p>That said, everything else seems to be more or less intact. The voice acting is stellar, the game runs smoothly during gameplay, and most of the visual art style holds up. And again, it’s only been ten years since release, so it hasn’t had time to really age out of style.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, if you haven’t played <em>Tales of Berseria</em> on PC or PS4, now’s a good time as any to check it out. The game acts as a prequel to <em>Tales of Zestiria</em>, which will no doubt see a re-release down the line, as Bandai Namco seems keen to keep the series fresh in people’s minds as they prepare an all-new entry.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tales of Berseria Remastered</em> does its job in the meantime, and while there are some minor issues with textures and lighting, the core of the game remains as delightful as ever.</p><hr><p><em>TechRaptor reviewed <strong>Tales of Berseria Remastered</strong> on PlayStation 5 with a code provided by the publisher.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legends of Avantris have announced a new Kickstarter campaign for a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> book. The campaign is for Neon Odyssey, a sci-fi space opera setting inspired by retro games, pop culture, and synthwave.</p><h2>The <em>Neon Odyssey</em> Kickstarter Announcement</h2><p>According to a press release, <em>Neon Odyssey</em> is a fantasy-forward sci-fi setting. It prioritizes optimism, adventure, and stylish presentation over hard sci-fi rules or attempts at real world physics. The focus is more on fun and atmosphere than simulation. The book will feature character-driven adventures with big tone, big style, and table-ready momentum.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Neon Odyssey</em> is set in Legends of Avantris' own <em>Stardust Rhapsody</em> setting. Players will explore various planets and space stations as bounty hunters. These jobs involve targeting people, robots, data and more. Those jobs will earn credits, which can be used in upgrading ships and gear, and may pull players into deepening conflict with larger factions at play.</p><p><em>Neon Odyssey</em> differs greatly from Avantris' last project, the spooky adventure <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/crooked-moon-review-incredibly-spooky-adventure-that-dms-will-love" rel="nofollow"><em>Crooked Moon</em></a>. This book is not a single scripted adventure, but a setting book packed with modular content and plug-and-play missions. Meaning it can support everything from one-shots to major years-long campaigns. Its influences include 80s and 90s anime, synthwave edge, and pop culture nostalgia.</p><p>The Kickstarter will produce three books. The <em>Outrunner's Handbook</em> contains re-imagined, sci-fi versions of classic D&amp;D classes, subclasses, species, backgrounds, spells, and more. The Cosmic Codex contains worldbuilding material on the setting, including 13 factions, over 30 alien worlds, 6 interdimensional realms, over 250, monsters, 40 missions, and more than 120 items.&nbsp;</p><p>The third book is the <em>Overdrive Expansio</em>n, which contains more of everything. This includes optional and advanced systems like Professions, Racing, Stress &amp; Entertainment, and ship upgrading. Combined, all three of these books will proved 1,400 pages of new material for your gaming table.</p><p>The Kickstarter campaign for Neon Odyssey will go live on May 5, 2026.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>A decade on from its 1.0 launch, action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grim-dawn">Grim Dawn</a> is getting some new Fangs of Asterkarn DLC that adds 5.5 square kilometres of in-game terrain. Picture the extra geography barrelling out of the atmosphere like a boisterous asteroid, teeming with bosses and minibosses and unique items. Look out below!</p>
<p>The DLC will increase the size of the base game by 76%, and will be prefaced by a free update with a new scaleable UI and revised stash feature, offering dedicated crafting and components pages. My, my, Grim Dawn, you’re certainly looking sprightly and well-padded, for a Diabbler of your seniority.
</p><!--more-->
<p>“Fantasy/horror action RPG Grim Dawn is a huge and slick affair which clings tight to a doomy tone, eschews online funny business and is careful to keep lore overload at arm's length,” Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grim-dawn-review-2">wrote back in 2016</a>. “A lack of overblown cutscenes aside, you'd never guess that it was made comparatively under the radar and on surely a fraction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iii">Diablo III</a>'s budget.” 
</p>
<p>Grim Dawn certainly found an audience both during and after early access, as developers Crate Entertainment recall in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/219990/view/532124583945306256?l=english">an anniversary Steam post this week</a>. “Grim Dawn's success enabled Crate Entertainment to grow from a studio of just 8 people to a team of 29 today, with 4 projects currently in development,” they write. “Your early support has allowed us to not only stay independent from publishers, but to pour our passion into each of our creations.
</p><p>“Likewise, when we started, we never could have imagined that 10 years later Grim Dawn would not only still be receiving major updates but it would have another expansion on the way. Our engineers bent the old engine to their will. Even as recently as last year, we addressed bugs that have been there since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titan-quest">Titan Quest</a>. 
</p>
<p>“Across 82 updates both big and small, we refined and polished, revamping everything from melee animations to how Nemesis bosses spawn on the map. We overhauled loot tables and added loot filters, revamped UIs and smoothed out the difficulty unlocks. Now with v1.3.0 on the way, truly nothing feels off the table to make the game better for you.”
</p>
<p>You can read a playtest changelog for v.1.3.0 <a href="https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/v1-3-0-playtest-changelog/150992">here</a>. This being an ARPG, it includes a lot of sentences like “Hamster of Ventriloquism Deafening Modifier Increased to 300/s”. I leave it you veteran Grim Dawners - now presumably well into the Dismal Afternoon of middle age – to make sense of things.
</p>
<p>The developers had planned to wind things up with Grim Dawn's second expansion, Forgotten Gods, in 2019. They figured that “sales would naturally decline” thereafter, but were caught out by growing player counts in 2023. “Despite having 3 games already in development, we knew we had to reassemble the team for one more loop around the sun,” the Steam post enthuses. “As it turned out... that may have been a bit of an understatement as we enter 2026!”
</p><p>Fangs of Asterkarn development is now “in its final stretch”, and they’re absolutely sure this time that it’ll be “Grim Dawn's final hurrah”. You can expect over 60 new bosses or minibosses, 370 unique items, eight new nemesis monsters, and 116 monster infrequents. The DLC will also add a new alchemy system, “awakened Epic items and Affix Rerolling”, a 10th mastery, and a new class combo maximum of 45.
</p>
<p>Not having played Grim Dawn, I can only gaze in terror upon the bulk of this jargon. But I <em>can</em> get my head around the concept of shapeshifting - “a system we once thought was untenable in this old engine”. Sounds like there’s a juicy story there. In general, I’m automatically pleased and interested by efforts to keep older games in the pink. All we need now is a release date for Fangs of Asterkarn, but alas, there is none.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Metacritic Removes Resident Evil Requiem Review From Website That Replaced Humans With AI]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-metacritic-ai-review-videogamer-2000674042</link>
            <guid>1447345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> review published by long-standing UK gaming news site <em>Videogamer</em> has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-best-reviewed-main-entry-in-over-20-years-2000673626">removed from Metacritic</a> after readers pointed out it was written by a fake AI journalist who doesn’t actually exist. <em>Videogamer</em>‘s human masthead was gutted last week, sources tell <em>Kotaku</em>, and the site has been publishing apparent genAI slop ever since.</p> <p><span><em>Videogamer,</em> purchased BGFG a few years back and recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-escapist-esports-insider-clickout-media-layoffs-2000669743">sold to gambling seo spam agency Clickout</a>, gave <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> a 9/10 in its review this week. But readers pointed out that the writing “reeks [of] AI,” and its author, “experienced iGaming and sports betting analyst” Brian Merrygold, appeared to be a made-up person complete with an AI profile image.</span></p>

 <p><span>The review in question is full of clichés and generalities rather than specifics about the game and how it plays. Here’s an excerpt:</span></p> <blockquote><p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem is not just a victory lap for Capcom’s survival horror dynasty; it is a chainsaw-revving, blood-soaked testament to why we love getting scared stupid.</strong>&nbsp;It is the sort of finale that effectively grabs the franchise by the lapels, shakes it violently, and demands you acknowledge just how far it has come since the tank-control days of 1996. While other series limp toward their conclusions,&nbsp;<strong>RE9</strong>&nbsp;arrives with the confidence of a Tyrant smashing through a brick wall.</p> <p>It happens like clockwork with every major&nbsp;Resident Evil Requiem leak, doesn’t it? We worry if the developers can balance the scales. After the southern gothic reinvention of&nbsp;<em>RE7</em>&nbsp;and the action-hero theatrics of the recent remakes, the franchise has been having something of an identity crisis. This game solves it by simply doing both.&nbsp;<strong>It bonds the trauma of Raccoon City with modern design sensibilities</strong>, proving there is plenty of life left in this undead horse. It frames the horror not just as a series of jump scares, but as a legacy that haunts its characters as much as it haunts our backlogs.</p></blockquote> <p><span>It was previously scraped and featured on Metacritic for its review score roundup on launch day. It raises concerns about quality control for the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/metacritic-co-founder-marc-doyle-lifts-the-veil-on-how-the-site-works">primary video game review aggregator</a> that fans consult before buying games and that companies mention in their quarterly earnings reports when touting the success of recent releases.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's bleak. I was reading some RE Requiem reviews and found this thing published by videogamer. Can't find anything about the writer, everything about it reeks AI (dead giveaway being the image). Low effort, gargabe.</p> <p>Mind you, this review made its way to Metacritic. <a href="https://t.co/4STN8DjAwe">https://t.co/4STN8DjAwe</a> <a href="https://t.co/awk26P9wSA">pic.twitter.com/awk26P9wSA</a></p> <p>— Andrés (@Andrew_east) <a href="https://twitter.com/Andrew_east/status/2026919935641895380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“The <em>RE Requiem</em> review and a handful of other Videogamer reviews from 2026 have been removed from Metacritic,” site cofounder Marc Doyle told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email.</p>

 <p><span>As spotted by </span><i><span>Gfinity’s </span></i><span>Andrés Aquino in a post on </span><a href="https://x.com/Andrew_east/status/2026919935641895380?s=20"><span>X</span></a><span>, everything about Brian Merrygold’s profile on <em>Videogamer</em> comes off as suspicious.

 <p><span>Several other authors on the site have similarly suspicious-looking AI-generated profile pictures that don’t mention they were generated by ChatGPT in their file names, suggesting this may have been a slip-up on by <em>Videogamer</em> site management as it pivots the outlet to completely AI-generated junk. </span><span>Other current bylines on the site include </span><a href="https://www.videogamer.com/author/shooter-orson/"><span>Shooter Orson</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.videogamer.com/author/steven-danielson/"><span>Steven Danielson</span></a>. Like the <span>Merrygold account, all three had their X profiles created in October 2025.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000674047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674047"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674047">X</figcaption></figure> <p>Sources told <em>Kotaku</em> that Clickout began publishing AI-generated content under the casino and gambling portions of <em>Videogamer</em> around that time last fall, but it wasn’t until the staff was axed last week that AI content started being pushed out into the gaming news, reviews, and features sections as well. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhiki.bsky.social/post/3l7qicbpbza2n">Older human bylines</a> from the site’s 15-year history have been completely wiped out as well and overwritten with fake AI profiles.</p>

 <p><span>While it’s impossible to verify what content is or isn’t generated with AI with complete accuracy, multiple AI checkers <em>Kotaku</em> used to verify the legitimacy of the </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> review sounded alarm bells.

A Recent </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</span></i><span> review, which was published on <em>Videogamer</em> and subsequently featured on Metacritic on February 23, has also been removed from the aggregator’s roundup.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Ethan Gach.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Santa Monica has provided a code that players can use to access God of War: Sons of Sparta’s roguelike mode, The Pit of Agonies, early. </p>



<p>Santa Monica <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-dropped</a> God of War: Sons of Sparta during the latest Sony State of Play event, and fans have fun in the 2D metroidvania adventure ever since then. The title has always had the Pit of Agonies roguelike mode, but players had to finish the game to access it; now, they can do it earlier. </p>

<p>As revealed in the new blog post, the only way previously to unlock God of War: Sons of Sparta’s Pit of Agonies roguelike mode was to beat the story. However, now players can unlock it early by entering a code in the starting menu. The code is a series of inputs on your DualSense controller that you can check out below: </p>



<p><strong>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, L1, R1, Touchpad</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>For those unaware about the Pit, it is a separate rougelike mode where players battle different enemies to access new reward pools. The game mode can be played solo or with another player through local co-op as Kratos and Deimos take on this challenge. </p>



<p>The game mode also features a difficulty modifier called Agony, which can be chosen at the start of a run. This introduces variety to gameplay and changes how players approach the game. For example, “the Agony of Torment will manifest healing vessels that must be destroyed to prevent enemies from regenerating health, while the Agony of Calamity will cause defeated enemies to burst into a fiery explosion.” </p>



<p>After finishing each run in God of War: Sons of Sparta’s The Pit mode, players will be rewarded with a Symbol of Suffering for their chosen Agonies. When players hit thresholds of Symbols, they unlock new agones, and completion provides them with Ashes of Agony, which allows them to get permanent upgrades that last between attempts.</p>
