			<p>Posted on the official Call of Duty X account, the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pc-trailer-specs-preloading-intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-load details</a> have been announced, alongside launch times of the game and system requirements for those who are playing the game on PC. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will require players to have 102 GB of space available on their SSD to be able to install the title, with the system requirements being rather respectable for the recommended settings, at the very least. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-global-launch-game-trailer/">game will be released globally</a> by October 25. Those who are in American time zones will be able to play the game as of October 24, with the rest of the world joining the fight on October 25.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has had a pretty hefty promotional campaign, with there being multiple open betas for players to try out, as well as the game being live-streamed during an event to showcase it as well as get some deep dive commentary from the developers. Players will also be able to preload the game on all platforms as of October 21, with those eager to have the game ready to install. The game can be pre-loaded by 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 5 PM BST. For those who may have less than favorable internet speeds, being able to preload the game will make a huge difference, as you have a whopping 102 GB download to complete.</p>
<p>The official launch time for the game on Battle.net and Steam is October 24 at 9 PM PT / 12 AM ET. Below is the full map of launch times so that you can stay ahead of the game and jump right into the campaign and zombies or even jump-start your multiplayer experience if you don't want to start the campaign right away.</p>

<p>The system requirements for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have also been listed, as you'll be able to see below. The requirements are listed for minimum, recommended and competitive/ultra 4K.</p>

This unfortunately included some personal information about members of its staff, but the majority of the leak consists of information about old and upcoming projects from the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise.

<p>XDefiant isn’t shutting down after Season 4. That’s the message executive producer Mark Rubin wants to make clear.</p>



<p>After rumors began to circulate on Tuesday that the game was at risk of being shut down at the end of Season 4, Rubin took to <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> to debunk the claims.</p>



<p>“To be crystal clear there are NO plans to shut down after Season 4,” Rubin said. I’ve literally been in meetings as of last week to discuss our Year 2 plans.”</p>



<p>He added  that the current focus of the team is to improve the technical experience of the game, including its netcode. He also said that they are working on content plans for both Season 3 and 4.</p>



<p>As far as the game’s player base,  Rubin admits that they have lost players since the game launched. However, he insists that its due to Ubisoft doing “very little marketing” for the game.</p>



<p>“We have done very little marketing so yes our numbers are down but that is just to give the team the time to get the game in a better place before we do bigger spends on marketing to bring new players to the game and to bring back players that have left,” he said.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously reported</a> that XDefiant was at risk of losing support from Ubisoft if its player base didn’t improved. That remains the case, though it was never reported that XDefiant would “shut down”. In the report, however, it was mentioned by sources that frustrations within the studio are aimed at leadership who “have refused to take responsibility for the project’s shortcomings”.</p>



<p>What do you think of Rubin’s denial that XDefiant was at risk of shutting down after Season 4? Let us know down below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/980/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">PC players will also be able to toggle on the FSR Frame Generation graphic setting, which allows them to enable frame generation to significantly increase their framerate. Activision says this setting also works seamlessly with other upscaling solutions.</p><p dir="ltr">Spec-wise, the publisher recommends running Black Ops 6 with an AMD Ryzen 5 1600X or Intel Core i7-6700K CPU with at least 12 GB of RAM. Video card recommendations include AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1080Ti / RTX 3060 cards.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the minimum specs seem to be pretty modest, with only an AMD Ryzen 5 1400 or Intel Core i5-6600 needed with at least 8 GB of RAM.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games has announced it's laying off an unspecified number of employees in the studio's second round of job cuts since the start of this year.
</p>
<p>
Riot began 2024 by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-laying-off-530-employees">laying off 530 employees</a> in a move it insisted was a "necessity",  saying its costs had "grown to the point where they're unsustainable... [leaving] no room for experimentation or failure". Ten months on, however, and the studio says it's latest round of job cuts "isn't about reducing headcount to save money - it's about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond."
</p>
<p>
"While team effectiveness is more important than team size," Riot co-founder Marc Merrill wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243708100091985">statement shared on social media</a>, "the League team will eventually be even larger than it is today as we develop the next phase of League. For Rioters who are laid off, we're supporting them with a severance package that includes a minimum of six months' pay, annual bonus, job placement assistance, health coverage, and more."

<p>
Despite Riot having now seen three rounds of layoffs since the start of 2023 (the studio also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-reportedly-making-layoffs">announced 46 job cuts</a> last year), Merrill attempted to reassure League of Legends fans in his statement, saying, "I want to be clear: we're not slowing down work on the game you love. We're investing heavily in solving today's challenges faster while also building for the future."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Riot for additional information, including the number of employees affected by today's layoffs, and we'll update the story if more is shared.
</p>
<p>
Today's news continues a devastating 2024 for the games industry, with around 13,000 industry employees believed to have lost their jobs since the start of the year - and that's in addition to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">10,500 workers laid off in 2023.</a> So why are these layoffs occurring? GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">shared his thoughts</a> earlier this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/space-marine-2-post-launch-trailer-reveals-dark-angels-operations-lethal-difficulty/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Around a month after its blockbusting launch, the future of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is looking anything but dark, as Saber Interactive outline a roadmap of post-launch content that will soon be coming to the game. There’s Dark Angels in the Season Pass, and a free update that will add Lethal Difficulty and a new PvE Operation, and with plenty more on the horizon into 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Post-Launch Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-aTR-9RYPu0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Dark Angels are a one of the most popular Space Marine chapters, and their arrival in Space Marine 2, alongside a bunch of their successor chapters, will no doubt go down well. Those who have the Season Pass will be able to dress up in dark green and be all broody about your dark secrets while fighting aliens and Chaos in the PvE and PvP modes.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, a new PvE Operation will be coming to the game in the first free content update. Termination will see you and your team of three face off against the largest Tyranid threat that the swarm can bring to bear, the Hierophant Bio-Titan.</p>


<p>And if you just want pain, then you will also be able to play on Lethal Difficulty, also included in the free update.</p>
<p>After that, Saber is committed to bringing more content to the game through 2025. This will include both free updates that add the Neo-Volkite pistol, more new PvE opeartions, PvP maps and modes, and a new Horde Mode in a later update. The Season Passes will then have more premium cosmetics to unlock for your Space Marines, so you can represent your favourite chapters.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">our Space Marine 2 review</a>, Dom said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

                <p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard PC specs have just been released, expanding on the information provided earlier this year. These expanded specs clarify what PC players will need to run the game with or without ray tracing. Additionally, the PC version will not include any third-party DRM.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-pc-specs-revealed/1100-6525873/" data-ref-id="1100-6525873">previously confirmed</a>, the minimum specs require an Intel Core I5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 3 3000X processor, an Nvidia GTX 970/1650 or AMD Radeon R9 290X GPU, and at least 16GB RAM. The Veilguard will take up 100GB of space. An HDD is supported on low settings, but an SDD is recommended.</p><p>To run the game on high, players will need an Intel Core i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processor and an Nvidia RTX 2070 or AMD Radeon RX 5700XT GPU. The GPU requirements jump significantly on ultra, which requires an Nvidia RTX 4080 or AMD RX 7900 XTX. Ray tracing needs at least 10GB of VRAM and otherwise similar specs to High or Ultra, depending on desired resolution.</p><p>BioWare confirmed that Dragon Age: The Veilguard will not use any 3rd-party DRM (such as Denuvo). That does mean that players can't pre-load the game on PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-lays-off-number-of-league-of-legends-developers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games, the developers of League of Legends, is laying off a number of developers at the company. The announcement came via a <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243708100091985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy article</a> posted by co-founder Marc Merrill.</p>



<p>The layoffs come as the company works to “make sure [Riot] can keep improving the League experience now and for the long-term.”</p>



<p>Merrillsays that the decision to make the cuts were “tough”, but it wasn’t about “reducing headcount to save money”.</p>



<p>“It’s about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond,” he said, also mentioning the company’s goal of solving challenges faster. </p>



<p>“While team effectiveness is more important than team size, the League team will eventually be even larger than it is today as we develop the next phase of League.”</p>



<p>He added that all employees being let go from the company will get a severance package that includes a minimum of six months’ pay, their annual bonus, job placement assistance, and health coverage.</p>



<p>“Thank you all for playing and for being part of the League community,” Merrill said to close his statement.</p>



<p>In total, 32 employees were let go from Riot Games. Of those 32, 28 were developers on League of Legends, according to a Riot spokesperson. Earlier this year, Riot Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-lays-off-530-people-and-ends-riot-forge/">laid off 530 employees</a>. </p>



<p>With Riot’s layoffs, the games industry has seen <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 13,100 known jobs</a> lost in 2024. Based on multiple sources, however, the real number is likely around 16,000 at this time.</p>

Today, Amazon is offering the PS5 compatible <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6b4YY?object_uuid=8d92521e-fbd4-405d-a6e2-a064f8cad3b5&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lexar NM790</a> 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 Solid State Drive (SSD) with pre-installed heatsink for only $128.99. This was one of the best SSD deals we saw during Amazon Prime Day. It expired quickly after, but available once again for a little while longer.</p><h2>Lexar NM790 2TB PS5 SSD for $128.99</h2><div catalogid="afd3830a-9c79-404d-8955-bea9002efa9c" id="192792"><div id="192792" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Lexar NM790 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Heatsink</h3></p></div><p>The PlayStation 5 console comes with a 1TB SSD, but 300GB of that is reserved for the OS, leaving around 700GB left over for games. That space will run out quickly because some games take up an enormous amount of space, especially if you buy digital copies. For example, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k25-review">NBA 2K25</a> all require 140GB each. Even older games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gran-turismo-7-review">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-review">Horizon Forbidden West</a> require 90GB of space apiece.</p><p>Enter the Lexar NM790 SSD. Although we didn't pick it as one of our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">favorite SSDs for the PlayStation 5</a>, Lexar is a well known and established flash memory brand and its SSD has garnered plenty of positive reviews. The NM790 is a guaranteed fit with any PlayStation 5 console. Performance-wise, it boasts read speeds of 7,400MB/s and write speeds of 6,500MB/s, which is well above Sony's minimum recommendation of 5,600MB/s.  It's also pre-equipped with a low-profile aluminum heatsink. The 2TB capacity triples the storage of a PS5 or doubles the storage of a PS5 Pro.</p><h2>Alternative: Silicon Power XS70 2TB PS5 SSD for $127.99</h2></div><div catalogid="93755942-ef91-4264-b643-301d1026fd11" id="199763"><div id="199763" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Silicon Power XS70 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Heatsink</h3></p></div><p>Amazon is offering <strong>Amazon Prime members</strong> this <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAV8yw?object_uuid=8d92521e-fbd4-405d-a6e2-a064f8cad3b5&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silicon Power XS70</a> 2TB PS5 SSD for $127.99 shipped. The primary difference is that the Lexar NM790 is a DRAM-less drive and the Silicon Power XS70 has a DRAM cache. Instead of onboard DRAM, the NM790 uses HMB (host memory buffer), which basically means that it uses the system memory as cache. The XS790, on the other hand, has a dedicated DRAM cache built into the stick. Theoretically, having a DRAM cache offers fast random write performance, but both types of SSDs are so fast that there really any noticeable performance difference when it comes to gaming on a PS5 or PC.</p><p>If you want more options, here's a list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-ssd-deals-for-2024">best PS5 SSD deals</a> available right now.

If you don't yet own a PS5 console, note that the new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> is currently up for preorder and ships out next month. This is a more powerful version of the PS5 with double the storage capacity at a significantly higher price.</p><p><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

In the run-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s launch next week, Activision has shared a whole bunch of details relating to the PC version, ranging from system specs (complete with a not-as-bad-as-it-could-have-been 102GB storage requirement) to pre-load and launch times.
</p>
<p>
As per Activision's <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pc-trailer-specs-preloading-intel">newly shared blog post</a>, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 comes with support for a range of PC-specific features. It's compatible with Ultrawide monitors, for instance, and supports AMD FSR 3.1, with the publisher also promising a "huge number of options across a variety of settings so players can dial in the best playing experience possible".
</p>
<p>
Spec-wise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is relatively modest in its demands, requiring an AMD Ryzen 51400/Intel Core i5-6600 CPU, Radeon RX 470/GeForce GTX 960/Intel Arc A580 GPU, plus 8GB RAM as a minimum. Activision's Recommended specs, meanwhile, seek a Ryzen 5 1600X/Intel Core i7-6700K CPU, plus a Radon RX 6600XT/GeForce GTX 1080Ti/RTX 3060 GPU, and 12GB RAM - all to get 60fps in "most situations" with everything set to high.

<p>
And as for players looking to go the Competitive/4K Ultra route, Activision suggest a Ryzen 7/Intel Core i7-8700K CPU, Radeon RX6800XT/GeForce RTX 3080/RTX 4070 GPU, plus 16GB RAM. And in all cases, you'll be needing an SSD with 102GB of available storage at launch - which is almost 50GB less than the space required by last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 on PC, but obviously expect that increase if you also want to install Call of Duty: Warzone.

<p>
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 6 launches for PC via Steam and Battle.net at 9pm on the 24th October in the US, which equates to 5am BST on 25th October in the UK. And there's the option to pre-load starting on 21st October if you've pre-ordered the game.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will, of course, also be available via PC Game Pass on day one, but for console players it requires an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.

We learn how she was forced into Arkham Asylum by her father after she questioned how her mother died, and was then repeatedly violated by the male doctor there and stripped of her rights until she did, in fact, go mad, and, how ten years later, after her release, she is still questioned and maligned by the men in the Falone crime family. But, like a chartreuse phoenix rising from the patriarchal ashes, Sofia gets hers by the end of “Cent’anni,” and we get <em>The Penguin</em>’s true protagonist. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“For 10 years men have lied to me. And then I come home and it’s all the same. They think I’m broken. I’m not broken. I’m not the one who’s sick. And neither are you. The world is,” Sofia tells Dr. Julian Rush (Theo Rossi), the assistant to the Arkham doctor who repeatedly subjected her to shock treatment despite her protestations, and who declared her unfit for trial, forcing her to stay there for a decade.<br></p><p>Sofia is the victim of men who built their empires using violence and coercion—we learn in this episode that her father, Carmine Falcone, not only strangled her mother but several other women who he employed. When Sofia questioned him, he told her she was not herself and got her involuntarily committed to Akrham. These kinds of men are terrified of losing their power, and someone as capable as Sofia is a threat—but her womanhood makes her an easy target.<br></p><p>Sofia’s time in Arkham is painful and horrifying to watch. We see an innocent woman thrown into an asylum for daring to question a man and are forced to watch as that system breaks her down until she is no longer a person, but a feral thing. Her perfectly manicured nails become filthy, ragged claws. Her styled hair becomes wild and knotted, her pristine skin marred by redness and bruises from the electroshock therapy. By the time she takes her neighbor’s head and repeatedly smashes it onto a cafeteria table until she’s dead (RIP Magpie), we know that this place and the men who put her there effectively killed Sofia Falcone.</p><p>Milioti gives an award-worthy performance, deconstructing the character until she is as untrusting and sharp as an alley cat. You are angry for her, and in turn, for any woman who has been wrongfully accused or armchair psychoanalyzed. You want her to win. </p><p>And win she does. After the episode’s lengthy flashback, Sofia attends what is meant to be her last family dinner. After all, she’s been told by the men that she has to get on a flight to Sicily or else risk certain death, since she’s become, in their eyes, too much of a liability for la famiglia. Clad in a plunging chartreuse silk gown, she holds dominion over the family dinner for an excruciating speech, before toasting to new beginnings.<br></p><p>She leads her cousin’s young daughter to the greenhouse to spend the night, her beautiful gown trailing behind her as she walks. She awakens next to her in the morning, the orangey glow of the sunrise highlighting her profile as she sits up. Making her way back into the Falcone mansion, the young girl’s pink backpack in hand and no shoes on her feet, she pauses in the doorway to put on a gas mask. And then, like the silent killer gas can be, Sofia tiptoes, dances, and prances through the mansion, opening doors and windows with glee to let the sunlight in. Shining through her dress, it reveals the curves of her body as she moves like a jungle cat through the sprawling mansion, in which each and every Falcone family member is now dead.<br></p><p>In the last room, she takes a handgun off the end table and wakes up Johnny Vitti, the right hand man who she’s chosen to let live through the night. “Put your pants on Johnny, we have to talk,” she snaps with her New York Italian accent. Mamma mia, I’m in love. Talk about gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss, am I right?</p><p>The next episode of <em>The Penguin</em> airs on HBO Max on October 20 at 9 p.m. ET. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will have hands-on previews at the end of this month.</p>



<p>As part of these previews, Microsoft and Bethesda are hosting several media events this week for content creators and the media worldwide.</p>



<p>One content creator has not-so-subtly hinted that he’s traveling to such an event to play Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at one of the events on social media. “Hopefully learning whip skills and wearing a cool leather jacket,” he said when asked what he was doing in San Francisco.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch on December 9, 2024, on the Xbox Series S|X and on PC. The game has also been announced for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 in early 2025</a>. According to rumours, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early 2025 release date is currently targeted for April</a>, giving the Xbox platform and PC four months of exclusivity. </p>



<p>Indiana Jones creative director Axel Torvenius said in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-developers-thrilled-game-is-coming-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview earlier this year</a>, “From MachineGames’ point of view, we are super thrilled and excited over the fact we will be able to be on PlayStation next year as well.” </p>

NISA confirmed the news today, along with releasing a brand new trailer for the game.

<p>For The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II both Agnes Claudel and Van Arkride return as the main characters, with the game location remaining as the Claudel Republic. The description for The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II says,&nbsp;<em>“One day, a shocking series of murders set the wheels of fate into motion once again.

Time may be the only key to unlocking the secrets lurking beneath the shadows… “</em></p>

<p>In our review for The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, Miguel said, <em>“The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak is the spark that this series needed, and an incredible new chapter for such an iconic franchise. The shift in tone for the story and the addictive dual-mode combat had me hooked from beginning to end. If you play any game in this series, make it this one.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-zorba-boss-how-to-beat-1851672980<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In retrospect, it is a little weird how that otherwise ridiculously generous multi-hour demo for <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> just kinda decided, “You’ve had enough,” after a random boss in Regalith Grand Cathedral. Over a million people have since told Atlus, “<em>We’ll</em> tell <em>you</em> when we’ve had enough,” and bit the bullet on the full game. That’s excellent news for us JRPG sickos, but that demo might give you delusions that all the bosses are just random collections of minions. That is quickly dispelled when you hit the game’s first <em>real </em>challenge.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Zorba—looking like one of the sexiest goths ever drawn, and sounding like Drew McIntyre—is waiting at the top of the Cathedral, and he’s brought a whole lotta dead guys with him, who hit harder than you think. But remain calm. Zorba ain’t a huge deal, so much as a place to practice good synergy. We’ll show you how to take him down.<br></p><h2 id="h2312"><a id=""></a><strong>Zorba’s abilities</strong></h2><p>You gotta admire a man with a plan. Zorba’s first move, every time, will be Corpse Puppetry, where he raises a Corpsethrall out of the ground. His second move? Raising another Corpsethrall. If you kill one of the Corpsethrall, guess what his next move’s gonna be? You got it. If you’re a Corpsethrall fan, you’ve come to the right place.</p><p>Once he’s got two corpses up, though, his next move will be setting his new rotten buddies up for success with Madness Curse. That inflicts them with Rage, meaning when the corpses hit you, they will hit HARD. If both enraged corpses are still up and shambling while he’s got turns left, then finally Zorba will get down to the business of dealing with you personally, by tossing some magic your way, usually either Mudoon (darkness), Kandera (lightning), or Bondage Curse, which hits one of your party with Paralysis.</p><h2 id="h2313"><a id=""></a><strong>Recommended Archetypes</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-recommend-id="image://fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zorba in front of some spectacular sky action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zorba in front of some spectacular sky action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-recommend-id="image://fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zorba in front of some spectacular sky action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your pointman on this one is the Warrior. All of its Slash moves do decent damage to Zorba and the Corpsethralls—a killer name for a band, I might add. If you can get Fire magic equipped—either through Inheritance, or with an Igniter—even better, since Zorba’s corpse friends don’t much care for being set on fire, and they’ll take a big chunk of damage.</p><p>Your second-in-command here is gonna be the Healer. The healing is certainly a big help, but on top of that is the fact that the Healer can cast Hama (Light magic), which the corpses are also weak to. Hama is also one of the only magic spells that can damage Zorba in a pinch, which is nice.</p><p>Lastly, bring a Knight. That’s primarily because you want the Knight’s Synthesis move with the Warrior: Jump Thrust. That move lays the hardest smackdown on Zorba in general, but it also lowers Zorba’s defense, which will make this whole thing go by even faster. The Knight also provides insurance against your biggest weakness in the fight once there are corpses around, which is that the Healer’s weak to Strikes, which the Corpsethralls will use all the damn time. Using Knight’s Proclamation to draw aggro will be the only way to keep their filthy hands off you. The Knight will take hefty damage that turn. Good thing you’ve got a healer then, eh?</p><h2 id="h2314"><a id=""></a><strong>Defeating Zorba</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-recommend-id="image://1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle with Zorba." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The battle with Zorba." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-recommend-id="image://1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle with Zorba." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When the fight starts, you’ve got a free set of turns to do some damage to Zorba. Your Healer can let loose with Hama, your Warrior can use Slicer, but whatever you do, when you get down to two turn icons left, pass your turn over to your Knight and use Jump Thrust. That’ll start this fight off with Zorba in a bad way.</p><p>When it’s his turn, of course, he’ll raise his first corpse. By and large, that first phase is the general template for this whole fight. That is, you’ll want to do as much raw damage as humanly possible to the corpses, until you hit two turn icons, then hit Zorba with a Jump Thrust. The corpses being weak to Fire and Light magic means you’ll easily get three or four big hits in before that point.</p></div><p>If you did a little extra grinding before you got to this point, you might just be dangerous enough where you can take down a Corpsethrall in one go, and in which case, if you’ve brought down Zorba’s defense more than once, the Warrior’s Slicer does absolutely brutal damage to that poor, pretty bastard. But if you’re just going about your merry way through the game, chances are good you’ll end the turn with the corpse low on health but still standing. Zorba will use his time to raise another corpse, but the remaining corpse will lash out at one of your crew for a bit of damage. Let him have a free one, it’ll be his last. Even if he hits your Healer, Zorba won’t have enough of a turn left to do anything worrisome.</p><p>Obviously, start Round 2 by taking out that first corpse, then focus on the second. If you decide to get fancy, you can use the Warrior’s Round Slash to hit all three targets at once, though it’s a bit pricey on the turn icons and MP. Use discretion. Lather, rinse, repeat. Main thing is that somewhere in this cycle of violence, you’re gonna have to sacrifice your Healer’s turn to actually heal, especially if you’re unlucky enough where one of your attacks is a miss. If you’re ever going to end a turn with two corpses standing, especially if Zorba gets to cast Madness Curse, it’s time to let the Knight do their duty for God and country. Make sure the Knight gets the last turn, use Knight’s Proclamation to eat the incoming attacks, and have your Healer recover them after.</p><p>The tl;dr with all of this is to keep Zorba so busy spawning new corpses that he doesn’t have time for anything else. That means a strong focus on getting at least one corpse out of the picture at all times. Shit does happen, however, and you need to brace yourself if you get well and truly unlucky. If you have a choice between letting the Healer do damage or topping off your team’s health, choose the health, unless Zorba’s down to the last sliver. Still, if everything goes smoothly—and 90 percent of the time, it will with this plan—it doesn’t take more than five or six goes around to take Zorba down for good, liberate the Cathedral, and hear Hulkenberg walk Zorba down with some of that, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7-roiI5Vqc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7-roiI5Vqc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You have offended my family and the Shaolin temple</a></span>” good stuff.

Commonly compared to Monopoly, Talisman features an easy to learn and basic gameplay loop that makes it a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">great board game for beginners</a>, despite its extremely randomized outcomes, hectic situations, and often longer-than-average play times. </p><p>Players choose from over 12 characters, all of which are classic fantasy classes, like the Wizard and Thief, and then the game begins. In it, two to six players battle it out to be the first to reach the Crown of Command in the center of the board and defeat the dragon, venturing through three main sections of the board: the outer, middle, and inner. </p><p>Throughout the game, you’ll have the opportunity to use over 100 different Adventure, Spell, or Talisman cards to gain the upper hand or screw with your opponents. You might even be able to turn one of them into a toad. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p>The entire history of Talisman is vast and has many out-of-print versions and expansions, so this guide will focus solely on expansions and spin-offs that are more easily accessible. </p><p id="talisman-base-game"><h2 data-toc-title="Talisman base game">The Base Game</h2></p><h3>Talisman: The Magical Quest Board Game 5th Edition</h3><div catalogid="fde15d86-9341-45d3-84d5-660752d11d57" id="207849"><div id="207849" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Talisman: The Magical Quest Board Game 5th Edition</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: $59.99</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-6 players</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 60-90 minutes</li></ul><p>Released in July 2024, the 5th Edition of the decades-spanning fantasy board game is the latest and most up-to-date version available. With the game’s rich history, it’s easy to get confused on which versions to pick up – don’t look on eBay, as 4th Editions can go for almost $150! Instead, pick up the 5th Edition, which offers the base game as well as the gameplay mechanic changes first introduced in the 3rd Edition. Additionally, compared to the 4th Edition, the newest edition of Talisman is a more streamlined, slightly less chaotic experience; the 5th Edition rulebook even mentions explicit changes with a symbol next to the rules blurbs. This version also comes with two fewer characters; it cuts the Bard and Druid. </p></div><p id="talisman-expansions"><h2 data-toc-title="Talisman expansions">Talisman Expansions</h2></p><p>A very notable bummer is that the 5th Edition is not backwards compatible with the extensive library of 4th Edition expansions.

Each of the five lost Talismans is recovered in their own unique adventures, and can be replayed as many times as possible to get the full experience.

The 40th Anniversary Collection includes all 13 of the 4th Edition expansions, from Blood Moon to the Nether Realm. The PS4 and PC versions include extra characters not available on Switch. Notably, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/91b1Eq?object_uuid=4cd575cf-51aa-433b-a553-0fa8bb8df978&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>physical versions</u></a> on PS4 and Nintendo Switch are not region-locked, but the expansions are.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Talisman is undeniably one of the most popular fantasy board games of our time, with a rich history of expansions and revisions spanning over 40 years. The streamlined ruleset of the 5th Edition makes learning it for the first time a breeze, and the updated fantasy art is worth the upgrade. And while many of the 4th Edition expansions are out of print and are either hard to find or expensive on the secondary market, the 5th Edition of the base game marks a perfect jumping on point for newcomers or those looking for a more laid back experience. The Talisman Adventures series of RPGs is a worthy, barebones competitor to DnD, and is  great for budding DMs and players of all ages looking into trying out their first RPG.</p><p><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance commerce writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-does-not-include-any-3rd-party-drm-including-denuvo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> does not have third-party DRM of any kind, including Denuvo, Bioware has announced.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/specifications-spotlight?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, the EA-owned studio said its upcoming fantasy role-playing game lacks digital rights management (DRM) on any platform, which is sure to go down well with PC gamers.</p><p>But the lack of DRM has the knock-on effect of preventing Bioware from offering a preload period for PC players. Instead, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be downloadable and playable on launch day, 9am Pacific / 12noon Eastern / 5pm UK on October 31 on PC.</p><p>There <em>is</em> a preload period on console, however: Xbox Series X and S preload is already available, with PlayStation 5 preload going live at 9am Pacific / 12noon Eastern / 5pm UK on October 29.</p><p>Denuvo is a controversial system used by video game developers and publishers to stem the tide of video game piracy by, they hope, pushing back the release of cracked versions of their games by sometimes weeks, maybe months, and in some cases, indefinitely. From a publisher perspective, Denuvo helps to prevent lost sales and revenue it might have received if those who pirate a video game at launch would have otherwise bought it.</p><p>However, Denuvo is often criticized by PC gamers for potentially affecting video game performance and even reducing the life-span of solid-state drives (SSDs). Denuvo has repeatedly denied the claims. In 2021, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-cracked-performance-beats-official-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> found the pirate version of Resident Evil Village actually improved performance. Capcom later patched the game.</p><p>BioWare has been on something of a charm offensive with PC gamers for the next Dragon Age. In July, it announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-steam-native-so-you-dont-need-the-ea-app-to-play-the-game-on-pc"><u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u> is “Steam native,”</a> which means the EA App is not required to play the game on Valve’s platform. Most EA-published video games <em>do</em> require the EA App, which replaced Origin in 2022, to play on Steam, much to the annoyance of many PC gamers.</p><p>This week, IGN reported on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-look-at-the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trophy-achievement-list-if-you-want-to-avoid-spoilers">Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s Trophy / Achievement list</a> hitting the internet (beware of spoilers!). Earlier this month <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-doesnt-have-an-arachnophobia-mode-because-its-the-first-game-in-the-series-without-spiders"><u>BioWare confirmed Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the first game in the fantasy action role-playing game series not to feature spiders</u></a>.</p><p>IGN has plenty more on Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade"><u>a deep-dive into its development</u></a>, which is well worth a read if you want to know more about how BioWare realized the game.

<p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140808/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>, one of those activities that will be improved is the seasonal Realmwalkers. Currently, they lumber about and slowly spawn enemies. When enough are defeated, the Realmwalker can be slain, after which a portal to the "Seething Realm" is opened where players can gain even more rewards. Come update 2.0.3, the Realmwalkers will be receiving a significant speed buff, and they'll spawn more enemies more quickly. Realmwalkers will additionally have a chance to spawn a Treasure Goblin, and Blizzard notes that other "miscellaneous changes" have been made to make the event progress faster overall. Speeding up the Realmwalkers should mean players get to the Seething Realm, where the meat of the event is, more quickly than before.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kurast Undercity will become more lucrative as well. Blizzard notes that more items will drop from successful runs, with at least one guaranteed Legendary item. The amount of gold dropped in the dungeon will also be doubled. Enemies within the Kurast Undercity have had their health and affixes brought closer in line to that of the game's other dungeons, and the mode's timer--as well as the amount of bonus time earned from slaying elite enemies--will be increased.</p><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of other changes coming in update 2.0.3, including a bug fix that may affect one of the game's more popular Spiritborn builds. The "Evade" build for the new Spiritborn class sees players constantly dodge-rolling using the Evade button, during which they send out huge volleys of feathers that fill the screen and decimate enemies. It turns out players were faster and using it more often than was intended, as a bug for Spiritborn allowed the class to cancel its evade animation mid-Evade. That bug will be fixed in the next update. The fix may slow down the Evade build somewhat but it will likely still be incredibly strong.</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes coming in the update include buffs to a number of Mythic Uniques, a fix for players who didn't receive their Resplendent Spark for defeating the Echo of Lilith, the reimplementation of a number of items that were disabled for the expansion's launch, a mount trophy for reaching Paragon 300. Additionally, tooltips for Masterworking, Runewords, and various crafting materials will be updated for "improved readability."</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review-piercing-the-veil/1900-6418298/" data-ref-id="1900-6418298">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred review</a>, writer Alessandro Barbosa said the expansion serves as "a great reentry point for lapsed Diablo 4 players," one that delivers on making the game "feel fresh again."</p>
