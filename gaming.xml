            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,600 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released the gameplay trailer, latest information, and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Street Fighter 6 [48 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a></em> downloadable content character Sagat, who is due out on August 5. <span id="more-978711"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>As the final boss in the original <em>Street Fighter</em> game, veterans and newcomers will be eager to reign supreme as the fearsome Sagat in <em>Street Fighter 6</em>. Sagat’s moveset is inspired by Muay Thai, a martial art and combat sport originating from Thailand, combined with uppercuts, knees, and an added twist… fireballs! Under Sagat’s rule, a new stage called Proud Spire will be released as well, featuring a calming temple and a peaceful Buddha statue in the background.</p><p>Sagat’s regalia includes two Outfits—Outfit 1 is a newer look featuring a darker Muay Thai-inspired theme, while Outfit 2 is an ode to his <em>Street Fighter II</em> appearance where he dons Muay Thai shorts, plus hand and foot wraps which is common for many Muay Thai practitioners. Outfit 2 can be earned in World Tour by maxing out your bond with Sagat or purchased via Fighter Coins.</p><p>Year 3 Ultimate Pass and Year 3 Character Pass—both of which will unlock Sagat, the three remaining Year 3 characters, including C. Viper, Alex, and Ingrid, plus new Outfit colors and Drive Tickets—are available now for purchase across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, with both passes available for pre-order on Nintendo Switch 2. Content included in the pass will unlock starting when Sagat releases on August 5, 2025.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_978809"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As displayed in the latest trailer, Sagat’s Muay Thai moveset focuses on crushing, hard-hitting blows courtesy of his big frame that also gives him solid kicks with notable physical range, including:</p><ul><li><strong>High Tiger Shot</strong> – Fire a ki blast forward to hit standing opponents, with the blast fired at different speeds depending on the button being pressed.</li><li><strong>Low Tiger Shot</strong> – Fire a ki blast forward that can hit crouching opponents. Use both fireballs to keep opponents guessing!</li><li><strong>Tiger Uppercut</strong> – A powerful anti-air attack which the heavy version can be held down to send opponents flying.</li><li><strong>Tiger Knee Crush</strong> – Leap forward and catch opponents off guard with a powerful knee attack.</li><li><strong>Tiger Nexus</strong> – A brand new special move where Sagat strikes with his knee and can then be followed up with three different kicks—Mighty Tiger, Greedy Tiger, or Nova Tiger.</li><li><strong>Tiger Cannon</strong> – Sagat’s Level 1 Super Art, where he fires a mighty Tiger Shot.<ul><li><strong>Savage Tiger</strong> – Sagat’s Level 2 Super Art, where after Sagat leaps forward, this Super Art can be followed up with four moves.</li><li><strong>Savage Tiger Raid</strong> – The highest damage of all the options.</li><li><strong>Savage Tiger Zenith</strong> – Launches the opponent in the air and can be followed up with more attacks.</li><li><strong>Savage Tiger Pendulum</strong> – Allows Sagat to switch places with his opponent.</li><li><strong>Savage Tiger Stomp</strong> – Leaves Sagat close to the enemy, allowing for better “oki.”</li></ul></li><li><strong>Tiger Vanquisher</strong> – Sagat’s Level 3 Super Art unleashes all of his power in a series of devastating kicks and a beastly uppercut.</li></ul><p>Additional <em>Street Fighter 6</em> Updates:</p><ul><li><strong>Sagat Playable at EVO 2025</strong> – Before launch, fans have the opportunity to become one of the first to go hands-on with Sagat on the show floor at EVO 2025 in Las Vegas from August 1 to 3 at the Capcom booth, with more details to follow!</li><li><strong>Hot Fighter Summer Fits</strong> – Dropping alongside Sagat are Outfit 4 swimsuits for seven characters, including Cammy, Luke, Chun-Li, Manon, Jamie, Kimberly, and A.K.I.! Stay tuned for more Outfit 4 news soon!</li><li><strong>“Coming up, better think fast” with the æspa Collaboration</strong> – As a reminder, players still have the chance to acquire Juri’s Outfit 4, inspired by the collaboration with the global phenom K-pop group æspa. Additionally, nævis is now a Real-Time Commentator and can be used for battles!

On Arrakis, that’s true. Between the sandworms and the other deadly players, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone or anything friendly. Even worse, your only haven—the base you build—isn’t free or safe. You owe money to the local government for plopping down a few foundations and creating a habitat. If you don’t pay, oh, they’ll take it from you by force, by god. Here’s everything to know about paying your taxes in <em>Dune Awakening</em> to avoid the Imperial government’s wrath!

The port will launch on July 17, but this early footage may be running the 2.3 update already, because fans have taken note of what might be an autopilot icon when V gets behind the wheel. <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </em>had a similar function when you rode your horse, allowing you to trot along to your destination without having to move your character yourself. If <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> got a similar feature, it would actually be a genuine improvement to the game because its cars handle like they’re hydroplaning. Motorcycles run well enough, though. However, sometimes the plot requires you to drive a car for races and high-speed chases, and that shit <em>sucked</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced that pre-orders are live for their latest starter set. The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set is their largest set to date, packed with everything a new play group needs. It is also their priciest.</p>



<p>In the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set, players will get everything they need to start playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> right out of the box. This includes physical maps, class boards, monster cards and spell cards for quick referencing, NPC cards for the DM, tokens, and dice. This is the first starter set featuring the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em></a> ruleset.</p>

This includes creating memorable characters, navigating D&amp;D's various settings, progressing through epic quests, fighting monsters, and more. Lastly, the set contains three booklets. Each booklet will contain a quick, hour-long adventure. No prior experience needed.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set is an update on one of the oldest, most enduring modules in the game's history. It is based on <em>The Keep on the Borderlands</em>, written by Gary Gygax and published in 1979. It was also designed to introduce new players to the game, packed full of rules and sage advice.</p>

<p>This adventure has a special place in the game's history. It has been reprinted several times throughout various editions of the game. It's even been reprinted by OSR-focused developer Goodman Games under the title <em>Into The Borderlands</em>, which contained scans of the original adventure, a <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> conversion, and testimonials from various designers and players.</p>

<p>Notably, the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set is the most expensive starter set to date. On D&amp;D Beyond, a physical copy of the set is $49.99. A digital copy on the platform is $14.99. And there is the Ultimate bundle, which gives you access to both at $54.99. The starter set will release September 16.</p>

I then realized that I had likely done the same a few months ago, probably under some frantic attempt to make room on my ever-overflowing storage devices, during which I thought, “When the hell am I gonna sift through hours of <em>Starfield</em> footage?” But after learning the only other copies of these videos were trashed, and realizing I completely misplaced and lost the game’s photo mode folder, a rather strange quote sprang to mind from Bethesda’s managing director, Ashley Cheng, addressing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-steam-reviews-bethesda-1851052929&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-steam-reviews-bethesda-1851052929">early concerns that <em>Starfield</em></a></span> was bland:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“When the astronauts went to the moon, there was nothing there.

Hell, in the vast travels I took across the states, Canada, and a sliver of the UK in my 20s, I took tons of videos and photos that I haven’t looked at in many years, but I’d be really upset if I found they were just suddenly <em>gone</em>. In fact, I still think about things I saw that I regret not taking a picture of nearly a decade later.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em>: The <em>Kotaku </em>Review</a></span></p><p>It all brings to mind so much of the work Bethesda and Microsoft were doing in telling us this game was something special, instead of ever really showing it to us in the form of a compelling game.

There are many video games that capture this spirit of stillness, of just being in awe of a visual spectacle that communicates a sense of place. But <em>Starfield</em>’s overabundance has failed to be one of them. Despite some fleetingly beautiful moments across its many worlds, not a single one of them felt precious enough for me to feel bad about losing the archival footage.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/starfield-exploration-astronauts-moon-boring-1851786351]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-falling-asleep-to-let%E2%80%99s-plays-medically-approved-gamer-melatonin-or-nah.1244448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For about seven years now, the only way I’ve been able to lull myself to sleep is by watching YouTube Let’s Plays. This isn’t a jab at YouTube gamers being boring. As a kid, I would routinely fall asleep to the smooth voice of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpovAmh0blw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA commentator Michael Breen</a>, and this is a similar vibe. It’s comfy shit.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not the only person who uses this very millennial sleep method. There are countless YouTube channels with thousands of subscribers who make content to fall asleep to. And there are plenty of Reddit threads asking for content creators with a chill vibe and a comforting voice, or if there are good playlists to fall asleep to.</p><p>However, there’s always been this nagging question in my mind over whether my self-made, undiagnosed insomnia remedy is just new-age snake oil or if there’s some actual medical benefit to falling asleep to video game commentary. So I decided to ask a sleep expert about it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Ghost in the Shell<span></span><span>Production I.G</span></figcaption></figure><p>A week ago, I sent out a broad message to neurologists in Chicago. Neurologists are medical professionals who specialize in diagnosing and treating disorders of the nervous system. A key part of their work involves brain activity and sleep. After reaching out across the Chicagoland area, I connected with <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/kenneth-lee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kenneth Lee</a>, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago and the medical and clinical director at the University of Chicago Sleep Center.&nbsp;</p><p>Lee was quite excited to talk with me because he is a gamer himself. Among his colleagues at UIC, Northwestern, and Loyola, he’s the only gaming professional in the field. (Nice). He provided his gamer credentials, saying that he’s been a gamer his entire life, owns a gaming PC, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and mainly plays a lot of <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Vampire</em> <em>Survivors</em>, and <em>Skate 3</em>, along with RPGs like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> whenever he isn’t playing <em>Mario Kart</em> <em>World</em> with his boys. In short, I wasn’t speaking gibberish when I asked him about Let’s Plays to fall asleep to from a medical standpoint.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a career where patients of all age groups approach him with questions about sleep problems, Lee told me that falling asleep to Let’s Plays isn’t new territory for him.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is a phenomenon that we have noticed. It's not exclusive to just Let's Plays. We oftentimes see this just with people being in bed on TikTok. And then, in the older populations, it's like needing the TV on to go to sleep,” Lee said. “Let's Plays is almost kind of an extension of that behavior in the past. I see that as the Gen Z version, so to speak. But I think that the premise is very similar to what a lot of people have done throughout the ages.”</p><figure><figcaption>Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door<span></span><span>Bones</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Lee admits it's hard to measure, sleep studies haven’t previously determined how many people identify with the Let's Play community for sleep. He notes that a significant number use “some sort of device” as a distraction or noise to help them fall asleep. Lee estimates this accounts for about 20 to 30 percent of the population. However, as the saying goes, just because many people do something doesn’t mean it's beneficial. Regarding whether Let’s Plays help or hinder the process of falling asleep, from a neurological perspective, the answer varies. But Lee did explain the medical science behind what this process has done for people like me as a solution to insomnia.&nbsp;</p><p>“What it really does is that [Let’s Plays] kind of help relax the brain,” Lee said. “It's kind of like your winding down process, essentially, in terms of just kind of your relaxation state.”</p><p>In neurology, Lee says he and his colleagues emphasize to their patients struggling with insomnia that having a routine is important. One suggestion is to set aside a worry time before you go to sleep—maybe two to three hours beforehand, during which you take stock of or inventory the things you need to do or what's worrying you. That way, when the time comes to greet Mr. Sandman, you can dedicate the last hour of worry time to relaxing. Or, in anime speak, Nazuna Nanakuza in <em>Call of the Night</em> saying, “Stay up until you feel satisfied about your day.”</p><figure><figcaption>Call of the Night <span></span><span>Lidenfilms</span></figcaption></figure><p>“These Let's Plays and so forth, really can be an extension of that—[doing] this kind of routine,” Lee said. “The other thing that it does is it gives you something to focus on, to some extent, which can also help relax things, focus in terms of shutting things down.”</p><p>Another aspect of falling asleep to Let’s Plays, which Lee mentioned as a tip for people seeking a good routine, is practicing what’s called sleep hygiene. This essentially means ensuring your environment is as conducive to sleep as possible, such as by making sure your bed is optimized for you to fall asleep.</p><figure><figcaption>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End<span></span><span>Madhouse </span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking anecdotally, my sleeping environment over the past decade has involved cozying up on my Casper mattress and memory foam pillow, putting on my Bose headphones, queueing up hours-long Let’s Plays, and drifting off. A problem with this, however, is that it isn’t good sleep hygiene, because I’m trying to fall asleep to a screen emitting bright light. Lee said he recommends patients try to avoid screens. Although he concedes that his refrain is a boilerplate medical statement, he does acknowledge that for some people, allotting some screen light in their sleep routine can be helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>While in the past, I would turn to YouTube playlists from creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGQkbwm0yHk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Best Friends Play</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-QgmqAlQTgwWi5Jr3sB0d6oRcgWjNaLU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snapcube’s Real-Time Fan Dub</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6EC7B047181AD013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Four Star’s Dragon Ball Z Abridged Series</a> to listen to and fall asleep, I encountered the screen issue Lee mentioned when trying to reset my circadian rhythm: all the flashing lights would wake me up. It wasn’t until I grew tired of modifying familiar comfort playlists by keeping my laptop lid almost closed or flipping over my dimmed phone and started exploring videos specifically made for sleep that I saw a noticeable difference in my sleep quality.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Oneyplays Fall Asleep to Zach (Part 16) [Fan Edit]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PikjT7IJ2qc?start=14434&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>One of the channels I frequent, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SleepyTimeEdits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SleepyTime Edits</a>, which posts <a href="https://youtu.be/PikjT7IJ2qc?si=b1iRjJit3RbruHWr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos of 10+ hours of Oneyplays</a>, sets its videos to a dim, still image, creating a calmer visual ambiance. This transforms video game compilations into a podcast-like experience, as well as providing me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGoLnyMHnD4&amp;t=664s&amp;pp=ygUac21pbGluZyBmcmllbmRzIGFkdWx0IHN3aW0%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Smiling Friends</em></a>-adjacent content to laugh myself to sleep to.&nbsp;</p><p>In describing SleepyTime Edits’ makeshift solution to Lee—asking whether this kind of media engagement supported or interfered with the brain’s transition into sleep—he said that it’s “a bit of a double-edged sword.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Say that you're watching a Let's Play that is super intense, like an EVO event or something that you're really into, that's not the best thing that's going to help you quiet your brain. If it's more relaxing, that can calm your mind down. Even if it's something you’ve seen, like a Let's Play that [you’ve] watched before,” Lee said.</p><figure><figcaption>Neon Genesis Evangelion<span></span><span>Gainax</span></figcaption></figure><p>He continued, “You do have to be careful about things such as light. I recommend to my patients that you use a dimmer setting— a lot of devices now have blue light settings. But really, I also recommend a light setting itself, because a lot of bright light can interfere with your sleep onset, and dim lights as well. It really varies. But it can be paradoxical in that it can be relaxing, but it can also be activating, too.”</p><p>Regarding whether there are any medically recognized videos to help with insomnia, Lee mentioned a treatment he and his colleagues use called <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/conditions-services/psychiatry-and-psychology/cognitive-behavioral-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="CBT for Insomnia" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oYnudJrod8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“The way I like to think of this is retraining your brain how to sleep. What happens with more chronic insomnia—insomnia that's been there for several months—is that your brain loses the ability of how to sleep,” Lee said. “What [cognitive behavioral therapy] does is help guide you with meditation techniques&nbsp; [and], a lot of times, things that can help, like white noise.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lee said that much of the CBT video content is easily accessible on YouTube, featuring videos that demonstrate breathing and progressive muscle relaxation techniques to help calm the mind and promote sleep. This can be especially helpful when finances are tight and people can’t afford a sleep prescription from a doctor or sleep expert. One point Lee emphasized was the University of Chicago business center's insomnia treatment, <a href="https://www.drlullaby.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DrLullaby</a>. During this virtual session, patients, guided by a sleep-trained clinical psychologist, work together to find ways to improve their nighttime sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Lee acknowledged that using Let’s Plays to sleep shares a similar functional approach to cognitive behavioral therapy as a layman’s solution to insomnia-focused sleep medicine, he also issued a warning for individuals who find it helpful in falling asleep or relaxing.</p><p>“During the nighttime, things like noises, even though they’re low-lights and so forth, something flashing can actually disrupt your sleep,” Lee said. “Try to recognize that as well, and try to limit the stimuli that’s around you.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Game Grumps MEGA COMPILATION !!! 8+ HOURS - Sleep Aid - Best of 2021" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mS1tzv_rJYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Which naturally leads into the next reason not to fall asleep to Let’s Plays: random loud noises. When I first reached out to Lee to start that conversation and sighed with relief at my mention of the Game Grumps not making him burst into dust, he noted that LPers you find comfort listening to, while adding to the soothing process of falling asleep, can just as easily break your rhythm if they’re prone to having a shouting match in the middle of playing.&nbsp;</p><p>“Everybody's a little bit different. Some people are going to be more susceptible when you're watching a Game Grumps Let's Play if somebody yells or shouts out something,” Lee said, adding that folks do run that risk of having their sleep cycle interrupted.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to whether Lee considers Let’s Plays a medically sound way to fall asleep or a workaround with its own risks, he says he’s somewhere in the middle.&nbsp;</p><p>“It can be helpful if that's part of your routine to relax and help make it so that you know your mind and your body are in a place that can easily fall asleep. I think that it can be helpful,” Lee said. “I don't think that there's been any evidence to suggest specifically Let's Plays and so forth, or any studies, which would be an interesting area to explore.”&nbsp;</p><p>“That being said, [Let’s Plays] can also backfire on you so you have to be cautious with that. It could backfire for a single night, where, say, you have a Game Grumps Let's Play and then they start screaming [and] that wakes you up, and now you have trouble falling back asleep. And then it could potentially develop into more of a chronic insomnia, where it helps you kind of acutely, but then, over time, because of those things, you're actually developing more problems. That's where it is a little bit of a double-edged sword, and you do have to be cautious taking a stock of your own individualized approach to it.”</p><figure><figcaption>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners <span></span><span>Trigger </span></figcaption></figure><p>I, ever the rebel, have ignored the warning signs because they've also led to a fun result in my sleep, where whatever Dan and Arin are babbling about ends up influencing my dreams. This creates a pretty fun <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BdhmLanXjU&amp;pp=ygUpZ2FtZSBncnVtcHMgdG8gZmFsbCBhc2xlZXAgdG8gcGFwZXIgbWFyaW8%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mystery box </a>phenomenon every night, where I look forward to seeing how these videos influence my otherwise dreamless sleep. When asked whether there is an explanation for how sleeping with Let’s Play channels ends up scripting my dreams, Lee says medical science has yet to fully explain that phenomenon.&nbsp;</p><p>“I wish we knew more about that or why that happens, but there's so much about the subconscious that we just don't know. As you're going into transition sleep, or even just when you're going into sleep, your brain is not shut off to what's around you. If you think about just kind of why we have that evolutionarily, if there's a threat, you wake up. So you're still absorbing things, you're just not recognizing it. How the subconscious kind of interprets that into dreams, that's a great question. And one I don't really have an answer for, but it has been explored throughout the ages,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>While Lee couldn’t provide an explanation for why Let’s Plays might influence sleep or if they are similar to brain dances in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, he did give a polite send-off to people like myself who use Let’s Plays to fall asleep. It’s the most courteous way a medical professional can suggest to a gamer to touch grass while counting virtual sheep.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you are using Let’s Plays, we recommend that the bed should only be used for sleep and intimacy,” Lee said. “So trying to do those things outside of bed and then, when you're feeling tired, going to bed, is the best approach.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime"><h3>Pretty Girl Horse Racing Game ‘Uma Musume’ Is Engrossing And Weird As Hell</h3></a><p>Breed horse girls to create even better horse girls, so that they can achieve their dream of winning races and performing a concert literally right after</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza"><h3>Why Disability Journalism In Games Needs To Evolve Beyond Marketing</h3></a><p>"We’ve conditioned ourselves to believe that we’re all one big happy family"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Xbox developer Rare, which today is best known for Sea of Thieves, has commented on the recent mass layoffs at Microsoft that led to the cancellation of the studio's long-in-development project Everwild.</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCzbo9xxo4Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves developer update video for July</a>, Rare production director Drew Stevens started off by addressing the layoffs. "It would be strange to jump straight into our usual updates without acknowledging the news that we've ended development on Everwild here at Rare," Stevens said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/another-xbox-studio-reacts-to-the-layoffs-exploding-around-it-with-rares-everwild-dead-sea-of-thieves-dev-says-its-impossible-for-something-like-this-not-to-ripple-through-the-studio/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>The game was formally revealed all the way back in November 2019, but beyond a trailer for it in 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-was-missing-all-these-major-games/2900-6657/">updates on it have been almost non-existent</a>. Sources said Rare was unable to find the right direction for Everwild, and now it's no longer in development.</p><p>The cancellation of Everwild didn't "directly impact" Sea of Thieves, Stevens added, mentioning that development is continuing as planned. "Our focus as a team and a studio is on supporting our friends and colleagues whose roles are at risk," Stevens said.</p><p>The developer went on to say that it's "impossible for something like this not to ripple through the studio and affect all of us in some way or another, so please bear with us."</p><p>"I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who's reached out to check in on us and share their kind words of support. Genuinely, thank you, it really means a lot," Stevens said.</p><p>It wasn't just Everwild that got canned as part of the Xbox cutbacks, as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6726">also canceled</a> a new MMO from The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, as well as the new Perfect Dark. Microsoft also laid off numerous developers across its network of studios.</p><p>The cuts came as part of a wider downsizing effort at Microsoft that affected more than 9,000 people and against the backdrop of Microsoft investing billions into artificial intelligence projects. Some of the laid-off developers at the Microsoft-owned Candy Crush studio King say <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they are set to be replaced by AI systems they helped create.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-revealed-launches-in-july-next-three-expansions-including-the-star-wars-inspired-renegades-expansion-also-announced/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest expansion from Bungie for Destiny 2 and the first major expansion to kick off a new era of Destiny, the Fate Saga, is out now on all platforms. </p>



<p>The Edge of Fate sees the Guardians getting some help from a new ally, Lodi, as the story centers once again on the Nine, and sees the Guardians dealing with a threat to the universe that goes back even before the Traveler came into the picture. Set in a new location, Kepler, there's plenty of mystery and changes to Destiny 2 coming in this update.</p>



<p>Edge of Fate introduces an overhaul to the armor system with Armor 3.0, a new UI system that's supposed to streamline the experience for players. It also marks the removal of the paywall for seasonal content, and the addition of a new permanent shooting range. </p>



<p>While the expansion is out today for players to check out, the new raid, The Desert Perpetual, will launch this weekend on July 19, 2025.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's been no secret that Bungie has been struggling recently. While this new expansion offers a chance for the studio to experience a bright spot in their calendar this year, the delay for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">Marathon</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">massive plagiarism scandal around it</a>, and reports of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">studio's internal troubles all pointing to leadership;</a> it's clear that the studio desperately needs a win. If only for those developers who have been working overtime to fix the mistakes of their bosses. </p>



<p>Hopefully, Edge of Fate is the beginning of Bungie taking a turn for the better. It's the sign of a healthy industry when a storied studio like Bungie can grow in strength over its many years, instead of dwindling into what many long-time fans fear to be the inevitable, that the studio shuts its doors for good within a few years time.</p>

            <p>
Santa Ragione - the acclaimed indie studio and publisher behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-review-a-horrible-nightmare-in-all-the-right-ways">Saturnalia</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mirrormoon-ep-review">Mirror Moon EP</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mediterranea-inferno-review-a-bruising-intensely-stylish-post-covid-nightmare">Mediterranea Inferno</a> - has accused Apple of yanking one of its titles from the App Store without "clear justification".
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to Eurogamer, Santa Ragione co-founder and director Pietro Righi Riva revealed the studio's 2016 visual novel Wheels of Aurelia will be delisted from the App Store on 25th July following a number of unsuccessful appeals to Apple.
</p>
<p>
According to Riva, Apple's reasoning for Wheels of Aurelia's removal has remained vague, with the company only citing its "policy to remove apps deemed 'obsolete' or 'outdated'" during correspondence. Riva insists the game remains "fully functional and compliant with current technical standards" and that no "clear justification" for the removal has been provided "despite multiple appeals and sincere efforts to seek clarification." We've contacted Apple for comment.
</p>
<p>
Riva added that "enforced and unnecessary" updates "represent a substantial financial burden" for developers, and "negatively [impacts] their ability to sustain existent projects and to pursue new creative endeavours."
</p>
<p>
"We firmly believe that removing fully functional artistic works simply due to infrequent updates undermines the value and sustainability of games as cultural and artistic products," he continued. "Like books, films, and music albums, video games represent complete creative works that do not inherently require continual updates beyond maintaining basic functionality."

<p>
Riva called Apple's practices "especially troubling" given the tech company's "dominant position in digital distribution", adding they reinforce the "importance of diversified ecosystems". He also applauded the European Union's recent efforts at "fostering more fairness and plurality in the digital marketplace." Apple, of course, has repeatedly expressed its discontent over EU decisions stemming from the Digital Markets Act legislation Riva appears to be referencing, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-appeals-eus-500m-fine-for-app-store-anti-steering-practices-says-its-far-beyond-what-the-law-requires">currently appealing a €500m fine</a> it received in April over the restrictions it places on app developers wishing to use alternative purchase methods.
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione is far from the only developer to take issue with Apple's approach. Studios described creating games for the company's platforms as being "like an abusive relationship" in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-games-for-apple-platforms-like-an-abusive-relationship-say-developers">report last year</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> developer Epic Games has been heavily involved in legal efforts to curtail Apple's much-criticised practices following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">significant falling out</a> in 2020.
</p>
<p>
As for Wheels of Aurelia, Santa Ragione is making the game - a "narrative road trip... set in the roaring Italian 70s" - <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wheels-of-aurelia/id1198170026">free on the App Store</a> until its delisting on 25th July, to ensure "as many people as possible can experience this work before its removal".

The twist is that the third person arrested in this ongoing case is apparently the manager of a rival trading card store nearby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The robbery happened on June 16 at around 3:30 a.m. at Card Shop Masters in central Japan’s Gifu Prefecture. Two men in their 30s were later arrested for breaking and entering. According to the Sanspo article, one of the men is suspected of threatening the owners with a knife before taking the cards and cash. On July 9, a third person, allegedly the owner of a nearby trading card store, was arrested on suspicion of being an accomplice in the robbery, although according to police, he has yet to confess or deny his involvement.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon TCG Mega Evolution</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The shop that was robbed has been posting about the situation on its X account, revealing the alleged identity of the third suspect as the manager of a rival store.

Back in September, two men broke into a trading card seller in Osaka, also at 3:30 a.m. They threatened an employee (who had just been livestreaming a card sale) with a knife, tied them up and then took over 100 cards (worth over 10 million yen or around $67,000) as well as 250,000 yen (around $1,700) in cash (source: <a href="https://www.kochinews.co.jp/article/detail/783380" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kochi Shimbun</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rare Pokémon cards have become a target for heists in other countries too.

It's possible the five years-distinction was legal verbiage copied and pasted from previous, older playtests, but it still doesn't inspire confidence.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-delayed-post-launch-update-to-undo-a-controversial-change/1100-6529977/" data-ref-id="1100-6529977">Killing Floor 3 was originally supposed to arrive earlier this year</a> on March 25, but was delayed just a few weeks before release. The requiring of a lengthy NDA for a playtest so close to launch has fans worried another delay could be on the way, but in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190?emclan=103582791474057313&amp;emgid=496075125142061061" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> about the stress test, Tripwire said it has been focused on optimizations and enacting player feedback so it can "ship a great game to fans on July 24."</p><p dir="ltr">"This test is designed to help our team and partners ensure that the multiplayer environment stays as stable as possible at launch," Tripwire states.</p><p dir="ltr">Tripwire has already laid out some of its post-launch plans for Killing Floor 3, which include improved animations, the ability for playable characters to be able to pick any perk, and the implementation of text chat.</p><p dir="ltr">Killing Floor 3 supports six-player co-op and features cross-play across platforms.
