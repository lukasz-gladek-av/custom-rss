            <link>https://kotaku.com/ring-battery-video-doorbell-priced-like-basic-doorbell-amazon-plays-zero-profit-on-own-brand-2000652158</link>
            <guid>1378597</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ring belongs to Amazon, which gives the retail giant complete freedom to price these video doorbells however aggressively it wants without worrying about profit margins on individual units. Amazon’s strategy focuses on getting Ring devices installed in as many homes as possible and knows that subscription revenue and ecosystem lock-in will pay off long-term even if the hardware sells at cost or below.</p>
<p>The newest<strong> battery doorbell model delivers head-to-toe video coverage with 66% more vertical view</strong> than the previous generation, and captures packages on the ground and tall visitors’ faces in a single frame. This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/"> latest version currently sells for $49 on Amazon instead of the usual $99</a>&nbsp;which marks a record low price that makes smart doorbell technology accessible to practically anyone with a front door and a WiFi connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6333/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Video Coverage That Shows What Really Matters</h2>
<p>The <strong>bigger vertical field of view is a big improvement over older Ring doorbells</strong> which often cut off the tops of tall people’s heads or packages on the ground below the camera’s frame. This full-body coverage gets rid of the annoyance of having to watch footage again and again only to find that important details are missing because they were out of the camera’s view: You can clearly see the faces of delivery drivers while also making sure they really left your package instead of just pretending to deliver it. You can also see people who look suspiciously like they’re casing your property while they think they’re outside the camera’s range.</p>



<p>The<strong> built-in rechargeable battery</strong> means you don’t have to connect the doorbell to your home’s electrical system so renters or anyone who doesn’t want to deal with electrical work can install it. You probably already have cables that work with the USB-C charging port because it uses modern connector standards that are the same as those used by most new phones and tablets. When the battery gets low, just take the doorbell off its mount, plug it into any USB-C charger, and put it back in place after a few hours.</p>
<p>With the <em>Live View</em> feature, <strong>you can use the Ring app on your phone to see what’s going on at your door</strong> at any time, even if no one has pressed the doorbell button or motion detection has been triggered. This is helpful if you’re waiting for a delivery and want to see the driver, if you want to make sure your kids got home from school, or if you just want to see what’s going on outside without having to walk to the door.</p>



<p>When there is movement near your door, <strong>motion detection sends real-time alerts to your phone</strong>. However, the basic notifications only let you know that motion was detected and don’t say what caused it. Ring’s subscription service offers Smart Alerts, which use AI to tell the difference between people, packages, and other moving things like cars or animals. This way, you get more useful notifications that help you decide if something needs your immediate attention.</p>
<p>With Alexa integration, you can stream doorbell video to Echo Show devices all over your house, use Alexa speakers to announce visitors, or use voice commands to control Ring functions. You can ask Alexa to show you the front door, and within seconds, the video feed will appear on compatible Echo displays which lets you check who’s there without having to pull out your phone.</p>
<p>When you consider that smart doorbells from well-known brands usually cost between $150 and $250, spending $49 on a Ring video doorbell with its build quality and features is a great deal. Amazon’s usual price of $99 already made this a good deal compared to other options, but the 50% discount makes it so cheap that it is almost as cheap as regular doorbells from home improvement stores.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>John Romero’s upcoming game, which was seemingly canceled back when Microsoft ended its publishing agreement with Romero Games and pulled funding, has been saved. Well, sort of.</p>



<p>During an appearance at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid&nbsp;(Madrid Video Game Show), the creator of DOOM revealed that work on the game was continuing. He then went into some more detail on the game’s state, and what’s been happening since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romero-games-denies-its-closed-after-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news broke in July</a>.</p>







<p>Romero revealed that the game has been “completely redesigned” and incorporates elements from the original version while still being a different game. That said, he wanted to make it clear that they weren’t “starting at ground zero” with the project.</p>



<p><strong>“We can take pieces out of and put into a brand-new indie game,”</strong> he said.<strong> “We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.”</strong></p>



<p>He continued to say that the building the game is “more fun” than it was while also being a “much smaller game” overall. </p>



<p><strong>“It’s more fun for us because the people working on it were all directors of different departments, and they didn’t actually get to code or design or whatever,” </strong>he said. <strong>“[Now] we get to actually do that, do the thing that we’re really good at ourselves.”</strong></p>







<p>As far as the game’s features, Romero didn’t go into many specifics during his on-stage talk. That said, he spoke about Elden Ring being an inspiration for the game because it was a “really new experience”. His game, he says, is something that he’s never even played before, and making it something like that for players is the main idea behind the project.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch 2’s December Patch Overhauls Competitive Like Never Before]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-patch-december-overhauls-competitive/</link>
            <guid>1378588</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Overwatch 2, despite a few ups and downs, remains one of the most popular hero shooters on the market. Since being released in October 2022 and going free-to-play, Overwatch 2 has remained a staple of the esports space, even with some drastic changes taking place to alter the face of the game’s core competitive leagues.</p>



<p>In the most recent update, the super-sized patch released on December 9, Blizzard made stacks of amendments to Overwatch 2, focusing quite heavily on the game’s competitive ecosystem. It was an overhaul, the likes of which haven’t been seen since the game launched.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-2-s-competitive-revolution">Overwatch 2’s Competitive Revolution</h2>



<p>Blizzard’s latest Overwatch 2 update isn’t just about festivities; it’s a landmark moment for the game’s competitive platform. On December 9, the Winter Wonderland event was ushered in alongside a new patch, but the core of the update addressed the game’s ranked foundations.</p>



<p>The headline change is the ‘Challenger Tier’, a complete replacement for the long-standing Top 500 system that players have known and understood for years. The new framework transforms leaderboards into a season-long battle of skill.</p>



<p>It boasts an all-new scoring system that allows players to earn points based on their MMR, and certain bonuses can be unlocked for consistent performance streaks.</p>



<p>To get into the leaderboard, you’ll need to have a 4000 to 5000 Challenger Score, depending on the playlist you prefer to enjoy.</p>



<p>What’s exciting for the more pro players out there is that social integration is now a thing with this latest Overwatch 2 patch. Those players who are lucky enough to be verified can integrate their streaming and social profiles directly to their entry on the in-game leaderboard, and active competitors are highlighted, prompting fans to spectate their matches from within the client.</p>



<p>The new Wuxing University map is a competitive dream. Cassidy has been completely reforged to emphasize better survivability and versatility, and the competitive meta has been tweaked to no end. It really is the biggest update to the game’s core ‘esports systems’ since it was released over three years ago.</p>

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 celebrates its fifth anniversary today, December 10, as the RPG originally launched back on December 10, 2020. It's been a busy, tumultuous five years for the game, and now one of the game's designers, Pawel Sasko, has weighed in with a <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1998772126317220142" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">heartfelt message</a> to mark the milestone.</p><p>"I feel nothing but gratitude towards each one of you," he said. "I feel so thankful to be part of this community. I love all the pictures, videos; all the cosplay and mods that you have done for Cyberpunk 2077. It has been an incredible adventure."</p><p>He added: "I hope you have enjoyed the stories we have told about the characters we have built. I feel so blessed to be part of this community. I feel so thankful to be able to work on this game and to add something valuable to your lives."</p><p>Another developer, Bartek Pyrko, <a href="https://x.com/BartPyrko/status/1998737046739857431" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "I'm deeply proud to have been part of the team that shaped Night City. The project changed me--as a designer and as a person--and being my first project at CDPR, it became a defining and unforgettable chapter of my career."</p><p>When Cyberpunk 2077 launched in December 2020, it was in such a rough state, technically, that it was removed from sale from the PlayStation Store. Thousands of people got refunds.</p><p>CD Projekt pledged to update, fix, and improve Cyberpunk 2077 following its troubled launch, and the Polish developer did just that. The game later got into much better shape, culminating with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-rebuilds-its-gameplay-to-make-a-fantastic-rpg/1100-6517704/" data-ref-id="1100-6517704">Cyberpunk 2077's 2.0 update in 2023</a> that re-worked a number of gameplay systems, alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phantom-liberty-rewrites-cyberpunk-2077s-dna/1100-6515050/" data-ref-id="1100-6515050">Phantom Liberty expansion.</a></p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 has gone on to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-hits-35-million-sales-and-did-so-faster-than-witcher-3/1100-6536532/" data-ref-id="1100-6536532">more than 35 million copies</a>, reaching that sales milestone faster than The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The game expanded to a new platform, Switch 2, earlier this year. Unsurprisingly, a sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a>, is now in the works.</p><p>Beyond that, CD Projekt just recently announced an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-is-getting-an-official-physical-trading-card-game-in-collaboration-with-cd-projekt-red/1100-6536818/" data-ref-id="1100-6536818">official Cyberpunk Trading Card Game</a>. It features characters from Cyberpunk 2077 and the Netflix series Edgerunners, with a Kickstarter campaign for it coming in 2026.</p>

<p>With physical versions and everything!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>ININ Games has just announced that a new entry in the iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_r-type">R-Type</a> series is on its way to Switch consoles in May 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/r-type-dimensions-iii">R-Type Dimensions III</a> sees players return to the franchise's signature side-scrolling bullet hell warfare against, well, a whole bunch of weird s**t, sir. It's coming right at us!</p>
<p>Sorry about that. Flashbacks, innit. Working closely with Tozai and Irem (so that's the original creators and licence holders onboard), ININ describes this one as "one of the most ambitious and significant undertakings in ININ’s history." So stick that in your pulsating xenomorph skull and smoke it.</p>
<p>Building on the legacy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/r-type_dimensions_ex">R-Type Dimensions EX</a>, this new game apparently completely re-envisions the core action with cutting-edge visuals, sounds and more in the way of gameplay modes.</p>
<p>Here's some more details from ININ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> brings the intensity, precision, and creative enemy design of the arcade originals to a new generation. Every stage, boss, and projectile pattern has been rebuilt with high-end 3D graphics, enhanced animations, and richly detailed environments, whilst preserving the instantly recognizable atmosphere that defined R-Type’s identity.</p>
<p>The same applies to the original music and sound effects. With an enormous effort, everything has been rebuilt so that Players can switch seamlessly between the original and the new R-Type III at any time, offering both nostalgic authenticity and a striking modern reinterpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Key features include:</strong></p>
<p>A fully remastered experience with completely reconstructed assets</p>
<p>Local co-op, enhanced with new scoring and survival mechanics</p>
<p>Advanced mode is accessible from the start</p>
<p>Customizable controls and quality-of-life features in the settings</p>
<p>3D Camera settings (normal and crazy)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we mentioned, there are also physical editions to get hold of here, with a special and collector's version as detailed below!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Special Edition<br></strong>The Special Edition includes the full game, a beautifully crafted artbook showcasing concept art and visual development, as well as the complete new original soundtrack, perfect for players who want to dive deeper into the creative universe of <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em>. This edition will be sold for € 59,99.</p>
<p><strong>Collector’s Edition<br></strong>For devoted R-Type enthusiasts, the ultra-limited Collector’s Edition offers everything from the Special Edition plus a selection of exclusive bonus items. The centerpiece is a highly collectible figurine based on the new cover interpretation. This exclusive edition is priced at € 199,99.</p>
</blockquote>

			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>

			<p>Despite the current questionable management of the brand, there's no denying that Xbox did some things right in the past. Chief among them is the backward compatibility program that makes select legacy games playable on current generation system, allowing more users to enjoy them without having to track old systems and copies of these games. In the future, Xbox backward compatibility could become even better, potentially expanding to Windows PCs and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/"><strong>ROG Xbox Ally</strong></a>, if a rumored effort bears fruit.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-ronald-on-25th-anniversary-we-want-to-celebrate-the-legacy-of-xbox-as-well-as-define-the-future-of-where-the-xbox-ecosystem-is-going.1376665/post-148633819">Over on the ResetERA forums</a></strong>, reliable insider Nate the Hate, who consistently provides correct insider information, commented on the future of the Xbox ecosystem, suggesting that there's a chance backward compatibility could be expanded to more platforms.</p>



<p><em>"There exists a hope to make legacy Xbox (OG and Xbox 360) games BC on ROG and Windows. Whether they succeed is the unknown; but there is an effort being made," </em>the insider wrote. <em>"The other unknown would be how extensive will the initiative be in offerings. Will it be what we currently have on Series or will BC expand to add more titles across the Xbox ecosystem."</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first time we heard that legacy Xbox games could be coming to PC, but even if the effort is ongoing, there are many hurdles to overcome to accomplish this. One of the biggest issues that would prevent a larger library from being available on PC and the ROG Xbox Ally would be licensing issues, as reportedly, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-cost-double-playstation-6/">publishers are not willing to allow an Xbox game license to be converted into a PC game license.</a></strong></p>



<p>What seems almost certain at this point is that the next-generation Xbox, <span>rumored to be powered by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-power-both-console-xbox-pcs/"><strong>AMD Magnus APU</strong></a>, will be&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/" target="_blank"><strong>backward compatible with previous-generation games.</strong></a>&nbsp;T</span>he above licensing issues wouldn't apply in this case, allowing legacy games to remain playable on a current gaming system.</p>



<p>Regardless of what Xbox has planned, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=266&amp;v=6Wl8G4k6FoQ&amp;feature=youtu.be"><strong>news about the ecosystem will be shared in 2026</strong></a>, which will mark the 25th anniversary of the brand. As such, we may not have to wait much longer to learn if this ongoing effort will bear fruit, and legacy games will indeed become available on PC.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-the-finals-season-9-dragon-rising/</link>
            <guid>1378552</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a> may be the most significant game to come out of Embark Studios so far, but that doesn't mean the team has forgotten about its first-person, free-to-play shooter from 2023, The Finals. Today, Embark <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/900">is kicking off the game's third year</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-game-awards-shadow-drop/">it was shadow-dropped at The Game Awards 2023</a>, with Season 9: Dragon Rising, an update that Embark says is "<em>focused on growth, accessibility and renewed competitive momentum</em>."</p>



<p>With that focus, on top of Season 9 introducing a new megacity map called Fangwai City, a new battle pass, and several new quality of life and balance improvements - all things you might expect from a seasonal update - it's also introducing a new 8v8 gameplay mode, Point Break, and key updates to its ranked system.</p>



<p>Point Break is the clear highlight in Season 9, though not just because it's a new, bigger mode compared to other modes offered in The Finals. You may recall that <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-ea-dice-exec-starts-embark/">Embark Studios was initially founded by former Battlefield developers</a> who wanted to return to a shooter that emphasized destructability in its matches, and to hear Embark describe the new mode in today's Season 9 reveal sounds like the team is getting back to their Battlefield roots in a way that makes sense for The Finals.</p>



<p>Point Break puts players as either attackers or defenders, with the lines of the battlefield constantly shifting, with attackers looking to destroy objectives that the defenders are charged with protecting. It's a large-scale game mode (well, large-scale for The Finals) that Embark describes as "<em>a mode where you always know where the action is headed, and what your team needs from you</em>," which could work just as well as a description for some game modes in Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SEASON 9 REVEAL PANEL | THE FINALS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwQlThIa4f8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Point Break, the new Fangwei City map, the extra optimization work done by Embark, and all of the other quality of life improvements Embark discusses in the video above really do hammer home the point that Embark is trying to inject some life back into The Finals. "<em>Season 9 isn't just new content, it's a stronger, more flexible version of The Finals, from top to bottom</em>," Embark says in its Season 9 reveal video.</p>



<p>And it couldn't have come at a better time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/">with all eyes back on Embark thanks to ARC Raiders</a>. While SteamDB numbers are never the full picture, it still doesn't exactly look great to see that The Finals <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2073850/charts/#max">hasn't had more than 50K concurrent players on Steam since January 2024</a>. While it's impressive that The Finals has been able to stick around long enough to reach its third year, which is more than can be said for <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/">some other recent free-to-play multiplayer first-person shooters</a>, it can't exactly continue to survive if its numbers don't start improving.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We'll see if Season 9: Dragon Rising is the adrenaline shot that the game needed, or if it's another whiff, bringing the game closer to its demise.</p>

            <p>Rockstar Games' firing of more than 30 workers just over a month ago has once again been brought up by UK politicians, with prime minister Keir Starmer calling it a "deeply concerning case" which will be looked into by government ministers. Rockstar have been accused of union busting by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain over the firings, with the union having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company.</p>
<p>The dismissals <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">reportedly followed a discussion</a> on a union-focused Discord server in which staff cited emails from Rockstar about changes to the company's internal Slack policies.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to a session in the House of Commons today, December 10th. Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP Chris Murray raised the issue of the firings, saying: "Having met Rockstar [about the firings], they failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting." He then asked Starmer if the big cheese agrees that every company has to follow employment law and that workers have the right to unionise.</p>
<p>"It's a deeply concerning case," replied the prime minister. "Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers' rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated."</p>

Keir Starmer was just asked about the Rockstar firings in Parliament today where he described the situation as "deeply concerning" and promised it would be looked into by government ministers.

</span></p><p>We'll have to see if anything comes of that looking into things, but it is noteworthy that Murray said he'd come out of meeting with the publisher with reservations as to whether Rockstar's firings were justified. Murray has shared more detail about his meeting with Rockstar in a statement sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-prime-minister-sir-keir-starmer-says-rockstar-firing-31-gta-6-developers-over-alleged-union-busting-is-deeply-concerning-and-pledges-that-ministers-will-now-investigate">IGN</a>. "The meeting began with us as MPs refused entry unless an NDA [non-disclosure agreement] was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after it being made clear this would not be signed," he said.</p><p>"The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members," the MP continued. "I was not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal."</p>
<p>While the IWGB have accused them of union busting, Rockstar have stuck to their line that the staff were let go for "distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum".</p>
<p>I've reached out to Rockstar for comment.</p>
<p>Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine has also previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">raised the issue of the firings in the House of Commons</a>, revealing that she'd written to Rockstar asking for information about the issue and requesting a meeting with a relevant minister.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-rogue-reaction-vanguard-release-date-tank-2000652174</link>
            <guid>1378543</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Rogue has always been one of my favorite X-Men thanks to the </span><i><span>X-Men Evolution </span></i><span>animated series and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>the Fox movies</span></a><span> I grew up with (justice for Anna Paquin!), and I was curious how </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a> <span>would balance a hero with unlimited possibilities for a competitive game. Now that we’ve finally seen her in action, it’s clear NetEase just made her a comic-accurate powerhouse, and fans are terrified of the power-siphoning hero’s abilities.</span></p>  <p><span>For those not steeped in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-disney-plus-premiere-impressions-1851356830"><i><span>X-Men</span></i></a> <span>knowledge, Rogue is a mutant with the ability to absorb people’s memories, personality, and powers at the slightest touch. Typically, this exchange causes a great deal of pain for the affected person, and Rogue can even kill someone through skin-to-skin contact if she hangs on long enough. </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>is implementing this into her kit, as she is able to absorb an ability from nearly every other character in the game. This lets her change her playstyle on the fly; she might take Doctor Strange’s shield to raise team-wide defenses, for instance, or copy Invisible Woman’s crowd-controlling bubbles to move enemies around.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Anyone playing Rogue has to be adaptable, as she can only copy abilities from enemies on the field, rather than just pulling from the roster at her whim. She’s not too dissimilar to Echo from </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>, whose ultimate lets her copy an enemy or ally’s form and kit, but Rogue still maintains her own cooldowns and abilities when she siphons an ability. Even without taking an ability from one of her foes, Rogue is a powerhouse of a tank. Her primary attacks are pretty straightforward, as she punches, kicks, and tosses around enemies like they’re nothing. She also has a block move that minimizes damage as she absorbs all that energy for a more powerful punch.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Rogue looks great for leading the front line and controlling a crowd, and that all comes together in her Ultimate, which creates an area-of-effect that siphons health, ult charge, and some other properties from heroes in her proximity. This gives her a ton of survivability and drains resources from enemies, some of which seems to be based on what enemy classes are in your field. Early footage shows her absorbing what looks to be base health from other Vanguards. The ult charge absorb is the real boon here, as that can undermine some of your opponents’ plays before they even get a chance to fire off their game-changing abilities. As you can expect, fans are both excited to play as this powerhouse and also scared to see her coming out of the enemy spawn.</span></p>         <p><span>All that said, some fans </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1pircv5/rogue_cant_steal_abilities_from_punisher/"><span>think she might have a weakness</span></a><span> when she drops on December 12. Based on the footage we’ve seen of her thus far, it seems like heroes that don’t technically have superpowers may be safe from her ability siphon. Punisher fights with firearms, and doesn’t seem to have the icon that shows Rogue can steal a power from him. So maybe Rogue’s counter is actually just regular guys who shoot at superheroes, like Hawkeye and Black Widow. We’ll know for sure when she launches on Friday.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/genies-avatar-sdk-lets-you-build-customizable-avatars-and-drop-them-straight-into-your-unity-game-2000651849</link>
            <guid>1378540</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game characters have come a long way in the last few years, but Genies — the company best known for its ultra-stylized digital avatars — is kicking that evolution into high gear. After announcing a partnership with Unity this summer, the company has begun rolling out its first set of tools to developers: the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/">Genies Avatar SDK, now available on the Unity Asset Store</a>.</p>
<p>The process is exceptionally easy: Drop this package into your project, and suddenly your game can support high-fidelity, fully customizable player avatars that persist across any game built using the Unity dev engine and that plugs into the same system. The avatars are then available across Unity-based games. The Genies Avatar SDK gives players something games have tried (and often failed) to nail for years — a digital identity that’s entirely theirs, not one feels like a generic character creator pulled from a dropdown menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Genies</a></p>

<h2>Change On the Fly</h2>
<p>The Genies editor lets players tweak body features, facial details, outfits, hairstyles, and accessories with a surprising amount of nuance. There’s a built-in “Closet” with starter clothing, and new outfits will roll out regularly, with developers able to also toss their own designs into the mix. Thanks to the company’s auto-rigging pipeline, custom wearables snap onto any avatar without breaking animations, clipping through bodies, or tanking visual fidelity.</p>
<p>Developers get a flexible avatar framework baked directly into the SDK. It comes with a ready-to-use character controller and can plug into existing animation systems if you already have one. NPCs can be created through the same editor — meaning every character in a world, not just players, can share the same expressive stylization. More importantly, everything persists. If a player unlocks or buys a wearable in one experience, it lives in their inventory everywhere the Genies system is supported.</p>



<h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
<p data-start="2161" data-end="2490">The Genies SDK also includes a streamlined login flow. Instead of making players juggle passwords or account portals, Genies uses a one-time email code system that carries a user’s avatar and items from game to game. For any developer building a social space, UGC world, or multiplayer hub, that’s the holy grail.</p>
<p data-start="2492" data-end="3028">But Genies is already teasing what comes next — and this is where things get&nbsp;<em>really</em> interesting. The company is developing an AIGC SDK that can generate game-ready 3D assets in minutes, a Smart Avatar SDK that turns NPCs into AI-driven characters capable of learning and adapting to players, and a Genies Party SDK that bundles all of this into a platform for IP-driven experiences. Their stated goal is to turn some of the most tedious parts of development — asset creation, rigging, optimization — into fast, automated workflows.</p>
<p data-start="3030" data-end="3308">Whether this becomes the next big shift in game development or just a very fancy avatar creator remains to be seen. But if you’re curious, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/">the Avatar SDK is already live on the Unity Asset Store</a> — and Genies says it’s only the first step in a much cooler, more ambitious plan.</p>

            <guid>1378534</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Anniversary Edition</em> was shadowdropped</a> onto the Nintendo Switch 2. Bethesda promised this port of the classic 2011 open-world RPG was an improvement on the Switch 1 version. And in some ways, that’s true. But players are disappointed by how it runs and feels, and by all the space it takes up.</p> <p>The original <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch felt like a big deal at the time in 2017. Bethesda getting its ambitious RPG running on Nintendo’s portable hybrid console was wild to see, and it became a solid way to experience <em>Skyrim</em> while on the go. So, when <em>Skyrim</em> made the leap to Switch 2 yesterday, fans were excited to see Bethesda’s aging RPG get a big shot in the arm on the more powerful hardware. And visually, this new version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 does look nicer, with many of the enhancements to models and textures found in the other Anniversary Edition ports. So that’s nice!</p>

  <p>However, for some reason, this 2011 game, which runs at 60FPS or more on almost every other platform, remains stuck at 30FPS on Switch 2, as if it were 2017 all over again. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1piid4c/skyrim_swith_2_is_absolutely_terrible/">Across Reddit and social media</a>, fans feel that this 30FPS cap is one of the biggest problems with this new port. As many point out, games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-2077-switch-2-mouse-mode-greyed-out-turn-on-1851785724"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> run at 40FPS on Switch 2, yet <em>Skyrim</em> is still stuck at 30? Another annoying issue is that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1piegpl/input_delay_on_skyrim_switch_2_edition_is_terrible/"><em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 seems to have horrendous input lag.</a> Some players are calling it borderline unplayable in handheld mode, and coupled with the 30FPS cap, it adds up to <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 feeling like shit.</p>

 <p>And what’s baffling is that this version of Skyrim takes up 53 GB of space on <em>Switch 2.</em> In comparison, the Special Edition version of <em>Skyrim</em> on PC is 12GB. Add the <em>Anniversary Edition</em> DLC upgrade, and it requires approximately 25 GB of space. Meanwhile, on Xbox Series X/S, <em>Skyrim Anniversary Edition</em> has a digital footprint of 32GB. Why the Switch 2 version is this big is unknown, though some speculate it’s a mistake. Others wonder if it has to do with the Switch 2 hardware itself and how Bethesda’s old tech runs on it. Either way, it’s wild to think that <em>Cyberpunk</em> on Switch 2 is only 10GB bigger, at around 60GB, and looks 10 times better and runs at a higher framerate. Something seems off here.</p> <p>Hopefully, Bethesda does the other thing it’s famous for:<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-fix-bethesda-new-patch-xbox-1851469635"> patching its broken games</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-10th-anniversary-update-is-a-complete-shit-show-that-nobody-wanted-2000642938">terrible updates</a> to make things more playable. But until then, you might want to hold off on buying <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2.</p>

                <p>The Fortnite collabs look like they could be off to a strong start next year, with leaks suggesting that a Bleach crossover is coming. According to the leaks, it's set to launch in early 2026 during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-all-weapons-and-loot/2900-7294/" data-ref-id="2900-7294">Chapter 7 Season 1</a>. Since the season is set to end on March 4, the most likely release window is January or February.</p><p>First spotted by noted dataminer SamLeakss, the collab could feature not just a character skin but also Ichigo's theme, "Number One." So the skin seems likely to be Ichigo himself.</p><p>Fortnite has been packed with collaborations lately, incorporating characters and icons from various worlds. In the past year alone, players have seen crossovers with horror legend Ghost Face, the viral Skibidi Toilet meme, Metal Gear Solid's Snake, and even recent pop-culture giants like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kpop-demon-hunters-x-fortnite-adds-skins-gameplay-items-and-their-own-demon-hunting-mode/1100-6535150/" data-ref-id="1100-6535150">KPop Demon Hunters</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/fortnite-x-squid-game-official-island-escape-trailer/2300-6466244/" data-ref-id="2300-6466244">Squid Game</a>.</p><p>Anime crossovers have been especially popular with players. Fortnite has already teamed up with major series such as Naruto, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dragon-ball-super-crossover-all-skins-weapons-and-more/1100-6506500/" data-ref-id="1100-6506500">Dragon Ball</a>, Attack on Titan, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-jujutsu-kaisen-crossover-adds-new-skins-and-tons-of-free-cosmetics/1100-6516642/" data-ref-id="1100-6516642">Jujutsu Kaisen</a>, each bringing fan-favorite skins, themed items, and special gameplay features. With these collaborations being so successful, it makes sense that Epic Games would pursue another major anime name, such as Bleach. However, nothing is confirmed yet, so we'll have to wait until Epic Games officially announces the crossover.</p>

            <p>Two classic N64 platformers are making their way to Nintendo Switch Online this month for subscribers.</p>
<p>The first of these is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rayman-2">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a>, from Ubisoft, which first released on the N64 in 1999, alongside PC, PlayStation and Dreamcast. It was the second game in the Rayman series, following the character's sidescrolling debut from 1995, and was the first 3D Rayman game.</p>
<p>The second is Tonic Trouble, also from Ubisoft and conceptualised by Rayman creator Michel Ancel. It was also released in 1999 and sees players as purple alien Ed (great name) on a mission to stop drunkard Grögh from conquering the world. He can also turn into Super Ed by eating popcorn - I wish I could do the same.</p>

<p>Rayman 2 and Tonic Trouble join the party next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has today announced that it will soon be expanding the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 library with a pair of classic 3D platformers.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tonic_trouble">Tonic Trouble</a> will be added to the service on <strong>17th December 2025</strong> (that's next week!), so expect to see a lot of floating hands/feet with no arms/legs attached to 'em.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1999 by Ubi Soft, Rayman 2 sees you tasked with saving the Fairy Glade from Admiral Razorbeard and his army of robots. There's all of the usual collecting and platforming peril that you would expect from a Rayman title, but we remember having a jolly good time with this one back in the day, and it's always nice to have an excuse to pick it up again.</p>
<p>Ubi launched Tonic Trouble the very same year, and while not quite as beloved as its platforming pal, it brings the weirdness with its story. This one will have you playing as an alien named Ed, who's sent down to Earth to clean up a little supernatural conqueror problem after he inadvertently pollutes the planet's water supply with a strange liquid.</p>

<p>Those with an NSO + Expansion Pack membership will be able to play both of these titles on the service next Wednesday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-led-gaming-light-bars-are-back-to-their-lowest-price-and-work-with-alexa-google-assistant-2000652084</link>
            <guid>1378486</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>So, you’ve invested in a good gaming PC, a high-resolution display, and an immersive sound setup, but the whole thing still feels incomplete? You need good lighting to match your in-game mood and aesthetics. Hardly any brand does smart lighting better than Govee, and we just spotted its gaming light bars going for less at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/">This pair of lightbars, with a smart controller, retails for $90, but you can pick them up for just $55 today, after a sweet 39% discount.</a> There are no coupon codes to enter or long checkout steps to follow; just add the product to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. Both Prime and non-Prime members will also enjoy free shipping with their purchase, which ultimately brings the total cost down even further. Best of all, if you place your orders today, you’re going to get them before Christmas, which is great for anyone looking to host game nights with friends during the holidays. However, considering how this is the lowest price these have dropped to since launch, we’re not expecting the discount (or the stock) to be around for long. If your current play setup is in need of a bit of personality, now is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Gaming Experience</h2>
<p>You’re getting a sleek pair that can sit nicely on either side of your desk, and lets you choose from 16.8 million colors for DIY lighting effects for a personalized experience. There are over 60 preset scene modes, as well; basically one for every mood. The dedicated app lets you tweak settings, adjust modes, play around with colors, and more. In fact, the scenes are divided into categories like emotion, games, festival, and funny, which makes the light bars great for year-round use. Go for a brighter setting when you’re feeling a rush of energy inside, a warmer tone during holiday dinners, and maybe switch to something a bit calmer on those slow nights.</p>
<p>The lights are capable of syncing with audio from both your speakers and headphones, a feature that lets them react to whatever’s happening on your computer screen. Expect a cozy setup during those cute Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin moments in Crash Landing on You, and let the lights go wild when it’s time to take out some bad guys in Valorant. Translation? A much more immersive viewing and gaming experience that makes you feel like a part of the action.</p>



<p>The smart desktop dial takes the experience even further by allowing you to adjust the brightness, change the modes/colors, and turn the light bars on/off without pulling your phone out. Just keep it on your desk, and make necessary adjustments in seconds when needed. Voice control is supported, too, as the lights play nicely with Alexa and Google Assistant. This way, you can simply speak to command; ideal for when you can’t afford to take your hands off the controller or keyboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/">These smart LED gaming lights are now down to $55, thanks to this 39% discount at Amazon.</a> They not only offer a ton of colors to choose from, but also include preset modes and music syncing capabilities to upgrade the entire vibe of your place. Snap it up quick, though, as the deal could wrap up any moment now.</p>

              <p>Fumbling with charging cables while trying to use your phone feels like a problem from the previous decade, and <strong>MagSafe technology finally removes this annoyance by magnetically snapping power banks directly to your iPhone’s back</strong>. This <em>TRKOY</em> wireless charger delivers 5,000mAh of backup power in a slim profile that stays attached while you scroll, call, or photograph without requiring any cables during use. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6331/">Amazon has dropped the price to a record low of $19, down from the usual $32, though you’ll need a Prime membership to access this deal</a> and grab one of the most practical iPhone accessories available.</p>

<p>The<strong> 15N magnetic force makes a connection that is strong enough</strong> to keep the power bank attached even when you’re walking, talking on the phone, or taking pictures at weird angles. This magnetic strength is just right because it keeps the charger connected during normal use but lets go easily when you pull it off on purpose. This way, you don’t have to deal with magnets that are either too weak to hold or too strong to separate without a lot of effort. You can answer calls, look at social media, or take selfies while the charger stays perfectly aligned on the back of your phone and this solves the cable management problems that come with regular power banks.</p>



<p>The phone and charger package is easy to handle with one hand because it is <strong>only 11.8 mm thick and weighs 120 grams</strong>: This is not the case with bulky power banks that make your phone feel like a brick and this slim design doesn’t get in the way of your phone’s cameras, so you can take pictures and videos without the charger blocking the lenses or making weird shadows. The design works well for situations where you need power but can’t put your phone down for a long time, like following GPS directions while walking, streaming events live, or keeping video calls going during your commute.</p>
<p>The <strong>5,000mAh capacity gives you enough power to fully charge an iPhone 17 once</strong> but for larger Pro Max models, this means about 50–80% of a full charge, and for standard and Mini models, it means a full charge. This amount of power is a good balance between useful backup power and keeping the charger slim enough to carry every day. However, people who use a lot of power every day might find the capacity limiting.</p>



<p>With dual charging, you can charge your iPhone wirelessly with MagSafe while also charging another device, like AirPods, an Apple Watch, or even an iPad, through the USB-C port at faster wired speeds. You won’t have to carry around a bunch of chargers or decide which device gets power first when you’re away from outlets because of this flexibility. You <strong>can also use the USB-C port to charge the power bank itself</strong>&nbsp;which makes things easier because you can use the same USB-C cable that charges many modern devices.</p>
<p>Comprehensive protection circuitry keeps an eye <strong>on the temperature, voltage, and current during the charging process</strong> to stop overheating, overcharging, and short circuits that could harm your phone’s battery or put your safety at risk. The smart cooling chip controls how heat is released which makes sure the charger stays at safe temperatures even when it’s charging for a long time.</p>
<p>When you compare it to other magnetic chargers from well-known brands that cost $40 to $60 or more, spending $19 on a MagSafe power bank is a great deal. The usual price of $32 already made it competitive with other options, but the 39% discount for Prime members makes it so cheap that people will want to buy it right away because it’s so convenient.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">recent firings of 34 <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> developers</a> at Rockstar UK have generated a lot of suspicion that the action was <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881">a response to these workers being unionized</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-union-workers-legal-2000643030">Protests have ensued</a>, and today the topic was raised in the UK’s Parliament, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer describing the situation as “deeply concerning.”</p> <p>The 34 members of the Scottish development team were fired in October based on claims of “gross misconduct” by Rockstar, but this was quickly refuted by the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) representing unionized developers, saying that it was in fact an act of “union busting.” Rockstar has heavily denied this, but <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/">the IWGB has pressed ahead with a case for unfair dismissal</a>, and the protests continue.</p>

 <p>This furor has now reached the UK government, after the MP for Rockstar’s constituency of Edinburgh East and Musselburgh, Chris Murray, raised the matter during Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions. Asking a question of Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Murray raised the claims of union busting, and explained that he had met with Rockstar and that they had “failed to reassure me they are following employment law.”</p>

 <p>“It’s a deeply concerning case,” said Keir Starmer. “Every worker has the right to join a trade union, and we’re determined to strengthen workers’ rights and ensure they don’t face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Ministers will look into the particular case that he raises and keep him updated.”</p>   <p>For context, Prime Minister’s Questions is a weekly event in the UK Parliament that takes place every Wednesday lunchtime, where the leader of the opposition and other members of Parliament are able to put questions to the Prime Minister. This usually begins with a tiresomely performative piece of theater as the two main rival party leaders exchange overly scripted insults designed to win headlines, before it then moves on to a more useful period in which genuine concerns can be raised in the House.</p>

 <p>However, it’s important to note that while opposition questions will usually be loaded with point-scoring, questions coming from the PM’s own party are very rarely combative, and usually pre-planned—the likes of, “Would the Prime Minister agree that we’re all doing a completely splendid job, and the Conservatives were super-extra rubbish?” Murray’s question, while obviously not sycophantic, was certainly planned and Starmer’s reply was pre-written.</p>

 <p>Labour is, in theory, a pro-union party, and has historically been in large part funded by the UK’s various major unions, as opposed to the Conservatives who are mostly funded by big businesses and Satan himself. However, in recent years Labour has betrayed its union roots to the degree that it’s now losing the support of many trade unions. Starmer actually saying something pro-union will be a relief to many, and hopefully put a chill down the spine of many corporations who thought there was no more need to worry about stomping all over their workers.</p> <p>Or it’ll be another lie and nothing will happen. But it’s fun to pretend to have hope.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK) intends to have Rockstar Games investigated for alleged union busting. </p>



<p>During Wednesday’s UK Parliament session, MP Chris Murray asked Prime Minister Kier Starmer about the allegations. Murray said that after meeting with Rockstar over the firings, the company “failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting.”</p>







<p>He then asked Starmer if he agrees that <strong>“all companies regardless of profit size must follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union.”</strong></p>



<p>Starmer responded by saying that it’s a “deeply concerning case”.</p>



<p><strong>“Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we’re determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don’t face unfair consequences for being part of a union,” </strong>he said. <strong>“Our ministers will look into the particular case that he [Murray] raises and will keep him updated.”</strong></p>



<p>In October, it was reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 30 employees</a> were fired from Rockstar. Immediately, employees and the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claimed it was a “blatant and ruthless” act of union busting. Rockstar, however, denied that claim, saying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employees were fired</a> for <strong>“gross negligence”</strong> after finding that they were <strong>“distributing and discussing confidential information”.</strong></p>







<p>Not long after that, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaked-discord-messages-reveal-why-rockstar-fired-34-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Discord messages</a> suggest that the information being shared involved discussions of new company policies with other employees, among other messages. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out multiple times to Rockstar for official comment on the claims. As of writing, no responses have been received.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/outward-2-is-an-rpg-that-wanted-me-dead-but-i-liked-exploring-its-world</link>
            <guid>1378468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, the best thing you can do is pick a goal and move towards it. You might have no idea how to get where you wanna go; you might have no idea where you are when it comes to accomplishing it; and you might not have much outside help, but you’ll do it anyway. What other choice is there? Just keep moving forward, and maybe something good will happen. That philosophy guided me through my three hours with Outward 2, a video game that mostly wanted me dead and was very good about making it happen. Everybody needs goals, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After making a character in Outward 2’s fairly (at least right now) limited character creator and choosing different elements of my backstory, which altered my starting stats – the RPG standard Strength, Agility, Constitution, Intelligence, and Willpower – my journey started in the city of Haboob, which has been recently reclaimed from the Scourge. I don’t know what that means, exactly, but it sounded good. Anyway, my recently arrived character won the housing lottery when a guy named Sebastian decided to move. Here I was, less than five minutes into the game and already a homeowner. Talk about a fantasy. We chatted before he left, and he seemed nice enough, and then I headed out to explore the city. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Outward 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Haboob is gorgeous – a multilayered city of stone, with these giant rotating fans (there’s one in my house, near the bed) and I enjoy walking around it for a bit, grabbing  an “on the house” (pun intended) drink at the local tea shop, and enjoying the vibe. Outward 2 isn’t the most visually sophisticated game out there – the character models kinda look like they stepped out of an Xbox 360-era Bethesda RPG – but its environments are pretty grand. After wandering around for a bit and speaking to the local Chamberlord, who hands over the deed to my new house, I call it a night. There’s not much else to do.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Haboob is gorgeous – a multilayered city of stone...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m awoken when a guard breaks in and tries to rob me (rude!) and whacks me in the head with a mace. Sebastian shows up to kill him, takes whatever it is, and then places the pistol he used to take care of the guard in my hand. At least he looks sorry about it, but because all the evidence of the murder points to me, I’m exiled with little more than what’s in my possession. The Chamberlord suggests I find Sebastian to prove my innocence.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Back to Square One</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Outward 2 is a survival game, which means I need to find, craft, or buy my supplies. Out in the world, there’s nothing to guide you. I had no map and no leads. The only thing around was a big, dead bird under what looked like some sort of mystical lamp post. I decided to head east. Always into the east. I got into a couple fights, one of which was against a dude that really didn’t seem to want to be there. Outward’s combat isn’t going to blow anyone away, but it’s weighty and generally pretty solid. I’m doing all right even though I only have an ice pick and a bow I picked up in the city until I fall into a small, rocky hole. I can’t walk or roll out of it and Outward 2 has no jump button. I end up starting a new run. I ran into a lot of bugs in my time with my preview build of Outward 2 – items would duplicate or not be usable, characters would float in mid-air, and so on – but that’s to be expected of something this early.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I tried to use it as an opportunity. This time, I spent more time in Haboob because I knew I was going to get kicked out, found some new people to talk to, and was generally better equipped when I was framed for murder. Again. I just bought a house in real life, so I was particularly upset about this. How dare this dude? Who does he think he is?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I was lucky in other ways. Remember that dead bird from last time? In its place, I found a woman named Oliele who helped me out by offering me some supplies, including a tent and a map, and told me where I might find Sebastian. There were a couple possibilities. I opted to head northeast to the True Levantines. Even with my supplies, life wasn’t easier. Drinking river water made me sick to my stomach, and my ice pick wasn’t a force in combat. I scavenged enough wood to build a shield and mostly tried to avoid fights. Even the map wasn’t much help. Oh, yeah, it was nice to see what the region looked like, but the map doesn’t track where you are, so… you know, it works like a real map. Outward 2 is willing to let you get lost, and I appreciated that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Second Chances</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This time, I didn’t fall into a hole, but I did run into other problems. Combat was risky, and when I camped for the night because my character was exhausted, I got attacked and… I couldn’t fight back. I could move, but I couldn’t swing my weapons. I opted to die, thinking that would be the end of it. Instead, I got a special little sequence because I died near a river, and washed up on its banks, my gear close by. Minus my tent.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon after, I spotted a weird ghost and tried to pick a fight. That was a <em>bad idea. </em>Not only could I barely hurt him with my ice pick, he never stopped following me when I tried to run away, so I followed the path I was on, the spectre hot on my heels, until I just happened to run into the True Levantine settlement and the guards finished him off for me. No sign of Sebastian, but I had a lead: south. Okay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then I got back on the road and died a whole bunch. I died to a big bird. I died to a weird bat thing. I fell over once and died. I died because I bled out. Each time I was rescued. Sometimes by a nice guy named Gep who I never met but left me a drink at his campfire. Sometimes by the healers at the True Levantine camp. Eventually, I decided it was time to buy a sword. I sold what little I had, and from there, things got easier. I made progress south. I found a weird tower where everything wanted to kill me. I killed an exiled mercenary and stole *his* tent. Ha! I explored a weird little cave and did some mining. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At this point I was rolling, and I figured I’d keep going until I died. Then I ran into one of those weird bat things again, and that was that. Three hours had flown by. Outward 2 doesn’t hold your hand, and I admire that. Exploring its gorgeous world is a lot of fun. I wish it was a little less buggy, and I wish that there was a bit more to do in a world that can sometimes feel big and empty – gathering materials in the areas I explored was difficult, and I didn’t get to craft as much as I wanted; I really wanted some linen, and I could not find or buy any of me for the life of me – but I did enjoying just picking a direction, setting off into the world, and seeing what I could see. There’s something special in that, and if the full release of Outward 2 can capture it, it might just make you want to go for a stroll.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/outward-2-is-an-rpg-that-wanted-me-dead-but-i-liked-exploring-its-world]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Another day, another Skyrim port — this time <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition"><u>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Anniversary Edition</u></a> is out on Nintendo Switch 2 after a shadowdrop — and even Bethesda can see the funny side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skyrim’s release on Switch 2 has resurfaced jokes about Bethesda milking the life out of its open-world fantasy role-playing game by releasing it on all the platforms under the sun. Skyrim has been ported and remastered so many times that it’s become one of the internet’s most enduring memes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a bit of a joke at this point how often we release Skyrim, but it's a great game," Bethesda's Matt Carofano, creative director of the Switch 2 version, said while talking to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-a-bit-of-a-joke-at-this-point-skyrim-dev-on-returning-for-a-switch-2-re-release" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nintendo Life</u></a>. "We want everyone to be able to play it in the best way possible."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that, it seems, is at the crux of Skyrim's numerous ports. With each new hardware generation, Bethesda has an opportunity to reach a whole new generation of players who get to experience its RPG for the first time. This time, it's Switch 2, giving the development team the chance to "take advantage of the new hardware."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A few years after Skyrim's original release in 2011, Bethesda worked on a "remastering process," improving the lighting and graphics features. Now, on Switch 2, it can make use of things like volumetric lighting and improved weather conditions, fog, and clouds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had previously done the version for the Switch, so this was going back to that and making improvements on it," Carofano said. "So it was really an easy development process and actually pretty quick in terms of our timelines. Making the game takes years and years and years, but bringing it to this new console was a much, much faster process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A lot of it was really just focusing on taking advantage of the new hardware. We can use DLSS now and get better resolution, better performance, and the game loads faster. Switch 2 has the Joy-Con 2 controllers that let you use mouse controls, so we added that. A lot of it is really just, 'How do we take advantage of the Switch 2? What can it do? And [how can we] give players the best version of Skyrim for that console?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of everything, though, Carofano says it's the general performance that most impresses him, as the game "performs better, runs smoother, and loads faster. So it's just a better play experience on the Switch 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on why so many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyrim-lead-designer-is-eternally-shocked-at-the-games-lasting-appeal-saying-i-think-skyrim-did-open-world-in-a-way-that-nobody-had-ever-done-before"><u>people continue to play and enjoy Skyrim</u></a> over a decade after its release, lead designer Bruce Nesmith recently said: "I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since. By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, 10. It’s like ‘what the hell is going on here?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Todd [Howard, Bethesda boss] would even go to these meetings and show us information, which I can’t give you the details of, about how many people are playing it. It’s like, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me?’ Seriously, still, 10 years later."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is, of course, working on its hotly anticipated Skyrim follow-up, The Elder Scrolls VI, but it has said next to nothing about it. We do know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-will-feature-a-memorial-character-for-a-much-missed-fan-following-85000-donation-to-make-a-wish"><u>it will include a character designed in memory of a much-missed fan</u></a>, after a remarkable charity campaign that raised more than $85,000 for Make-A-Wish. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Todd Howard recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-boss-todd-howard-wont-rule-out-an-elder-scrolls-tv-show-but-says-fallout-was-more-uniquely-suited-for-an-adaptation"><u>refused to rule out the possibility of an Elder Scrolls TV adaptation</u></a>, but did suggest the post-apocalyptic sci-fi franchise <a href="https://b/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fallout</u></a> — the second series of which debuts on December 17 — was better suited to an adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
