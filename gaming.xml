<p>"In the meantime, we have asked Nintendo to remove the game from the Switch 2 eShop. Thank you for your patience as we work with Nintendo to resolve these issues!"</p>

<p>Alongside the latest system firmware update</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8bbf56f765b4d/super-smash-bros-ultimate.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo yesterday rolled out a new update for the Switch 2 which also included some backwards compatibility fixes for select Switch titles.</p>
<p>One of these happens to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and an issue with the Mii Fighter. Thankfully, in the latest system firmware update, the problem has been fixed (<em>thanks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/users/Polley001" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Life user 'Polley001'</a> for the heads up</em>).</p>
<p>Nintendo has shared the following information on the game's eShop page about this:</p>
<h3>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Compatibility</h3>
<p>Supported - Game progressions may be affected in portions of the game.</p><p><figure data-videoid="FHjNdrGk2jw" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4052a3lqgwrt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHjNdrGk2jw">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>Updated 06/19/2025</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fixed:</strong> When playing online, when a Nintendo Switch 2 player and Nintendo Switch player were matched and someone was using Mii Fighter, it was possible for the match to end immediately.</p>
<p>When creating or editing and saving a Mii Fighter, the thumbnail image showing the Mii Fighter may not appear correctly. This may be improved by saving it again. This is planned to be fixed in the near future.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, online match issues with Mii Fighters should be resolved. Apart from this, Nintendo says it's also resolved a problem with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a>. As documented in its backwards compatibility PDF, "the frame rate goes to 30 frames per second during football matches in Play Globally (the speed does not change).</p>
<p>According to the title's eShop page, this has now been updated:</p>
<h3>Nintendo Switch Sports - Nintendo Switch 2 Compatibility</h3>
<p>Supported - Game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><strong>Updated: 06/19/2025</strong></p>
<p>Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update.</p>
<hr>
<p>Again, both of these titles were already flagged on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/?srsltid=AfmBOor8Tut3SZbnGbzhkc8DvoSvTHxmahk-PbAEP5aDct6q2TKARuOK">backwards compatibility page</a> and were scheduled to be fixed. Nintendo also released game updates for certain other titles yesterday to resolve some backwards compatibility issues.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/en-publishings-level-up-pets-sidekicks-ttrpg-supplements-brings-enhanced-companions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EN Publishing has announced a new <em>Level-Up</em> supplement for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. The new supplement, <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em>, brings more complex rules and mechanics to both animal companions and support NPCs. It is coming to Kickstarter later this summer.</p>

<h2>The <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> expands on the heroic companion rules first introduced in Level-Up Monstrous Menagerie II. The supplement will contain new rules for companions alongside new player options. The supplement's contents are compatible with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-updated-dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-at-end-of-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em></a>, and EN's own <em>Level-Up Advanced Fifth Edition</em> system.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/level-up-pets-sidekicks-girl-and-unicorn.jpg?itok=s7OdthpQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/level-up-pets-sidekicks-girl-and-unicorn.jpg?itok=rYYWC09u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One major selling point of the book is advanced pet options. Has your adventuring party adopted a creature for a pet and been underwhelmed by what it can do? This book includes ways they can track, herd, or guard the party. Additionally, the pet can earn heroic features as it levels up. This can be a tougher hide to help them in fights, or some spellcasting abilities.</p>

<p>As for companion NPCs, <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> will include new rules for recruiting them. Alternatively, the book includes rules for recurring monsters and villain NPCs. Threats that grow powerful in parallel to your party whenever they pop up. Essentially, it's a villainous take on the rival party idea from the <em>D&amp;D</em> module, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-call-of-netherdeep-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep</em></a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, the player options continue the focus of pets. This includes new player backgrounds, such as Beast Friend, and feats like Bonded Companion and Ringleader. There are new companion-themed equipment like the collar of disguise or the saddle of recall. There are even new rules for evolving wildshapes, giving Druids even more options as they continue their career.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> will go live this July. Physical copies of the book are expected to ship next January.</p>

Powered by Unreal 5 Engine and enhanced with proprietary tools and technologies by the studio, <em>Blood Message</em> is NetEase Games’ first AAA single-player title, blending brutal <a title="Genres > Survival [428 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> combat with profound Eastern storytelling.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Blood Message</em> introduces a forgotten odyssey of loyalty and survival where players join Dunhuang’s uprising, taking control of a nameless messenger and his young son in this immersive third-person action-adventure. Caught in the crossfire of a righteous uprising and driven by loyalty to both family and country, players will embark on a perilous eastward journey to deliver a message that holds the fate of their war-torn homeland. Amidst the shifting sands of history, they will etch a final tale of loyalty.</p><p>Set during the final years of the Tang Dynasty, players will traverse a treacherous 3,000-li (around 1,000 miles) odyssey back to Chang’an, the heart of the Tang Empire. Cross lethal landscapes including desolate deserts and the vast wilderness of East and Central Asia to survive brutal sieges, unforgiving terrain, and overwhelming odds. The game’s setting in the last years of the Tang Dynasty provides a cultural landmark of Chinese history that frames the story with customs, culture, and rich history of the era.</p><p>How can countless ordinary people—smaller than dust—leave a mark on history? The <em>Blood Message</em> development team offers this answer: The remembrance and praise of future generations become their eternal monument.</p><p>The game invites players to step into the shoes of unsung heroes—not emperors or generals—but ordinary people driven by extraordinary resolve. As part of a righteous uprising in Shazhou, Dunhuang, the father and son must navigate a collapsing world, torn between duty to country and love for family. When history forgets, warriors remember. The world has heard too many stories of emperors and generals—<em>Blood Message</em> is an ode to the unsung heroes.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Narrative-driven gameplay anchored in cinematic storytelling.</li><li>Visceral, realistic combat blending <a title="Genres > Stealth [90 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> and survival mechanics.</li><li>A deeply emotional journey exploring themes of family, honor, sacrifice, and cultural identity.</li><li>Expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia, such as Dunhuang (敦煌).</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - the sequel to developer Level 5's 2012 Nintendo DS life sim and RPG <em>thing</em> - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-studio-announces-free-dlc-as-the-slow-life-rpg-sequel-gets-off-to-a-flying-start">getting a bunch of free DLC</a>, which we already knew. What we weren't previously aware of, however, is that its DLC will include an open-world roguelike mode.
</p>
<p>
It's not entirely clear <em>why</em> a relatively laidback, job-focused life sim RPG would want to get in on the roguelike action, but that's what Level 5 is going for. As <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250619/">detailed in its announcement blog</a>, the update - which is currently "actively underway" - will feature an "evolved version of Ginormosia, including a system blending roguelike and open-world elements".
</p>
<p>
Level 5's announcement stops short of explaining how the new mode will actually work, but it does say the update will include "engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike." Additionally, the update promises "powerful new gear", plus "stylish equipment, mounts, and a variety of unusual items." A telephone made of butts immediately springs to mind, but I suspect I'm likely to be disappointed.

<p>
And we're not quite done yet. Fantasy Life i's free DLC update will also include a brand-new character who'll "leave a significant mark on the world", plus new hairstyles and new emotes to "make it even more enjoyable for players to express themselves in-game". As for when all this will show up, Level 5 says "as soon as possible".
</p>
<p>
"Level 5 appreciates everyone's continued support and remains committed to continuously refining Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time," it concludes in its announcement post, "as well as expanding content to provide the best possible gaming experience."
</p>
<p>
Why all this free DLC? That'll be down to Fantasy Life i's impressive sales, with the game having already shifted 1m copies since its release at the end of May. Level 5 is also celebrating the milestone with a "commemorative gift code" that'll unlock an "exclusive piece of equipment", plus a "commemorative Pegasus mount" - although its post profusely apologises for mistakenly giving players on certain platforms a unicorn instead. That error should now be fixed, alas.
</p>
<p>
And if you'd like to bump that sales number up to 1m and one, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Switch, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>.

            <p>
You would think that being able to take on 14 different jobs would be enough to keep most people busy in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, but to Level-5 it seems like that won't be enough. Last month, the developer announced that because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has done so well, they'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/level-5-are-so-pleased-with-how-fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-is-doing-theyre-giving-away-a-free-bit-of-dlc">releasing a free update/ bit of DLC called Update the World</a>, and they've now offered a couple of details as to what that'll be.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Apparently, it'll be a "roguelike open world" mode, which mostly just sounds like a bit of an awkward translation, but the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250619/">post</a> detailing the mode did explain it a touch at least: "The update will feature an evolved version of Ginormosia, including a system blending roguelike and open-world elements that offers engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike." So, kind of what it says on the tin honestly. No details were shared as to how the mode will work, but there will be some new gear, equipment, mounts, hairstyles, emotes, and "unusual items".
</p>
<p>
A bit of character art featuring an evil, wizardy looking big dog creature with a mysterious set of cases attached to their back was also shown off. This new character will arrive with the update, and "plays a pivotal role in the story and is set to leave a significant mark on the world." Kind of love Level-5 just dropping a PNG of some guy almost completely contextlessly.
</p>
<p>
The team is apparently "actively working" on all this new stuff, but there's no release date in sight for it just yet. Considering how big that game is though, I'm sure you've got more than enough to be getting on with in the meantime.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Every Switch 2 Launch Game</p>
      </div>
<p>Circana executive director Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzlxpmlk2t" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on Bluesky</a> that "Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 reached just shy of 40%," which is almost double what third-party games did at the launch of the Switch 1. The Game Business did point out that improvement over the performance of third-party games on the original Switch, but also explains that "it's hard to describe these statistics as positive." That's understandable, considering the Switch 2 has had one of the most successful console launches of all time, yet an anonymous publisher is claiming that even its lowest estimates overestimated how well third-party games would do on Switch 2.</p><p>The release of this information has caused discussions over the negative impact of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">Game-Key Cards</a>, which are physical game cartridges that don't contain a game's full data and still require a download. Kelsey Lewin, owner of Seattle game retailer Pink Gorilla Games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kelslewin.bsky.social/post/3lrxrv3h7h222" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on Bluesky</a> that Game-Key Card sales have flagged. "We had very low expectations carrying these in-store but can anecdotally confirm: no one is buying these," Lewin wrote</p><p>Niko Partners director of research and insights Daniel Ahmad is less bullish on the idea that Game-Key Cards had a negative impact on third-party Switch 2 sales. "I hate to break it to people, but the 'I refuse to buy a game for my Nintendo Switch 2 if the physical version is not on the cart' crowd are both a minority today and will be an even smaller minority in five years," he <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1935721809657127138" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on X</a>.</p><p>While the third-party numbers on Switch 2 aren't very promising thus far, we'll see how these games perform in the coming months and years as more brand-new games come to the platform.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">got off to a flying start</a>, with Nintendo proudly trumpeting the console as its "fastest-selling hardware ever" just days after launch. But while things are looking rosy for Nintendo, a new report suggests third-party titles have so far struggled, with one third-party publisher saying sales have been "below our lowest estimates".
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch">according to TheGameBusiness' Chris Dring</a>, who collated some pertinent sales figures surrounding Switch 2's launch in his latest newsletter. The key numbers are that 48 percent of physical game sales in the UK (and 62 percent of physical game sales in the US) were first-party titles, if Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle is excluded; but if it's <em>not</em>, 86 percent of Switch 2 physical game sales in the UK were for first-party titles. Nintendo, for context, had three titles available physically at launch: Mario Kart World, plus Switch 2 editions of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>; third-parties released a total of 13 physical games.
</p>
<p>
Dring notes Switch 2's figures are an improvement compared to the original Switch's launch, where 89 percent of UK physical sales were from first-party games, but adds that "most third-party Switch 2 games posted very low numbers", despite the availability of some big names, including Civilization 7, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, Street Fighter, and Hogwarts Legacy (the report's source, NielsenIQ, does not publicly release video game sales data).

<p>
Speaking to TheGameBusiness, one unnamed third-party publisher painted a bleak picture of its Switch 2 launch sales, saying they'd been "below our lowest estimates". However, not every third-party release has struggled. Dring says CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 was the "best-selling third-party game during the launch of Switch 2", and did "reasonable numbers".
</p>
<p>
Dring highlights the fact CD Projekt was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">one of the few publishers not to opt for Nintendo's controversial Game Key Cards</a>, which require full downloads to play, and quotes CD Projekt's Jan Rosner as having previously said, "Do not underestimate the physical edition. It's not going anywhere and Nintendo players are very appreciative of physical editions that are done right."
</p>
<p>
As to <em>why</em> most third-parties have got off to a slow start on Switch 2, Dring suggests a number of reasons in his analysis; there's the console's enhanced backward compatibility, for starters, meaning many players (we've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-scarlet-violet-pokemon-love">some of them here</a>) are likely also delving into the original Switch's impressive back catalogue right now. That's alongside a lack of reviews covering third-party games given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtual-boy-switch-2-review">Nintendo's decision not to provide early consoles to press</a>, and it's hard to ignore the fact almost all third-party Switch 2 titles are ports of older games, which many core players have likely already experienced elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Despite all this, Dring says many major publishers have told him Nintendo is "actively trying to push third-party games this time around", so the hope will obviously be that sales pick up once players have had their fill of Mario Kart World. Notable confirmed third-party titles still to release include EA Sports Madden 26 and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, while Nintendo's big hitters include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-musical-twist-revealed-plus-dk-rap-is-included">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and Pokémon Legends: Z-A, plus Switch 2 editions of Super Mario Party Jamboree and Kirby and the Forgotten Land.

            <p>
Match-3 games are probably the purest out there, at least in terms of genre. They are so instantly understandable by pretty much anyone, no wonder there's a seemingly infinite number of them available on our phones. The issue is that most of them can't match up to the heights of a classic like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bejeweled">Bejeweled</a>, though at least every once in a while we get delightful spins on the genre like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spirit-swap">Spirit Swap</a>. Now, there's a new, quite tiny new kid on the block in the form of Sinister Sodies, a match-3 game where you set out to "purify your carbonated concoction before time runs out."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Sinister Sodies has the usual thing you'll find in a match-3 game, i.e. different coloured tiles you have to match up. The particular spin here is that rather than like in other games in the genre where you might move a tile to get a match, you have to box specific combinations of three tiles in by drawing a four-cornered box.

</span></p><p>
It sounds simple enough, but there's a fast-paced time limit, so in the first instance you have to find a spot that includes your three target tiles before you can even match them up. This gets complicated by things like tiles that explode if you draw a line through them, more and more of said tiles appearing as you make matches. 
</p>
<p>
I really like this little twist on the genre, there's a snappiness to it thanks to the timer that really helps it to feel satisfying when you just manage to make a match. Not enough to make you want to play it for hours on end, but I can see myself coming back to this for five minutes pop when I need a break from writing about the latest Fortnite update or whatever it is games journalists do these days.
</p>
<p>
I think the thing I'm most fond of is the presentation. It all looks like a piece of claymation, rendered in artist Crisppyboat's own signature style. I feel like it's a game that would have fit very well on Cartoon Network's Flash games site back when that was still a thing. Real "killing time on the family computer while your mum is getting ready for the school run" kind of vibe in the most positive of ways possible.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's already out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3752580/Sinister_Sodies/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://goblin-laundromat.itch.io/sinister-sodies">itch.io</a>, and it's cheap as chips, so you've not got much of an excuse to not get it honestly.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/powerwash-simulator-2-gets-a-funky-new-gameplay-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Futurlab has shared a new gameplay trailer for their spick-and-span sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>. The game is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in late 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="PowerWash Simulator 2: Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rLMus-sx1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer showed off a bunch of the tools you’re using to tidy up Muckingham, from your standard powerwasher to a buffing thingy, new elevated platforms, isolated powerwashing jobs for pianos and rugs, and plenty more. It ended off with the new cat companion, Ulysses, who you can pet and take with you on every job. Cute!</p>
<p>But there’s more! PowerWash Simulator 2 will have multi-stage jobs, home case customisation, and even some mysteries to uncover around Muckingham.</p>
<p>We loved the original Powerwash Simulator, awarding it an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/22/powerwash-simulator-review/">8/10 for its original version</a>, and 9/10 for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/powerwash-simulator-vr-review/">excellent VR rendition</a>. Talking about the original we said, “PowerWash Simulator is a rare example of a game that more than lives up to its expectations. If the calming loop of the gameplay gets you then you’ll easily find hours of your life disappearing along with the dirt and grime. Add in some interesting challenge modes and a story that caught me by surprise and you have a game that more than deserves your time”. We then called the VR version, “the ultimate evolution of Futurlab’s astoundingly satisfying smash hit, effortlessly translating the calming clean ’em up to virtual reality.”</p>

<figure><a title="Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Ganondorf face collage" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/103f98688c570/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-ganondorf-face-collage.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>You know what would make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> much easier? A herd of Epona. In terms of making it harder? How about multiple Ganondorfs? Well, you can have all that and more thanks to an exploit discovered by the TOTK community. (Thanks <a href="https://gamingreinvented.com/feature/what-happens-if-you-send-glitched-items-to-zelda-notes/">GamingReinvented</a>!).</p>
<p>With the new Zelda Notes companion app (compatible only with the Switch 2 Edition), it's possible to share Autobuild creations by uploading them to the app in-game, which then creates a QR code that you can share online. When someone scans that code in and uploads it to the game, voila, they have your Autobuild creation ready to roll.</p>
<p>Those with modded save files have been taking advantage of this feature in hilarious ways, uploading QR codes for "creations" that range from food, bubbles, items locked to shrines, and, uh, Ganondorf. Complete with a health bar and ready to absolutely destroy Link. He'll follow him absolutely everywhere, too, unless you fast travel away.</p>
<p>For something a little more relaxing than being chased by Demon King Ganondorf, there are codes that allow you to summon multiple Epona too — all of this demonstrated over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/1ledk4e/totk_autobuild_sharing_is_so_broken/#lightbox">tearsofthekingdom subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>How is this possible, though? It requires modded save data and access to a modded Switch 1 with TOTK, before transferring the save data to Switch 2. But, essentially, in the save data, you can change any part of an Autobuild to any kind of 'actor' or item.</p>
<p>So, as long as you find a QR code that lets you summon the respective item or character you want (we won't share them here, though they're relatively easy to hunt down), then you can go ahead and cause a different kind of chaos in Hyrule.</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you were wondering; yes, you can summon an army of good boys, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-nintendo-switch-power-bank-death-stranding-vinyl-skytech-gaming-pc-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been holding out for a solid deal, today’s lineup delivers some excellent finds. From a $12 power bank perfect for your Nintendo Switch 2 to a hefty Skytech gaming PC loaded with AMD’s latest hardware, there’s a little something for everyone. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vinyl collectors can also look forward to Woodkid’s emotionally rich <em>Death Stranding 2</em> soundtrack, while digital deal hunters should check out the IGN Live 2025 Bundle. Eight well-reviewed PC games for just $22.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hulu + Live TV Free Trial</h2><div catalogid="77f3624c-3861-436e-b835-55c123112a11" id="216770"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hulu + Live TV <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-get-hulu-plus-live-tv-free-trial">offers a three-day free trial</a> that allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin. This is one of the overall <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-streaming-service-free-trials">best streaming free trials</a> because it gets you a bundle of services. It is quite a bit shorter than the standard Hulu free trial of 30 days, but it's a great way to test it out over the weekend.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Final Fantasy x Secret Lair</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While boosters, Commander decks, and a new Starter Kit are up for grabs (if you can find them in stock), collectors will be most drawn to the highly coveted Secret Lair drops. Despite selling out instantly via Wizards of the Coast, these limited-edition mini-sets (Game Over, Weapons, and Grimoire) are still available through third-party platforms like TCGPlayer, though you’ll be paying premium prices well above the original $30–$40 MSRP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each set features beautifully reimagined cards themed around iconic Final Fantasy characters and spells: the Weapons drop highlights legendary arms like Cloud’s Buster Sword and Tidus’s Brotherhood, Grimoire centers on magic-wielders like Vivi and Aerith, and Game Over pays tribute to villains with cards like Spira’s Punishment and Meteorfall. All sets come in standard and foil variants, with Japanese versions available as well. If you’re considering adding these to your collection, be sure to check listings carefully and be prepared for markups ranging from $70 to $150 or more.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Final Fantasy Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's insane how quickly these cards have climbed in value just days after release, and I can guarantee you (almost) that they won't be coming down any time soon. If you fancy saving some money ripping packs of MTG FF, just buy the card you want on TCGPlayer instead and save a fortune.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild. If you got a preorder for MSRP, well played, but many TCG and Final Fantasy fans missed out. Fear not, there's still some options on sealed products available right now, including options from the secondary market with TCG Player which is around the same or lower than the pricing of big box retailers right now.
</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark. Make no mistake, they're still way off MSRP, but finding Pokémon products on shelves that haven't been marked up past the point of anyone caring is a positive. Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Most Expensive Pokémon Cards In Packs RIGHT NOW</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're not talking about vintage or out of print sets, all of these are incredible chase cards you can pull from booster packs available now. You can probably put money on their value going up as soon as their respective sets go out of print. If you don't want to spend mega money ripping open packs, market values on these single cards are quite reasonable for the most part..</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Sealed Stock</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wew're look to market values for Destined Rivals at the moment, seeing as big box stores are either fresh out of stock or charging over MSRP and what they're worth on the secondary market. So here's the full lineup to pop on your shelf or rip open like THAT Tyranitar. If you know you know.</p><p id="skytech-king-95-gaming-pc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Skytech King 95 Gaming PC">Skytech King 95 Gaming PC</h2></p><div catalogid="12468fbf-8990-4f79-9cda-997cbff2a2aa" id="223214"><div id="223214" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Skytech King 95 Gaming PC</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Skytech King 95 Gaming PC delivers serious performance for gamers ready to step into high-end territory without going overboard.

<p>Sub-layers of new info</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're all still hyped full of bananergy after yesterday's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025">Direct</a> and, if you're anything like us, you'll likely have been straight onto the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/">official Nintendo website</a> to check out further details. Standard practice.</p>
<p>However, as we've found over the past 24 hours or so, jumping onto the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaca/index.html?m=stage">Japanese version of the site</a> reveals a Donkey Kong Bananza section that has a bunch more details than we've got so far in the US/UK. Indeed, our man Zion has been breaking down the Direct, whilst also digging into new deets he's uncovered on said Japanese site, and well, there's lots juicy stuff to pick at here.</p>
<p>You can check out Zion's video for yourself up top for a much more detailed round-up of everything, but of particular interest here is that he's been looking at the sub-layers (that is, the levels that make up the world that you dig down through in the game) and attempting to piece them all together using both the Direct trailer and the extra details found tucked away on Nintendo's Japanese site.</p>


<p>By doing so, he's attempted to order the nine levels he believes are included, as they'll appear in the game, even digging into some of the minigames and deducing where they may show up.</p>
<p>The levels Zion's managed to work out thus far <em>seem</em> to appear in the game in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingot Isle</li>
<li>Lagoon Layer</li>
<li>Hilltop Layer</li>
<li>Canyon Layer</li>
<li><strong>???</strong></li>
<li>'Ice &amp; Lava'</li>
<li>Forest Layer</li>
<li><strong>???</strong></li>
<li>'Beach'</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there's info still missing here, including two missing areas and some names that are placeholders. It certainly gives us a much easier-to-grasp overview of how this one may flow, and an early idea of just how much variety there's gonna be in this one when it drops in just a few weeks' time.</p>
<p>Other juicy details that Zion has picked out in this breakdown include some returning tracks from DK games of the past, as well as a whole bunch of other stuff that, we'll be honest, we'd never have noticed without him!</p>
<p>It's fascinating — and very exciting — stuff for anyone who's been waiting years for a new DK game. Bananza really is beginning to look like a surprisingly inventive banger, and the full breakdown gives lots of details on each area too, so go check it out!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendos-first-party-games-are-dominating-game-sales-on-nintendo-switch-2-while-third-party-published-games-are-off-to-a-slow-start/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is off to an incredible start, selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">3.5 million units globally</a> in just its first four days on the market.</p>
<p>Nintendo is selling as many Switch 2 units as it can make, but the massive hardware launch doesn't seem to translate to huge game sales, at least for non-Nintendo games. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch">The Game Business</a> reports that in the US, 62% of physical game sales for the Nintendo Switch 2 were for first-party Nintendo games, not including Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>In the UK, once again without including Mario Kart World, 48% of physical game sales were first-party Nintendo games, and with Mario Kart World included in those sales, that number bumps up to 86% of physical game sales going to first-party, Nintendo-made titles. Though you might think this leaves out a big piece of the picture by only focusing on physical sales, in cases where games were available digitally and physically, "<em>over 80% of Switch 2 game sales came from physical retailers,</em>" according to data shared by publishers to The Game Business.</p>
<p>A third-party publisher also told The Game Business that their sales numbers were "<em>below our lowest estimates</em>" for what they expected to sell on the Switch 2. The only third-party game that seems to have had great success on the Switch 2 so far is Cyberpunk 2077, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-set-another-record-by-selling-1-1-million-units-in-its-launch-week-in-the-us/">Circana reported was the third best-selling game in the US</a> during the Switch 2's launch week.</p>
<p>So, at least on a global scale, it looks like third-party publishers aren't having the best time on Switch 2, with first-party Nintendo games swallowing up all the attention. But at least regionally, according to Circana analyst and executive director Mat Piscatella, third-party game sales for Switch 2 games are doing much better than they were compared to the Switch 1's launch.</p>
<p>"<em>Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 just reached shy of 40%</em>," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzjgdngs2t">Piscatella writes on BlueSky</a>. "<em>For month 1 of the Switch launch it was less than 20%.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>It's far too early to claim best or worst this or that or whatever when it comes to Switch 2</em>."</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3lrxzlxpmlk2t" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreibt6po5g6srzn35mitsjizz2fkvfyqigwje2m6u4fxzw2zjbecn5m">
<p lang="en">Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 reached just shy of 40%. For month 1 of the Switch launch it was less than 20%.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lrxzlxpmlk2t?ref_src=embed">2025-06-19T17:15:19.742Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As Piscatella also points out, the Switch 2 has not even been out for a month. We'll have a better look at sales numbers in due time, and there are also plenty of other factors to consider.</p>
<p>For example, the number of Switch's available at launch in 2017 is nowhere close to the number of units Nintendo was prepared with for the Switch 2's launch. There are simply more consoles out in the wild, for people to buy games on.</p>
<p>And that's before getting into the fact that people buy Nintendo consoles to play Nintendo games. It's only with the Switch that third-party publishers saw more success on the platform. Piscatella also pointed out in a separate post that as of March 2025, "<em>approximately half of all US owners of either the PS5 or Xbox Series also owned a Switch.</em>"</p>
<p>Someone who has never played Cyberpunk 2077 because they don't have a console or PC to play it on is more likely to buy it now that it's on Switch 2 than someone who bought their Switch 2 to play Mario Kart, and already played Cyberpunk on their current-gen console or high-end PC, and that goes for all third-party titles that are essentially ports to the Switch 2 for games that couldn't run on the Switch.</p>
<p>Again, as Piscatella pointed out, it's far too early to really say how third-party games will perform on the Switch 2. With the new hardware being capable of more 'impossible ports' like the Witcher 3 running on the original Switch, and more new games potentially releasing on Switch 2 alongside PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions, the Switch 2 could still be a good platform for third-party games to thrive.</p>
<p>Though, seemingly that's contingent on whether Nintendo has a new Mario game out for the console at the same time.</p>

But if you’ve gotten good and need a harder challenge, you’ll be able to take on “Everdark Sovereigns,” which are more difficult versions of the game’s Nightlord foes you face to conclude a run.</p><p>“These limited-time versions of the Nightlords are extremely challenging and pose an even greater threat to the Nightfarers with new moves and increased power,” according to <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged">a blog post from Bandai Namco</a>.</p><p>The first Everdark Sovereign you can fight is a new version of Adel, Baron of the Night, aka Gaping Jaw. If you’ve beaten the normal version of that boss, you’ll be able to take on the new form. When you beat an Everdark Sovereign, you’ll get “Sovereign Sigils,” which you can exchange for “special Relics and other items.”</p><p>There are a couple caveats to be aware of. You can only fight Everdark Sovereigns while playing online. And Everdark Sovereigns will only be available for a limited time — the upgraded Gaping Jaw, for example, will stick around until June 25th at 8:59 PM ET.</p><p>Bandai Namco says a new Everdark Sovereign will be added every week, and over the “next few weeks,” Everdark versions of Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight will be added to the game. Other Everdark bosses will be added “at a later date.” Based on the blog post, it seems like Everdark variations will eventually return after they’ve disappeared.</p><p>At some point, the game will also get DLC that adds new playable characters and bosses.

            <p>
Crytek had a little bit of an oopsie yesterday with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown 1896's</a> 2.4 update yesterday. As soon as it arrived, there were reports of server problems and issues with buying Blood Bonds. This led to Crytek trying to fix it, taking the game's servers offline to do so, except when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> was brought back online, it wasn't with a fixed version of the new update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/594650/view/500576552635859005?l=english">but version 2.3</a>. However! It looks like the team continued work on getting it fixed (hope you didn't have to crunch too hard, Crytek staff), and the update is back and available to download.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Our team has been working tirelessly to resolve the issues that followed the original rollout, and after extensive testing and final checks, we’re confident in this new release," Crytek explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/594650/view/500576552635859184?l=english">Steam post</a>. "We’ll continue monitoring stability closely and remain committed to delivering the best possible experience moving forward." For what it's worth, now that the update is live and stable, <a href="https://x.com/HuntShowdown/status/1935431568409116845">you'll be able to redeem a code for 10,000 Hunt dollars as compensation</a> (I'd also like to take a second to note how funny Hunt dollars is as a name, couldn't figure out anything else huh).
</p>
<p>
In terms of the actual content of the update, also called the Judgement of the Fool update, it goes as follows: there's a new area called The Fool's Hideout to explore, where you can use Pledge Marks to unlock Sealed Rewards. The map DeSalle is back too, "revitalized with significant enhancements." 
</p>
<p>
There's a new Catalyst Trait too, which "unlocks powerful Conditional Trait Effects for specific Traits when they’re equipped on your Hunter." And there's also The Brute, a "formidable offspring of Ursa Mortis" that is stealthy in nature, so keep your wits about you. You can read more about the update in a blog post <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/update-24-judgement-of-the-fool-live-now">here</a>.

She used to live above ground, but for some reason she was brought to the underground world and transformed into a rock."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-confirms-super-mario-odysseys-pauline-is-your-new-sidekick-and-dk-can-now-transform-into-a-zebra-or-flying-ostrich">Yesterday's reveal of this younger Pauline, during the Donkey Kong Bananza Nintendo Direct</a>, strongly suggested she was the same music-loving version of the character seen in Nintendo Switch platformer Super Mario Odyssey, where a grown-up Pauline serves as both the mayor of New Donk City and the lead singer of a popular band.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans have been quick to highlight what this might mean for Pauline's overall timeline — and the fact that DK and Pauline's friendly team-up in Bananza is a very different vibe to the pair's usual relationship of kidnapper and victim. Does something happen to DK, turning him evil? Or have we been getting Pauline and DK's friendship wrong all these years?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza sees the two characters working together to help the teenage Pauline get back to the surface, in order to pursue her dream of becoming a world famous singer. Pauline's appearance as a singer in Odyssey suggests that she does indeed make it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Bananza looks story-wise to be an Odyssey prequel, the exact timeline here is somewhat unclear. Nintendo has never stated Pauline's age in Odyssey, or in any of her other appearances, so it's unknown how long before those events it is that Bananza takes place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But by linking the character across these games through Pauline's musical ambitions, it also highlights the fact that Odyssey's Pauline does address her kidnapping by DK — something she describes as "traumatic."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pauline has been kidnapped by DK multiple times over the years. Most notably, she is saved from DK's clutches in the original Donkey Kong arcade game, but she is then abducted again in various entries within the Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, Pauline is snatched by Donkey Kong after the she dares to pick a gift from Mario instead of DK. In Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!, Pauline is kidnapped once more by an enraged DK, upset that he's missed out on a theme park opening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later entries in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series paint Pauline's interactions with DK in a kinder light, however, such as in Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move, where the two team up to host a mini-game, and Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars, where the pair plan Mario a surprise party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does something happen to sour DK and Pauline's relationship at the end of Donkey Kong Bananza, turning the ape from an ally to kidnapper? Will we see the events of the original Donkey Kong arcade game take place within Bananza, perhaps, with Mario coming in to save the day? Or have we been getting it wrong all these years?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have suggested that Bananza will turn the Mario universe on its head by revealing that DK and Pauline are in fact friends — and that Mario has been the villain all along, effectively stealing Pauline back when she's just been hanging out with her pal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully all will be revealed when Donkey Kong Bananza arrives as Nintendo's next major Switch 2 launch on July 17, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
