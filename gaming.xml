            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>series and the beloved ape's first 3D platformer since 1999's&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong 64</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's Switch 2 Direct show,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will launch exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th, so it'll just miss the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launch date of June 5th</a>&nbsp;and won't be included as part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 launch lineup</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>game, the story of&nbsp;<em>Bananza&nbsp;</em>revolves around DK uncovering a treasure trove of golden bananas, only for them to be stolen away by the nefarious VoidCo, causing him to set out on a quest to retrieve his hoard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-minecart.jpg?itok=5qnpfEqb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-minecart.jpg?itok=4kX4NB7v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is DK's first 3D platforming outing in many years.</figcaption></figure><p>Donkey Kong sports a design inspired by his old-school arcade self in&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em>, and I think it's pretty cute. He's got a rather expressive face that lends itself well to the world in which he finds himself for this adventure.</p>

<p>The trailer shows DK platforming his way around a few open-looking environments, as well as burrowing down into the ground to explore the level below the surface.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It isn't clear to what extent you'll be able to seamlessly transition between above-ground levels and underground stages, but I'd expect that given the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">still-relatively-modest tech specs</a>, that's not going to be the case.</p>

<p>In any case, you can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, which shows off a fair bit of gameplay and DK's endearing redesign, right here.</p>




<p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games coming to the Switch 2. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, which is coming at launch alongside new versions of&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as games like EA's hugely successful&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>when it <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launches for Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>

His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc.), home theater, smartphones, photography, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At numerous points during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 event stream, fine print at the bottom of the screen directed viewers to Nintendo’s website for the full details on which original Switch titles will be supported by the new console.</p><p>As it turns out, the company has put together a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftransfer-guide%2Fcompatible-games%2F" rel="sponsored">surprisingly detailed resource page</a> that goes over all the titles it has tested thus far — both from Nintendo itself and third-party developers. And the chart below really tells the story: more often than not, last-gen games should run without any problems when the Switch 2 hits shelves on June 5th.</p><p>Even titles that we assumed might be fully incompatible — <em>Ring Fit Adventure, 1-2-Switch</em>, and the various <em>Labo</em> kit assembly games — are supported to some extent on the Switch 2 if you stick to original Joy-Cons or use other workaround methods that Nintendo spells out. At least for the time being, there’s only one game that just plain won’t work, and that’s the VR <em>Labo</em> kit. I don’t think anyone can really fault Nintendo for that.</p><p>The company also divides “games with startup issues” — <em>Doom Eternal, Rocket League, NBA 2K25,</em> and <em>Warframe</em> are among these — and “games that are playable, but have some in-game compatibility issues” into separate lists. “Nintendo is continuing to improve compatibility, including by working with publishing and developing partners,” the company notes on the site. That work will no doubt continue right up until the console’s release in early June.</p><p>Separately, Nintendo <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftransfer-guide%2Fgames-with-free-updates%2F" rel="sponsored">has also revealed</a> which original Switch titles will be getting upgrades via future patches.

Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The Duskbloods</em>, a new game by FromSoftware, is coming exclusively to the Nintendo Switch 2. The teaser trailer debuted during Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct video presentation, where it was revealed that it’s set to launch in 2026 with famed <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Dark Souls </em>director Hidetaka Miyazaki at the helm. No other details were provided.</p><p>The trailer and name are very evocative of <em>Bloodborne</em>, the cult classic title that’s remained exclusive to Sony’s PlayStation consoles. But according to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1907432474759569770">a post by Nintendo of America on X</a> and <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/article/250402_1.html"><em>The Duskbloods</em> website</a>, the new title differs in that it’s a player vs player vs enemies (PvPvE) format multiplayer game. FromSoftware may be known for single-player focused epics (with limited co-op) like the <em>Dark Souls</em> series and <em>Elden Ring</em>, but well before <em>Duskbloods </em>launches we’ll be getting its first multiplayer-only game in the form of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em>.</p><p>Nintendo teased that more will be revealed about <em>The Duskbloods</em> in a Creator’s Voice article with Miyazaki, set to publish on the official Nintendo website on April 4th. That should be helpful, considering the trailer goes heavier on style and flair than it does on details. There’s definitely a <em>Bloodborne</em>-y vibe with its gothic setting, and there seem to be vampiric Twilight Blood Clan characters. And it’s FromSoftware, so there’s of course some excellent looking enemies, monster designs, and fashion for days.</p><p>The moment that hangs on the vast expanse of The Duskbloods’ world may even indicate an open-world of some kind, but I’ll leave it up to the FromSoftware lore experts to go hard on their deep-dives and dissections of the three-and-a-half minute trailer.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> is getting a Tarnished Edition on Switch 2, but you are an enlightened individual who cares not for Switchery - why else would you be reading RPS, a website dedicated to PCs, the very best console of all? Are you some kind of Nintendo fan-enthusiast-zealot, here to gloat about the fact that the Tarnished Edition is a Switch 2 exclusive? 
</p>
<p>
Is that what you think? Well if that <em>is</em> what you think, I've got something to tell you. Something that may shock and discredit you. And that thing is as follows: I'm not wearing a tie at all! I mean, the Tarnished Edition's new stuff is almost guaranteed to turf up on PC at some stage.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Catch the trailer for the Tarnished Edition below. It's out on the Switchbox in 2025, and includes the original open world action-RPG and last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> expansion, which Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">described</a> as "basically a sequel" and "a knotty, dense expansion that's home to some of the best moments in Elden Ring, but also some of its most frustrating."

You should notice a few new pieces of armour and equipment. There's one that resembles Lucatiel of Mirrah's gear from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>. The biggest addition, so far, is a new customisation feature for Torrent, your summonable spectral steed. The trailer treats us to a few glimpses of a saddle with flapping red banners.</p>
<p>According to a press release from publisher Bandai Namco, "the additional content in the title will also be available on other platforms". I know, it doesn't specifically mention PC, but come on. Why would PC not be included among "other platforms". Denying us this would be like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">denying us a spiritual Bloodborne sequel</a>, before we've even got a PC port of the first game.</p>
<p>I will keep my eyes peeled for Steam updates. In the meantime, you might want to check out <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, a co-op multiplayer spin-off in which three players farm maps for upgrades in order to fight a series of bosses.

            <title><![CDATA[Enter the Dungeon 2 gets a reveal almost a decade on from the first one, looks like more of the same, but in 3D]]></title>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enter-the-gungeon">Enter the Gungeon</a> feels like one of those quintessential indie games right? It came out almost a decade ago way back in 2016, which felt like the peak "indie games are here and they can go toe to toe with the big boys" era. It had all the hallmarks, like throwback pixel art, quirky designs, easy to pick up and put down. So it feels a bit funny to see that a sequel, quite aptly titled Enter the Gungeon 2, was revealed during a presentation for, what was it called now, the Nintendo Switch 2? Something like that, doesn't matter, point is: Dodge Roll are making a sequel, and yes, it is coming to PC too, don't you worry.
</p>

<p>
I think its first, very short trailer (seriously, only 30 seconds, can't blame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> for not wanting to cough up cash for a longer one) is a bit funny too, in that the game is 3D now. This isn't a knock on how the game looks, I think the style has been translated very well between dimensions, that giant enemy made up of tinier lil bullet guys speaks to me. But it really does show you how much the industry has changed in a decade when an iconic indie like Enter the Gungeon makes a switch like this.

The trailer didn't reveal all that much honestly, it really does look like the game but in 3D, and it is still a bullet hell, action, roguelike game. Over on Steam it says that you'll "battle through areas familiar and unknown", and that there'll be an "expanding roster of Gungeoneers full of both familiar and new faces as you rescue and extract marooned heroes from the depths of the Gungeon." 
</p>
<p>
There's no release date to be found just yet, so another classic case of "this exists, we'll see you when we see you." Fair enough! Anyway, congrats Enter the Gungeon fans, you're doing better than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">Bloodborne for PC crowd</a>.

The new console is set to launch in June and will cost $450. And it will, as previously announced, support most OG Switch games. However, two new compatibility lists from Nintendo seem to indicate that over 100 Switch games will have various issues or just flat-out not work on the upcoming Switch 2.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,195670" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Late last year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-release-date-1851690470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-release-date-1851690470">during the US presidential election</a></span>, Nintendo quietly confirmed that, yes, many Switch games will be playable and functional on the upcoming Switch 2 console. But the wording used was a bit vague and left some wiggle-room for not everything working or some games having issues. So it’s not surprising that, following Wednesday’s big Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo published two new lists containing over 100 games that won’t properly work on Switch 2. </p><p>The two lists are named: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nintendo Switch games that start up on Nintendo Switch 2, but include some in-game compatibility issues</strong></a></span><strong> </strong></li><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> Nintendo Switch games with start up issues on Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a></span></li></ul><p>The wording here is a bit vague and I’ve reached out to Nintendo for clarification. The first list seems to imply that some OG Switch games on the new console will start but will have “in-game compatibility issues,” while the second suggests many more games have “start up issues,” which sounds like they won’t boot up at all? And unfortunately, the longer list is the one featuring games with start up issues.</p><p>Some games on the “start up issues” list include&nbsp;<em>Another Crab’s Treasure, Darksiders Genesis, DOOM: Eternal, Final Fantasy, Pizza Tower, Rocket League, Super Mega Baseball 3, Warframe, </em>and <em>Trove. </em>It seems all first-party Nintendo games will at least boot up and play on Switch 2. </p><p>Some good news! All of the games listed that won’t work properly or even start up on Switch 2, with one exception, are currently “being investigated.” So hopefully before Switch 2's launch or shortly after, many of these games will be updated and will work on the new console. We’ll see about that. </p><p>The one exception, by the way, is <em>Fortnite</em>, which according to Nintendo has some “start up issues” on Switch 2. But Epic isn’t going to fix those, apparently, and instead is planning to launch a Switch 2 version of the free-to-play shooter. </p><hr><p><em>You’re reading part of </em>Kotaku’s <em>ongoing coverage of the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*lqzwhi*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5ODc5My4yODEuMS4xNzQzNjA5MDcwLjU0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*lqzwhi*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5ODc5My4yODEuMS4xNzQzNjA5MDcwLjU0LjAuMA.." target="_blank"><em>Check our roundup</em></a></span><em> for more news from the showcase </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200" target="_blank"><em>including launch games</em></a></span><em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502" target="_blank"><em>pricing information, release date, pre-order information</em></a></span><em>, and </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209" target="_blank"><em>what that mysterious C button Nintendo keeps teasing actually does</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><p><em>We’ll be continuing to update stories with news and analysis throughout the day as Nintendo pulls back the curtain on its most anticipated console launch ever.

In addition to giving fans a closer look at the hardware itself, Nintendo confirmed that Switch 1 owners will be able to transfer their system data over to the upcoming console.</p><p>According to the company, you can move your data from the original Switch to the Switch 2 by logging in to your Nintendo Account and using the System Transfer feature. This will transfer your game saves, digital titles, user profiles, screenshots you've taken, and other data (such as your settings and parental controls) to the new console.</p><p>As detailed on the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transfer guide</a> website, you will need to have an active internet connection to perform a system transfer. Once the transfer is complete, digital Switch 1 titles you own will be automatically redownloaded on Switch 2, allowing you to pick up where you left off on the new system.</p><p>In addition to being able to transfer your games over, select Switch 1 titles such as Super Mario Odyssey, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will receive <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free updates</a> on Switch 2. Nintendo will also release paid updates for some titles like Super Mario Party Jamboree and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, adding new features and functionality to the games when played on Switch 2.</p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5 and retails for $450 USD. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Preorders</a> for the system will begin on April 9.

It launched on October 31, 2018 with a free demo of Chapter 1. Then, on September 17, 2021, Toby surprised us with Chapter 2.</p><p>"The world has been really tough for everybody recently.

Toby published the last Deltarune update about one year after that in September 2022.</p><p>Deltarune is an unfinished game, but fans have praised the storytelling and gameplay so far. Chapter 2 marked the discovery of an alternate route dubbed the "Snowgrave Route." Right now, it's unclear if there are more than two routes, but Chapter 3 and 4 are a great way to find out.</p><p>Deltarune will be available on June 5, 2025 as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza, a new entry in the series starring one of Nintendo's most iconic characters besides Mario, is launching in a few months on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The new 3D platformer will be released on July 17th, a little over a month after the next-generation Nintendo console debuts worldwide on June 5th. While not a lot of information is currently available on the game, the trailer shown during today's Nintendo Direct provided a decent overview of what to expect, including a new design for Donkey Kong clearly inspired by the successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie, a colorful and lively experience that looks heavily inspired by Super Mario Odyssey.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIddsPkdX9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>With the announcement of Donkey Kong Bananza, 2025 is looking increasingly like the year of Donkey Kong. Back in January, Nintendo brought one of the best entries in the series, Donkey Kong Country Returns, to Nintendo Switch, complete with improved visuals that make it a worthwhile purchase for those who have never experienced the game before, as highlighted by Nathan in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD still delivers its share of scintillating simian escapades, but aside from a visual spit shine, not much has been added to the game to keep it competitive with the many excellent 2D platformers that have hit the scene since 2010, including its own sequel. DK completionists and newbies looking for a surprisingly stiff "Nintendo hard" challenge will be happy with this package, but others might want to wait until the big ape has something truly new to beat his chest about.</em></p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th worldwide.</p>

"Slowly asphyxiating to death in an unforgiving alien wasteland has never been so joyful", wrote he, reminding me of the over air-fried chicken nugget I got stuck in my throat last week. The original Astroneer will keep receiving updates for "years" to come, say developers System Era Softworks. As for Starseeker, it's aiming to be a different kettle of space entirely.</p>

<p>It's doing that through the power of mates, chiefly. Not just a few mates, but many. Mates squared. "Exploring deep space on the ESS Starseeker, players will need to work together with the entire crew of the space station," say System Era, "to complete planet-wide objectives across a multitude of star systems using cutting edge technology". Alec called the original's tone more "Vengaboys than 65daysofstatic" (them what did music for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>), and it definitely all seems far more bubbly and chipper than your garden variety forage-for-dysentry-berries-or-die-in-poverty 'em up. Labour's new fifteen point berries-or-poverty plan being what it is, I'm thankful for the escapism.</p>
<p>A "focus on discovery, cooperative expeditions, and camaraderie" is the vibe here. "Players will have an advanced set of tools at their disposal to tackle expeditions while they face off with the unknown perils of space- - fascinating creatures, hazardous flora, and mysterious forces that await them".</p>
<p>This'll all be done from your space station, the titular ESS Starseeker - "an ever-evolving space station where players get together to plan expeditions, upgrade their capabilities, and even hang out with other players".</p>
<p>The devs promise livestreams, vlogs, a limited beta, and a more in-depth gameplay trailer all over the coming months. You can find Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454370/STARSEEKER_Astroneer_Expeditions/">on Steam here</a>, and it's due for release 2026. I'm actually not being glib when I say I hope there's a way to talk to these monsters, they look ace.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No gameplay was revealed, with Nintendo instead choosing to reveal the project with a cinematic trailer and the promise of a 2025 release window. We likely won't have to wait too long to see how the sequel builds on the original GameCube game, but we can at least rest easy knowing Kirby creator and Super Smash Bros. mastermind Masahiro Sakurai is serving as the project's director.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see the Kirby Air Riders reveal trailer below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo released its original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> spinoff for GameCube players in 2003. It's an off-the-wall entry for the all-powerful pink hero that sees him trading out platforming challenges for fast-paced racing gameplay. It's unclear how exactly Kirby Air Riders will shake up the formula, but after more than two decades of waiting, Sakurai and his team will surely have plenty to reveal at a later date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last original new Kirby game was Kirby and the Forgotten Land for Nintendo Switch. This was Kirby's first adventure in a full 3D perspective, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review">we gave it an 8/10</a>. We said that it "successfully warps the series’ already fun mix of ability-based combat, platforming, and secret hunting into the third dimension. The post-apocalyptic setting may not be as thematically interesting as Planet Popstar, but it is still lovely and vibrant, with cleverly designed levels that make consistently smart use of Kirby’s abilities."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - Kirby AirRiders</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 is currently scheduled to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-confirmed-during-nintendo-direct">launch June 5, 2025</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-launching-alongside-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Toby Fox has been a busy guy. During today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the small white dog dev showed the first full trailer for Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4, revealing that chapters 3 and 4 will launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. It will also be available on all other platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune's first two chapters are mysterious little RPGs following a character named Kris through their adventures in a "Dark World" with their classmate Suzie and a prince named Ralsei. They borrow a number of characters and themes from Fox's previous work, Undertale, but thus far it's been unclear if there's any relationship between the two stories. Trailers lately have been referring to it as a "parallel" story to Undertale.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In today's trailer, we got our first-ever look at Chapters 3 and 4, though the look was cryptic as is Fox's wont. There was a brief look at the Castle Town with all the characters we've met so far hanging out together (including Queen!), a new battle that looked like some sort of rock show with Guitar Hero-like controls, Suzie throwing Kris into what looks like a chapel with both characters slightly off-color, and a look at two new villains. One, for Chapter 3, appears to be a creepy smile in a static-y TV (recalling the tease at the end of Chapter 2), and the other, a bit less comprehensibly, seems to be a pile of...weird jellyfish? That Suzie and Kris are running from? No idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune has thus far been released chapter by chapter, with chapter 1 coming out on Halloween 2018, and Chapter 2 debuting in September of 2021. Both of the first chapters were free. The total number of chapters is still unknown, but the menu screen has previously seemed to hold room for seven total, meainng that two more may be on the way. The anticipation for these latest chapters has only grown in the last year, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-will-100-come-out-in-2025-says-creator-toby-fox">Fox confirming last Halloween that 3 and 4</a> would "100% come out in 2025". The Nintendo Switch 2 version will include all four chapters, including the two previously released.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though we haven't yet reviewed the beginnings of Deltarune, we gave Fox's previous game, Undertale, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/18/undertale-review">rare 10/10</a>, calling it a "masterfully crafted experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The absolute madmen did it. During today's Direct covering all things Nintendo Switch 2, it was demonstrated that for the first time ever, the console will have a built-in voice chat feature thanks to its infamous C button.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase revealed how players will be able to seamlessly bond when playing their favorite Nintendo Switch 2 titles, all with the press of that C button. Discord users will note that the footage shown reveals a variety of familiar features, including a similar layout where players can watch each other enjoying the same or different titles and, with the help of a camera that can be purchased separately, even see each other. It's made all the easier by a built-in microphone that is shown to be relatively reliable regardless of each player's gaming environment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is looking to bring that gaming party setting to players to the comfort of their homes when Switch 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-confirmed-during-nintendo-direct">launches this summer</a>. That means helping a friend out by watching their game stream will be just as easy as organizing a group photo in a game like Mario Kart World. The C button's chat menu aims to be an all-in-one multiplayer feature that could result in Nintendo's most successful online push in decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has tried out a version of a voice chat before, but none of them have ever been just a normal voice chat feature like everyone else has. In 2017, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/19/nintendo-switch-online-app-is-available-to-download">it launched the Nintendo Switch Online app</a>, which allowed players to voice chat with friends while playing specific, compatible games. However, the app's functionality was limited, and critically, tied to the phone instead of the system itself. This is the first time Nintendo's ever had the voice chat actually built in, and at last puts a cap on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/18/nintendo-voice-chat-podcast-episode-1">running joke IGN's been making about Nintendo Voice Chat for years now</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're still dissecting everything we saw this morning on the Nintendo Switch 2, so check out our breakdown of everything announced today. And if you want to tune into the real Nintendo Voice Chat that's been there for you all along, you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/nintendo-voice-chat">check out our podcast page</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 C Button &amp; Camera Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything Nintendo Switch 2 voice chat is able to do remains unclear, but it already looks leaps and bounds better than the previous Switch voice chat option that required the use of a mobile app. For a better look at everything else Nintendo had to show during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, you can click <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Developing...</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade will release on Nintendo Switch 2 as one of many third-party games announced for the console.</p><p>As of writing, specific details are scant. There is no price point or release date for the game's Switch 2 port. In a short video segment, which was part of the April Nintendo Direct, Square Enix director Naoki Hamaguchi promised "more updates on the Final Fantasy VII Remake project for Switch 2." What exactly this statement means is unknown. Perhaps the sequel, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, will also see a Switch 2 port. The aforementioned video segment showed off a couple early portions of the game, with principle characters Cloud and Barrett fighting robots. Other third-party games releasing on the Switch 2 include Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Sid Meier's Civilization VII, and Borderlands 4.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrXgnDfqP4Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YrXgnDfqP4Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For anyone unaware, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-yuffie-episode-ps5-upgrade-detailed/1100-6488309/" data-ref-id="1100-6488309">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a> originally released in 2021 as a PC port and PS5 upgrade for the erstwhile PS4 exclusive. It improved graphical features and added a mini-story featuring party member Yuffie. Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a partial remake of the classic game, covering the party's journey through the city of Midgar.</p><p>As for other Switch 2 news, the newest Mario Kart game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-officially-confirmed-for-switch-2-as-mario-kart-world/1100-6530411/" data-ref-id="1100-6530411">Mario Kart World is priced at $80</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">The console itself</a> will run for $450.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 – Official System Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>One of the ideas that Nintendo considered was "Super Nintendo Switch." Nintendo decided against this, however, because it "didn't feel right to use the same naming convention as the Super NES."</p><p>"Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo," Kawamoto said. "So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p>The Switch 2's development director, Takuhiro Dohta, went on to say that the Switch 2 is not aimed at people who prefer "high-performance hardware," but instead its ambition is to be a product that can appeal to the widest possible audience. "So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system," Dohta said.</p><p>Another Switch 2 designer, Tetsuya Sasaki, said the name "Switch 2" is "simple and easy to understand." Sasaki added that it was always the plan for the system to be a "proper successor to Switch," so keeping the same name made sense.</p><p>Dohta, meanwhile, added that the teams had "lots of back and forth" about what to call the Switch 2, but in the end, they came together and "agreed that it should be Nintendo Switch 2 after all."</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">priced at $450 and scaling to $500</a> for a bundle that includes a copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>.
