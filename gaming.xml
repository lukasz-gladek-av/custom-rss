Many fans are especially vocal against the idea of Space Marines 2 turning into a live-service game, especially after Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive introduced community events seemingly as the only way to get desirable items that are only available for a limited time. This time, the pushback has been so intense that Focus has apologized to fans and assured them that a live-service transformation isn't in the cards for Space Marines 2.</p><p>In this week's <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">community update</a>, Focus Entertainment shared the following statement: "We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items. We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events. Rest assured, we are not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live-service game. The items available through events WILL be available later, for everyone. We want Community Events to be a way to unlock the items in advance, for the most dedicated players, and not to be a source of frustration and stress for everyone.</p><p>"However, that means we must provide a smooth experience in unlocking said items, which has not been the case so far. We deeply apologize for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining."</p><p>As a way to make it up to fans, the emblem-less Mk VIII Errant Helmet will now be available for free to all players who link their PROS account to Space Marine 2. Before this change, the helmet was only going to be given to players who had victories in each of the six classes in Operations mode before the Imperial Vigil community event came to an end.</p><p>Earlier this year, Focus Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-will-get-several-substantial-updates-in-2025/1100-6529135/" data-ref-id="1100-6529135">shared its roadmap for Space Marine 2's "substantial" updates</a> throughout 2025.

Game Club, a new segment for podcast Beyond! where each month we will be picking games to play as a group and talking about our experiences as we progress through them. The games will range from various classics to quintessential PlayStation games we consider must plays, and even revisiting some recent favorites to prepare for upcoming sequels (looking at you Ghost of Tsushima and Yotei)! However, for March we decided it would be a great time to revisit one of our favorite superhero games of all time: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/11/batman-arkham-asylum-review">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been at least 10 years since many of us dove into 2009's Batman: Arkham Asylum and now feels like the perfect time to revisit the game that almost singlehandedly revitalized the superhero genre. Whether it was the excellent freeform combat of snapping back and forth between enemies with precision, to unleashing devastating kicks or takedowns, or the way it trained our detective skills to solve the numerous riddles by the Riddler – Arkham Asylum gave us the best depiction (for its time) of Batman and what it would be like to wear the cowl.  
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Beyond! team is eager to dive back into this amazing game, and over the month of March we will be talking about it weekly on each episode of the podcast as well as updating this column with our thoughts and hope that you will all do the same in the comments below.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Nobody can lose their shit and start yelling quite like Gene Hackman. The actor, who was discovered dead in his home at the age of 95 this week (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gene-hackman-death-investigation-prescription-pills_n_67c1ee2ee4b0abc2b3eed500&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gene-hackman-death-investigation-prescription-pills_n_67c1ee2ee4b0abc2b3eed500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">under bizarre-sounding circumstances</a></span>), appeared in dozens of movies and won two Oscars. He did comedies, thrillers, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4X0vypRdHU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4X0vypRdHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least one kids movie</a></span>. He was also the best Lex Luthor we’ve ever had. </p><p>We took the occasion of his passing to look back at some of his best movies. There are of course the all-time classics like <em>French Connection</em> and <em>The Conversation</em> in which Hackman showed his range, subtlety, and fierceness.  But there’s also the more obscure thrillers like <em>No Way Out</em> in which he plays a Secretary of Defense caught up in a murder plot investigated by Kevin Costner. I watched it last night and my interest ebbed and flowed until the last 30 minutes cemented it as one of my favorite political thrillers from the era. </p><p>Sam Raimi’s <em>The Quick and the Dead</em>, a Western in which Hackman plays a diabolical sheriff opposite an all-star cast that includes Sharon Stone, Russell Crowe, and Leonardo DiCaprio, also comes highly recommended. I’m putting it on this weekend. Here are seven of our other favorite Hackman movies. </p></div></div><div><p>Richard Donner’s 1978 <em>Superman </em>is not only the first modern-day superhero blockbuster; it’s one of the few enduringly great superhero movies, and that’s due in large part to its ebullience. It’s just a fun, joyful movie, radiating classic comic-book enthusiasm and energy from start to finish. And Gene Hackman’s portrayal of Superman’s archnemesis Lex Luthor is an essential part of that. Here’s the key to Hackman’s version of Luthor: he really seems to be enjoying himself. He’s constantly delighted by his own evil ingenuity, explaining his nefarious schemes to Superman with obvious glee while Christopher Reeve, as the Man of Steel, looks on disapprovingly with that wholesome, Boy Scout stare of his. If anything, Hackman’s Luthor is only more fascinating today than ever, as so many of us feel the ways in which we’re at the mercy of oligarchs who view the world as their own personal plaything, something to be manipulated and destroyed for their gain, no matter the cost to millions of others. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.max.com/movies/superman-the-movie/de1897ac-3fff-48e7-98a1-9247f3a0e40b?utm_source=universal_search&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.max.com/movies/superman-the-movie/de1897ac-3fff-48e7-98a1-9247f3a0e40b?utm_source=universal_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Max</a></span></p></div><div><p>The 1970s are when Hackman established himself as not just a great actor but a movie star capable of carrying a film on his own, with acclaimed performances like his Oscar-winning turn in <em>The French Connection </em>and his legendary work as surveillance expert Henry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola’s <em>The Conversation</em>. But my favorite Hackman film from this period is <em>Night Moves</em>, a morally slippery, sun-dappled Hollywood neo-noir from <em>Bonnie and Clyde </em>director Arthur Penn. Hackman is at his most enjoyably complex here as Harry Moseby, a football player turned private eye who’s hired by an aging actress to find her missing teenage daughter Delly, played by Melanie Griffith. As his pursuit of Delly takes him into the shadowy underbelly of the film industry and beyond, Moseby is also coming apart at the seams due to problems in his marriage. Be warned, you won’t find a traditional whodunit and a conventionally satisfying conclusion here; <em>Night Moves </em>has other things on its mind. It’s a distinctly 1970s American film—disillusioned, ambiguous, rich with character and fantastic dialogue—and it demonstrates why Hackman was an ideal actor for this fascinating era in American cinema. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcm.com/watchtcm/titles/84889&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcm.com/watchtcm/titles/84889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCM</a></span></p></div><div><p><em>The Birdcage </em>is a ‘90s comedy starring Nathan Lane and Robin Williams as a gay couple in Miami who pretend to be straight to deceive a conservative senator in order to help their son who is trying to marry the politician’s daughter. It’s a very funny movie that feels ahead of its time in a lot of ways for how it depicts LGBTQ people.</p><p>And here’s how good Gene Hackman is at acting and being funny: He’s able to stand out and deliver a memorable performance in a movie starring Robin Williams and Nathan Lane. That’s impressive. So many other actors playing (literally) the straight man in a wacky comedy like <em>The Birdcage</em> would have disappeared and been overshadowed completely by the zany leads and their incredible onscreen chemistry. But not Hackman, who plays Republican senator Kevin Keely perfectly as a believably grumpy conservative who’s put into a very uncomfortable situation and comes out the other side somewhat changed. And Hackman’s comedic chops are on full display, especially in scenes featuring Lane. Track this one down and watch it ASAP.  — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Birdcage-Robin-Williams/dp/B004AZKI6W?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/gene-hackman-movies-stream-hoosiers-enemy-state-1851767152&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B004AZKI6W" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Prime Video</a></span></p></div><div><p>Few things in cinema are as pleasurable as seeing two towering actors butt heads in a film with a whip-smart script that gives their clash real stakes. The actors have never been better, and the stakes never higher, than they are in <em>Crimson Tide</em>, Tony Scott’s 1995 submarine-set pressure cooker in which a commanding officer (Hackman) and his executive officer (Denzel Washington) clash, with a potential nuclear crisis hanging in the balance. <em>Crimson Tide </em>is irresistibly compelling for so many reasons: the complexity of its lead performances, the circumstances that drive these men to collide, and the intelligence with which it engages with the nuclear threat. As Washington’s character puts it at one point, “In the nuclear world, the true enemy can’t be destroyed…in my humble opinion, in the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself.” Hackman is pitch-perfect as the cigar-chomping human embodiment of the opposition to this idea, an old-school navy officer with the capacity to kick off World War III. — Carolyn Petit </p><p>  <strong>Where to stream it:</strong> Rent or buy it</p></div><div><p>I’m not a big sports movie guy, but I’m a big fan of <em>Hoosiers, </em>and a big reason for that is<em> </em>Gene Hackman’s powerful performance as high school basketball coach Norman Dale. What I particularly like about Hackman in <em>Hoosiers </em>is that he nails the power and ferocity that tough coaches in high school tend to have, but he never seems like a jerk. In fact, he’s someone you root for just as much as the team of misfits he’s leading. Even if you don’t watch basketball or like sports, check out <em>Hoosiers </em>to see Hackman doing what he does best and proving that he was one of the greats. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it </p></div><div><p>Will Smith in his prime opposite a seasoned, paranoid Gene Hackman made <em>Enemy of the State</em> an instant classic. Hackman has always felt like an old actor, but he rarely got to play one. <em>Enemy of the State </em>let him school an electric Smith on the emerging surveillance state with grizzled wisdom and curmudgeonly charm. Plus the movie’s MacGuffin is a digital camera recording wedged into a Game Boy, because all technology is fun and whimsical until it accidentally implicates you in a conspiratorial coverup. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it </p></div><div><p><em>The Royal Tenenbaums </em>isn’t director Wes Andersen’s best movie but it’s certainly his most watchable, possibly because Hackman forced him to make it that way. It was his third-to-last movie appearance and one of his most charismatic, letting him seamlessly shift between humor and drama, dry, sardonic line deliveries and heartfelt admissions that land like an ocean liner. Hackman r<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://nytimes.com/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-royal-tenenbaums.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://nytimes.com/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-royal-tenenbaums.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eportedly hated making the movie</a></span>, which probably made it all the better. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By far the biggest, most disheartening industry news of the week was <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WB’s sudden closure of three studios</a>, including Monolith, creators of classics like <em>Blood</em>, <em>F.E.A.R.</em>, and <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>. While swinging the scythe and taking out Monolith’s much-anticipated <em>Wonder Woman</em> game, the company said it’s now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/529310/warner-bros-games-monolith-productions-multiversus-studio-closure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turning its focus</a> to “fewer but bigger franchises.” On the latest episode of Aftermath Hours, we talk about why this strategy – which might make line go up in the short term – is ultimately a dead end.</p><p>We begin the episode by accidentally bursting the dam on another wellspring of Riley Lore – perhaps the wildest yet – before we all move on to a discussion of more sobering matters: the closure of Monolith and two other WB-owned studios. WB, of course, has proven especially eager to <a href="https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumpster promising projects</a> beyond the world of games in recent years, but what portion of this sickness is specific to the company and where does it overlap with the gaming industry’s own <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-10/why-so-many-video-games-cost-so-much-to-make" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mismanagement epidemic</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about Jeff Bezos’ mask-off decision to <a href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transform The Washington Post into the propaganda arm</a> of his already-unimaginably-profitable business empire, the latest in a line of tech billionaires bending the knee to tired old king Donald Trump and cackling vizier Elon Musk. Speaking of workplaces that suck, we also discuss <em>Severance</em>, a show that <a href="https://aftermath.site/our-thoughts-and-theories-on-severances-second-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely does not suck</a>. It has the trappings of a mystery box, but so far, it has successfully maintained a focus on characters above all else. Fantastic! Keep it up! Please do not become another <em>Lost </em>or <em>Westworld</em>! Finally, we suggest games that would be improved by the addition of a Nemesis System (basically all of them; <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fuck WB</a> for patenting it).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can add a Nemesis System to Aftermath’s comments section.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think now we’re finally reaching a point where we’re seeing more misfires than regular fires. At some point, the industry’s gonna have to change course. But Warner’s going further in this direction: fewer, bigger franchises. Destined to fail. No doubt in my mind, that shit’s not gonna work out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>I hate to reup the <em>Avowed </em>conversation, but I’m seeing my friends like Chris Person and Luke Plunkett wrap on <em>Avowed</em>, and [the solution] is not fewer, bigger projects; it’s more adequately scaled projects with clear parameters. That’s what we need. It’s not limiting the flagship game to once every five years or whatever. It’s having fewer flagship games and not resting all your economic and cultural expectations on one thing. That’s never gonna work. Why not be pleasantly surprised by a medium-sized game doing really well?</p><p>Microsoft has repeatedly said, despite what people on the internet will try to tell you, that they are happy with <em>Avowed</em>’s sales, and the developers seem to be very happy with how the game is being received by players and not weird people on YouTube. I can’t help but think that Microsoft – which is primarily a company that makes software and software products – does understand how to scale these things. Why wouldn’t you look to other industry leaders in this, instead of looking to entertainment industry models that don’t make sense with how video games are created?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> There’s that meme of “I want smaller games with worse graphics blah blah blah.” It’s not even that. I want mid-sized games that are scaled to a relatively sane degree – that are not trying to be everything for everyone because a) nothing can be everything for everyone, and b) the games that are functionally that already exist. You’re never going to supplant <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em>Valorant </em>and <em>Fortnite</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>But these big companies believe that if you just pump enough money into something, you can overcome all of life’s problems. And time and time again, they fail, and the money’s no longer imaginary; there are real, tangible repercussions in terms of how it affects the people who worked on those projects. They don’t have jobs anymore. The only people who were unaffected, as ever, were the fucking executives, and they get to keep making these stupid mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita and Riley:</strong> [Pregnant pause] Yep!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think that in the case of something like Monolith, it’s especially galling because their track record is crazy. They were such a good studio in this way that was somewhat underappreciated. I think their games, reputationally, grew after they came out and had their moment. Back when <em>F.E.A.R. </em>came out, people were like “Yeah, it’s kind of this interesting shooter. It’s got slow-mo. It draws on certain types of horror cinema.” Now, decades later, people are still like “Oh man, does the AI in this FPS compare to <em>F.E.A.R.</em>’s?” That’s become its calling card. It’s this legendary game in people’s minds in a way that it wasn’t when it came out.&nbsp;</p><p>Same with the Nemesis System. Everyone’s like “Where did that go? What happened to that? That was one of the coolest things to come out of a couple console generations ago. Why aren’t more people doing that?” Monolith came up with all this stuff that should have been imitated and wasn’t. Losing a studio that has that kind of ingenuity is one of those tragedies that can’t be fully measured. You can’t understand the knock-on effects because things that could’ve happened now just won’t. There’s only an absence.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/islands-and-trains-steam-next-fest-demo-impressions-pc"><h3>Islands And Trains Are Two Of My Favorite Things</h3></a><p>'Craft tiny railway dioramas in a stress-free island sandbox' oh hell yes</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> has been getting increasingly, delightfully weird over the last couple of years, leading up to last year's time-travelling, NPC-romancing blast back to 1999. And things are about to get even wilder when developer Digital Extremes invites players to start kicking boy band butt in its new Techrot Encore update, arriving on 19th March.
</p>
<p>
Techrot Encore sees Digital Extremes building on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-motorbiking-pal-romancing-boyband-battling-1999-expansion-finally-has-a-release-date">last year's 1999 update</a> by introducing a range of new gameplay systems. That begins with the introduction of the Technocyte Coda - a corruption of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88">Warframe's in-game 90s boy band On-lyne</a>, whose members (Harddrive, Zeke, Drillbit, Packet, and DJ RoM) will randomly appear in levels until players defeat them.

It's an adversary system - originally due to launch last year until it ballooned into something more expansive - that works similarly to Warframe's Kuva Lich and Sisters of Parvos. As such, players - who'll need to have completed The Hex quest first - can't have a Lich or Sister tied to them if they want to experience the Technocyte Coda. Oh and be warned that you'll gain a steadily growing pimple until you manage to defeat your bothersome boy band foe.

<p>
On top of that, Techrot Encore adds four new Protoframes to 1999's Höllvania Mall, which has been expanded to provide access to the grungy The Round Table pub. Here, players can meet Velimir (the Protoframe of Frost) and his ex-wife Minerva (Saryn), as well as brilliant young engineer Kaya Velasco, the Protoframe of Nova. And lastly, there's the David Bowie-inspired Flare - the only surviving member of a band called Temple, and the Protoframe for the game's musically inclined, talking-guitar-wielding 60th Warframe, Temple.
</p>
<p>
All these characters have a presence in the mall, meaning you can talk to them in the world, or delve deeper into their backstories through conversations using 1999's AOL-inspired KIN system. You won't, however, be able to romance any of the new NPCs. Not even the guitar.
</p>
<p>
Away from the story stuff, Kaya's your port of call for accessing Techrot Encore's tough new Temporal Archimedea missions. These can be played for various rewards, and feature a stackable sticker-inspired boost system players can explore to gain advantages while out in the field. That's alongside Flare's new Stage Defence missions, which see players venturing out to Solstice Square. Here, their job is to protect Temple from incoming foes across three waves (all Defence missions have been reduced to three waves in the new update) as he rocks out on stage in mourning for his bandmates.
</p>
<p>
Rewards for successfully completing a Stage Defence mission include Techrot Heartstrings. These can be given to Flare at The Round Table to get Temple's blueprints if you're not lucky enough to receive them as a mission reward. Temple, incidentally, is a heat-based Warframe with a distinct musical twist, given that he - and his sentient guitar Lizzy - gain an attack boost if players manage to cast his abilities on the beat.
</p>
<p>
Pyrotechnics, for instance, causes Temple to rock out on guitar and unleash pillars of fire, which can be doubled if deployed on the beat. Overdrive, meanwhile, is a crit debuff that spawns a circle of subwoofers to stun enemies, and can extend the duration of Ripper's Wail if on-beat. Speaking of which, this one's a buff ability that heals player and makes them invulnerable for a time, all while giving fire damage to allies. Landing on the beat makes healing twice as effective. And finally there's Exalted Solo, which turns Lizzy into a flame thrower (because why not!) that can be augmented with additional electricity attacks.
</p>
<p>
And there's plenty more! Techrot Encore also features a new Rainbow Road-inspired bike-racing arcade game known as Ollie's Crash Course, and brings new Ollie-themed cosmetics, including an Ollie floof. That's alongside a huge range of adjustments and quality of life improvents, including Warframe augments for Gyre, Qorvex, Koumei, and Wisp, plus a Pseudo Exalted Rework for Kora, Atlas, Gard, and Ash. Players can also expect a shortened Star Chart path - making it easier to access the Second Dream quest and the wild new content Warframe's added in the last few years. There's also easier Archwing crafting, plus changes to make The Duviri Paradox and the The Hex Quest more replayable. And most exciting of all, there'll finally be a way to replay Fortuna's iconic We All Lift Together cinematic.
</p>
<p>
All this will be available when Warframe's expansive (and free) Techrot Encore update launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 19th March.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-introduces-new-progression-loop-mastery-trees-abilities/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/1uXFMBPEpXS1vSH7lPICnN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new post</a> released on the official Ubisoft website, those interested in Assassin's Creed Shadows would be able to read about what is coming in the game. This post specifically focuses on the progression loop of the game, as well as the mastery trees and abilities that are available for players to use. Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on March 20, with pre-orders currently being available, which includes free access to the upcoming expansion called <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-dlc-is-called-claws-of-awaji-will-bring-10-hours-of-new-content/">Claws of Awaji</a>.</p>
<p>"Having two separate characters with unique archetypes in our feudal Japan world pushed us to rethink how we wanted to approach player progression," says Julien, Associate Game Director. "Our goal was to stay as close as possible to the philosophy of mastery and martial art."</p>
<p>Both Naoe and Yaskue will have multiple Mastery trees that they can invest in, with the trees being unique to both characters. The Mastery trees featured in the game are tied to the unique weapons that they can utilize, as well as the archetypes set for each character.</p>
<p>The weapon trees will allow you to improve your pre-existing skills, as well as learn new combos and increase weapon efficacy, which can help you progress through the game as combat gets harder. When it comes to the archetype trees in Assassin's Creed Shadows, there are multiple abilities you can unlock that will be beneficial for Naoe or Yasuke. For example, Yasuke can put points into samurai training, where he can then learn how to switch weapons mid-combo.</p>
<p>To be able to earn Mastery points to utilize the Mastery trees, you will need to level up your character, which can be done by undertaking quests and activities throughout feudal Japan. There will also be unique enemies that you can take down throughout the world, which will also provide you with Mastery points.</p>
<p>The blog post also goes on to explain Knowledge utility, as well as the equipment and stats that you will be dealing with in the game. There will also be a multitude of gear sets that you can collect in Assassin's Creed Shadows for both Naoe and Yasuke. The gear and weapons can be looted from chests or can be found on defeated enemies. It's also stated that the loot is largely randomized to provide players with a sense of unique discovery throughout the game.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has released multiple of these blog posts now to provide information for those who may be on the fence about Assassin's Creed Shadows, as well as those who are eagerly awaiting the game. Thus far, Assassin's Creed Shadows is shaping up to be one of the more <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/">controversial games</a> in the franchise, with a lot of uproar across the community.</p>

Instead, it’s slowly built up a decently-sized library of first- and third-party retro games from across multiple console libraries. However, subscribers in Japan will be losing a retro game in March, even if they already downloaded it. </p><p>On February 27, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000023175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000023175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Japan quietly announced</a></span>  that Super Famicon game <em>Super Formation Soccer </em>will be removed from the Japan’s Nintendo Switch Online service on March 28.</p><p>Nintendo confirmed that even players who have already downloaded and installed the game on their Switch consoles will no longer be able to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Soccer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Soccer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S<em>uper Formation Soccer</em></a></span> after March 28. </p><p>At the moment it appears that this title is only being removed from Nintendo Switch Online in Japan. In America the game was released as <em>Super Soccer </em>for the SNES. So far Nintendo hasn’t announced plans to remove this version from  NSO’s classic catalog over here. That might be because while <em>Super Formation Soccer </em>was published by Spike Chunsoft in Japan, worldwide the game was published by Nintendo. So it would appear that whatever deal was in place to license the game is expiring soon in Japan, but that deal likely doesn’t apply in regions where<em> Super Soccer </em>was published by Nintendo itself.</p><p>While I doubt there was a giant audience for <em>Super Soccer </em>on Nintendo Switch, it’s still bad news to see a game removed from the classic catalog. </p><p>Although games are removed from Game Pass and PS Plus all the time, people can still buy those games digitally. With Nintendo, these games are locked behind the NSO subscription service and once removed, you can no longer play them on Switch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770?_gl=1*1dotjpl*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc3NjIzNy4yMTguMS4xNzQwNzc3NDIwLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770?_gl=1*1dotjpl*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc3NjIzNy4yMTguMS4xNzQwNzc3NDIwLjYwLjAuMA..">Just another good reason why Nintendo needs to bring back the Virtual Console for Switch 2</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Games always ask you to calibrate this before playing by making you play a little watermark-balancing mini-game, but I found that baseline to be wildly over-tuned. Turning the first two brightness sliders all the way down and keeping the third slider where it would normally be helped up the contrast for me and cut down on the sludge graphics, at least a little bit. </p><h2 id="h480846"><a id=""></a>Juice that saturation on your display</h2><p>This setting isn’t in the game but specific to whatever display you’re using. I jacked up the saturation and contrast to try and bring out more definition and color and that also helped. Now, if you like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ more washed-out look, then by all means embrace it. But these are two things you can do to help mitigate it if you choose. The game also looks way better overall <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ethangach/status/1895554770813010257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1895554770813010257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during the world’s daytime and when there aren’t storms</a></span>, so another hack is to just try to prioritize hunting during those times (unfortunately certain beasts only emerge when it’s ugly out). </p><h2 id="h480847"><a id=""></a>Turn off motion blur</h2><p>If you play a lot of games you probably instinctively do this already. If not, here’s your perennial reminder to toggle motion blur off so the game looks sharper and less blurry during combat. </p><h2 id="h480848"><a id=""></a>Turn on Felyne Language</h2><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> defaults to your Palico pals speaking in English, but you can change it so they speak in their native cat tongue instead. This way they’ll meow and purr at you during combat and exploration but you can still understand what they’re saying thanks to subtitles. It makes the experience much more immersive. Also yay cats!</p><h2 id="h480849"><a id=""></a>Boost the field of view</h2><p>Hunting monsters is hard when they’re taking up the whole screen and you can barely glimpse the read of the battlefield. You can dial back the camera to show you more of the world by bumping up the camera distance up. There are definitely times when it can be fun and cinematic to have things more zoomed in, but on the whole the wider lens helps a lot. </p><h2 id="h480850"><a id=""></a>Just say no to Seikret auto explore</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-tips-guides-items-pause-weapon-1851766658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-tips-guides-items-pause-weapon-1851766658">The Seikret is amazing</a></span> but also loves to wonder off on its own when you don’t have a next objective selected. This default for the mount to auto explore the area can be turned off so you’re not constantly fighting it or confused if it’s actually taking you where you want to go or just randomly wandering around for no reason. </p><h2 id="h480851"><a id=""></a>Turn off some of the UI</h2><p>Exactly how immersive do you want to make <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>? That’s a question every player has to answer for themselves. Once you have the controls down pat, especially the quick commands, you can get away with very little onscreen help. But in the beginning I recommend at the very least turning off the control scheme help in the top right corner. You’d think it would disappear on its own after the tutorial but it doesn’t. Once you have your radial dial commands figured out, you can turn the item bag bar off too. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Minecraft's live-action movie adaptation is almost upon us, and with its 4th April release date looming, Warner Bros. has shared a "final" trailer - giving us a quick glimpse of Jack Black's Nether region, as well as Jennifer Coolidge in a still-mysterious role.
</p>
<p>
For this fourth and final trailer, the bombastic action of earlier showings is cranked even higher, as huge armies of classic Minecraft mobs - including Piglin Brutes and Iron Golems - amass for some sort climactic set-piece battle. That's balanced out by some sillier moments, but none of this is likely to win over anyone who's previously been put off by the <em>ugliness</em> of it all.
</p>
<p>
We get even more of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-its-villagers-and-they-are-sight-for-sore-eyes">those nightmare villagers</a>, as well as Ghasts that looked like they've just slipped in from some eldritch dimension. I'm still not convinced by the Creepers either, given what I'd always assumed were a sort of sentient cactus have been reimagined as angry shoeboxes covered in astroturf. Thank goodness for Jennifer Coolidge, then, who immediately improves the situation at the end of the trailer, simply by being Jennifer Coolidge.

<p>
The Minecraft movie, if you haven't been keeping up, follows four "misfits" - played by Sebastian Hansen, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Jason Momoa - who're suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into a "bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination". To get back home, they'll need to embark on a magical quest with help from Jack Black's Steve.
</p>
<p>
I can't honestly say the Minecraft movie is something I'll personally be rushing out to watch based on everything Warner Bros. has shown so far, but it does at least look like the kind of harmlessly amusing fluff that - between its silly gags and mild peril - should shut the kids up for an hour or two. And if that suits, it's coming to cinemas on 4th April.

In other Minecraft news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">Netflix's animated Minecraft series</a> is getting closer to release, and there's some real-world Minecraft on the way too, as Alton Towers owner Merlin Entertainments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-attractions-set-to-open-in-uk-and-us-as-85m-deal-with-alton-towers-owner-signed">readies to open a number of Minecraft attractions</a> in the UK and US.

            <p>RPS's corporate daddy has announced that IGN Live is returning this June. The in-person event aims to fill the void left by E3, with playable demos in LA and livestreams of game reveals and panels for those who can't attend.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now in its second year, IGN Live features games but also announcements about films, television and comic books, with those who pick up tickets able to expect "exclusive reveals, celebrity panels, game demos, photo ops, exclusive merch, gaming stations, screenings, lounges, live episodes of IGN shows" and more, according to the announcement. The event takes place at <a href="https://events.magicboxla.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAlPu9BhAjEiwA5NDSA7E0qlQ12-DimO_VnecLCmnEAbmaBe5CYy1OSojTVky-q3oi9jEyihoCxrAQAvD_BwE">Magic Box &amp; The Reef</a> in Downtown LA, and those interested in tickets can <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/">sign up to be notified when they go on sale</a>.
</p>
<p>Last year's IGN Live featured news and announcements from Microsoft, Ubisoft, Razer and Nvidia, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-announcements-from-ign-live-2024">among others</a>.
</p>
<p>RPS has yet to get involved with IGN Live, but we're no strangers to making a mess of events held by our corporate dads. Remember when we turned EGX Rezzed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-miss-rezzed-so-much-that-we-turned-it-into-a-free-tabletop-rpg">into a tabletop game</a>, permamently transformed the TF2 voice cast into a comedy troupe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/pax-east">with RPS@PAX</a>, and had Nate share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FoozFca88Y&amp;ab_channel=EGX">the true history of Jason Statham in videogames</a> across several continents? IGN, let us on your stage.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
IGN Live will return this June for a second year, with plans for an even bigger physical event in Los Angeles during the summer's annual game announcement season.
</p>
<p>
Held once again at LA's Magic Box downtown event space, IGN Live (organised by Eurogamer's parent company, IGN Entertainment) will feature various hands-on oppurtunities, plus a stage with fresh reveals and trailers, interviews and celebrity panels.
</p>
<p>
Last year, IGN Live welcomed Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> to the stage, and featured over 100 gaming stations. The plans for this year's edition are even bigger, organisers have said.
</p>
<p>
For those across the pond, more details on dates and tickets, when announced, will be available at <a href="http://ign.com/live">IGN.com/live</a>. Alternatively, you'll be able to follow the biggest announcements live online.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/e3-is-officially-dead">E3 might be dead and buried</a>, but the beginning of June remains a time we're all glued to the internet to find out what's next from the games industry.
</p>
<p>
Expect the usual glut of publisher shows around the same time, including the regular conferences from Microsoft, Sony, Ubisoft and more - and hopefully more from Nintendo as it gets ready to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/streamer-secures-full-combo-for-the-most-infamous-guitar-hero-song-at-200-speed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Clone Hero streamer and content creator CarnyJared has completed a full combo (FC) for DragonForce’s infamous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock"><u>Guitar Hero 3</u></a> song Through the Fire and Flames — at 200% speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The streamer's description of the event says it all: “IT. IS. OVER.” Posted yesterday, February 27, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhV9b0CiAtU&amp;t=5s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded evidence</a> of the unbelievable feat and world record CarnyJared managed to pull off while streaming. As he launches into his final, successful attempt at hitting all 3,722 notes without missing a beat, on-screen text reminds viewers that this grand finale is the result of nine months of practicing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am rightfully thankful for everybody that has supported me throughout this ridiculous grind. I have the best supporters on the entire platform of Twitch and YouTube,” CarnyJared explains in the video’s description.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We all spent an unfathomable amount of time staring at the same 3,722 notes, figuring out any possible way to hit them more efficiently. Somehow it worked out, and somehow I am able to sit in front of this computer which you have all cumulatively provided to me, and make a living playing Clone Hero.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— CarnyJared (@CarnyJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/CarnyJared/status/1895007995852951808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Through the Fire and Flames running at regular speed can be a lot to process for the untrained eye, so watching CarnyJared blaze through the song at 200% speed feels completely incomprehensible. There’s not much else to say; FCing a seven-and-a-half-minute song in just over three minutes is extremely impressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Achieving an FC on the open-source Guitar Hero-like known as Clone Hero requires playing a song in its entirety without missing a single note. On-screen stats in the streamer’s video reveal that he’s reached nearly 2,000 FC runs past the song's first bridge, only 662 past its second bridge, and 227 to its solo section. The Through the Fire and Flames 200% FC you see today marks only the fourth time CarnyJared has managed to pass the solo.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a moment that will live with me forever.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am blessed every single day to wake up and have food in the kitchen, and a place to sleep because of you amazing group of people,” CarnyJared adds. “And I also thank my family, who has not only supported me my whole life, but they all specifically watched and supported this entire grind at my lowest and highest points. This is a moment that will live with me forever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He called the Through the Fire and Flames 200% FC the “hardest thing” he’s ever done in his life, so the celebration that follows his successful run tracks with the effort he’s put into completing it throughout the last nine months. For those interested in seeing how such an inhuman achievement can be accomplished in the world of Guitar Hero and Clone Hero, CarnyJared teased that fans can expect a “1 hour+” documentary in the next few months.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CarnyJared?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CarnyJared</a> CarnyJared full combos Through The Fire and Flames on 200% speed <a href="https://t.co/bscIumlvhy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bscIumlvhy</a></p>— Livestream Fails (@LSF_Forwarder) <a href="https://twitter.com/LSF_Forwarder/status/1895045223983591471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">For more on how the Guitar Hero community is keeping the game alive, you can watch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crkd-reveals-its-new-guitar-controller-and-how-it-builds-on-guitar-heros-legacy-ign-fan-fest-2025"><u>music game streamer Acai test out CRKD’s new guitar controller</u></a> in Fortnite Festival as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">IGN Fan Fest 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

While smaller edits to your character — say, hair color or voice pitch — won't consume a voucher, more extensive edits <em>will </em>require a voucher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can edit hair, eyebrow color, facial hair, makeup and clothing from the Appearance Menu in tent without using a voucher," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289620/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_ThreeVoucher_Pack/?curator_clanid=44795648" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">description on the Steam page states</a>.

With Capcom's current system, there's a hard cap to how many times a player can return to the creator and edit their hunter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"On top of having to pay in MH, there's a hard limit where you can never customise that character again once you've used all the available vouchers.

"When I return to a game I haven't played for a while I like to change my character's looks to keep it fresh, but I just don't bother in Monster Hunter and whack a helmet on lmao."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The system itself is fairly reminiscent of some MMOs where making a "new character" might require an additional sub or added cost.

On the negative side, the complaints seem clear: "It's not ideal, but I can live with cosmetics 'DLC', but limiting character edits is a bit much, should be free and unlimited."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rebuttal, the positive reviews stress how little the Vouchers impact the game itself: "The amount of people that will never actually read, or actually use the in-game feature that allows this shocks me. But then again, it's the internet here we're talking about."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The whole kerfuffle feels reminiscent of Dragon's Dogma 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-breaks-capcom-steam-records-amid-microtransactions-furore">where a legion of microtransactions rolled out at launch and immediately garnered frustration</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">I like robots--especially comically large ones armed with various weapons. When I received an invitation to visit Amazing Seasun Games' Irvine, California office to try out their latest title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/">Mecha Break</a>, all I really knew going into it was that I'd be playing a game featuring really big robots armed with various weapons. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting (other than access to the aforementioned giant robots), but I <em>certainly</em> wasn't expecting to fall in love.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of Amazing Seasun Games' previous titles were unknown to me, and all I'd seen of Mecha Break were some impressive trailers. When I finally sat down to take the free-to-play mech-based third-person hero shooter for a test-fly, I was admittedly a bit apprehensive. The live-service hero shooter market is oversaturated enough as it is, and it's a tough genre to stand out in. Is Mecha Break up to the task? So far, the answer appears to be "yes."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452072-mb1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452072" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452072-mb1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452072"></a><figcaption>Mecha Break is mech-nerd heaven.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452072-mb1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game features a cast of 13 different mechs--referred to in-game as Strikers--each with their own set of unique weapons and abilities. When selecting a Striker, players can look at a graph showing that particular mech's strengths and weaknesses. Some Strikers are great for lone-wolf playstyles, some are better at supporting or defending one's team, and some are a combination of both. Each Striker feels surprisingly well-balanced--while I quickly fell in love with a specific Striker that fit my preferred playstyle (more on that in a bit), I never felt that one Striker was too overpowered or underpowered.</p><p dir="ltr">But before I get into the nitty gritty of Mecha Break's gameplay, I have to take a second to praise the game's absolutely phenomenal character creator. Before you set foot in a mech, you must first create the character who will be piloting it. You can pick from a series of masculine and feminine preset characters, but those options can then be customized. At most, I was expecting a simple customization screen that might let me choose from a handful of hairstyles and colors. What I was not expecting was a character creator so detailed it rivals that of RPGs like Cyberpunk 2077. While there aren't many body shapes to choose from, the sky's the limit when it comes to everything else.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can customize their pilot's hair color (including roots and tips), every part of their eyes (from sclera to pupil) and other facial features, their makeup (including eyeshadow, eyeliner, blush, lipstick, and lip gloss), scars and tattoos, and more. Outfit colors can also be customized on an extremely detailed level, and players are given the ability to choose from a wide variety of colors. I had to physically tear myself away from the character creator--one could easily spend an hour or more perfecting their pilot's look. In the end, I had a female pilot with heart-shaped pupils, impeccable makeup, and beautifully animated waist-length hair with a black-to-purple ombré dye job. While playing, I encountered pilots with equally varied looks, including one who was wearing a sailor uniform and had a PC monitor for a head. (I later learned this pilot belonged to none other than Amazing Seasun Games CEO and Mecha Break Game Director, Kris Kwok, who joined us for a few matches.)</p><p dir="ltr">Additional customization options like clothing colors, hairstyles, tattoos, and eyeliner designs can be purchased using an in-game currency that you earn for free while playing the game, which is a plus. After just a few hours, I had more than enough currency to customize every inch of my pilot ten times over. While items like pilot outfits will likely be sold via an in-game store when the game is released, the build I played allowed for plenty of customization without the need for players to spend real-life currency. Oh, and players can also customize their Striker as well as its pilot, using the same in-game currency.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452073-mb2pilot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452073" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452073-mb2pilot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452073"></a><figcaption>Character customization is extremely detailed, and doesn't cost a dime of real-life currency.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452073-mb2pilot.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After reluctantly dragging myself away from the incredibly detailed character creator, I climbed into a Striker and tried out three game modes. The first was your standard 3v3 team deathmatch-style mode. The second was a 6v6 mode that really leaned into hero shooter mechanics, with different maps having different objectives--one map had my squad protecting a moving payload from an enemy team as it traveled across the map, while another saw us fighting to control a series of three map points in a king-of-the-hill-style match. The third mode, called Mashmak, is Mecha Break's "signature mode," according to its developers.</p><p dir="ltr">Mashmak is a PvPvE mode that sees 10 three-player teams dropped into an absolutely <em>enormous</em> map, where they must defeat both AI-controlled enemies and player-controlled squads, collect loot, and--if they want to keep that loot--reach an extraction point. The extraction point appears 10 minutes in, but you don't have to hit it immediately, as another extraction point will spawn every five minutes for the remainder of the match. But you don't want to wait too long--after 15 minutes, a Pulse Storm will begin devouring the map. You can delay this to some degree by destroying some of the drones controlling the storm, but ultimately, the appearance of the Pulse Storm is your sign that it's time to extract as soon as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to being visually appealing, Mecha Break's Mashmak maps are absolutely enormous. Each of the game's Strikers has the ability to fly long distances (though some have bigger fuel reserves than others), and during the preview event, we were told that even if the Strikers had infinite fuel reserves, it would still take roughly <em>10 minutes</em> to fly from one end of the map to the other. Mecha Break's maps aren't just wide, however--they also have a huge amount of verticality. Players can fly up and over the side of large mountains which, in most games, are usually put there to keep players penned in. This is not the case with Mecha Break--if you can see it, you can fly over it. Of course, there's a limit--fly too high and an alert will appear on screen alongside an out-of-bounds timer, signaling players to lower their altitude--but I didn't often find myself flying too close to the sun.</p><p dir="ltr">One might imagine that with a map this big, keeping a squad together might be difficult, but in my experience, that wasn't the case. Mecha Break's Strikers fly fast and far, fuel reserves replenish quickly, and as long as you're communicating with your team, you're unlikely to find yourself in a situation where your squad is too far away to help.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452121-mb6airborne.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452121" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452121-mb6airborne.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452121"></a><figcaption>Mecha Break's maps are absolutely enormous, and quite beautiful.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452121-mb6airborne.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking of going airborne, flying in Mecha Break feels <em>amazing</em>. The game's developers lean into airborne combat, rather than shy away from it, so each Striker has decent fuel reserves and can stay airborne for quite a while. I played the game with both mouse-and-keyboard controls and an Xbox controller, and both input methods felt equally seamless when I took to the sky.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat, too, felt seamless and satisfying. I played around with a few different mechs, but quickly found my favorite Striker in Alysnes, an agile, sword-wielding mech with an arsenal that also included a machine gun, a shield, and a special ability that shoots deadly lasers in multiple directions.. Mecha Break has an interesting lock-on mechanic--keep an enemy in your line of sight for a brief moment and a large red triangle will appear around them, indicating that your target is locked, and you're free to fire away. The lock-on mechanic works the same way for every Striker, and if you lose sight of an enemy, you'll have to get them back in your field of vision and lock on again if you want to continue attacking them. Thankfully, locking on doesn't take long.</p><p dir="ltr">Alysnes' gun does decent damage, but I had far more fun using her sword. With her sword equipped and her target locked, Alysnes will zoom toward the enemy and begin slashing away. If that target happens to be in the air, she will automatically go airborne as well, leading to tons of intense, mid-air fights to the death. Speaking of death, what happens when your Striker's health hits zero depends on the game mode. In non-Mashmak matches, your pilot will automatically eject from their mech, and you'll be removed from the battle for a brief time period before redeploying from the sky to rejoin your teammates. In Mashmak mode, your fellow squadmates will have to respawn you themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">In its current state, Mecha Break feels like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/titanfall-2/">Titanfall 2</a> if you gave it a can of Red Bull and let it spend the day playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/">Armored Core</a>. It's an incredibly good time, and does a great job of making you feel like you really are piloting a gigantic robot--bridges crumble when you forcefully land on them, parts of buildings break apart when you send an enemy crashing into them, and while the Strikers feel appropriately hefty, they never feel clunky.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452122-mb5lockon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452122" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452122-mb5lockon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452122"></a><figcaption>Locking onto enemies is easy--just keep them in your line of sight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452122-mb5lockon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Aside from the lack of variation in pilot body shapes and a few instances of rather silly looking jiggle physics on feminine pilots, it's truly difficult to find much to complain about when it comes to Mecha Break's current build. Unlike a lot of newer hero shooters currently on the market, Mecha Break appears to have a well-defined identity--it knows what it is, and it knows who it's for. Though there are plenty of similarities to Titanfall, it never feels like a rip-off, and while the Alysnes Striker <em>does</em> feel a lot like Titanfall 2's Ronin Titan, Mecha Break's Strikers operate differently--and frankly, more gracefully--than Titans. You can't manually eject your pilot and run around ripping batteries out of other mechs, nor does each Striker have a unique voice and distinct personality for you to grow attached to, but that doesn't feel detrimental to the quality of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Mecha Break doesn't have a single-player campaign, but there is a tutorial mission, and the game has an ongoing plot revolving around the mining of a strange, crystal-like element known as Corite. Amazing Seasun Games says that the story will be supported with additional media, including manga and animated shorts. But even if you completely removed the plot from the equation, Mecha Break could still stand firm (and fly high) on the foundation of its gameplay, which thus far is engaging, smooth, satisfying, and frankly, fun as all hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Curious to learn more about Mecha Break's development, I sat down with Amazing Seasun Games CEO and Mecha Break game director Kris Kwok to find out how exactly this high-flying hero shooter got off the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">"I came to Hong Kong when I was very young, so I got to know [of] mecha when I was very young, maybe when I was in the second or third year of primary school," Kwok told me. "So, for Mecha Break, my biggest inspiration would be these works: First of all, Gundam. Secondly, Macross."</p><p dir="ltr">Given the complexities of the game--13 mechs with various abilities, multiple modes, enormous maps--I was curious to hear what sort of challenges the development team faced while working to bring Mecha Break to life.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the Chinese market, as long as you're doing something sci-fi related, [or] mecha-related, there's almost no beginning," Kwok said. "If you want to do something, you'll be the first one [to do it]. So, in terms of hiring the right people and getting the right technology in place, we had barely anything to begin with. In the beginning, we invested in a British team. We learned a lot from the British team. Their original [idea] was to do it on PS2, a space-fighter shooter project. In the end, we've experienced several failures. The second time, we worked with the UK team, our team, and [a team of] Japanese designers. We failed. Then, we did it ourselves--we asked the Japanese designers to be our consultants. We failed. In 2021, I think we learned a lot. In this process [of failure], we learned a few key techniques that allowed us to break through. In terms of design, [that breakthrough was] the design language of mechas, [which] deviate from the traditional, low-quality toy-looking kind of appearances, and [look] way more cool."</p><p dir="ltr">Another challenge was making Mecha Break's mechs look appropriately robotic.</p><p dir="ltr">"You cannot just map the skin onto a human body, because mechas don't move like humans," Kwok explained. "We had to re-design the animation of the mecha's skeletal structure, and then we had to follow up with animations in that sense. The second [challenge] in terms of technology was hard surface modeling. We had to make it [look] really hard, very industrial looking. Through numerous iterations, we mastered that as well."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452123-mb3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452123" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452123-mb3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452123"></a><figcaption>Kwok says getting Mecha Break's Strikers to look realistically robotic was a challenge.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452123-mb3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While we were on the topic of animation and modeling, I had to know: Why add such a detailed, RPG-esque character creator?</p><p dir="ltr">"Amazing Seasun Games already has a reputable history for the past three decades of making Chinese-themed traditional wuxia games," Kwok explained. "So, we kind of transferred those core competencies over to the character-creation stage. We don't want you just to identify with the hard metal mecha surface--there's an actual person behind it: The human, the pilot, that you can eventually identify with. If you get to create a character that physically looks like you, the player, you will have a stronger sense of immersion in the world. <em>You</em> are playing that mecha, <em>you</em> are the pilot."</p><p dir="ltr">Amazing Seasun Games has held a number of community playtests, so the next thing I wanted to know was how player feedback has shaped Mecha Break's development. Kwok told me that he and his team have received a ton of player feedback regarding the game's user interface and gameplay balance.</p><p dir="ltr">"In terms of the feedback that we've gotten, mostly it's in terms of the product itself, the UI, the experience, etc.," Kwok said. "So we're working on that too. And the balance takes time, you know? Nobody can get it right the first time. I'm not surprised that we've gotten a lot of feedback in terms of balance as well, and the players had expectations of PvE in addition to PvP."</p><p dir="ltr">It was at this point, Kwok said, he and the team were faced with a monumental decision: Should there be a single-player campaign?</p><p dir="ltr">"A [single-player] campaign is a one-time-through kind of deal," Kwok said. "So we kind of decided against it."</p><p dir="ltr">Another aspect I was curious about was balance. My experience with Mecha Break was smooth and seamless, and there was never a time where I felt one of the game's 13 mechs had a massive advantage over the others, or a blatant weakness in need of addressing. I asked Kwok how on Earth the team went about balancing the game's lineup of mech-heroes, and which mech was his favorite. The answer truly surprised me.</p><p dir="ltr">"So, first of all, as the producer and designer of all that--I'm not talking about the aesthetics or the outward appearances [of the mechs], but the weaponization was all done by me, myself--for me, each of them is like my own child," Kwok told me, explaining that he had personally spent hundreds of hours playing and perfecting each mech. "So, it's hard for me to tell you which one I like the most, because I had to play each one of them many times, try a lot of things, and constantly modify them.</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course, balance is a very, very difficult process. So in this process, the question is, 'Which one is the most difficult to balance?' I can't say which one is the most difficult to balance. In terms of balance in this game, I'd rather stay away from the traditional buffing [or] nerfing some units, giving them more stats, HP, armor, all that."</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Kwok added that he's more focused on "the actual player's control in-game, rather than giving you a number to tell you which one is the hardest to balance. It's always an ongoing process, there's no endpoint [to] a game's balance anyway."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452124-mb4gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452124" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452124-mb4gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452124"></a><figcaption>Balancing the abilities of all 13 Strikers was no small task, Kwok says.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452124-mb4gameplay.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's clear that even while tweaking small details, Kwok always has his eye on the big picture first and foremost. When I asked what aspect of the game he was most excited for players to experience, he simply told me, "Actually, I think [I'm most looking forward to the reception of] the game as a whole. At its core, what we want to create in the game is the feeling of driving a machine gun. Whether it's 6v6, Mashmak, or 3v3, we want all players to feel like, 'Okay, I'm really driving this machine, I'm controlling this machine, it's like part of my body.'"</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm counting on the player to experience that kind of integration, unity, the pilot being one with the mech," Kwok said.</p><p>Mecha Break does not yet have an official launch date, but is slated for release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2025.
