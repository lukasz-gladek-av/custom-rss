            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Xbox Developer Direct presentation has been announced for later this month, and it will feature updates on upcoming Xbox games, including&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>and more.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/09/xbox-developer-direct-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Xbox Wire news site, the presentation will air on January 23rd. Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redfall-release-date-revealed-during-xbox-developer-direct" rel="nofollow">previous</a> Developer Direct <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-2024-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">showcases</a>, it'll offer "an in-depth look at upcoming titles, how they're being created, and who's creating them".</p>

<p>The show will begin with a new look at Compulsion Games' action-adventure title&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight</em>, and it'll continue with a trip to France to check in with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>developer Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-south-of-midnight.jpg?itok=N3pntcyK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-south-of-midnight.jpg?itok=c097vuwL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>South of Midnight&nbsp;</em>is just one of the games that will be featured at this month's Xbox Developer Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>Following those two games, the presentation will switch focus to&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, which is being developed by id Software over in Texas.</p>

<p>Perhaps most tantalizingly, though, Xbox says the showcase will end with a visit to a "surprise location" in order to see "another studio's brand new game". I wonder who that could be?</p>

<p>As ever with Developer Direct showcases, you probably shouldn't expect any extra reveals beyond what's been promised by Microsoft; outside of the "brand new game" that's being teased, it's likely the show will focus on the aforementioned three games.</p>

<p>As for what will be revealed regarding the three games outlined above, I'd be surprised if we didn't get a release date for&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>at the very least, since the game is currently penciled in for a 2025 launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-developer-direct.jpg?itok=lg1cyQ6O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-developer-direct.jpg?itok=9rBDTFXN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will we get a&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>release date during this month's Xbox Developer Direct?</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox is promising a "full game reveal" for&nbsp;<em>The Dark Ages</em>, as well as a "deep dive" into&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight&nbsp;</em>and a behind-the-scenes look at&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur</em>. Developer Direct shows are traditionally more focused on dev processes than sizzle reels, so expect some interesting insider tidbits.</p>

<p>At any rate, the next Xbox Developer Direct will air on January 23rd at 1pm Eastern (that's 10am Pacific). Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong and his pal Diddy are two of Nintendo’s longest-serving mascots. The duo is due to hit screens again in Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, and the release date is close.</p>



<p>Nintendo has decided to halt production of new Donkey Kong for now games in favor of ports. Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze was released 11 years ago now—representing the most recent “new” DK game. It was ported to Switch in 2018, and Nintendo has decided to go even further back and port <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong: Country Returns</a> to Switch as well.</p>



<p>I’m not sure if this is a case of the Switch being at the end of its lifecycle ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Regardless, it never hurts to see Donkey Kong again! The big, lumbering mammoth of a monkey is here, and Country Returns on the Switch likewise.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-donkey-kong-country-returns-switch-release-date">When is the Donkey Kong Country Returns Switch Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Make way for Donkey. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Donkey Kong Country Returns release date for Nintendo Switch is January 16.</strong></p>



<p>Yep, get your fingers out and start counting. The HD port of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Donkey-Kong-Country-Returns-HD-2590475.html?nsuid=70010000084603#Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Country Returns</a> is gearing up to grace the Switch mere days from now. I’d say it looked pretty decent back in the day on the Wii, but a 2024 Switch release is worlds apart. </p>



<p>It’s also getting extra levels featured in the 3DS port, along with all the original features:</p>



<ul>
<li>Over 80+ levels</li>



<li>9 Worlds</li>



<li>Boss Battles</li>



<li>Lots of collectibles</li>



<li>Time Attack levels</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Local co-op</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-switch-release-time">Donkey Kong Country Returns Switch Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>We expect Donkey Kong Country Returns on Switch to release at midnight everywhere.</strong></p>



<p>If games get a special release time, it’s usually announced ahead of launch. So far, we haven’t seen anything to suggest otherwise, so a midnight launch in your region is probably likely. Different timezones get to play Country Returns HD first—something I suffer from being in the UK—and DK fans will be going bananas for release day.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-donkey-kong-country-returns-switch-platforms">All Donkey Kong Country Returns Switch Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Yep, Nintendo Switch is the only platform Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is coming to.</strong></p>



<p>Not too much to add here if you don’t already know. Donkey Kong is one of Nintendo’s most cherished brands and lives on its consoles. You can play Country Returns on Wii and 3Ds, but the spruced-up, all-encompassing port is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch. </p>



<hr>



<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is one of several games being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-releasing-in-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released in January 2025</a>. It’s a fairly quiet month, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-nintendo-switch-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest Nintendo games coming out in 2025</a> are sure to shake the foundations a bit.</p>



<p>Let us know if you are picking up a copy of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Switch. Plus, what do you think, is it time for Nintendo to pull their finger out and announce a new Donkey Kong entry?</p>

            <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he would be "delighted" to visit president-elect Donald Trump and "do everything we can" to help his administration succeed.</p>
<p>Huang was interviewed by Bloomberg following Nvidia's presentation at CES earlier this week, in which he discussed the company's AI technology and how AI will "reinvigorate" the gaming industry.</p>
<p>However, he's yet to receive an invite from Trump to Mar-a-Lago. "I'd be delighted to go see him," said Huang, "and congratulate him and do everything we can to help this administration succeed."</p>

<p>Huang is the latest tech boss to pay obeisance to Trump's regime, following Apple CEO Tim Cook, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who have all donated to Trump's inauguration fund.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, Huang would have made similar comments had Kamala Harris won the presidency instead, considering he's CEO of not only one of the biggest tech companies in the US but - for a brief time last year - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidias-market-value-surges-due-to-ai-prominence-rather-than-gpus">most valuable company in the world</a>.</p><p>It's perhaps Huang's flattery of Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk that's pertinent. Huang described Musk as "very optimistic" about the future of AI and is working on "some of the most important AI areas". Tesla is in fact a customer of Nvidia, with its AI tech included in vehicles.</p>
<p>AI has formed a major part of Nvidia's latest tech reveals, including its new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-dlss-4-on-nvidias-new-geforce-rtx-5080">GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, Huang told Bloomberg: "At the limit, artificial intelligence is the single most important technology force of our time and we're at the beginning of that."</p>
<p>Further, he specified AI will "reinvigorate" the video game industry.</p>
<p>"On the one hand, for developers, it's going to reduce the cost of creating the content," he said. "On the other hand, all of the characters that are in the games are going to be smart characters in the future, so every time you interact with them they're going to be interacting with you in a much more intelligent way.</p><p>"And so the games are going to be more interesting, characters are going to be more interesting, the content development cost is going to decline, and that's going to be really great for the industry. I think the future's really bright for video games and these virtual worlds, and artificial intelligence is going to reinvigorate it."</p>
<p>Huang's comments on AI are a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-boss-we-cant-do-graphics-anymore-without-ai">continuation of last year</a>: "We can't do computer graphics anymore without artificial intelligence," he said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference.</p>
<p>Still, not everyone shares his view on AI. While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-has-developed-an-ai-tool-that-generates-fully-playable-3d-worlds">Google works on new AI tools</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">EA's CEO</a> stated AI is "the very core of our business", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-says-ai-will-revolutionise-gaming-but-must-be-balanced-with-human-touch">PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst</a> was more tentative stating it won't replace the "human touch", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eschewing-generative-ai-in-favour-of-decades-of-know-how">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa</a> said the company would instead rely on "decades of know-how".</p>

            <p>
Following a festive bout of generosity with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-sim-wants-to-put-you-in-the-festive-mood-with-this-free-christmas-update">December's free PowerWash Simulator update</a>, developer FutureLab has announced the squirt 'em up's next blast of paid DLC, this time themed around Lancashire's premier Wensleydale gobblers, Wallace &amp; Gromit.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>'s Wallace &amp; Gromit Special Pack - which FuturLab <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1875195484605964647">sneakily teased in a social media post</a> earlier this month amid praise for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0022179/wallace-gromit-vengeance-most-fowl">new movie Vengeance Most Fowl</a> - has been developed in collaboration with animation house Aardman. It'll be whisking players to the duo's home of 62 West Wallaby Street <em>and beyond</em> when it arrives later the year.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, FuturLab promises a "cracking cleaning adventure" that'll take players - hoses in hand and a deep-seated hatred of grime in their hearts - from "charming British suburbs to cheesy celestial bodies." And that's pretty much all we know about the DLC so far.

<p>
PowerWash Simulator's Wallace &amp; Gromit Special Pack - which follows similar DLC collaborations with the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-heading-to-shreks-fairytale-world-this-autumn">Shrek</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wash-your-bikini-bottom-in-new-powerwash-simulator-sponge-bob-crossover">SpongBob Square Pants</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/back-to-the-future-cruises-into-powerwash-simulator-next-month">Back to the Future</a> - doesn't have a release date yet, but FuturLab says it's out this year and "coming soon".
</p>
<p>
It'll be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, Switch, and PC when it eventually shows up, and should - based on previous DLC releases - cost around £6.50.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23-featuring-doom-south-of-midnight-and-a-surprise-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft just now <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1877354722916458694" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the date for this year's Xbox Developer Direct. The annual appointment to show some of this year's first-party games coming to PC and Xbox consoles will take place on January 23 at 10 AM Pacific Time / 1 PM Eastern Time / 6 PM UK / 7 PM Central European Time via the Xbox social channels.</p>
<p>Microsoft also unveiled the game lineup that fans can expect to see showcased at the event. By far the most anticipated of the bunch is id Software's DOOM: The Dark Ages. The eighth installment in the main series and the third following 2016's DOOM and 2020's DOOM Eternal will actually function as a prequel, demonstrating the origin story of the Slayer in a medieval inspired setting. PlayStation 5 users will want to tune in for this one, too, since it will be available on Sony's console as well from day one. The PC version will deliver the most advanced visuals, though, thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation support and path traced graphics, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at CES 2025.</p>
<p>Another game featured in the Xbox Developer Direct is <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-compulsion-games-upcoming-deep-south-folktale-receives-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>. This is a new IP from Compulsion Games, the Canadian studio behind Contrast and We Happy Few. South of Midnight features unique stop-motion-like graphics, a setting inspired by deep South folk tales, and an action/adventure framework that, however, puts the emphasis on narrative rather than gameplay. The game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-rumored-to-launch-in-march-2025-following-tga-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to launch in March, and if that's the case, it will definitely be announced during this broadcast.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Microsoft is also hosting a third-party game this year. It's the intriguing <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-launches-next-spring-with-an-incredible-voice-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, a JRPG featuring a mix of turn-based combat and real-time elements in development at French studio Sandfall Interactive. The game will be available on Game Pass, which likely explains the inclusion here.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Microsoft has teased a 'visit to a surprise location to see another studio's brand new game'. It's really anyone's guess as to what it could be, but we're definitely intrigued.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evo-2025-lineup-leaked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-ahead-of-reveal-next-week.1077972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evo-2025-lineup-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lineup for this year's Evo tournament appears to have been leaked just a week or so before the official announcement is due to take place.</p>

<p>Per a Nintendo Life <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/oops-evo-2025s-lineup-has-accidentally-been-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the official thumbnail for the upcoming livestream apparently gave away the games before seemingly being changed. It no longer features any of the participating games, instead simply depicting a plain "Evo Announcement Show" banner.</p>

<p>Obviously, this story will contain spoilers for the Evo 2025 lineup, so if you'd rather wait for the official broadcast, which is due to take place on January 14th at 8pm Eastern (that's 5pm Pacific), then make sure you don't read on. Here's an image of Evo 2024 so you can get out before it's too late!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-evo-2024.jpg?itok=_8bDRs1d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-evo-2024.jpg?itok=c8hKlVz8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is your last chance not to be spoiled on the Evo 2025 lineup.</figcaption></figure><p>Still here? Alright then. Here are the games that were apparently featured in the Evo 2025 livestream's thumbnail before they were hastily removed.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tekken-8" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken 8</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/guilty-gear-strive" rel="nofollow"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a></li>
	<li><em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/under-night-in-birth-ii-sysceles" rel="nofollow"><em>Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes</em></a></li>
	<li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></li>
	<li><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em></li>
	<li><em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</em></li>
</ul><p>After all that, it's a pretty straightforward lineup, featuring as it does several Evo mainstays; last year's competition also featured&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>, and a number of the other games on this list.</p>

<p>Two games have notably been subbed in, however:&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2&nbsp;</em>have been swapped in for&nbsp;<em>King of Fighters XV&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike</em>.</p>

<p>While you should take this lineup with a small pinch of salt until the official announcement arrives, these games were featured in the Evo 2025 stream lineup before it was changed, so they're almost certainly the games in which you'll be watching competitors duke it out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first Nintendo Switch basically had the road to itself, and Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">instantly proved</a> just how awesome a hybrid console and handheld could be, leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">massive success</a>. The next Switch is imminent, but it will launch into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo, especially following news from CES 2025.</p><p>Valve’s Steam Deck kicked off the handheld gaming PC push in large part because its Linux-based SteamOS makes playing your games just about as easy as it is on consoles. That’s why one of the biggest CES announcements is that Valve is going to let people install SteamOS on other handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as soon as April</a>, potentially making the entire handheld PC gaming market a lot more appealing.</p><p>The first official non-Valve device with SteamOS is set to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">Lenovo’s $499 Legion Go S</a>, which launches in May. But it’s not hard to imagine a near-term future where many other hardware makers announce their own SteamOS handhelds, meaning the magic of SteamOS might be available in all kinds of interesting devices very soon. (And, hopefully, the increased competition means Valve will make the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">eventual next Steam Deck</a> <em>really</em> good.)</p><div><figcaption><em>The Lenovo Legion Go S next to a Steam Deck OLED.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>CES 2025 featured a bunch of other handheld gaming hardware, too, like the chonk that is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335423/acer-handheld-gaming-pc-nitro-blaze-8-11-specs-price">Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11</a>. It has a gigantic 10.95-inch screen, detachable controllers, and a kickstand. It’s huge! Intel and Tencent also made a handheld with an 11-inch screen, and theirs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337860/intel-brought-a-big-honking-stereo-3d-handheld-gaming-pc-to-ces-2025">has stereo 3D</a>. My colleague Sean Hollister finally got to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338654/i-finally-touched-the-msi-claw-8-ai-plus">the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a>. Razer made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24336841/razer-handheld-dock-chroma-pc-remote-play-price-availability">a docking station</a> that works with handheld gaming PCs. And in a CES panel, Microsoft promised news about changes to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">the handheld Windows experience</a> for later this year, which could improve things for people who already own Windows-based hardware.</p><p>That’s a lot of cool stuff! But Nintendo is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(character)#:~:text=In%20a%20match%20against%20boxing,is%20given%20at%20800%20pounds.">800-pound gorilla</a> in the room, and as interesting as all of the PC gaming hardware is, the Switch’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">imminent</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">successor</a> will almost certainly be a very compelling upgrade. The original Switch was released <em>nearly eight years ago</em>, so the successor will likely be much more powerful and will probably have splashy new games in marquee franchises like <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. (I’d bet already-announced Switch games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> will get some kind of boost on the next Switch, too.)</p><p>Right out of the gate, Nintendo’s new console will also have an enormous library. The company already announced its next console will be compatible with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">original Switch games</a> — a catalog that includes many of the indie hits that are also some of the best games on handheld PCs.</p><p>Back in 2017, when the original Switch launched, there wasn’t anything like it. The Switch’s successor will compete in a much more crowded field and one that’s getting even more crowded after CES 2025. Hopefully, the competition means everyone makes better hardware and better games. It’s a great time for handhelds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Transformers Reactivate gameplay leaked online after Splash Damage announced the game would be canceled.</p>



<p>Uploading by the X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/DpzLuna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@DpzLuna</a>, six and half minutes of footage reveal what the game would have been like. According to the watermarks, the footage was captured on March 28, 2023. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>







<p>The footage shows the player driving around in a car and seamessly transforming into a transformer to battle enemies.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, Splash Damage announced that Transformers Reactivate would be canceled and that a number of roles at the company are at risk of redundancy. Splash Damage said the company would “refocus” on some of its other projects.</p>



<p>“While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more,” they said. “We’re now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.”</p>



<p>Transformers Reactivate was first announced on December 8, 2022, and little about the game has been heard since then.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how many roles at Splash Damage have been affected, but Insider Gaming has contacted Splash Damage for comment.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Transformers Reactivate gameplay? Let us know in the comment, or join the discussion on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>Actor Jennifer Hale, who voices Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series, has spoken up to share her thoughts on the upcoming Mass Effect TV series. She said in an interview that she's excited to see Mass Effect become a TV show and would love to be a part of it. She also offered a piece of advice to the team making the show that she believes could make the show even better.</p><p>"I never suppose to tell creators what to do. The only thing I must say about that TV series is I want to play! Any capacity, I will be there with bells on!" Hale told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-original-cast-should-return-for-the-tv-series-shepard-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer.</a></p><p>She went on to say that the producers would be "really smart" to try to involve as many of the original cast members as possible in the Mass Effect TV series. Hale said she'd love to see her colleagues show up in "cameos and Easter eggs" or even recurring and regular roles.</p><p>"I think that would be an absolutely genius move," she said. "The voice acting community are some of the most brilliant performers I've ever met… they're the most gifted, hard working, adept, skilled people I've ever met in my life in the acting field. So I'm ready for the smart production company that stops overlooking that gold mine. I fully volunteer to be on the show."</p><p>The Mass Effect TV show was announced in 2021 but was not going anywhere until November 2024, which is when Amazon MGM Studios announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">"officially in development."</a> A show being "in development" doesn't mean it'll ever get made, though. Anything can happen in Hollywood.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">A report said</a> Daniel Casey (Fast &amp; Furious 9) is writing and executive producing the show, while EA's Michael Gamble is an executive producer as well. Ari Arad (Iron Man, Uncharted, upcoming Zelda movie) is an executive producer, too.</p><p>There are no plot details available as of yet for the Mass Effect show, but the main series follows the spacefaring events of Commander Shepard. A movie version of Mass Effect was planned at one point, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-on-why-the-mass-effect-movie-stalled-and-how-a-tv-show-might-be-better/1100-6493310/" data-ref-id="1100-6493310">never got off the ground.</a></p><p>BioWare veteran Mac Walters, who has since left the company, said in 2021 that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-on-why-the-mass-effect-movie-stalled-and-how-a-tv-show-might-be-better/1100-6493310/" data-ref-id="1100-6493310">Mass Effect TV show makes more sense than a film</a>. "If you're going to tell a story that's as fleshed out as Mass Effect, TV is the way to do it. There's a natural way it fits well with episodic content," he explained.</p><p>As for the Mass Effect game series, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">new game is now in the works now</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">BioWare's main focus currently</a> after the company released Dragon Age: The Veilguard in October 2024.</p>

Microsoft will once again hold a Xbox Developer Direct to kick off the new year, with deep dives into a small selection of upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> titles.
</p>
<p>
Xbox's next livestream will begin at 6pm UK time (that's 1pm Eastern or 10am Pacific) on Thursday, 23rd January - that's a fortnight from today.
</p>
<p>
On the schedule will be a detailed look at Doom: The Dark Ages, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and a mystery fourth game from an unknown studio. Mysterious! 
</p>
<p>
Doom: The Dark Ages has been dubbed as an origin story for the series' iconic Doom Slayer from veteran developer id Software, and is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point in 2025. Will we get a date? It seems likely.
</p><p>South of Midnight, meanwhile, is the stylish-looking action-adventure from We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games,  set in a gothic fantasy American Deep South. It looks a treat, though also currently lacks a release date beyond "2025". Here's hoping we find out when exactly it'll arrive for PC and Xbox Series X/S very soon.</p>
<p>Next up, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This is the dark fantasy RPG from French outfit Sandfall Interactive that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">we reckon has shades of Persona and Final Fantasy</a>, plus the vocal talents of Andy Serkis and Charlie Cox. Clair Obscur isn't an Xbox Game Studios title and is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point this year.</p>
<p>And then there's that fourth game. Microsoft still has plenty on its 2025 release schedule that this could be - Fable, The Outer Wilds, even Avowed - which will be just a month away. But the secretive nature here suggests something that hasn't yet publicly been confirmed. It'll be interesting to see if internet rumours of an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake bear any fruit.</p>
<p>Join us in a couple of weeks for Xbox Developer Direct, right here on Eurogamer, when we'll be reporting live.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Bandai Namco has announced that a network test for the upcoming standalone multiplayer game Elden Ring Nightreign will take place next month. Sign-ups will begin tomorrow <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/network-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on this page</a>, but the test is for consoles (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X) only, so if you're a PC player, you're currently out of luck.</p>
<p>Here's the brief description provided for the network test:</p>
<p><em>The network test is a preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch. Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign was among the most surprising announcements <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> during last month's The Game Awards 2024 event. FromSoftware is crafting something they've never attempted before. While the foundation is obviously the award-winning Elden Ring, it is being greatly tweaked to deliver a unique multiplayer experience that takes some elements from the survival and even battle royale genres. Here's the official description shared in the press release:</p>
<p><em>Players must choose from eight unique characters, each with their own unique abilities and powerful Ultimates. Their journeys take them to Limveld, where they will have to make split-second decisions when it comes to combat and exploration in the face of a night cycle that shrinks the map with the coming Night’s Tide. At the end of each night, they will face a powerful boss and, if victorious, awaken to bigger challenges. Each session will culminate on the third night, when they must face off against the chosen Nightlord. Individuals can fight the night alone, but strength will come in numbers. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience in the ELDEN RING universe. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat; unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles.</em></p>
<p><em>In this condensed action RPG, players will never experience the same journey twice as enemies, rewards and Limveld itself are all ever shifting and evolving each session in the realm of the Nightlord. Defeating greater enemies and venturing into the more dangerous parts of the map will uncover more powerful weapons and greater Rune rewards. Find Sites of Grace to give each hero a chance to level up and gain crucial power. With each session-based adventure being akin to playing through an open-air dungeon, every journey provides an opportunity to grow lasting stat bonuses. Successful runs against the night bring players ever closer to defeating the realm of the Nightlord and unraveling the story behind each Hero in this parallel world.</em></p>
<p>Are you excited about checking out Elden Ring Nightreign in February?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocraft-2-canceled-freejam-shuts-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>developer Freejam has announced that ongoing development on the game is no longer sustainable, and that the studio itself will also be closing its doors and sunsetting its other titles.</p>

<p>In a message on&nbsp;<em>Robocraft</em>'s official Discord server, Freejam's Rawxas says that "the current market conditions and the server costs required" to keep&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>running mean that the studio is unable to launch the game's 1.0 version or continue development.</p>

<p>As such, Freejam says it'll spend "some time" sunsetting&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2</em>, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301520/Robocraft/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">its predecessor</a>, "over the coming weeks". The studio's cardboard survival game&nbsp;<em>CardLife&nbsp;</em>will also be sunsetted along with the two&nbsp;<em>Robocraft&nbsp;</em>games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robocraft-2-canceled-vehicle.jpg?itok=S4AgP3u4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robocraft-2-canceled-vehicle.jpg?itok=UxzM1zeP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>is no more as of today.</figcaption></figure><p>The dismantling of Freejam's work has already begun; it's no longer possible to buy&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1991140/Robocraft_2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on the Steam store</a>, although the original game, which is free-to-play, remains available, as does&nbsp;<em>CardLife&nbsp;</em>(at time of writing).</p>

<p>It may also not come as a surprise that&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>is being sunsetted if you've played the game; it's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1991140/Robocraft_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a Mostly Negative review rating</a> on Steam, with 1,760 players weighing in with their opinions.</p>

<p>Some negative reviews point to technical issues like an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199588571283/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inability to log in</a> or difficulty getting the game to run <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199127398025/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on certain platforms</a>, but others offer more <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198135029860/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in-depth critiques</a> of the game, suggesting it's failed to strike the same kind of chord that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301520/Robocraft/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original&nbsp;<em>Robocraft&nbsp;</em>did</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>is (or was), it's an online-focused vehicular combat game in which you can create and deploy your own custom-created vehicles. Freejam says its game's "construction systems" allow players to create "a multitude of shapes at any scale".</p>

<p>Just this week,&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">was reported to have laid off a number of its staff</a> at the end of last year, and other companies such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" rel="nofollow">Thunderful</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">Don't Nod</a>, and many others have also been hit by layoffs.</p>

<p>Bigger companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a> have been affected too, although that hasn't stopped the C-suites at these companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">raking in</a> frankly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">embarrassing amounts of money</a> while they hemorrhage staff.</p>

It takes inspiration from browser geography game <a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/">Geoguessr</a>. You’ll be studying sets of photos and comparing them with notes from Abigail’s journal, then pinpointing her location on a series of lovely maps.</p>

<p>After you’ve placed three pins, you’ll find out whether you’re correct or not, then move on to the next set as you follow Abigail’s trail. It starts out as a simple game of identifying landmarks, but soon evolves into a case of cross-referencing cryptic notes in her journal. But it really feels like a game about considering perspectives; trying to place yourself in Abigail’s shoes, and seeing the world the way she did. An early puzzle has you locate specific cyclopean statues in a cavernous alien tomb. Abigail has given her favourites names like Milton and Orville and drawn moustaches and glasses on diary sketches, which feels like exactly the sort of thing you’d do when completely isolated on a strange planet.</p>
<p>"Locator combines the spatial reasoning of Geoguessr with the logical deduction of detective games," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3388650/Locator_Demo/">Steam page</a>, which also houses a demo. "Use constellations, alien architecture, wildlife, cryptic symbols, and even temperature to pinpoint the location of photos."</p>
<p>I love a good map, though as much for their place in language and metaphor as their presence as physical objects. One of my favourite neologisms is the concept of the ‘cartographer’s folly’ - also called paper towns, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_entry">fictitious entries</a>. Copyright traps, effectively - bits of geographical fakery that cartographers can use to mark their work. Then there’s the Alfred Korzybski quote “the map is not the territory” - an always cogent reminder to not confuse semantics with reality. I’d like to see how Locator explores our empathy for Abigail when we only really know her through a model of a journey we’ve put together ourselves. No release date as yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Back in November, relaxed garden puzzle game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/botany-manor">Botany Manor</a> was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-horticultural-puzzler-botany-manor-comes-to-playstation-in-december">announced</a> as getting a belated launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5.
</p>
<p>
An impressive indie 3D puzzling effort, Botany Manor had already shone on PC, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X - including Xbox Game Pass - earlier in 2024. 
</p>
<p>
But in December, publisher Whitethorn Games issued an <a href="https://x.com/WhitethornGames/status/1868687621217473001">update</a> to say Botany Manor had hit a snag, and would now launch in the new year. Well, here we are - and today brings a fresh (and hopefully final) PlayStation launch date for the game: 28th January.

<p>I can wholeheartedly recommend Botany Manor, as one of the few games I actually got around to fully completing last year. You're given the keys to a National Trust-style estate that slowly opens up over time as you uncover mysteries and grow long-lost blooms through increasingly brain-teasing ways.
</p>
<p>But things never get too taxing, the game is relentlessly chilled out, and the game's gentle story offers just enough of a glimpse at life within its Victorian-era surroundings to keep you intrigued.</p>
<p>
"Perhaps an afternoon in Botany Manor's company will inflame your own curiosity for nature," Matt wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/botany-manor-review">Eurogamer's Botany Manor review</a> last year. "Or perhaps you'll simply be content to explore its sun-dabbled corners, solve its few clever puzzles, and enjoy the timeless pleasures of an enchanting summer's day stroll."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-renders-based-on-new-information-from-proven-tech-leaker-provide-updated-look-at-system%E2%80%99s-design-controllers.1077864/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-renders-tech-leaker/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new look at the yet-to-be-officially revealed Nintendo Switch 2 has come today, thanks to the renders put together by a well-known tech leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OnLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnLeaks</a>, who has previously put together accurate renders for tech products before their official reveal, created these new renders on behalf of <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nintendo-switch-2-design-renders-exclusive/">91mobiles</a> which are based on new data, including the supposed dimensions of the real console. A 360-degree video, which can be watched below, provides another great look at the system, the U-shaped kickstand, and the Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 | First Look | 360 Degree Video | Exclusive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KAbXItlrUnQ?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides the new look at the console's design provided by OnLeaks' renders and 360-degree video, today we have learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 may indeed use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/">microSD Express format</a> as <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-storage-samsung-sd-express-micrso-sd-cards-800-mb-s/">previously rumored</a>. This new standard can reach a sequential read speed of up to 800MB/s, four times faster than traditional UHS-1 memory cards, whose read speed is capped at 200 MB/s. The console adopting this new standard is hardly surprising, considering how multiplatform games are nowadays developed with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S SSDs.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but with leaks coming in daily, there's no doubt that the reveal is imminent. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
