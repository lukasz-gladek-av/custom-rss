The E3 replacement included multiple online showcases and onsite events, each aimed at drumming up excitement for a flood of upcoming games. Which games rocked? Which ones sucked? Which ones will become video game industry touchstones while the rest fade from memory? We tried to play as many of them as we could to find out.<br></p><p>After flying back from LA, throwing all our dirty laundry in the corner, and passing out, we started gathering every single game we got a chance to actually go hands-on with during Summer Game Fest, from <em>Marvel Rivals</em> to <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em>, and all of the indies in-between. In some cases, we only got mere minutes with the the games as their developers and brand managers pitched us on what made them great. But for other games, like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, we were able to roam new worlds at our leisure and chew on them for a while. </p><p>We saw loud monster truck races, real-time strategy battles, Souls-likes, sidescrollers, hotly anticipated <em>Overwatch</em> knockoffs, and much, much more. Every game we got a chance to try out is here for your perusal, along with details on where they’ll launch and when. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC </p><p>Amazon Games’ <em>New World</em> has had an interesting few years. Billed as an MMORPG and launched in 2021 on PC, it’s now being repackaged and re-released as <em>New World: Aeternum </em>for a console drop. Weirdly, Amazon is also shifting the marketing approach for <em>New World: Aeternum</em>: it has all of the base game material, the <em>Rise of the Angry Earth e</em>xpansion, and a slew of new content—and the team is calling it an RPG, not an MMO, even though it’s still an MMO. Yes, I am also confused.</p><p><em>Aeternum</em> clearly wants to court new players while also attempting to not alienate the exist fan base, but I’m not sure how well this will work out. My hands-on was fairly brief, but showed off the new story content and new characters. At first, the RPG elements were obvious—there’s a cool story at play here, your build can be varied, your approach diverse, but then after getting through the on-boarding process, it hard-pivots back to an MMO. And a kind of boring one at that.</p><p>If you already play <em>New World</em>, you won’t be annoyed by the tedious crafting and leveling that comes standard with an MMO. But if you haven’t (and that’s clearly who Amazon is trying to court here), why the hell would you sign up for an RPG just to play this? If the full game launch is more fleshed out in terms of solo gameplay that isn’t as tedious, <em>New World: Aeternum </em>could be a solid RPG. We’ll have to wait and see. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Early Access July 30</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p>If you loved <em>StarCraft II</em> you’ll probably like <em>Stormgate</em>, a real-time strategy revival project led by some ex-Blizzard developers. It’s free-to-play with an emphasis on 1v1 competitive modes, though additional content and campaign missions will be available in the paid version. The team recently revealed its third faction called the Celestials which turn the traditional resource extraction, base expansion, army creation loop on its head due to an intricate set of mechanics that allow players to explore, expand, and attack all at once.</p><p>I was able to demo the game ahead of the event and chat with the team at Summer Game Fest and it looks good and plays great. I’m still not sold on if it can break out beyond the hardcore, esports-minded crowd it’s initially pitched at, but it’s snappy, matches are quick, and I’m excited to play more. I never got into <em>StarCraft</em> but love the genre, and have been on the hunt for an old-school RTS that can fill that void in my life. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p><em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> fans, we are so back. After playing half a dozen matches against AI-opponents, I can’t wait to get my hands on <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> and relive all of my favorite DBZ highs and lows while getting ultra sweaty online, if the netcode allows it. It sucks that local versus is limited to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber but it’s better than none at all. I have a sneaking suspicion that I’ll find plenty of things to complain about once I’ve spent dozens of hours with the finished game, but that’s also part of the <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> legacy. A flawless series it was not, but what I saw of <em>Sparking Zero </em>made it feel like Bandai Namco is serious about making it more than just a next-gen nostalgia cash-in. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-tenkaichi-4-local-splitscreen-1851537589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-tenkaichi-4-local-splitscreen-1851537589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>Hands-On: Shaping Up To Be The <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3 </em>Sequel Fans Deserve</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 29, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, PC</p><p>The newest game in the <em>Monster Jam </em>series, <em>Showdown</em> is exactly what it says on the label: you drive around massive monster trucks across several different game modes and three major locations. There are 1v1 races, traditional multi-truck races, and a destruction mode that rewards you for—you guessed it—demolishing shit.</p><p>During my Summer Game Fest hands-on, I struggled a bit with steering my monster truck, and flipped over <em>a lot</em>. Luckily, there’s a simple “respawn” button that blinks you back a few feet and sits you upright, but I did not do well in any of my races because I couldn’t keep the damn thing from tipping over. I was told that I could use the right joystick to better control my truck, as <em>Showdown</em> has independent suspension, but that just made me even wobblier.</p><p>I can see <em>Monster Jam Showdown</em> being a fun game to pick up and play with friends while having a few brewskis, and for fans of the series, this will probably satisfy them, but this isn’t really my jam. Teehee. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>TBD (beta this summer)</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p><em>Battle Aces</em> is another RTS led by ex-Blizzard developers. You might have caught it during the Summer Game Fest showcase where it debuted with a flashy anime trailer that set many viewers up for crushing disappointment when the worst “real-time strategy” eventually followed. But <em>Battle Aces</em> isn’t your standard RTS. It’s much closer to something like <em>Clash Royale</em>, the mobile deck-building tower-defense game.</p><p>In<em> Battle Aces</em> you unlock new units, build a “deck” out of the ones you want,” and then go into battle against opponents on a super small map where matches are only expected to take about five minutes or so. Resource extraction is all automated outside of investing in a limited set of additional base nodes, and building units is almost instantaneous. Where the strategy comes in is trying to counter-play against your opponent’s army, capitalize on big swings to cripple their resource extraction, and incrementally build up advantages until you crush their final base <em>Dota-2</em> style. As with <em>Stormgate</em>, competitive play isn’t where my RTS love lies, but<em> Battle Aces </em>felt approachable and low commitment enough to peak my interest once it’s out. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date</strong>: July 19, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, PC</p><p>I love tower defense. I love Capcom action games. <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> combines the two into a Japanese folklore-inspired adventure where you guide a maiden from one demonic gate to another across a mountain until all of the evil spirits have been banished. It was one of the best demos I played at Summer Game Fest, and luckily most players won’t have to take a risk on buying it to find out what’s so special about it since it’s coming to Game Pass. As someone who put dozens of hours into the original <em>Dungeon Defenders</em>, I’m so glad tower defense sickos are about to get what feels like a big-budget action strategy game with some of the visual flair of <em>Okami</em>. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess Is An Incredibly Clever Strategy Mash-Up I Can't Wait To Return To&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess Is An Incredibly Clever Strategy Mash-Up I Can't Wait To Return To"><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess</em> Is An Incredibly Clever Strategy Mash-Up I Can’t Wait To Return To</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>I am very much not an RTS person, so perhaps I won’t do <em>Age of Mythology: Retold </em>justice, and for that, I’m sorry. But even I can understand the excitement around <em>Retold</em>’s release, as it’s finally bringing back a 22-year-old RTS classic with modern graphics, improved mechanics, and a chance to fight through Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and Atlantean pantheons. And instead of having just swords, shields, spears, and other typical classic RTS weapons to fight with, you’ll get some sick powers as well: Zeus’ lightning, a barrage of meteors, dragons, centaurs, crocodiles, cyclops—you name it, <em>Age of Mythology: Retold </em>probably has it.</p><p>During my playthrough, I quickly picked up on some of the hotkeys to make this RTS really sing, like selecting the entirety of my troops in one click so I could direct them to destroy an enemy stronghold, or pressing F3 to heal everyone in the vicinity. There is a zen-like appeal to RTS games that my hands-on has allowed me to understand, and I zone out almost immediately. Before I know it, the preview is over. A rep for the dev team said that the goal with <em>Age of Mythology: Retold </em>was to attract non-RTS players, and it could very well do that—it’s available day one on Xbox Game Pass for the Series X/S and PC. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>July 16 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p>I played<em> Flock</em> for about 15 minutes and in that time I discovered six new specimens of exotic indie game creatures and managed to get four of them to follow me back to my quest giver. Think <em>Pokémon Snap </em>mixed with a chill flight sim. I’m not sure how much deeper the game will go, but I enjoyed spotting new, weird little animals and guessing what they were based on their appearance and behaviors. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p><em>Lushfoil Photography Sim</em> is a game about taking pictures, I think. It doesn’t really tell you want to do, which is good because I was happy to just spend my time walking around mountain paths like I was on a hike. There’s an incredible soundtrack of chill licensed tracks that made me feel oddly meditative. The first-person view made me a little motion sick, but I did not expect any of my demos at Summer Game Fest to lead me down a trippy trance of existential reflection. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>TBD</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p>I did not like <em>Bounty Star</em> at all for the first eight minutes or so, which involved a tutorial of walking around a ranch following glowing markers and making items like I was trapped inside a survival crafting sim. Then I got into an actual mech and fought through my first mission and fell in love with the crunch robot combat. Getting hit felt a little wishy-washy and there’s a lot of room to improve on the overall look and level of polish, but I could definitely see getting hooked on a <em>Borderlands</em>-style loot loop of blowing up bandits and customizing my mech. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Early 2025</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, Mac</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is like <em>Overwatch</em> if it snorted a line of adderall off the TTRPG table in a comic book store. The free-to-play superhero PvP shooter aims to fill a gap left by Blizzard’s struggling hero shooter, and boasts a massive cast that will only get bigger, but it’s unclear if this will strike the right cord. There are so many aspects of this that feel directly lifted from <em>Overwatch</em>—Doctor Strange wields a shield like Reinhardt, The Punisher has a turret form like Bastion, Luna Snow can send heals across the map to a single teammate like Zenyatta. Hell, even the modes are similar, with opposing teams either fighting to maintain control over an area or one squad attempting to escort a hi-pri mobile object across a map.</p><p>But there is just <em>so much going on</em> that it’s immediately overwhelming. The roster is huge, the voice lines are constant, the colorful explosions and flashes of light as every Marvel hero fires off their abilities makes matches hard to read with all the visual noise. I only had a little bit of time with <em>Rivals</em> (back-to-back Summer Game Fest appointments that almost all run over make for an intense experience), but it took me more than half of my appointment to get a feel for everything. By the time I did, I was quite good at Luna Snow, who felt like the perfect character for me, a perpetual support player (though I did notice that NetEase and Marvel Games had to scrape the bottom of the hero barrel for a solid support character, as Luna was introduced into Marvel canon via the mobile game <em>Marvel Future Fight</em>).</p><p>I’m not sure if <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will have any legs. <em>Overwatch </em>has, indeed, left a gap in the hero shooter market, but <em>Rivals</em> feels clunkier, busier, and less inspired than Blizzard’s hero shooter once was. I guess we’ll have to wait and see. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>If you liked <em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em>, don’t sleep on<em> Robots at Midnight</em>. It’s another action-RPG Souls-lite that takes the edge off punishing combat with cartoony robot enemies and a whimsical world. In addition to the standard stamina bar and dodge roll, there’s also an air dash that lets you quickly retreat from combat. I still got my ass-kicked, especially at night when, as the title implies, the stakes ramp up with extra and tougher enemies. I enjoyed what I played and it’s definitely on my radar now. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p><em>Sky of Tides</em> is a narrative-driven sci-fi game where you try to navigate a world torn apart by revolutionary politics and heal its divides. There’s a slick-looking series of animated shorts attached to it that expand on the story, while the game itself was described to me by one of its developers as an “anti-RPG.” Instead of trying to min-max stats and role-play as a particular character, your aim is to progress by building stats and choosing dialogue responses that help your character grow in a balanced way. It’s an interesting idea though I’m not sure how compelling it will be in practice. Still, it’s the most interesting approach to subverting the traditional CRPG structure I’ve heard of since <em>Disco Elysium</em>. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>What if <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> was a survival crafting game that looked (even more) like <em>Princess Mononoke</em>? You might get something like <em>Fera: The Sundered Tribes</em>, a gorgeous and ambitious looking sandbox monster fighter where you can hookshot and paraglide around a massive map. It’s a huge pivot from Massive Damage’s last game, the pixel-art strategy roguelite, <em>Star Renegade</em>. The world looked really cool even if the game felt a bit messy to control at times and very chaotic during boss fights. It’s a tall order for the studio to pull off, but if it can it could be a really fascinating addition to the exploding (and quickly overheating) survival crafting genre. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 15, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p>I’m by no means an old-school <em>Fatal Fury</em> head or a  fighting game aficionado but I liked what I played of <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>. Like, a lot. It’s definitely not as approachable as <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, but it certainly feels like that’s where part of SNK’s attention is in brining the direct sequel to 1999's <em>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</em> into the world of 3D animations. There’s even a new simpler control scheme you can select that makes pulling off super moves a lot easier, even if some of the full-gage attacks are still locked behind some intricate manual button presses. </p><p>A lot of the tactics revolve around cancelable “Rev” moves and defensive advances that make City of the Wolves reward skilled and cautious play. Mostly I just had a ton of fun beating up on CPU opponents as Preecha, a brand-new addition to the SNK roster and a  Muay Thai fighter who brings a bubblier energy to the brooding dude-fest. Everyone should have “their” fighting game and I think I’m not determined to make <em>Fatal Fury </em>mine. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 19, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, PC</p><p>I will admit to approaching this hands-on with a heavy amount of bias. <em>Enotria</em> is an Italian folklore-inspired Soulslike from a small team of nine people based in Milan, Italy, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/colin-farrell-penguin-show-hbox-max-set-pics-1850213829&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/colin-farrell-penguin-show-hbox-max-set-pics-1850213829">I love Italian shit</a></span>. </p><p>I spent about half an hour with <em>Enotria</em>, and boy, did I struggle. The developer on-hand promised me that the team will be making it more accessible for launch, as it absolutely whooped my ass, but I enjoyed every second of it. The beautifully vibrant, over-the-top world and all its Italian influences (from the music to the bosses, like the multi-faced, batshit worshiper Vermiglio the Red Prior) were a delight to behold, even if I had to get help beating every one of the demo’s bosses.</p><p>And while <em>Enotria</em> feels and behaves a lot like a <em>Souls</em> game, Jyamma Games has gone to great lengths to add layers of customization that might surprise you. You can set up three loadouts and swap between them on the fly and apply aspects to the masks you wear that will adjust your stats and give you certain buffs and debuffs. There’s a lot going on under the hood here, which is really impressive considering how small the dev team is! — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 25, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p><p><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em> has never looked so good or featured Shadow as a playable character. That’s the long and short of my take-away from the remaster of the PS3/Xbox 360 era action platformer. I will say that the linear 3D spin on the speedster’s traditional formula has aged remarkably well, and feels focused and even somewhat fresh in comparison to a lot of the genre-scrambling bloat we sometimes see these days. Game was good. Game still good. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>July 25, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Switch, Mobile (Netflix exclusive), PC</p><p>No gaming expo is complete without that one puzzle game that lowkey scrambles your brain and blows your mind after just a few minutes with it. For me this year that was <em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em>, a beautifully illustrated top-down adventure where you maneuver through mazes by sliding their tilesets. It’s simple at first, but the gimmick quickly reveals clever tricks and unexpected challenges. It was made by a surprisingly large team of over a dozen people, one of whom was the artist on indie darling <em>Braid</em>. There’s a bit of how <em>Crypt of the Necrodancer</em> was remixing<em> Zelda </em>for music junkies, except this time around it’s puzzle logic sickos who are benefiting. It was another one of my top demos from Summer Game Fest. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 16, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p>This is probably the most beautiful game I played at Summer Game Fest. Animated with a lithographic style and set music that oozes neo-noir vibes, <em>Phoenix Springs </em>has you point-and-clicking through objects in the environment for clues about your missing brother. As a reporter, you try to tease out information from strangers and uncover the tools needed to progress by chaining together nouns. Instead of building up an inventory of stuff, you collect ideas that can be combined to initiate new interactions or strings of dialogue that advance the plot. As someone who doesn’t really gel with point-and-click adventure games, I wish there was another way to play through <em>Phoenix Springs</em>’ world and story, but both of them were irresistible enough that I am going to struggle through it regardless when it eventually comes out. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p><em>Replaced</em> is an ‘80s homage that feels like <em>The Lost Boys </em>met <em>The Warriors</em> in an arcade cabinet. The 2.5D cyberpunk platformer tells the story of R.E.A.C.H., an AI that was trapped in a human body and is now on the run through a dystopian world marred by corruption and littered with outlaws. I didn’t get a huge taste of what <em>Replaced</em>’s combat will be like in my half-hour demo (I got a gun towards the end of my playthrough, which I could charge up by using my melee ability to whack baddies), but I was immediately entranced by its set-dressing.</p><p>Though <em>Replaced</em>’s graphics are hyper-pixelated and decidedly retro, small details like flickering light particles, incredible audio design, and seamless transitions from side-scrolling movement to animated cutscenes adds a slightly modern twist. At one point, when I’m prompted to access my inventory, the camera zooms in on R.E.A.C.H.’s back and then through it for a tight shot of his “Wingman,” an obvious spin on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5861062/sony-walkman-at-35&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5861062/sony-walkman-at-35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walkman retro music player</a></span>. This game is <em>beautiful</em> from top to bottom, and my brief demo left me wanting a whole lot more. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 18, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p><em>UFO50</em> is the latest game from <em>Spelunky</em> maker Mossmouth and one fans have been waiting a while for. The title refers to a collection of 50 retro-inspired games built from the ground up to look and feel like a library of long-lost NES cartridges. I tried to flip through as many as possible in my short 10 minutes with the game, and found an RPG in the vein of<em> Dragon Quest</em>, a beat-em-up reminiscent of <em>Double Dragon</em>, and a space golfing game that is unlike anything I’ve played before.</p><p>There’s local co-op and a meta-story that runs through each game about the fictional company that made them. None of the ones I came across seemed like something I might end up spending hours playing, but I’m excited to dig into the full collection and pretend I’m back in my neighbor’s basement grinding through the same five games we had lying around over and over again because we were too poor to buy more. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>2025</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p><em>While Waiting</em> is what it says on the tin. The game is on a timer and will automatically move along from one day-in-the-life-style vignette to another. What you do while waiting for each new scene to arrive is up to you. Most of it consists of making messes, annoying people, or making up imaginary games to play with yourself like pretending your finger is a spaceship dodging asteroids as you move it along a window pain as rain drops run down it. It’s a clever idea with a perfectly suited visual style and lots of hidden achievements to collect. — Ethan<br></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>September 5, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PC</p><p>People have been waiting a very long time for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-s-delay-is-personally-painful-because-1848362882&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-s-delay-is-personally-painful-because-1848362882"><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em>.</a></span> The immersive FPS from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-russia-invasion-ukraine-release-date-delay-1849061092&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-russia-invasion-ukraine-release-date-delay-1849061092">Ukrainian studio GSC Game World</a></span> was delayed in 2022, when the team had to flee their country after it came under siege by Russia. Making a game is already incredibly difficult, now try making one the midst of an invasion. After several delays, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 </em>is set to launch this fall, and I got a chance to try out a demo build at Summer Game Fest. Though my build wouldn’t let me invert my Y-axis and I embarrassed myself in front of Phil Spencer (who was behind me while I wheeled the camera about wildly trying to unlearn years of inversion-brain), it’s clear that GSC has made something special.</p><p><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 </em>looks incredible. The game world is incredibly dark, not so much so that you can’t clearly see where you’re going, but just enough that the bizarre electrical anomalies chasing you through a sewer will overwhelm you and make a scary situation even more terrifying. Then there’s the resource management, which you’ll quickly learn is crucial if you’re going to make it through the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. Enemies are smart and painful, ammo dwindles fast, radiation poisoning stacks quickly, and you can very easily get over-encumbered with shit. You need to have your head on straight to succeed in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2</em>, as it offers a level of immersive FPS that surprised me. This game is going to be brutally fun when it launches in the fall, and it’s an instant cop for me (though it’ll be day one on Xbox Game Pass). — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Q3 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Switch, PC</p><p><em>After Love EP</em> is an adventure game where your dead girlfriend talks to you as you explore and try to recover from the grief of her passing. There’s rhythm gameplay when you’re jamming with your band, which I didn’t get to play, but the other part of the game is navigating conversations with friends and the daily toil of living in a beautiful, bustling part of Jakarta, Indonesia. The game is partly a tribute to <em>Coffee Talk</em> creator Mohammad Fahmi, and based on his work before passing away at the age of 32 a couple years ago. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Q1 2025<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC</p><p>Play as a house, roll around lo-fi PS1-looking environments, flirt with other buildings.

The part I like best is how all of the dialogue feels like someone downloaded their messiest group chats and text message threads and boiled them down into the funniest moments. It’s deeply personal but with the breezy nonchalance of a modern online dating profile. Boozayaangool said it’s about two hours and was partly inspired by the brief meditative journey<em> A Short Hike</em>. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 29, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</p><p><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank </em>fans, rejoice, <em>Akimbot</em> is coming later this summer and bringing with it a whole shoebox full of love letters addressed to the PlayStation platformer. Evil Raptor, the team behind the <em>MediEvil</em>-inspired <em>Pumpkin Jack</em>, has proven once again that they can take a winning formula, replicate it, and add some extra toppings to sweeten the deal. <em>Akimbot</em> follows two robots, Exe and Shipset, who have just escaped the clutches of the Roboglioni mafia family and are on the run from the very Italian-coded ‘bots (they even wear funny little old-school hats).</p><p>The platforming is incredibly fluid and seamless, with a double-jump and dash allowing you to move through the beachy environment with relative ease. It’s simplistic, but effective, and the level design feels like it’s gently nudging you in a direction rather than strapping you to rails. Combat is similarly simple: Exe can melee enemies with a blade, shoot them with an AR, and pick from one of four special attacks from a merchant I encountered almost immediately in my demo. You’ll need some firepower here, too, as one set piece where a giant, turreted ship rained hell down upon me was quite difficult.</p><p><em>Akimbot </em>is fast and fun, and feels like the perfect game for <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank </em>fans looking for some light platforming, fluid combat, and an unlikely duo leading the way. — Alyssa</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Late 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p><p><em>Shantae</em> maker Wayforward has teamed up with Atari to bring back <em>Yars’ Revenge</em>, a 1980s space shooter that was one of the best selling games on the Atari 2600. <em>Yars Risin</em>g tries to build that out into a <em>Mega Man Zero</em>-style action platformer with hacking mini-games (the developers really didn’t want me to call them that) where you complete challenges modeled after the gameplay of the original. It’s a neat homage that I didn’t feel any particular attachment to, especially because the presentation of <em>Yars Rising</em> feels quite distinct from its ‘80s source material. It certainly doesn’t seem like a bad game but I’d need more time with it to have a sense of whether it’s more than just a competent exercise in brand revival. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 6, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5</p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>was hands-down the best thing I played at Summer Game Fest. It is more<em> Astro Bot</em>, but it is not <em>only</em> more <em>Astro Bot</em>. I recently described it to someone as PlayStation’s version of a Nintendo game except that unlike a lot of those it doesn’t feel like it was trying to copy anyone’s homework. The platforming is tight, the secrets on each level are delightful, and challenge levels made me sweat just enough to want to keep coming back. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387">Hands-On With <em>Astro Bot</em>: Pure Joy</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Holiday 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Switch, PC</p><p>If you’ve played one of the many recent licensed Lego games you’ll know exactly what to expect from <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>.

It reminded me a lot of <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em>, which is excellent. Hopefully there’s enough meat on the <em>Horizon Adventures</em> bone to make it feel similarly fulfilling. — Ethan</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-lego-adventures-hands-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-1851535713&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lego-adventures-hands-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-1851535713">Hands-On With Horizon Lego Adventures: A Perfect Fit For Nintendo Switch</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 30, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5</p><p>I wasn’t sure what to expect from my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-gameplay-impressions-1851532894">hands-on with Ubisoft’s upcoming open-world game, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span>. I hoped that it would showcase a beautiful <em>Star Wars</em> world, and that it would play nothing like an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>—and I was pleasantly surprised. Though my demo was on rails, it’s clear that there will be a variety of gameplay options and features at protagonist Kay Vess’ disposal, from blaster gunfights to stealth options to leaning on her sidekick, Nix, to distract Stormtroopers or fetch objects.

It’s more <em>Super Monkey Ball,</em> folks, just with a lot of additional bells and whistles this time around. The game did not visually look that great running on Switch, though maybe that’s because it was blown up on a massive Samsung TV. The gameplay was decent and I never felt like I was slipping off stages or floating in the air for too long (the Sega rep told me there was a conscious effort to make the controls weightier this time around following some complaints about the recent remaster of the original games).</p><p>Did I mention you can play as Sonic? He, Knuckles, and the rest of the gang are part of a season pass players can pick up to expand their roster of characters, and a lot of the push behind the game seems to be inspired by things like<em> Fall Guys</em>, including a multiplayer mode featuring 16-player activities. There’s also a spin-dash move this time around that lets you store up momentum and fling your monkey around like a pinball. It was perfect for trying to cheese levels. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Fall 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, Mac</p><p>This ‘90s-inspired low-fi horror game from a two-person development team (Cozy Game Pals) was so vibey when it first launched, Blumhouse Games noticed it and offered money to expand upon it. <em>Fear The Spotlight</em> will return to Steam (and other platforms), later this year, and if you’re interested in vibey, VHS-quality visuals and creepy liminal spaces, I highly recommend it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fear-the-spotlight-blumhouse-horror-game-hands-on-1851528992&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fear-the-spotlight-blumhouse-horror-game-hands-on-1851528992">My hands-on with <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> </a></span>was an incredibly gripping and satisfying experience, like playing through an old point-and-click PC game with a throwback <em>Resident Evil </em>twist.

The S-Game project promising a 30 hour campaign with tons of different weapons and exploration looks years away still, but what I played much more like a PS3-era action game. Cool combos and flashy animations, complete with long range attacks and parrying. It didn’t blow me but I’m interested to see what the rest of the game ends up looking like once it exists. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>October 11, 2024<br></p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, PC</p><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>wasn’t quite what I was expecting. I went into my demo thinking it would have more real-time action flavor, but it is very much <em>Persona</em> in a fantasy setting. There’s a calendar system and social interactions to build deeper relationships with your party (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-bond-social-link-romance-1851430134">but no romances</a></span>), and transformations in battle to cast spells or use extra powerful attacks that feel a lot like summoning <em>Persona</em> in suits of armor.</p><p>You can perform attacks out in the world, but only against weaker enemies. The stronger ones still require a familiar turn-based battle to defeat. None of this is bad. In fact, with <em>Persona 6</em> nowhere in sight at the moment, Atlus RPG fans are lucky to have something so meaty and stylish to dive into this fall. I was just hoping to see the formula shaken up more. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> plays like a great, if conservative, <em>Persona </em>spiritual spin-off. — Ethan</p></div><div><p><strong>Release Date: </strong>August 8, 2024</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p><p>The newest side-scrolling robot tactics game from Thunderful Development was my final appointment at Summer Game Fest 2024. I felt completely dead while sinking back into the blue couch I was sitting on for the demo, but not so dead that I didn’t immediately get stoked for the new possibilities coming in the sequel. The first <em>SteamWorld Heis</em>t was XCOM in 2D, with players lining up ricocheting bullets and collecting rewards from surviving successful battles.</p><p><em>SteamWorld Heist 2</em> doesn’t change what’s not broken, but it does add some big twists. There’s now overworld exploration via a submarine you can upgrade and battle other ocean enemies with in real-time. Each character can also train in various classes and share abilities between them similar to the job systems popularized in Final Fantasy Tactics and other strategy RPGs. The result seems like a much deeper tactical experience that I’m really looking forward to checking out the full version of when it drops later this summer. — Ethan</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can also opt to turn off <strong>Anti-Aliasing</strong> or <strong>Ambient Occlusion</strong>, but <strong>I’d personally leave these on</strong>. There’s no compelling performance gains by disabling them.</p><p>That said, <strong>if you have the Steam Deck hooked up to a Monitor or TV, you can increase the game’s resolution to enjoy some superior visuals</strong>. To do this, before you select the “Play” option on the game’s main page, press <strong>the Cog icon</strong> on the right side of the screen (pictured above), then select <strong>Properties &gt; General &gt; Game Resolution</strong>. Here you can manually select what resolution the game will launch in, even if it’s past the Steam Deck’s default resolution. <strong>The resolution in-game needs to match whatever you select here, so make sure to review the Graphics settings in the Options menu to make sure everything is in order.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-recommend-id="image://c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of SMT V: Vengeance taken on Steam Deck with performance data across the top of the screen: FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of SMT V: Vengeance taken on Steam Deck with performance data across the top of the screen: FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, and so on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-recommend-id="image://c73b7dcb495f20eb0b700e04adeda2be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of SMT V: Vengeance taken on Steam Deck with performance data across the top of the screen: FPS, CPU usage, GPU usage, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Based on my testing experience, here’s how the game runs at the following resolutions:</p><p><strong>1368 X 768</strong>: This is, for the most part, just a clean visual upgrade. The game typically ran between 55 - 60 FPS, and did not meaningfully dip below 50. It’s not a big graphical boost, but it’s “free” if you’re on a TV.</p><p><strong>1600 X 900</strong>: I found this to be a good, balanced option. The game typically maintained a resolution above 50 FPS, with only an occasional dip below that. If you’re not particularly sensitive to frame rate issues, this should look good and feel smooth.</p><p><strong>1920 X 1080</strong>: Believe it or not, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>generally runs okay at 1920 X 1080! You’ll spend more time in the 40 FPS range, with occasional drops below that. However, the game was still perfectly playable and never dipped below 30.</p><p><strong>I personally preferred playing at 1600 X 900</strong>, but your mileage may vary. Some areas of the game may be more taxing than others, so you may need to adjust the resolution depending on where you’re at. Either way, the Steam Deck’s performance is leaps and bounds superior to the Nintendo Switch version, so keep that in mind as you select which version of the game you’d wish to play. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Shadow of the Erdtree patch is designed with players in mind, introducing inventory features to help you better manage your items. Any new item you obtain will be marked with a ‘!’ so you can spot them more easily on the menu. Also, a new tab called ‘Recent Items’ will be available for all your recently acquired items to sit.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the new Summoning Pool features, players have received more control over the tools. Active Summoning Pools are now available in New Game Plus. In the upcoming patch, you will be able to enable or disable individual summoning pools through the new Map Functions Menu. Lastly, the Small Golden Effigy will allow you to select only Active Summoning Pools.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Additionally, the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree patch will bring exciting new customization options for players. Among these additions are five fresh hairstyles that will be made available. These new styles can be accessed through the character creation section using either the Clouded Mirror Stand or Rennala’s Rebirth feature. Furthermore, FromSoftware has announced that they will introduce even more features as the update nears its release.&nbsp;</p>

The return 24 years in the making impressed with its American comic-style art, hard-hitting action, and unique fighting mechanics like the S.P.G. system. We had a chance to take another round of hands-on time with Fatal Fury at Summer Game Fest, and it continues to be a knockout.</p><p dir="ltr">This new demo removed two characters from the previous hands-on--sorry, Hotaru and Tizoc fans. However, replacing them in this demo's roster were two characters who have been confirmed since that first preview session: Marco Rodrigues, who was announced in April, and Vox Reaper, one of two new characters confirmed during Summer Game Fest Live. The other, B. Jenet, was not present in our demo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319548-ss04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319548" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319548-ss04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319548"></a><figcaption>Vox Reaper</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319548-ss04.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319549-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319550-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319551-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319552-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319553-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319554-ss09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319549,1300-4319550,1300-4319551,1300-4319552,1300-4319553,1300-4319554" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319549-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319550-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319551-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319552-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319553-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319554-ss09.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319549-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319550-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319551-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319552-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319553-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319554-ss09.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even before we took the controller, we continued to be impressed with Fatal Fury's art style; the "American comic" approach to color and shading really makes each character pop off the screen. In an interview with GameSpot after the hands-on session concluded, Fatal Fury art director Nobuyuki Kuroki said that this visual style, rather than taking a more realistic approach, was always the intention.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you look at what other game companies are doing, you can already see games at the pinnacle of realistic graphics and even anime graphics," Kuroki said. "We were trying to find a niche that nobody else has used, and then tried to perfect it and make it our own." When asked which character revealed so far is the best example of what the team has achieved, he quickly responded with "all of them," before eventually choosing Tizoc as the most visually impressive so far.</p><p dir="ltr">During our hands-on, we focused on using Marco and Vox Reaper. We tried out Vox first, who is evocative of the sub-boss Grant from Garou: Mark Of The Wolves. Vox thrives in the neutral game; his powerful one-off strikes pay dividends as a match progresses. His game is more of a patient one, where we'd be biding time and waiting for an opening to strike before moving in.</p><p dir="ltr">His command throw is a major part of his arsenal, as he can immediately follow it up with his uppercut special move or another big move as soon as the animation ends. He also takes a few special moves straight out of Grant's Garou kit, which will give longtime Grant players an edge from the jump. Of the two new characters in this build, Vox is the one we wish we had more time to figure out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319555-ss04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319555" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319555-ss04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319555"></a><figcaption>Marco Rodrigues</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319555-ss04.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319556-ss03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319557-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319558-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319559-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319560-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319561-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319562-ss09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319556,1300-4319557,1300-4319558,1300-4319559,1300-4319560,1300-4319561,1300-4319562" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319556-ss03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319557-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319558-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319559-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319560-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319561-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4319562-ss09.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319556-ss03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319557-ss04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319558-ss05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319559-ss06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319560-ss07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319561-ss08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4319562-ss09.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After a few turns with Vox, we moved on to Marco, and from the word "fight," we immediately clicked. Marco practices Kyokugenryu Karate, which in the deep lore of SNK, is a style also used by the Sakazaki family--most notably Ryo and his father, Takuma. As such, Marco plays very much like those two martial artists, and his take on the style packs a powerful yet familiar punch.</p><p dir="ltr">Marco's kit includes both the Kouken fireball and the Kohou uppercut, as well as the Hien Shippuu Kyaku jumping-kick combo. His powerful Haoh Sho Kouken fireball super move fills the screen with fire, as well, providing one of the martial artist's flashiest moves. Where Vox requires some more time on the sticks after this demo, we feel we could hold our own against anyone right now.</p><p dir="ltr">This new hands-on wasn't the only SNK update of the weekend, however: One of the more groundbreaking announcements of Summer Game Fest was the addition of Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui to Street Fighter 6. The inclusion makes Terry and Mai the first-ever guest characters in the core Street Fighter franchise, despite Capcom and SNK partnering up in the past.</p><p dir="ltr">Fatal Fury producer Yasuyuki Oda says that those discussions began back in 2022, when Evo returned to Las Vegas for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. "At Evo in 2022, we had SNK- and Capcom-themed posters that we collaborated on," Oda said, and those kicked off further talks during the same event.</p><p dir="ltr">"There were a couple of dinners during that time, and that's basically when the talks began," Oda said, adding that the two teams "are on very great terms nowadays; I know [Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki] Nakayama is a huge SNK fan, and we're all big Street Fighter fans as well."</p><p dir="ltr">Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves is not only a reinvention of the classic fighting franchise; it's a sign of SNK's renaissance as a whole. With more games and partnerships coming down the pipeline, the company may find itself in a new age of glory before long, and based on how City Of The Wolves has played in two preview sessions, we're looking forward to what's next.</p><p dir="ltr">Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves will launch in early 2025 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-urban-fantasy-books/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-urban-fantasy-books<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Urban Fantasy is an easy way to add a twist to a familiar setting. Essentially, it takes a modern (or near-ish future) setting and mixes it with fantasy elements; usually magic. Generally, but not always, this is used as a backdrop for another genre, such as horror.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">It’s a very malleable sub-genre that combines the familiar with the fantastical. It may take place in a real-world city or a fictional town, but it’s a place we’re all familiar with. However, the presence of magic or other fantasy elements brings their share of whimsy and an escape from the ordinary. Here are some of the best you can check out now.</p> <h2 id="h-city-of-bones-cassandra-clare" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/cRYHpsI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">City of Bones – Cassandra Clare</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://geni.us/cRYHpsI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">City of Bones</a></em> is the first in the series of <em>The Mortal Instruments</em> novels, and is a good introduction to her world featuring the Institute and Shadowhunters and her family’s connection with them. The series consists of six mainline novels that follow Clary Fray as she discovers herself and grows into her new role as a protector of mundane humans.</p> <h2 id="h-fire-and-hemlock-diana-wynne-jones" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/2gBHC01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Fire and Hemlock – Diana Wynne Jones</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Based on (and around) the Scottish ballads of “Tam Lin” and “Thomas the Rhymer,” <em><a href="https://geni.us/2gBHC01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Fire and Hemlock</a></em> is one of the foundational titles that helped shape Urban Fantasy as it is today. As such, it isn’t as overt when it comes to mixing fantasy with familiar. The fantasy aspect comes from portentous stories and the involvement of the Fae.</p> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">Mostly, it tells the story of Polly Whittacker and follows her relationship with Thomas Lynn over the years. It’s told retrospectively, looking back at alternate memories. It’s a bit difficult to describe, especially because parts of it are somewhat nebulous. Many of its fans suggest that it’s important to read it at least twice to really grok the ending.</p>
 <h2 id="h-moon-called-patricia-briggs" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Npqhei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Moon Called – Patricia Briggs</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="833" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/Npqhei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Moon Called</a></em> is the foundation upon which Patricia Briggs built up the Mercy Thompson series. While the “Mercyverse” (as I’m first hearing it called now) is rather vast now, this is where it started. The series, in general, follows Mercy, a shapeshifter who can change into a coyote, as she deals with other supernatural-related problems. In <em>Moon Called</em>, this takes the form of an investigation into missing Werewolves that balloons from there. It’s a solid introduction to the characters and world the series is based around.</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-darker-shade-of-magic-v-e-schwab" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/edBAg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">A Darker Shade of Magic – V.E. Schwab</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">Following a magician who is capable of jumping to four different versions of London (White, Grey, Black, and Red, A Darker Shade of Magic has a nice adventuresome tone to it. An envoy with the side hustle of smuggling, Kell winds up in possession of sinister stone and thrown together with a thrill-seeking thief.</p>
 <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="108" data-injectable="false">V.E. Schwab has continued the series with two more books, and a movie adaptation is reportedly in the works.</p> <h2 id="h-the-city-amp-the-city-china-mieville" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/EPEvVo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The City &amp; The City – China Miéville</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">This is perhaps here mostly because I like a good police procedural, but having won countless awards, <em><a href="https://geni.us/EPEvVo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The City &amp; The City</a></em> is worth a recommendation regardless of your expectations for Urban Fantasy. It follows the exploits of Tyador Borlú as he works to solve a murder that takes him from the Eastern European streets of Besźel to its twin city of Ul Qoma.</p> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true"><em>The City &amp; The City</em> is a bit more surreal and weird than a lot of the relatively grounded fiction found elsewhere on this list. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re searching for something to read.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-atrocity-archives-charles-stross" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/eSb7k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Atrocity Archives – Charles Stross</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/eSb7k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Atrocity Archives</a></em> is technically two short novels that set up <em>The Laundry Files</em>, a series of stories following the eponymous agency “The Laundry.” Many of the books (including the ones in this collection) have Bob Howard as the protagonist, as he helps the Laundry protect the world from supernatural and extra-dimensional threats.</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">The series brings a technological side to unknowable threats from beyond the veil of reality, giving them a unique hook to its world-building. The threats in the books range from elder gods to elves, giving the world no shortage of antagonists.</p> <h2 id="h-sandman-slim-richard-kadrey" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/j9frFOl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Sandman Slim – Richard Kadrey</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">A hitman from hell is an idea where the concept alone gets the endorphins pumping. It’s almost like <em>Doom</em>, but not the <em>Doom </em>novels. <em><a href="https://geni.us/j9frFOl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Sandman Slim</a></em> follows James “Sandman Slim” Stark who, after spending 11 years in hell, arrives in L.A. to exact his revenge against those who wronged him. There’s plenty of action, but it’s also packed with dark humor. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, which helps make the flex of a concept easier to swallow.</p>
 <h2 id="h-borderland-various-edited-by-terri-windling-and-mark-alan-arnold" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Fx8vAw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Borderland – Various (Edited by Terri Windling and Mark Alan Arnold)</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/Fx8vAw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Borderland</a>,</em> in itself, is actually an anthology of stories by a handful of authors. However, they’re all based around a shared Urban Fantasy universe. The series is set in and around a city called Bordertown on the, er, border of the Elflands (appropriately inhabited by fantasy elves) and the World (inhabited by us).</p>
 <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">The series is generally aimed at teenagers, but there’s enough thematic variety that it can even appeal to those of us who have left the traumas of puberty behind for the vacuous emptiness of adulthood. Wait, I got sidetracked. I just meant to say “young at heart.”</p> <h2 id="h-rivers-of-london-ben-aaronovitch" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/kPBj1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Rivers of London – Ben Aaronovitch</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Another Urban Fantasy book that focuses on law enforcement in a world bent by the supernatural, <em><a href="https://geni.us/kPBj1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Rivers of London</a></em> has Peter Grant, an up-and-coming British police officer, as he deals with a wave of murders, as well as the gods of the Thames. It’s a fun and personal story written with an enjoyable amount of sass.</p> <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">Like many books on this list, <em>Rivers of London</em> also spawned a series after it and has also been adapted into graphic novels.</p>
 <h2 id="h-american-gods-neil-gaiman" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/yj2cCT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">American Gods – Neil Gaiman</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">This list could have basically been entirely Neil Gaiman novels, as the author is one of the most prolific and influential Urban Fantasy writers. As such, it’s really difficult to pick one particular example to recommend. Adapted into a TV series back in 2017, <em><a href="https://geni.us/yj2cCT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">American Gods</a></em> seems like a great starting point.</p>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">It follows an ex-convict who, while grieving the loss of his wife, takes a job for an enigmatic figure, which leads him on a trip across America. Along the way, he meets the physical manifestations of the Gods and becomes entwined with their struggles.</p>

But one of the big differences between <em>XDefiant </em>and other games is the inclusion of characters, maps, and cosmetics from other Ubisoft-published and developed franchises, like <em>Ghost Recon</em> and <em>Far Cry. </em></p><p>For example, the game’s launch season—dubbed Season 0—adds DedSec hackers from <em>Watch Dogs</em> into the game. I asked why those silly computer nerds were the first to be added to <em>XDefiant</em>. </p><p>“When you look at all of our factions, you’ll see that each of them have a specific core archetype, whether it’s defense, healing, or fire damage,” said Rubin. “We wanted to make sure we had that core group available to the player. With DedSec and their disruption archetype, they really fit into that unlockable layer of factions to add.” </p><h2 id="h149199"><a id=""></a>Why bad guys from <em>The Division</em> are in <em>XDefiant</em></h2><p>Currently, the game has five factions: Libertad from <em>Far Cry 6</em>, Phantoms from <em>Ghost Recon,</em> Third Echelon from <em>Splinter Cell</em>, The Cleaners from <em>The Division</em>, and the previously mentioned DedSec from <em>Watch Dogs</em>. It’s a strange line-up of characters, for sure, so I asked what Ubisoft and the <em>XDefiant</em> devs are looking for when deciding on who to add to the game. </p><p>“First, we look at what we want to add gameplay-wise,” said Saada. “Once we identify the archetype we’re looking for, we look to see if that can be filled through the Ubisoft IPs that we have.”</p><p> Saada also says that the team tried to include things that players weren’t expecting because the surprise can add more fun to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-review-is-it-good-free-call-of-duty-ubisoft-1851499598"><em>XDefiant</em></a></span>. This is why The Cleaners, bad guys with flamethrowers from <em>The Division</em>, are in the game. </p><p>“Everyone has played as a Division Agent, but nobody has ever played as a member of the Cleaners until now. Giving players those types of unique opportunities played a role in having the Cleaners [in <em>XDefiant</em>],” said Rubin.<br></p><p>And this idea of trying to surprise players with unexpected factions is also applied to the rest of the game.<br></p><p>“Is there something iconic we can take from other [Ubisoft] games and create new features from it? This all plays a part in the decisions that are made,” said Saada. <br></p><p>Oh and if you, like me, were wondering why <em>XDefiant </em>includes characters from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/ghost-recon-phantoms-is-closing-its-doors/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ghost-recon-phantoms-is-closing-its-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a now-defunct <em>Ghost Recon</em> game</a></span>, it all comes down to finding unique and “specific” abilities that add new archetypes to the FPS. </p><p>“We chose the <em>Ghost Recon</em> Phantoms over any other game/faction because they had specific and iconic abilities that fit the archetype we wanted for them,” said Saada. </p><h2 id="h149200"><a id=""></a>How weird will things get in <em>XDefiant</em>?</h2><p>Of course, I had to ask: Will <em>XDefiant</em> ever add <em>Just Dance </em>characters to the game? Or maybe Rabbids? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-year-1-all-factions-leak-datamine-rabbids-maps-1851513219&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-year-1-all-factions-leak-datamine-rabbids-maps-1851513219">Some previous leaks</a></span>, which have so far <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://siege.gg/news/xdefiant-season-1-brings-rainbow-six-siege-operators-and-maps-into-the-fold&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://siege.gg/news/xdefiant-season-1-brings-rainbow-six-siege-operators-and-maps-into-the-fold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proven to be true</a></span>, seem to indicate that these wilder inclusions might be coming in the future. And according to Rubin, nothing is “off the table” when it comes to what could show up next in Ubisoft’s big, new <em>CoD</em>-like FPS.</p><p>“That’s one of the most fun things about our game—that mosh pit of Ubisoft IPs. I would say that there really isn’t anything off the table,” said Rubin. </p><p>“But again, it has to fit into the mechanics that we built. But other than that, we can do anything. For us, the whole point of having all these different factions is to celebrate those IPs. Anything we can do, whether it’s through a faction, a map, skins, or weapons, anything that we pull from other games is really a celebration of those games. And that, to me, is what really stands out about <em>XDefiant</em>.”</p><p>Stay tuned as we’ll have more from our interview with Ubisoft about <em>XDefiant</em>, including the devs’ thoughts on bunny-hopping, balancing a live game, and how the team makes its fan-favorite maps.<br></p><p><em> XDefiant </em>is out now on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Its next season starts on July 1.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Most of the Ghost Tracker quests you can get from Micah-10 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s new expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>, are fairly straightforward. One of the later missions, dubbed "The Illusion," can get a little confusing, though. That's because it takes you to a very specific and somewhat tough-to-reach spot in Savathun's Throne World, and the waypoints that lead you to your destination are currently a bit buggy.</p><p dir="ltr">The tricky part of the quest starts after you complete the first step, in which you play through The Cunning, a mission from the campaign of The Witch Queen expansion. Once you've made your way through the mission and scanned the Final Shape statue it includes to gather the necessary Ghost Telemetry, you'll be dispatched to Savathun's Throne World to actually track the Ghost down.</p><p dir="ltr">The place you want to go is where you faced down Savathun in the final battle during the campaign of The Witch Queen, but if you haven't been to the Throne World in a bit, finding that exact spot can be confusing. That's doubly true because the waypoints for this particular mission seems to be glitched and will take you close to where you want to go, but down into the depths of the Throne World rather than up to its pinnacle, and you can get lost down there. Here's where you want to go to find the Ghost.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Make For The Court Of Thorns</h2><p dir="ltr">Start at the Quagmire transmat zone, hop on your sparrow, and head east into the Florescent Canal. You want to continue east from there toward the Court of Thorns area, which requires heading into the big door at the eastern edge of the area.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319530-20240614113150_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319530" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319530-20240614113150_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319530"></a><figcaption>If you wind up here, you have gone too far. The easiest way to correct the mistake is to transmat back to the Quagmire and ride back to the Court of Thorns.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319530-20240614113150_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When you go through the door, follow the path until you make your way out onto a huge bridge. Ahead of you is a big door, but <strong>do not go through it</strong>. The waypoint will guide you through the door and downward, and while you can potentially climb to where you need to be using Strand grapples and a little luck, it's a big pain and likely to get you stuck down there.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, you want to go up.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Find The Elevator Beam</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319531-illusionghosttrackercourtofthornsbeam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319531" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319531-illusionghosttrackercourtofthornsbeam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319531"></a><figcaption>Jump into this admittedly easy to miss green beam, which will carry you up toward your true destination.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319531-illusionghosttrackercourtofthornsbeam.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Look for a green elevator beam on the left side of the bridge, emanating from a round white dish in front of a Thrall statue. You might remember this from the Wellspring activity--the beam will take you up to where you usually go for those encounters. While the waypoint won't mark this for you, it's the proper way to go to reach the upper portions of Savathun's Throne World.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Keep Going Up To The Bell</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319532-illusionghosttrackersecondbeam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319532" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319532-illusionghosttrackersecondbeam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319532"></a><figcaption>Spin around and hop into this second elevator beam to reach the top of the Throne World and the Ghost.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319532-illusionghosttrackersecondbeam.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The first elevator beam will take you up to where the Wellspring event takes place, but don't advance any farther forward. You're only about halfway to your destination, and once again, the waypoint isn't going to help you. When you land from the elevator beam, spin around 180 degrees and face the way you just came. You'll see another, darker elevator beam going straight up, hanging in the air off the ledge you just landed on. This is the path you want--jump out to the beam and it'll raise you up to the top of the Throne World.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Continue To The Island</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319529-illusionghosttracker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319529" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319529-illusionghosttracker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319529"></a><figcaption>Pass through this arena and follow the bridge out to the distant island.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319529-illusionghosttracker.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When you reach the top of the beam, it's a straight shot to your destination. Climb the stairs beneath the ringing bell to reach a courtyard, the Sanctum of the Brood Queen. You should remember this place from when you battled Savathun in The Witch Queen. The arena terminates at the edge of the water ahead, but you'll find a bridge that leads you out toward a distant island. That's the spot where you ultimately defeated Savathun at the end of the campaign. On the island, you've finally reached the search area. There's a central tower with a glowing light here ringed by new, sliced-up Final Shape statues. Go past those toward the back of this lower area to find the Ghost lying on the ground.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319533-illusionghosttrackerghostlocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319533" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319533-illusionghosttrackerghostlocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319533"></a><figcaption>The Ghost is, finally, in the middle of the arena toward the back, lying on the floor next to these round pieces of architecture, just past the horse statue.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319533-illusionghosttrackerghostlocation.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Check out the rest of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guides</a> for anything else you need to know about Destiny 2's new expansion, and don't miss our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Final Shape review</a>.</p>

                <p>Fans have been clamoring for Bloodborne on other platforms, including PC and PS5. While its PS4 version is backwards compatible on PS5, fans still want to play an enhanced version with features such as improved framerates and higher resolution. As it turns out, many From Software developers want a PC port, too.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, director Hidetaka Miyazaki was asked once again about the possibility of Bloodborne on PC. Except this time around, he was specifically asked if he personally wanted to see it happen.</p><p>He pointed to producer Yasuhiro Kitao and interpreter Bobby Simpson and said, "I know for a fact these guys want a Bloodborne PC port. If I say I want one, I'll get in trouble as well. But it's nothing I'm opposed to."</p><p>Miyazaki continued by explaining that he wants more players to enjoy Bloodborne, especially as the years go by and sometimes games get lost to older hardware and time. "I think any game like that, it'd be nice to have an opportunity for more players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past," he says. "So as far as I'm concerned, that's definitely not something I'd be opposed to."</p><p>Since From Software doesn't own the rights to Bloodborne, it's not the <a href="https://x.com/jeffgrubb/status/1801409807406284978" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">studio's call to make</a>, but rather Sony's. However, Sony hasn't seemed to forget about Bloodborne as the game is making a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-bit-of-bloodborne-is-coming-to-ps5-but-not-in-the-way-fans-want/1100-6524027/" data-ref-id="1100-6524027">cameo in the upcoming Astro Bot game</a>. That game's creative director is adamant this isn't a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-secret-meaning-behind-bloodborne-in-astro-bot-says-creative-director" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tease of anything</a>, but rather an homage to a PlayStation great from the past.</p><p>In the meantime, folks will still be able to enjoy more Elden Ring content when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-renews-the-awe-and-adventure-of-elden-ring/1100-6523901/" data-ref-id="1100-6523901">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion launches on June 21.</p>

<p id="UreDFn">Over the last six months, Mikey Bustos, who goes by AntsCanada, has been cultivating biodiversity in a 12-foot long vivarium that he keeps in his home in the Philippines. The latest addition is a six-inch long baby caiman, which he plans to eventually move to a separate swamp vivarium and then to his backyard. The ethics and legality of this are unclear to me, but it is compelling viewing nonetheless.</p>
<p id="G8nT1m">Bustos, who has long been what I guess I would call an ant YouTuber, uses a 4K camera to capture the residents of the vivarium, a world that he’s named Pantdora. Yes, with a “t.” There are tree frogs, geckos, many species of ants, crickets, cockroaches, guppies, spiders, the aforementioned caiman, shrimp, and more.</p>

<p id="Dw4GrQ">Over incredibly high-definition footage of the creatures, Bustos narrates at a clip, his voice taut with excitement. “Ah, I love when fish school! There’s just something beautiful and hypnotic about it!” he exclaims after adding guppies to Pantdora’s blackwater pool, Aqua Noctis. </p>

<p id="JNwu6u">A tree frog gets a similarly poetic introduction. “When I spotted her out and about in Pantdora, I was awestruck how beautiful she was in the misty moonlight,” Bustos tells us. “I named her Miss Piggy.”</p>
<p id="14U7hH">The rhythms of the videos makes me feel lightly insane. I am pretty sure they’re made and paced for children. The image quality is stunning, but they have the narrative simplicity and deranged cadence of something like CoComelon, and Bustos’ narration is less David Attenborough, and more Dora the Explorer. </p>
<p id="a7Q6Gf">But the Drama. Oh, the Drama.</p>

<p id="qILpNZ">At the beginning of the series, Bustos realizes that several ant colonies have accidentally ended up in Pantdora, after stowing away in a giant salvaged tree stump and soil from his yard. He’s thrilled to see a lively colony of marauder ants —<em> but wait, what’s this? </em></p>
<p id="TNdkq3">Two invasive ant species have also made their home in the vivarium: fire ants and black crazy ants. </p>
<p id="aqbHrn">A brief, bloody skirmish between the marauders and the fire ants ends with casualties: Bustos watches sadly as a marauder major dies, locked in battle with a fire ant. The surviving marauders bury the bodies, while the fire ants retreat to their tunnels, presumably to breed and shore up their numbers.</p>
<p id="NGiMXF">But the black crazy ants seem to coexist with the marauder ants in the tree stump (formally dubbed the Hallelujah Tree Stump). Until one day.</p>
<p id="mSsMhU">Hundreds of black crazy ants — with multiple queens — come pouring out of the stump, carrying eggs and moving the colony from the middle to the top of the stump. Bustos realizes that inside the stump, a war may have been raging between the crazy ants and the marauders — who haven’t been as plentiful lately. Also, the crazy ants have somehow infiltrated the hardened poop tunnels of a colony of termites who share the Hallelujah Tree Stump! Can the colony survive? Or have the king and queen, and their valuable eggs, been killed?</p>
<p id="dlLurA">As Bustos says, “Mother nature is just stunning, isn’t she?”</p>
<p id="OgFrID">I can’t wait to find out what happens in the ant war. Or what havoc the new praying mantis will wreak. Or what will happen after Bustos’ huntsman spider, Lady Deathstrike, is introduced to the ecosystem — along with her egg sac. </p>

<p id="VfK0mi">The thing is, despite the overdramatic voiceover, I genuinely believe in Bustos’ enthusiasm for his creatures. When he exclaims over a baby grasshopper crawling up a vine, praising its wisdom in moving slowly so that predators (like tree frogs Kermit and Miss Piggy) won’t see it, I get it! It’s pretty cool, and I’ve never been so engrossed in the complicated and dangerous lives of insects before.</p>
<p id="R6AId5">I’m not sure how many other adults will be able to put up with the child-like narration of Bustos’ videos. Come to that, I’m not sure how many other adults will be compelled by watching two huntsman spiders have sex in stunning 4K. But I need to know what happens next in Pantdora, and I will be tuning in.</p>

Also consider stocking up on <strong>Elec Shards</strong> from Cadaver’s Hollow to give the Nahobino and any other human characters a way to exploit Matador’s weakness.<br></p><p>With that out of the way, here’s everything you need to know about overcoming Matador.</p><figure id="" data-id="e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-recommend-id="image://e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Matador's stats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Matador's stats." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-recommend-id="image://e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Matador's stats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h150788"><a id=""></a>Matador’s abilities and weaknesses</h2><p>At first glance, Matador doesn’t seem too bad. <strong>He’s weak to Electric (Zio) damage, Immune to Force (Zan) damage, and resists Hama and Mudo</strong>. He also resists a spread of status ailments, though you can still inflict these conditions since he’s not full immunities. While Electric damage is your best option here, Physical attackers are perfectly viable too. This is especially true of any Physical moves that have a higher likelihood to inflict a critical hit (like <strong>Aramasa</strong>).</p><p>The real challenge here is Matador’s skills. New to <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em> is the <strong>Crippling Blow </strong>innate skill, <strong>which gives Matador a chance to instantly kill anyone when it hits a weakness or scores a critical hit</strong>. Yes, just one unlucky dice roll when Matador strikes the Nahobino can turn an otherwise successful encounter into an instant loss. Matador will exclusively inflict <strong>Physical </strong>and <strong>Force</strong> damage, so avoid bringing any demons who are weak to either of those.<br></p><p>You’ll also want to watch out for <strong>Red Capote</strong>, which will raise Matador’s accuracy and evasion by two stages whenever it’s used. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> really punishes you for missing attacks, so you’ll want to use <strong>Sukunda</strong> to counter this buff. In fact, <strong>any and all debuffs will serve you well here</strong>, since Matador doesn’t have any way to neutralize these conditions.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-recommend-id="image://41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-recommend-id="image://41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h150789"><a id=""></a>Matador’s battle strategy</h2><p>Before you even have a chance to attack, Matador will use <strong>Red Capote</strong>. Use <strong>Sukunda </strong>and other debuff moves ASAP so you don’t risk letting Matador dodge your attacks, since this will put you on the backfoot immediately. You can use a <strong>Purge Charm</strong> to immediately remove the effects of Red Capote, which helps a great deal if you don’t have multiple demons using Sukunda.</p><p>Fortunately, Matador casts Red Capote infrequently beyond this point. Though it can use <strong>Marakunda </strong>to lower your party’s defense, you shouldn’t have to worry too much if you keep Matador’s attack debuffed with <strong>Tarunda </strong>or equivalent attacks. Otherwise, Matador will primarily hit you with Physical attacks and the occasional <strong>Mazan</strong>, so make sure to defend accordingly.<br></p><p>As has been the case with other bosses, you’ll eventually see the text “<strong>Matador began gathering nearby Magatsuhi!</strong>” To counter this, <strong>make sure your party uses Guard at the end of their turn</strong>. Guarding is the only way you can completely negate the chance of suffering a critical hit, which Matador will inflict after gathering Magatsuhi. This is a good tip for many boss encounters, but it’s especially vital here.<br></p><p>That said, based on my testing, Matador seemed to use <strong>Mazan </strong>after gathering Magatsuhi, which he then followed with <strong>Andalucia </strong>(which inflicts multiple Physical hits) on the next turn. Because of this, you may want to have the Nahobino use Guard for another turn to avoid the possibility of catching an unlucky critical hit. This also means that anyone in your party immune to Force may be able to endure his Magatsuhi-charged attack without guarding. Your mileage may vary.<br></p><p>Aside from this, Matador doesn’t have any other surprises to throw at you. Keep him comprehensively debuffed, exploit his thunder weakness as much as you can, and pile on the damage until he goes down. Your tactics beyond that will depend on your party composition, so let’s give you some pointers.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-recommend-id="image://1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An important screen for beating Matador." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An important screen for beating Matador." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-recommend-id="image://1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An important screen for beating Matador." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h150790"><a id=""></a>How to build the Nahobino to fight Matador</h2><p>Given Matador’s moveset, <strong>you’ll mitigate a ton of damage by imbuing the Nahobino’s Affinities with the Sudama Essence</strong>. This will grant your protagonist total immunity to Force damage, protecting him from potential critical hits via Mazan <em>and </em>making him cut Matador’s turns short (enemies abide by the same Press Turn system the party does, so hitting an immunity inflicts a turn penalty). Sudama’s weaknesses aren’t relevant in this encounter, and you can purchase the essence from Cadaver’s Hollow.</p><p>Beyond that, Nahobino’s moveset will depend on how you’ve built him and what party members you’ll bring to the fight. <strong>Aramasa </strong>remains one of your strongest moves in a Physical build, whereas <strong>Zio </strong>or <strong>Zionga </strong>will obviously excel in a magic build. Physical Nahobinos may still prefer to bring Zio if you don’t want to bank on critical hits for extra turns. Beyond that, debuff moves are useful to bring, and <strong>Miracle Water </strong>will come in clutch if you don’t have a viable healer. <strong>Inflaming Divinity </strong>can help if you’ve progressed far enough to access it, though this will drain your MP very fast. <strong>Rooted Soul </strong>is always viable for the extra HP and MP, so use that if you have a skill slot to spare.</p><h2 id="h150791"><a id=""></a>The best demons and party members to counter Matador</h2><p>You’re forced to take your protagonist into the encounter, but your other monsters are a different story.

It naturally learns <strong>Zionga </strong>to exploit Matador’s weakness, <strong>Sukunda</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to mitigate the effects of Red Capote, <em>and </em>it resists Force damage. It can even counter Matador’s attacks thanks to its <strong>Guardian Beast</strong> innate skill.</p><p>Since other Zio-focused demons are weak to Force, Shiisaa is uniquely one of the best damage dealers you could use in this encounter. You honestly don’t need to do much to build it, just level it up so it learns its full moveset.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-recommend-id="image://a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kikuri-Hime's screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kikuri-Hime's screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-recommend-id="image://a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kikuri-Hime's screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h150793"><a id=""></a>Kikuri-Hime</h2><p>If you need a dedicated healer, Kikuri-Hime is one of your best options. Her primary boon is her <strong>Force immunity</strong>, completely negating Matador’s Mazan. Additionally, she naturally learns <strong>Recarm </strong>and <strong>Media</strong>, which allows you to heal and revive party members as needed. Her innate skill <strong>Divine Benevolence </strong>will also reduce the MP cost of support skills, which includes debuffs.</p><p>Kikuri-Hime’s only downside is her negative electric proficiency, so she struggles as a damage dealer despite her great Magic stat. That said, her support proficiency makes her especially good at using debuffs like <strong>Tarunda</strong>, which she can learn naturally. Also consider giving her the Essence of <strong>Obariyon</strong> to let her learn <strong>Sekunda </strong>and/or <strong>Sekukaja</strong>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0f74594ab41d2b63b0c916abce5e428f" data-recommend-id="image://0f74594ab41d2b63b0c916abce5e428f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Oni screen.

With good Strength, even better Vitality, and native access to the <strong>Taunt </strong>skill, Oni can soak Matador’s Physical attacks like a champ. What’s more, his Physical resistance will dampen Matador’s hits and ease pressure on your healer(s). <strong>Fang Breaker </strong>is also a great support skill, as it deals damage and lowers the enemy’s offenses by one stage.</p><p>If you want to optimize Oni even further, give him the <strong>Counter </strong>ability. This will give Oni a chance to counter attack any enemy that uses a strength-based attack, which is <em>perfect </em>for a tank. You can learn this skill from the <strong>Nozuchi </strong>or <strong>Rakshasa </strong>Essences.<br></p><p><strong>Ippon-Datara</strong> is a serviceable alternative to Oni, thanks to its native access to Taunt and its tank-supporting <strong>One-Foot Hop </strong>ability. That said, Oni is generally superior, and you don’t need to use both.</p><figure id="" data-id="cfdf69263a7f2692f0ee36892384434f" data-recommend-id="image://cfdf69263a7f2692f0ee36892384434f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoko's character page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yoko's character page." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfdf69263a7f2692f0ee36892384434f" data-recommend-id="image://cfdf69263a7f2692f0ee36892384434f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoko's character page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h150795"><a id=""></a>Yoko Hiromine</h2><p><strong>For those playing through the <em>Vengeance </em>story path</strong>, Yoko Hiromine fares well in this fight. Her most obvious perk is <strong>Zio</strong>, which upgrades to <strong>Zionga</strong> after a small amount of story progress. Thanks to her high Magic stat, she can make good use of these spells. She can heal and debuff Matador’s attack in a pinch too, though you’ll want to save her MP for those electric spells.</p><p>As a human character, Yoko can use items as needed. Given how helpful items are in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, this alone makes Yoko more versatile than she has any right to be. Absolutely no investment or building is required to use Yoko, so slot her into your party if you’re tired of devoting resources to this fight.<br></p><h2 id="h150796"><a id=""></a>Honorable Mentions</h2><p>Aside from the above, any demons that can inflict Electric damage and aren’t weak to Force can work. For example, <strong>Feng-Huang</strong> resists Force and doesn’t have a negative Electric proficiency, so you can teach it Zio and use it as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-recommend-id="image://816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screen showing the stats and skills of Feng Huang, which has the apperance of a colorful, regal bird." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A screen showing the stats and skills of Feng Huang, which has the apperance of a colorful, regal bird." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-recommend-id="image://816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screen showing the stats and skills of Feng Huang, which has the apperance of a colorful, regal bird." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As long as you play carefully, you shouldn’t need many backup demons to get through Matador. Build your team right, react to Matador’s attacks, and you should get your clear in no time. As a reward, you’ll unlock a special fusion for Matador, so you can use his powers against all who stand against you. Good luck in the rest of your journey through Da’at!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">In another big change, Holy Bolts Elixir is getting a major power reduction, thanks to the seasonal elixir "scaling unintentionally high when it was triggered from pets such as Necromancer's minions." The elixir, which sends bolts of holy energy in all directions upon killing an enemy, will soon deal a percentage of weapon damage instead of a percentage of an enemy's health. The change is intended to "reduce its effectiveness against the toughest enemies in higher tiers of the Pit," but Blizzard notes the elixir "will still be really valuable for players throughout the whole game."</p><p dir="ltr">Classes are seeing some changes too, with Whirlwind Barbarians, non-minion Necromancer builds, and Twisting Blades Rogues in particular receiving some significant buffs. On the item side, various Uber Uniques--like Andariel's Visage, Tyrael's Might, Doombringer, and Ring of Starless Skies--are all getting buffs, and the game's healing potions are increasing, with higher-level potions set to have their initial healing increased by 200%.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 4, which overhauled the game's items and introduced new ways for players to customize and power-up their gear, has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-4-loot-overhaul-is-going-over-very-well-with-fans/1100-6523491/" data-ref-id="1100-6523491">well-received by the game's community</a>.

You can read the full patch notes for update 1.4.3 below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">GAME UPDATES</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>We greatly appreciate everyone’s excitement since the launch of Season 4 and are very happy with the state of the game. The changes in this patch are aimed at buffing classes and builds that are not performing as well as their counterparts. We are also slightly reducing the difficulty of the Pit to ensure that most builds are able to get to Tier 60 to get their final tier of Masterworking materials.</em></p><h2 dir="ltr">BALANCE UPDATES</h2><h4 dir="ltr">General</h4><p dir="ltr"><strong>Healing Potions</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Minor Healing Potion  <ul><li dir="ltr">Initial healing increased by 50%.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Light, and Moderate Healing Potions  <ul><li dir="ltr">Initial healing increased by 100%.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Strong, Greater, Major, and Superior Healing Potions  <ul><li dir="ltr">Initial healing increased by 200%.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Legendary Aspects</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Aspect of the Protector  <ul><li dir="ltr">Barrier Cooldown reduced from 30 to 20 seconds.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mythic Unique Items</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Andariel’s Visage  <ul><li dir="ltr">Poison nova now spawns on the enemy instead of the player.</li><li dir="ltr">Poison nova damage increased by 50%.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Doombringer  <ul><li dir="ltr">Shadow explosion damage increased by 100%.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Ring of Starless Skies  <ul><li dir="ltr">Maximum stacks of Resource Cost Reduction and bonus Damage increased from 4 to 5.</li><li dir="ltr">This increases the maximum amount of Resource Cost Reduction and bonus Damage from 40%[x] to 50%[x].</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Tyrael’s Might  <ul><li dir="ltr">Divine barrage damage increased by 100%.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Paragon</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Stat requirements for non-main stats reduced from 90 to 60 per Paragon Board.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>A classes main stat is the one that increases the damage of all of their skills.

The stat requirements to activate any Rare Node increases for each additional Paragon Board you progress through. Some of these nodes that require non-main stats were harder to activate than intended.

            <p>
Former Dragon Age lead writer and Summerfall Games co-founder David Gaider has strung together some opinions on Xitter - the original spawning ground for all opinions - about the full reveal video for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, expressing broad enthusiasm for the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>’s narrative tone, combat system and environments, while offering a more ambivalent analysis of BioWare's decision to let players seduce every last member of their party.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Those Xeets came through yesterday. Since then, in the wake of a bunch of articles recapping his thoughts, Gaider has <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801425282223772043">chucklesomely added</a> that “I should shut up about Dragon Age for a while” and that “I have other things to do than to provide fodder for news articles that like to talk about what "former Dragon Age lead writer" tweets, after all”. Ooft! 
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen this kind of jovial bait-and-switch before, when an industry luminary serves up some insight on social media, waits for the internet’s news mosquitos to swarm the jar, then slams down the lid and traps those foolish insects of journalism in an atmosphere of mild professional embarrassment and self-loathing. Well, I didn’t make it into your dang jar yesterday, David. I was off buzzing around Monster Hunter at the time. So here I am fluttering at the glass, trying to rejoin my brethren. Let me in, David! I also wish to batten on the sweet nectar of your comparisons with Dragon Age 2!
</p>
<p>
Here’s Gaider’s <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801050867975819542">initial thread</a> on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">the full reveal gameplay footage</a> - not to be confused with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-very-first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-makes-it-look-like-a-fornite-heist-movie">the much clowned-on story trailer</a>, which is one wisecrack away from having Chris Pratt abseil through the ceiling in a tuxedo. 

"Overall, I'd say this made for a better introduction than the reveal trailer," Gaider begins. "We see some story, and tone-wise it feels a lot darker and more DA. Like I said, trailers often need to be taken with a grain of salt, and my impression is that many fans are relieved. Which is great. 
</p>
<p>
"I could pick on a few things," he adds. "The stylized characters will take some getting used to, but the DA art style has changed every game so that's nothing new. Combat is more action-y, without any tactical elements, but it seems fine. Style is not much different than, say, DA2's combat.” 
</p>
<p>
There's some commentary on the environments, which "look amazing, full stop. To see the sprawl of Minrathous - wow. I wish we could have done this for Kirkwall or even Val Royeaux. Utterly gorgeous, sells the breadth and tone, such great work." Gaider also notes that Veilguard's dialogue icons resemble those of Dragon Age 2, and is happy to see Solas back and causing a ruckus. "Could probably chatter about the implications for days, and how this aligns (or doesn't) with where I thought the story would go... but I won't. I'm just eager to see where this goes. To the folks at Bio: great job."
</p>
<p>
In a response to a response to his thread, Gaider had a touch more to say about Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s combat, noting that “it's not that far afield from where DA's been headed, though I'll miss the more tactical elements of the past, it's true. I imagine they'll make it fun, regardless.”
</p>
<p>
All pretty upbeat, then! In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">my own preview of the game</a> from SGF I focussed on the comparison with Dragon Age: Inquisition, the most recent Dragon Ager, but the link to Dragon Age 2 is worth pursuing. Depending on whether you’re playing it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/analysis-dragon-age-ii">2011</a> or any year after, let’s say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-dragon-age-ii">2015</a>, Dragon Age 2 is either Dragon Age’s lowest moment or its secret finest hour. It’s the more impetuously action-skewed of the existing Dragon Agers, especially before they patched in a proper auto-attack, and the least expansive or if you prefer, more focussed in terms of setting. Perhaps the better way of thinking about The Veilguard is that it’s a sequel to Dragon Age 2, rather than a streamlined version of Inquisition.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801421451414933634">a separate thread</a>, responding to an article from our colleagues at the Ian Acquisitions Network, Gaider offered a more involved appraisal of Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s letting you win the hearts of each and every one of your companions, noting that if you make a video game character a love interest, it stops you doing much else with them.</p>
<p>"First off, the fandom is pretty split on romance design," he wrote. "A huge part just want whoever they want, and NOT getting to romance them is tantamount to a slap in the face. Others like characters with more agency, even (and maybe especially) if it doesn't align with their preferences. 
</p>
<p>
"Nothing wrong with either desire, honestly," the thread continues. "It all depends on what you want out of your game. We're not all here for the same reasons, OK? The only unfortunate aspect, in my experience, is that these two approaches are more or less diametrically opposed, from a design standpoint. 
</p>
<p>
"The DA writers realized, eventually, that as soon as you make a character romanceable it limits the type of character they can be and the types of stories they can tell. They become beholden to their romance arc and their need to, ultimately, be appealing. 
</p>
<p>
"Why is that a limitation? Because not all character story arcs are defined by being appealing to the player. Even if the appeal of an arc is for a relatively limited audience, the requirement of having appeal inherently restricts the potential stories to a fairly limited band." 
</p>
<p>It was for the above reasons that the Inquisition writing team decided to make Varric, Dragon Age's smooth-sipping dwarven pulp novelist, a non-romanceable character, despite much Varric thirsting on the forums. "The call to back away from that approach in DAI was mine, made with [Mike Laidlaw]'s and the team's support," Gaider recalled. "I didn't like what taking away the followers' agencies did, that it turned them into sex dolls whose only purpose is to have the player mash them together and go "now kiss!"
</p>
<p>
To address the unclothed Githyanki in the room, Gaider also feels the hanky-panky-abundant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> might have been better if certain companion characters were off-limits. "Several characters would have had a stronger arc without romance, and the feeling I got from having this entire huge crew all ready to drop trou if I blinked wrong... meh." He thinks that Veilguard should get along perfectly well on this count, however, as long as "they unapologetically lean into it as BG3 did it", concluding that "it's a legit approach, like I said, and many many fans will be gleeful and happy for it."

            <p>There’ve been a ton of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-jackbox-party-pack">Jackbox Party Packs</a> over the last near-decade, each following a fairly similar structure: one or two standout games you’ll want to replay, a couple you might dip into every now and then, and at least one you’ll try once and then never bother with again. With 10 different packs to pick from, it becomes an increasing fuss to remember which pack has which game in, and then boot it up just to play its highlight before repeating the process when you choose to play something else.</p>

<p>Developers Jackbox Games seems to be <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/introducing-the-jackbox-megapicker">just as aware as anyone</a>, announcing the thing we’ve all been waiting for since at least Jackbox Party Pack 5: a single, unified launcher for all of the collected Jackbox Party Pack games that will let you jump between each of the more than 50 games released to date.</p>
<p>The Jackbox Megapicker, as they’ll christened it, will be out sometime next month on Steam, where it’ll be free to download. It’ll let you view all the Jackbox games you own, filter and sort them - it’s not clear what those options might be, but I’d assume things like player count - and then boot straight into your chosen game.</p>
<p>As someone who has found Jackbox to be a fixture of pretty much any social gathering in the last 10 years, it’s very welcome news. For what it’s worth, my favourite Jackbox remains <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jackbox-party-pack-3-released">Party Pack 3</a> - it’s hard to top Tee KO, and the rest are all good-to-great in a rare no-misses offering - though Mad Verse City from Pack 5 is an absolute banger thanks to hearing robot rappers spit awkward diss tracks about your friends.</p>

The high-stakes competitive mode is back this weekend, allowing you the chance to go Flawless and earn some serious, one-of-a-kind rewards. And like just about everything else in The Final Shape, Trials is seeing some significant changes from the way it used to work.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie gave us a few details about those changes in its latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_06_13_2024?msID=3e87801c-0c0d-41ea-8015-16858ff2d5f3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week In Destiny blog post</a>. The specific new alteration is that Trials is getting a new currency, called Osirian Cipher. What exactly these will get you isn't clear, though: the blog post only says, "This new and very aptly named currency can be exchanged for rewards every weekend." Nothing in the inventory of Saint-14, the Trials vendor, currently requires an Osirian Cipher to purchase it, but Bungie advises you "use them wisely," which suggests you'll be able to use them to grab specific rewards. We'll add more details here as soon as they're available.</p><p dir="ltr">As the blog post details, Osirian Ciphers are going to be somewhat hard to come by. You can earn one for completing a Passage of Persistence, and if you manage to go Flawless and reach the Lighthouse, you'll get four ciphers. You can keep a total of 10 in your inventory.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, this weekend allows you to earn the Adept version of The Summoner for your Trials tribulations. The auto rifle is highly accurate and dumps bullets fast, making it pretty deadly. Bungie has also updated it to be a Strand weapon rather than Kinetic, so if autos are your thing, you might want to try to nab one.</p><p dir="ltr">As always, both the Trials of Osiris rewards and the map are randomized when the mode goes live at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on Fridays. Here's what you're facing this weekend:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Map: Bannerfall</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Game Mode: Dominion</strong> (capture a control point or eliminate all opponents to win)</li><li dir="ltr">20 rounds won -- Pinnacle Trials Engram</li><li dir="ltr">7 matches won -- Pinnacle Trials Engram</li><li dir="ltr">Reputation Rank 10 -- Aisha's Care (Strand pulse rifle)</li><li dir="ltr">Reputation Rank 16 -- Shayura's Wrath (Void submachine gun)</li><li dir="ltr">Flawless run -- The Summoner (Adept), Solar auto rifle</li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you're not familiar with Trials of Osiris, the special PvP event runs from the daily reset on Friday until the weekly reset on Tuesday, giving you four days to take part. Your goal is for you and the other two players in your fireteam to achieve a "Flawless" run, in which you win seven matches without losing any.</p><p dir="ltr">Going Flawless gets you a trip to the Lighthouse, a special social space you can't reach any other way, and provides you with special rewards, including Adept weapons that can only come from Trials. These have additional stat bonuses, making them among the most coveted items you can get your hands on.</p><p dir="ltr">To access the mode, you'll need to buy a Trials Passage from Saint-14. The card tracks your wins, but not track your losses--so you can keep playing and earning rewards even if you lose out on a Flawless run. You also earn rewards based on the number of rounds, rather than matches, you've won during your session, Saint-14 has a reputation system similar to other vendors that will dish out some Trials-only loot in exchange for your participation, even if you don't clean out any lobbies.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, you'll also earn Trials Engrams for participating in the mode, which you can cash in with Saint-14 during the weekend you receive them. You can tune those engrams to yield specific pieces of loot, or take your chances with random drops that will expand what's available in your loot pool. You get Engrams even if you don't go Flawless, so it's worth trying your hand at the mode for some cool rewards, even if you're not cleaning out the competition. Just note that your Engrams for the weekend have to be cashed in before the weekly reset on Tuesday.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the rest of our Destiny 2 coverage with our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guides hub</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Final Shape review</a>.

        <p>Now renters will just split the bills, but their building will collapse if they can’t cover the costs</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> has found a delightfully straightforward solution to the very real-world problem of greedy landlords demanding excessive rent payments. The city-builder sequel will simply delete all its virtual leeches in its next patch, helping to bring down the cost of living in your digital metropolis.</p>

<p>The changes arriving in Colossal Order’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/4145079671516384052?l=english">next patch</a> are dubbed “Economy 2.0”, looking to stop the likelihood of players being bombarded by complaints of “High Rent” by their virtual population. Rather than having renters fork over their cash to a virtual landlord, the patch will remove landlords so citizens living together in a building just split the cost equally between them. Wow, it’s almost like landlords serve no valuable purpose and don’t need to exist at all for society to function properly.</p>
<p>On top of driving landlords out of the city, Colossal Order have tweaked the way that rent prices are calculated as a whole, basing a reasonable cost on the overall income of the household. If renters start to struggle with paying the bills, they’ll look to save some cash on things like resources before saying the rent’s too high - and subsequently moving out or relocating to more affordable housing.</p>
<p>If residents do continue to struggle to pay the bills, mind, their building will eventually start degrading and could even collapse if left without maintenance. Covering the rent will reverse the risk, gradually progressing buildings up a series of different levels.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the next patch, you’ll now be able to remove building upgrades without having to knock the whole thing down thanks to a new bin icon on their info panel, while sub-buildings can also be freely moved around and turned on and off for extra control.</p>
<p>Colossal Order have reassured that existing saves will still work when the new patch lands, though the changes to the calculations and such mean that you might just need to keep an eye on things for a bit after you boot it up. Government subsidies are gone and the cost of City Service upkeep has been increased, so your city is likely to be spending more once you reload. More industrial space means more demand, while the shift in companies trying to be profitable also means more citizens may end up unemployed once things settle.</p>
<p>Colossal Order say they’re already lining up Cities: Skylines 2’s next patch for Q3 of this year, teasing expanded service import options, UI improvements and information, and some new buildings on the way - including what looks like a bin lorry and a water tower of some kind.</p>

			<p>2012’s Lollipop Chainsaw is very much a product of its time, but it’s attracted a bit of a cult following over the years for both the obvious reasons, and because of surprisingly sharp writing by a pre-Marvel-fame James Gunn and its solid, varied gameplay. Well, a new version of the game, entitled <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/lollipop-chainsaw-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lollipop Chainsaw RePop</a> has now locked down a September release date.</p>
<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop was not made with the involvement of Gunn or the game’s original co-director Suda51, but its original executive producer Yoshimi Yasuda is heading up the project under the Dragami Games banner (Dragami is a split-off company from Lollipop Chainsaw co-developer Kadokawa games). RePop looks to occupy a somewhat unique position between a remaster and remake, offering largely similar graphics (uprezed and touched up of course) but a number of gameplay tweaks and improvements. The story will remain the same as before though, with players being able to play with gore intact or RePop mode in which the blood is replaced with colorful effects. Unfortunately, a lot of the licensed songs from the original game will be getting the chop. Check out a new trailer for Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW RePOP FIRST TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iacKQtesXlQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Need to know more? Here are Lollipop Chainsaw RePop’s key features…</p>
<p><em><strong>Quality of Life Improvements</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The resolution of the game has been increased to full HD, and load times have been greatly shortened.</em></li>
<li><em>The chainsaw action has been sped up with the introduction of the Chained Hits Hunting system, in which chaining multiple hits in succession increases the player’s attack speed.</em></li>
<li><em>The input timings for Combo Actions have been adjusted, to better fit players’ expectations.</em></li>
<li><em>Chainsaw Blaster action has been improved with the addition of auto-lock and auto-fire modes that can be toggled, and an increased maximum ammo count of 99.</em></li>
<li><em>The player can now immediately use Combo Actions at the start of the game.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Additional Gameplay Content</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Separate from Original Mode, RePop adds “RePop mode,” which uses a unique and colorful pop art-inspired art style for damage effects.</em></li>
<li><em>Unique new chainsaws with distinctly different features have been added.</em></li>
<li><em>There are 30 costumes, more than the original game’s costume count. Combined with the addition of 4 new hair colors and 4 new chainsaws, this adds up to 750 different possible combinations.</em></li>
<li><em>Juliet’s Room has been expanded with more features.</em></li>
<li><em>A “Time Attack” mode with ranking feature has been added.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop launches on PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Switch on September 25.</p>

<p id="wHKt7R">Inside Stormveil Castle, from the <strong>Rampart Tower Site of Grace</strong>, go north and down the stairs to access the roof of the church. Be careful with the Warhawks in your path. You can enter using one of the windows or use a ladder on the southeast side to access the church. If you choose the latter, you’ll have to defeat the patrolling units. Otherwise, they can follow you inside the church and attack Rogier.</p>

Teleport there if Melina has already taken you there, or visit a site of grace for her to appear and invite you. You can find Rogier <strong>sitting on the balcony east of the central room</strong>. Talk to him and choose the “I’ve defeated Godrick” dialogue option once it’s available. Rogier rewards you with the <strong>Rogier’s Rapier +8</strong> and ends the conversation.</p>

<p id="ncPy1P">To progress Rogier’s questline, you need to visit an underground section of Stormveil Castle, where you can learn about what happened to Rogier.</p>
<p id="vu1zkw">Teleport to the <strong>Liftside Chamber Site of Grace</strong>, take the lift on the left, and, in the next area, use the ledge to access a window on the right side. From there, turn right and follow the only available path.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ac-infinity-now-known-as-%E2%80%98animus-hub%E2%80%99-could-launch-with-shadows.901791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/animus-hub-ac-infinity-shadows/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a recent interview, it was revealed that Assassin’s Creed Infinity, the core ecosystem that was planned by Ubisoft to act as the beating heart of the AC series, has been renamed. It’s now known as the Animus Hub, but for all intents and purposes, it’ll do the exact same thing (just under a new name), acting as the central nervous system for all things Assassin’s Creed, much in the way that the Call of Duty HQ is a centrepoint for launching COD titles these days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sudden-changes">Sudden Changes</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/assassins-creed-shadows-interview">interview with Game File</a>, Ubisoft’s VP executive producer, Marc-Alexis Côté, confirmed to Stephen Totilo that the name change had taken effect but it wasn’t confirmed when the ‘platform’ will come into play. However, it <strong>was </strong>suggested that it’ll land in time for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the dual-protagonist title set in Feudal Japan that’s set to be released on November 15.</p>



<p>That’s something that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-infinty-news/">we reported back in February</a>. </p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was revealed with a gameplay breakdown earlier this week at Ubisoft Forward, and it looks pretty fantastic. The character split is heavily evident, with one side behind commanded by the hulking samurai, Yasuke, and the other being represented by the agile and lithe shinobi, Naoe. It looks unequivocally ‘RPG AC’ but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>



<p>With a dynamic weather system that includes seasons, a massive open-world map, multiple approaches to missions, and more movement and stealth mechanics than ever before, AC Shadows should be a memorable enough title. It has been a long time coming, too – while 2023’s Mirage was a great stopgap, it didn’t have that much meat on its bones – that’s where Shadows will step up.</p>



<p>It’s set to release on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S on November 15 – will it launch alongside the Animus Hub?</p>

                <p>A nomad no more, things have changed for Xur in Destiny 2: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a> as the wandering arms dealer has finally set up shop in a permanent location in the game. With a slice of prime real estate dedicated to him, Xur has also undergone a revamp and he now offers a more exciting selection of Exotic gear for players to browse through. In case you're looking to get a potentially good roll of a specific armor piece or you're looking to see if he has a specific catalyst, here's where you can find Xur this weekend and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week Xur is offering the weapon catalysts for Bad Juju and Arbalest. Hunters can pick up <strong>Lucky Raspberry</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Heart of Inmost Light</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Nezarec's Sin</strong>.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319455-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319455" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319455-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319455"></a><figcaption>Xur's location in the Tower's Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319455-xur-tfs.jpg"></figure><p>Spawn in at the Tower and hang a right past Banshee-44. Continue down the stairs, follow the corridor, and once you hit the Bazaar, turn right down the nearby alleyway. You'll find Xur here in his dedicated alcove, ready to sell you his latest wares if you have enough Strange Coins in your pocket.

Using a grenade, melee, or class ability will empower the others, making your offensive abilities do more damage and your barricade will have more hit points. Ideally you'd want both discipline and strength to have high stats, but unfortunately, you're not getting that on this roll. Recovery eats up the bulk of the available stat points, and discipline is high but but there's a very low strength stat attached to this armor.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 4</li><li>Resilience: 7</li><li>Recovery: 25</li><li>Discipline: 17</li><li>Intellect: 10</li><li>Strength: 6</li><li><strong>Stat total: </strong>69</li></ul><h3>Lucky Raspberry (Exotic Hunter chest armor)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319466-destiny22024-06-1419-03-59.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319466" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319466-destiny22024-06-1419-03-59.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319466"></a><figcaption>Lucky Raspberry</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319466-destiny22024-06-1419-03-59.jpg"></figure><p>Lucky Raspberry's armor perk is Overflowing Light, which is great for Hunters wanting to be grenadiers. Arcbolt Grenades gain an increased chance to chain damage around enemies, and damaging enemies with Jolt lightning strikes or collecting Ionic Traces will recharge that ability more quickly. With this Exotic equipped, you can also use Arcbolt Grenade to stun Overload champions. This is a pretty great roll as well, with resilience, recovery, and discipline all having high stats. Intellect and strength are low, but these can be addressed with some armor mods.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 4</li><li>Resilience: 16</li><li>Recovery: 16</li><li>Discipline: 19</li><li>Intellect: 9</li><li>Strength: 2</li><li><strong>Stat total: </strong>66</li></ul><h3>Nezarec's Sin (Exotic Warlock helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319467-destiny22024-06-1419-04-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319467" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319467-destiny22024-06-1419-04-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319467"></a><figcaption>Nezarec's Sin</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319467-destiny22024-06-1419-04-20.jpg"></figure><p>Another classic from the Destiny 2 vault, Nezarec's Sin works really nicely if you're focusing on causing some damage with Void weapons and abilities. Any Void damage you deal will increase your ability energy recharge rate, so pair this with a weapon like Graviton Lance and you'll quickly refill your ability meters. Unfortunately, this is not a good roll of Nezarec's Sin. Mobility is unnecessarily high, resilience is terribly low, and discipline is also not great. Intellect and strength aren't too bad, but this Exotic is worth skipping this weekend if you already have a better one in your armory.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 20</li><li>Resilience: 3</li><li>Recovery: 11</li><li>Discipline: 6</li><li>Intellect: 16</li><li>Strength: 12</li><li><strong>Stat total: </strong>68</li></ul><h2>Exotic Weapon Catalysts</h2><h3>Genesis (Arbalest Catalyst)</h3><p>Breaking a combatant's shield with this weapon fills its magazine from reserves.

Xur has changed how he conducts business. For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/microsofts-recent-layoffs-cast-a-heavy-shadow-over-this-years-xbox-showcase/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=microsofts-recent-layoffs-cast-a-heavy-shadow-over-this-years-xbox-showcase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="161" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While I don’t quite share some peoples’ enthusiasm for Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest Xbox showcase</a>, I will concede that it was at least a decent showing. </p> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">The whole thing was brisk and crammed a lot of announcements into its near two hour runtime and, while I was more intrigued by some of the third-party announcements (like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-brings-back-max-caulfield-launches-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <em>Life is Strange</em></a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-announced-at-xbox-games-showcase/">turn-based RPG <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>), there were some pivotal first-party reveals that warranted excitement from Xbox players, such as the long absent <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/new-perfect-dark-gameplay-trailer-looks-neither-perfect-nor-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark</a></em> and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gears-of-war-prequel-e-day-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <em>Gears of War</em></a>. But every time Microsoft had something new to show from one of its teams, all I could think of was, “Man, I hope this team doesn’t get shut down.”</p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">It’s no secret that the games industry, as a whole, feels like it’s collapsing in on itself. We’re only halfway through 2024 and an estimated 10,800 people have lost their jobs across a wide range of studios. What’s especially damning is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-games-industry-has-already-laid-off-more-people-this-year-than-in-all-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is already higher than the number of 2023 industry lay offs</a>: approximately 10,500. </p> <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="914" data-injectable="true">Microsoft may not be the sole contributor to these numbers, but it is one of the most notable examples. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-layoffs-affect-343-bethesda-report-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">At the beginning of 2023</a>, it culled staff at <em>Halo</em> studio 343 Industries and <em>Gears of War</em> studio The Coalition, as well as Bethesda. This past January, it let go roughly 1,900 employees from its gaming division, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-lays-off-1900-employees-from-activision-blizzard-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including ones at Activision Blizzard</a> which it had only recently bought out for $75.4 billion. And then, just last month, it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shuttered several of its studios</a> including Tango Gameworks, despite Microsoft deeming its last title, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hi-fi-rush-destructoid-tango-gameworks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a></em>, a success.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Xbox YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="614" data-current-count="914" data-injectable="true">To see Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty, and Xbox president Sarah Bond take to the stage and talk about how amazing and talented their studios feels tonally dissonant. Booty said, “The creativity and talent of game creators are what make our industry unique, and I’m incredibly proud of our games and our teams.” But such praise rings hollow when, again, Tango Gameworks provided the Xbox brand with the creative and unique <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>. It could very well have gone on to make even more such projects, but that apparently wasn’t good enough for Microsoft.</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">When I see something like <em>South of Midnight</em>, which boasts its own distinctive visual style and unique Southern Gothic inspirations, how can I have any faith that developer Compulsion Games (who Microsoft acquired in 2018) won’t get gutted or shut down, even if the game sells well or pulls in new Game Pass subscribers? </p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">I can’t imagine how former employees who contributed to Microsoft’s awesome reveals felt seeing them get such glowing responses. Actually, I don’t need to, because some of them admitted in an interview with <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-diablo-gears-of-war-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aftermath</a> about how bittersweet it all was. Take this quote from Shayna Moon, who was an engine producer on <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> (easily the highlight of the whole showcase) and was laid off in 2023:</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true"> <p>“Seeing the trailer go up and the title get announced made me feel empty inside. It was a reminder that after I got laid off my team kept going without me. I am genuinely happy for the coworkers I was close with while I was there. But I’m still extremely angry about what Microsoft has done these last two years. My layoff in January 2023 was sandwiched between Microsoft executives having a private concert from Sting and then them shelling out $69 billion for the Activision merger.”</p> </blockquote>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="South of Midnight - Gameplay Reveal - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4UHyaaWXuw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="824" data-current-count="1124" data-injectable="true">The way the showcase played out, you wouldn’t think the industry was on fire. Anyone not in the know tuning in could easily believe everything’s hunky-dory, and that Microsoft hadn’t put hundreds of people out of work barely two months before. Even Geoff Keighley managed to at least acknowledge the state of the industry when opening the Summer Game Fest showcase this year. It was brief and didn’t really touch on the root of the problem, but it was still far more than what Xbox offered. You’d think with how much public outrage there was regarding the shutdowns of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin, that they’d want to at least appear apologetic or offer any sort of condolences during the showcase. Clearly, announcing a new <em>Gears of War</em> was enough to make people forget or forgive.</p>
 <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">Admittedly, Spencer was asked about the recent studio shutdowns during his <a href="https://youtu.be/IIpMhthwnto?si=2unT4L8clJA0jEj4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with IGN</a> (one of the only interview he was apparently willing to do during this year’s SGF), but his answer was disappointingly, if unsurprisingly, corporate. All he could say was that it was a tough decision he didn’t enjoy making, and that his priority is to “run a sustainable business inside the company and grow.”</p>
 <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true">It’s not even a real explanation for why, specifically, the likes of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin had to go. Not to sound like a broken record, but <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> was a success in all key metrics <a href="https://x.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Xbox’s Aaron Greenberg</a>, and while Arkane’s <em>Redfall</em> most certainly underperformed, it’s reported that the game’s failure wasn’t the impetus for its closure. Instead, it was, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNTE5ODQyOCwiZXhwIjoxNzE1ODAzMjI4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRDZOSzZEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.zOpVTjvikB5ShRoVNwwKrwaDGSVNL6qhY3mhsEXW_nI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Bloomberg report</a>, because Microsoft was being spread too thin across its various studios. </p>
 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">“It’s hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over,” said Jill Braff, head of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media. This feels especially strange, after Xbox spent billions on acquiring Activision Blizzard and its studios.</p> <figure data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Microsoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">It doesn’t sound like Microsoft is in dire financial straits, either. Its decision to axe staff at Activision came two weeks after Microsoft briefly overtook Apple as the most valuable company in the world, worth $2.859 trillion (per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>). I’m not the first to make this observation, but it feels like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-people-making-the-games-keep-paying-the-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving the employees holding the bag</a>.</p> <p data-characters="748" data-current-count="1104" data-injectable="true">Recently, Obsidian Entertainment’s Carrie Patel and Matt Hansen, director and art director on fantasy RPG <em>Avowed</em>, mentioned they still <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/avowed-director-say-they-feel-sense-of-security-under-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">felt supported by Microsoft and weren’t afraid about their studio’s future</a> even after the closures of Arkane and Tango. That’s all well and good, but how long will that last? Who’s to say Obsidian’s staff won’t face job cuts or even be completely shutdown in the future? You can’t say, “Well, Obsidian makes good games like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-outer-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>,” because so did Tango Gameworks. Arkane Austin had the 2017 <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-prey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prey</a></em> under its belt, and people still praise that game to this day. Yet neither of these studios’ reputations saved them from the chopping block.</p>
 <p data-characters="622" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="false">I sadly have no perfect conclusion where I lay out what can be done to prevent future job losses or fix any of this. But we mustn’t allow ourselves to be distracted by whatever shiny new toy companies like Microsoft dangle in front of us. It doesn’t matter how good of a showcase Microsoft had this summer, that it’s putting <em>Call of Duty</em> on Game Pass, that it’s got a new <em>Gears of War</em> in the works. None of that changes how these employees have been treated, how talent has been made disposable. Even the best video games are not worth it, if the people who make them can be tossed aside so easily.</p>

<p>Rumours have abounded about a remaster or re-release of Final Fantasy Tactics since at least 2021, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hopes-for-god-of-war-on-pc-stoked-by-leaked-nvidia-list">a list of games datamined from Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming service leaked out</a>, including PlayStation exclusives like God of War - which has since come to PC - alongside apparent ports of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> and FF Tactics. Nvidia later <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-responds-to-geforce-now-database-leak-says-list-included-speculative-titles/">confirmed the list was real</a>, but described the titles as “speculative” releases rather than confirmation of their existence.</p>
<p>Talk of a Tactics remaster has been kicking around for a while, and recently came back into discussion in the wake of the recent drama around prolific Persona and JRPG leaker Midori, who <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1801044892300267796">revealed themselves</a> to be a previously blacklisted male American leaker who resurfaced under the guise of a Japanese woman (complete with tweets apparently composed deliberately in broken English, ew). Prior to their admittance of being a fraud, Midori had been sharing apparent details about a Final Fantasy Tactics remaster. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-reportedly-real">Eurogamer</a>.)</p>
<p>Though the truth of the Tactics remaster was called into question following Midori’s fall from grace - the account was also found to have made inaccurate claims about upcoming RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/visions-of-mana">Visions of Mana</a> - Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier jumped in to add some weight to the claims.</p>
<p>“The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster is real and happening,” Schreier <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1de4kcu/comment/l8aa74v/">responded</a> to a thread discussing the credibility of the details on Reddit.</p>

<p>Schreier’s report - brief as it is - contrasts comments made by Tactics director Yasumi Matsuno in December, when he <a href="https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/1729771931522470343?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1729771931522470343%7Ctwgr%5E5e6d5af26c884fa458dd8e1c1bab4bacc7ac0b9c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Ffinal-fantasy-tactics-remaster-rumours-squashed-by-director">told a fan on TwiXer</a> that “currently, there are no plans for remastering [Tactics]”.</p>
<p>If a Tactics remake does find its way onto PC, it’ll mark the first time that the 1997 spin-off has been officially available to play away from the original PlayStation. A revamped version of Tactics, subtitled The War of the Lions, featuring full-motion cutscenes, an expanded roster of characters and multiplayer, as well as a 16:9 resolution, was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2007, before later finding its way onto mobile.</p>
<p>The closest that Tactics has come to PC to date is MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, which used its world of Ivalice (shared with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xii">Final Fantasy 12</a>) and an alternative storyline as inspiration for the Return to Ivalice series of raids.</p>
