            <link>https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-simply-do-not-know-where-to-start-writing-about-clair-obscur.1184913/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you write about games for a living, you rarely just sit down and write about a whole damn game. Even reviews, which some people think <em>should</em> be that, are hopefully something more focused and nuanced. Impressions of a game tend to involve the writer choosing a hook, an angle, something to peg their thoughts on before expanding on them over the course of an article.</p><p>It's why, for example, my <em>Infinite Wealth</em> "review"<a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ended up</a> as<a href="https://aftermath.site/infinite-wealth-ichiban-kasuga-friendship-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> two separate pieces</a>, or why<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows'</em> ending specifically</a>; it's easier for everyone, me and you, if we just find one thing to talk about in detail. And normally, that's pretty easy to do! I wrote about <em>Shadows</em>' ending because it really stood out, and the <em>Yakuza </em>posts were based on themes and impressions that became clear over my time with the game, which I thought were a lot more interesting than talking about "graphics" and "difficulty".</p><p>This week, though, I am having <em>problems</em>. I have been playing <em>Clair Obscur</em> non-stop, it's that good, but every time I go to write about it I find myself struggling to find that hook. Not because there's nothing good or interesting to write about, but because <em>everything </em>in <em>Clair Obscur </em>is good and interesting.</p><figure></figure><p>That's OK, maybe I can pivot to writing about stuff I don't like and...hrm. I guess traversing the levels can suck sometimes, if I have to name <em>one </em>thing I am not completely enamoured by. They can get a bit sprawly and repetitive at times, and you can get lost if you're not careful; they maybe need a map or clearer marker system or something. It gets a bit tedious. But like, that's it? I can't pad a whole post out into me complaining about that.</p><p>Everything else I cast my eyes, hands and ears over is just the best. The music rules. I love the art design. The battles have <em>got me</em>, someone who doesn't normally dabble in this genre outside of <em>Persona </em>and the odd <em>Final Fantasy</em>. The writing is great, the voice acting is great, the interlocking magic and abilities systems are surprisingly elegant.</p><p>I could write about any one of these things, sure, but every time I've tried I look over at everything else and it feels like I'm about to adopt only one kitten from an entire litter, and those left behind are looking at me with the biggest, saddest eyes. Awwww, character art, I love you, but I can't write about you <em>and </em>Charlie Cox, there are only so many hours in a day!</p><p>Though...ah. Maybe this <em>is </em>the hook. That the game is hookless. And that in my failed attempts to avoid writing about a whole game maybe I have to, just this once, if only to emphasise how fucking good it is.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar"><h3>A Video Game Trailer Maker’s Take On The Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer</h3></a><p>"If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped.

                <p>Mafia: The Old Country is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC on August 8 and preorders are up at digital storefronts. The linear action game will focus on storytelling and immersion, providing fans with a nuanced new take on the series. Two different versions of the game are up for grabs, and there are preorder bonuses for reserving a copy in advance. Best of all, the <strong>standard edition is priced at just $50</strong>--a nice change of pace from all of today’s $70 and $80 releases.</p><h2>Mafia: The Old Country Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4490903-mafiapreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4490903-mafiapreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490903"></a><figcaption>Mario: The Old Country</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4490903-mafiapreorders.jpg"></figure><p>All Mafia: The Old Country preorders include the Soldato DLC Pack, which offers the following in-game items:</p><ul><li>“Soldato” Outfit</li><li>“Scannaturi Speciale” Knife</li><li>“Tesoro” Horse and Accessories</li><li>“Lupara” Charm</li></ul><p>You can also sign up for a free 2K account to unlock the “Garzia Tumulto Race Car,” plus additional benefits for other Mafia games.

Did you know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> is the 21st best-selling game of all time? It's sold more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>! At least by the numbers we currently have, anyway. I don't care all that much about sales figures, but if creator Eric Barone cared more about money, I can only imagine that a sequel would be all but guaranteed. As it turns out though, the developer could actually see himself making a sequel to the beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a>.
</p>

<p>
Barone recently appeared on the podcast Tiger Belly (thanks, GamesRadar), where host Bobby Lee asked why he doesn't just make a Stardew Valley 2 when he's constantly releasing new updates. "It's just so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," Barone explains. "Because Stardew Valley, all the systems, the major systems, are already all done. That's the stuff that's not fun to do. When I make an update, it's like, throw in this, throw in that, let's add green rain. These random ideas I have. Whimsical ideas."

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83DYlsJoaFk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
He noted that a lot of these ideas come about from playing the game himself and thinking, "'Oh, wouldn't it be cool if there was this or that?' And then I can just do it, and that's a new update. It's really just fun and creative and spontaneous to do it that way than to make a whole new game."
</p>
<p>
And then came the comment that struck fear into my heart: "I might eventually make a Stardew Valley 2, to be honest." I say fear, because Barone struggles to not update the original game, so much so he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-knows-if-stardew-valley-is-finally-done-but-the-dev-behind-it-is-committed-to-not-working-on-it-until-haunted-chocolatier-is-done">somewhat forcing himself to stop working on it so he can actually finish Haunted Chocolatier</a>. However, Barone did also say that while he won't deny the possibility of a Stardew Valley 2, he doesn't "want to just be the Stardew Valley guy, that's why I'm making <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>."
</p>
<p>
So, really we've got a Schrodinger's Stardew Valley sequel here. Fingers crossed Barone doesn't get carried away and do it, I'd like to play Haunted Chocolatier before I retire.

Instead, they have been replaced by the same two-minute runs and objectives found in the first three games. This upset a lot of hardcore players. And now Iron Galaxy, the team behind the remaster package, has explained why it cut the OG career mode. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/honoring-two-of-the-most-critically-acclaimed-games-ever&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/honoring-two-of-the-most-critically-acclaimed-games-ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to <em>Game Informer</em></a></span>, <em>THPS 3+4</em> design director Mike Rossi said that the team looked at <em>THPS 1+2 </em>and thought it was a good representation of the essence of those OG games. So they looked back at <em>3</em> and <em>4</em> before developing this new remake. </p><p> “We looked at <em>3</em>, and that was obviously another very highly regarded title in the franchise. So then it was, ‘Let’s look at <em>4</em>. It’s quite different, but what, at its essence, is it?’ Our goal here is to make the ultimate package of <em>3</em> and <em>4</em>. So ultimately, we felt that taking it into feeling more towards the <em>3</em> format, as opposed to what <em>4</em> did originally, was a better representation for a cohesive package that we were making.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamingbible.com/features/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-preview-605531-20250508&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamingbible.com/features/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-preview-605531-20250508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a different interview with <em>Gaming Bible</em></a></span>, <em>THPS 3+4 </em>game director Kurt Tillmanns said that once they put the timer in <em>THPS 4</em>'s levels, they knew that “this is totally going to work.”</p><p>“We recreated some of those classic goals that you remember [from <em>THPS 4</em>]; skitching the professor’s car, freeing the prisoner — in this new format all of those things still work.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/05/09/we-got-to-chat-with-iron-galaxy-about-bringing-tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-to-life/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/05/09/we-got-to-chat-with-iron-galaxy-about-bringing-tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to <em>Press Start</em></a></span>, Rossi was asked if the inclusion of an option to  extend the timer in <em>THPS 3+4</em>'s career mode  for up to an hour—as opposed to the hard and fast two minutes found in the old games—was a reaction to the negative feedback they received from fans who wanted the open-world career mode of <em>THPS 4. </em></p><p>“No,” said Rossi. “We knew going into it that it was going to be tough and that people were going to be looking at it. But we felt this was the right way to approach it, and it made it a more cohesive package. We had already been thinking, you know, we’ve got the mods, which, in our eyes, is another way of putting accessibility things in.”</p><p>“And a lot of the feedback we were getting internally, plus we’d see online, was that people didn’t always love the two-minute timer. You know, they’d want just a little bit more time. ‘Oh, I was just about to figure that out, or finish this thing. If only I had one more minute.’ And so why not give them that extra minute, or whatever extra time they want? It doesn’t feel like that impacts the overall goal that we’re trying to accomplish; it doesn’t impact progression,” said Rossi.</p><p> “So we just threw that in, it’s a nice coincidence, and now, hopefully, we can point to that as a solution for those people who are looking for more time in those levels.”</p><p>I’m not sure these answers will calm fans who believe the open-world format of <em>THPS4's</em> levels was a big part of the game’s identity. But at this point we are just a few a months away from launch and the devs sound committed to the objective-based run format for <em>THPS 4.</em> It’s a shame for fans of the OG game, but at least the original game is still around for those who prefer it. </p><p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em> launches July 11 on Xbox, Game Pass, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/eberron-forge-of-artificer-newest-dungeons-dragons-2024-supplement-is-available-for<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> 2024</em> supplement is now available for pre-order. Wizards of the Coast is returning to the beloved setting of Khorvaire with <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>, bringing the magical tinkerer player class to the latest version of the fantasy TTRPG.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> is a new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 supplement. The supplement will contain new player options, monster statblocks, and magic items. These options will be based on the titular setting created by Keith Baker.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-armorer-artwork.jpg?itok=wF401Fu8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-armorer-artwork.jpg?itok=tjKb3t4M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The biggest draw of the player options is the newly revised Artificer class. This class is a staple of the Eberron setting, embodying the power fantasy of channeling magic through gadgets and scientific devices. It was absent in the 2024 core rulebooks until it returned in recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, not only will <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> contain revised versions of all four Artificer subclasses, it will also contain a brand new subclass: the Cartographer. In addition to this revised class, the supplement will include an overhauled Dragonmark system, new player species including the Warforged, and new player bastions.</p>

<p>Lastly, the book's official store page on D&amp;D Beyond, mentions campaign templates for Game Masters. The book contains three distinct, genre-based templates based on the key thematic elements of Eberron: fantasy noir, political thriller, and pulp adventure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aside from these templates, it is unclear if the book will contain new lore or background details on the setting. This inclusion seems to go against the company's production roadmap as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-direct-2024-highlights-future-of-dd-and-showcases-project-sigil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Direct 2024</a>. During this presentation, it seemed future books would be separated into Player Guides and Campaign Guides intended for GMs.</p>

<p>Considering one of the critiques of <em>D&amp;D</em> books has been unevenly distributed material across several books, this appears to be WOTC falling back into bad habits. But considering, the 2014 supplement, <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, is still compatible with the 2024 ruleset, it is more likely WOTC is avoiding reprinting old information.</p>

<p><em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> is available for pre-order now on <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/category/5147000?pid=D5147000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a>. It is available in digital for $19.99, a physical book for $29.99 and an Ultimate Bundle for $39.99 which includes digital and physical books alongside digital maps and digital dice. The books are set to release August 19.</p>

            <p>
Alien: Rogue Incursion, the action-horror adventure from developer Survios, is ditching its headset requirements and getting a non-VR release on PS5 and Steam this September.
</p>
<p>
Alien: Rogue Incursion initially launched for PSVR 2 and PCVR last December, putting players into the big clompy boots of ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks as they - alongside their ever-present synth companion Davis 01 - embarked on a dangerous mission to the uncharted planet Purdan, in the hope of exposing the Weyland-Yutani's black-site experiments. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't take long for those pesky Xenomorphs to make their presence known.
</p>
<p>
Survios calls Alien: Rogue Incursion (which additionally launched for Meta Quest 3 earlier this year) part one of a two-part story, albeit one that "stands alone as a complete story" if you don't include "thrilling cliffhanger". It's newly announced non-VR release is titled Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition, and is described as having been "re-envisioned" for console and PC. What that means in specific terms isn't entirely clear, but there's talk of "even deadlier Xenomorphs and enhanced visuals."

<p>
The original Alien: Rogue Incursion currently has a 'mixed' rating on Steam, having garnered criticism for issues ranging from wonky AI to poor performance - but the general concensus seems to be it's built on solid foundations and manages to capture the essence of the beloved sci-fi series. And if that works for you, Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition will be available in two guises when it launches for PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3655390/Alien_Rogue_Incursion_Evolved_Edition/">Steam</a> on 30th September.
</p>
<p>
There's a $29.99 USD Standard Edition featuring just the base game, plus a $39.99 Deluxe Edition. This includes the base game, a Blue Camo armour skin, a Blue Camo weapon skin, and The Art of Alien: Rogue Incursion in-game art book. It's unclear, however, if owners of the earlier VR edition will be able to access the new version without forking out for the new release.
</p>
<p>
So to recap, Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition launches for Steam and PS5 on 30th September. And if that's put you in an Alien mood, why not take a trip to last year, when Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-decade-of-alien-isolation-how-creative-assembly-made-an-all-time-horror-classic">celebrated a decade of Creative Assembly's all-time horror classic Alien: Isolation</a>?

            <p>
I'm not sure if the words cosy and apocalypse are generally ones that go hand in hand together, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doloc-town">Doloc Town</a> is positioning itself as just that. Specifically, it's a quite lovely looking pixel-art <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a> set in a post-apocalypse, and it just launched in early access today. Like in many farming sims before it, there's the usual thing of tending to and growing your crops, cooking them up, fishing, that sort of thing. Where it differs is it's all on a 2D plane, obviously meaning you'll have to think about space quite differently.
</p>

<p>
Having a post-apocalyptic setting means you'll have to go off and explore a bit sometimes too. You might find some treasures, some secret relics, occasionally you'll need to fend off robot enemies. It's all just a little bit futuristic, but without the ability to completely rely on technology. I like the look of it a lot, there's a story too and I'm quite into the idea of a 2D farming sim with platforming elements. Not exactly revolutionary, just a combo that looks well done with some really well lit pixel art here.

<p>
Speaking of story, the current version of the game will apparently have a bit more than 20 hours of main story to get through, on top of side quests, so it sounds quite beefy. RedSaw Games Studio, the devs behind Doloc Town, say that they plan for the early access period to be no more than a year, with a more detailed roadmap coming soon.
</p>
<p>
Like a lot of Steam games, it has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2285550/Doloc_Town/">launch discount on Steam</a> too. Nothing much, just 10%, but if Doloc Town looks like a good time to you, now might be the best time to pick it up.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hangar-13-digs-into-mafia-the-old-country-gameplay-narrative-and-more-at-pax-east.1184778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-digs-into-mafia-the-old-country-gameplay-narrative-and-more-at-pax-east/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mafia: The Old Country developer Hangar 13 dug into plenty of behind-the-scenes details about making The Old Country during a PAX East panel. The team discussed their approach to making The Old Country, a few more details about the game's narrative, and also revealed a few core members of the cast.</p>
<p>The panel was hosted by Greg Miller from Kinda Funny Games, with Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes, game director Alex Cox, and cinematic director Tomas Hrebick representing the development team for <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/the-old-country/faq/">Mafia: The Old Country</a>.</p>
<p>There's a lot we already know about The Old Country, some of which we learned more about during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">gameplay trailer that was revealed ahead of the panel</a>. One aspect fans were happy to hear was that The Old Country would be closer in style to the first two Mafia games in that The Old Country is a more linear experience, and not necessarily an open-world game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - &quot;Family Takes Sacrifice&quot; Developer Presentation | PAX East" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmeirFVVzCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes did however clarify this point, that while the game will have you on a golden path through the story, you're still free to roam the new setting of 1900's Sicily and explore the world that the team has meticulously created in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>In terms of the gameplay, Baynes called it "<em>familiar, but better</em>," while Cox elaborated that there are elements to the gameplay and scenarios that are unique to The Old Country due to the new setting for the series, since each previous Mafia game has been set in an American city. Some of the missions and things you'll do in The Old Country however, are purposeful callbacks to activities veterans of the series will recognize that have been re-tooled to fit The Old Country.</p>
<p>Knife dueling, for example, is one of the new additions to gameplay that we get a short look at in the trailer, that will play a significant role in The Old Country's combat. That's not to say you won't be using a gun every now and then, as the trailer also showed a fair bit of gunplay that Cox and the panel likened more to the first Mafia game, than Mafia III, which was a more bombastic experience.</p>
<p>In terms of the narrative, we were introduced to three cast members who are playing three main roles in the story. Enzo Favara, the lead character in The Old Country and the person you play as in the game, is played by Riccardo Frascari. The Don of the Torrisi family, Bernado Torrisi is played by Johnny Santiago, and Torrisi's daughter, Isabella Torrisi is played by Carina Conti.</p>
<p>Speaking of characters, towards the end of the panel, Cox did confirm that there will be as many as four returning characters from previous Mafia games making an appearance in Mafia: The Old Country, though he did not reveal who it would be and how, to avoid spoiling the surprise for players.</p>
<p>One interesting bit about the studio's work to make Mafia: The Old Country as authentic as possible, relates to the cars we see Enzo drive in the game. They're some of the world's earliest vehicles, and Hangar 13 was able to find a collector in the Czech Republic who let the studio photograph, and even drive these cars and record them, to be as accurate as possible with how these old cars would have sounded.</p>
<p>Overall, it's clear that Hangar 13 put in a lot of work to make Mafia: The Old Country as detailed as possible. The game will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC this coming August 8, 2025.</p>

But a trailer everybody’s watched and a well-crafted trailer are two different things.</p><p>Despite amassing a truly astounding number of views, <em>GTA VI</em>’s second trailer didn’t land for everyone. This is not to say that the game will be bad or that Rockstar somehow dropped the ball, but rather that making a trailer, like any other mode of storytelling, is an art unto itself – one that goes far beyond the simple act of layering music atop footage.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Derek Lieu, a professional game trailer editor whose work you’ve almost certainly encountered – trailers for <em>Half-Life Alyx</em>, <em>Among Us</em>, <em>Psychonauts 2</em>, <em>Riven</em>, <em>Spelunky 2</em>, <em>Firewatch</em>, <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Viewfinder</em>, and <em>Stray Gods</em>, to name a few – believes that <em>GTA VI</em>’s second trailer doesn’t do its subject justice. The game, he told Aftermath, looks incredibly impressive, but after watching the trailer numerous times, he doesn’t find himself knowing or feeling as much as he’d like.</p><p>"[The game] looks amazing. It looks great," Lieu told Aftermath. "A trailer is designed to do this thing well, which is to incite our emotions and show a bunch of stuff from this new thing that we haven't seen before. This trailer, or a bunch of B-roll with music over it, can kind of achieve the same thing. But that doesn't make it a good trailer. Just because people get hyped, doesn't mean it's a good trailer. If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped. They would feel, they would care."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Just because people get hyped, doesn't mean it's a good trailer.</p></blockquote></figure><p>One of the trailer’s biggest issues, according to Lieu, is a general lack of narrative. This might sound odd given how much of it is made up of cutscenes, but consider what we’ve learned by the end: There are two characters who we’re obviously supposed to root for, and we know they’re having a grand old crime-filled time in Vice City, but what are the stakes? Why is any of this happening?&nbsp;</p><p>"The only thing we know about these characters is: They do crime and they're a couple,” said Lieu. “We have no idea what their motivation is. Why are they doing crime? Are they being forced to do crime? What's the reason? By the time the first part with the landlord is over, that's, like, 30 seconds into the trailer – an immense amount of time.”</p><p>Lieu drew a comparison to a more effective variation on the theme from Rockstar’s own oeuvre:&nbsp;</p><p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJIxpjXKd1g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>GTA IV</em>'s third trailer</a>, where it's like ‘Niko, my cousin!’, you know [Niko] is a person who's come to the United States, you know they're an immigrant, you know their contact is in a really shitty apartment, but they have aspirations of more,” said Lieu. “You have all of that in one shot. That [moment] encompasses the whole story of <em>GTA IV</em>. There's probably something like that in <em>GTA VI</em> somewhere. At least let us know what [the characters] want, and that will make us care more and be interested in how they achieve that."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GTA IV Official Trailer #3" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJIxpjXKd1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Lieu described Rockstar’s trailer output over the years as “uneven.” This, he said, is par for the course with trailers that are produced in-house – as opposed to those created by dedicated editors or agencies like <a href="https://www.altarcreative.com/our-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Altar Creative</a>, which has worked with Ubisoft on many occasions. While Lieu doesn’t know for certain if <em>GTA VI</em>’s trailer was produced in-house, he thinks it bears the hallmarks of one that was.&nbsp;</p><p>"Some places, in-house, are amazing,” he said. “<em>Destiny 2</em>, most of them are amazing. Blizzard, <em>Overwatch</em>, their stuff is amazing. Nintendo is kind of uneven, but the good stuff is really good."</p><p>In-house trailers, he said, often lean on viewers’ preexisting knowledge or excitement; they stop short of going the extra mile.</p><p>"The first <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trailers, I think, are also made in-house. They're terrible. The really good ones – they're really tightly edited and the music's done well – are edited by a place called <a href="https://www.hammercreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hammer Creative</a> in Los Angeles. Those [first trailers] are incredibly random because [Square Enix] knows it's <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. Everyone will recognize these scenes. They'll do the work for us. But <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has great music. Put some amazing music under it. Make me remember all this stuff. It's such a wasted opportunity. We could be [up] here, emotion-wise, and instead, whether people realize it or not, they could be so much more excited."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>You can give people room for speculation and reaction videos and stuff and have it be fun to watch.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Granted, <em>GTA VI</em> isn’t set to come out for another year, so perhaps Rockstar doesn’t have the necessary raw materials on hand to assemble a series of scenes that more explicitly lays out the game’s stakes. But Lieu finds that unlikely, given how video game trailers are typically made. He said that some triple-A studios will spend a month just capturing footage, meaning the process of editing together a trailer “can easily be multiple months.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm working on stuff that's for Summer Game Fest time,” he said. “A lot of these games are not super duper early, but there's still a lot of gray box stuff. So I make my draft of the trailer, and then we polish up the things that need to be done for that."</p><p>There’s also the matter of Rockstar’s infamous commitment to littering trailers with as many hints and easter eggs as possible, to inspire the kind of free marketing the aforementioned “details you missed” lists provide. But Lieu doesn’t believe those sorts of smaller flourishes need to come at the expense of a trailer’s storytelling.</p><p>"You can give people room for speculation and reaction videos and stuff and have it be fun to watch,” said Lieu. “If you look at the <em>Tears Of The Kingdom</em> trailers, it's <em>Legend Of Zelda</em>, so everyone's gonna speculate about every single frame. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGShqcAHlQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The full trailer</a> is completely epic. ... There's ups and downs, there's big, pivotal moments. If you look at that trailer in terms of its emotional weight, the graph of that would be [a series of taller and taller spikes, building to a huge crescendo]. <em>GTA VI</em>'s is kinda [flat]."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Official Trailer #3" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHGShqcAHlQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Music is another area where <em>GTA VI</em>’s trailer, in Lieu’s eyes, falters when compared to other major game trailers – or even Rockstar’s previous work. Again, the drama and narrative of the trailer take a backseat, in favor of a song that’s just sort of… there. The song itself, “Hot Together” by The Pointer Sisters, fits the trailer’s vibe, but it’s inelegantly deployed despite Rockstar almost certainly having the resources to give it a proper cinematic treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"So watch the trailer for [movie] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGqiHJTsRkQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Knives Out</em></a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSJN4hN28kg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>It Takes Two</em>'s 'Better Together' trailer</a>. Those both use licensed music, but they trailer-ized the music, which Rockstar has the money to do. Not all licensed music can just be put into a sequence and made into a trailer. If you look at<em> Knives Out</em>, that one, especially, is really customized. If you listen to the music during different parts of that trailer, you could really feel like 'Oh, this is the beginning, this is the middle, and this is the end.' But for [<em>GTA VI</em>], the energy just feels flat."</p><p>As Lieu sees it, all of these issues compound to make the trailer feel disconnected – like a series of unrelated moments rather than a cohesive work. For example, the first chunk of the trailer lingers on a day in the life of Jason Duval, a comically jacked Florida man who makes up one half of the game’s core power couple. But it doesn’t initially read like it’s trying to convey several related events from his perspective.</p><p>"That whole opening minute, I didn't even realize that the first scene where the landlord is saying, 'Go get me my money' connected with a shot of [Jason] slapping the guy and opening the register, which is, like, two shots later,” said Lieu. “It's so quick, too. It doesn't feel like 'This is a day in my life. This happens and this happens.’"</p><figure><blockquote><p>Not all licensed music can just be put into a sequence and made into a trailer.</p></blockquote></figure><p>These are, as far as Lieu sees it, fixable issues. They just require a little more signposting.</p><p>"The part where it's showing the two of them doing crime versus them having beers, there's space in there for really simple contrasts. They could be like 'To new beginnings' cut to [gunfire sounds] 'Hands on the floor!' to ask 'Oh, is this actually a new beginning?' To have that dramatic irony there. There' so many things you could do in there, but it just feels very disconnected. It's kind of forcing us to do the work in a not-interesting way."</p><p>This is not to say that trailers have to hand you everything upfront; some of the best trailers lure you in with a plethora of unanswered questions. They give you the basic premise followed by flashes of scenes that function almost as puzzle pieces. Lieu pointed to A24 movie trailers as an example.</p><p>"A24 movie trailers are really good at this, where you have an idea, and they show a lot of the movie after that. If you watch the trailer for<em> Under The Silver Lake</em>, the premise is that [Andrew Garfield’s character’s] girlfriend disappears, and there's a whole lot of stuff after that setup. All of it seems interesting, but none of it actually helps me understand what happens plot-wise, but it's interesting. It does a good job of [conveying] this context of this problem that needs to be solved and then 'These are things that we go through in order to do that.' But we don’t know how it turns out.

            <p>
If you've been hankering for a lizard-scented blast of nostalgia, you're in luck; Crystal Dynamics' cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels are being bundled up for a PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 16th June.
</p>
<p>
The Gex Trilogy, you might recall, was announced earlier this year, and gathers together the series' original 1995 outing - 2D PS1 platformer Gex - alongside its two 3D sequels, Gex: Enter the Gecko and Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, which launched in 1998 and 1999 respectively.
</p>
<p>
Limited Run Games, which is publishing the collection, isn't quite going as far as describing the bundle as a remaster, but it <em>is</em> promising "extras and numerous improvements". There's talk of native widescreen support, save states, and the ability to rewind the action. That's in addition to artwork and archival material including classic adverts, a music player, and a new interview with the voice of Gex (in the US at least), Dana Gould.

<p>
The Gex Trilogy will initially be available as a digital release when it comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183970/GEX_Trilogy/">Steam</a> on 16th June. However, Limited Run is also planning to give the bundle a physical release later this year, and those wanting to hold Gex's heft in their hands have a couple of options. There's a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-standard-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$39.99 USD Standard Edition</a>, which contains either a disc or a cartridge depending on your platform of choice (the PC version contains a Steam key), plus a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-classic-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$74.99 Classic Edition</a> that also includes a Steelbook, reversible poster, soundtrack selection CD, and a "retro box" resembling a PS1 game.
</p>
<p>
If you really want to go all-out in a fury of nostalgia, however, there's also a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-tail-time-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$199.99 Tail Time Edition</a>, which is available to pre-order from 9th May to 6th July. This includes everything in the Classic Edition (and upgrades the CD to a full soundtrack), then throws in a 7-inch Gex statue, trading cards, a Remote Pin, and a special box featuring artwork from Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano. Oh, and there's a 36-inch inflatable Gex to do with as you please.
</p>

Crystal Dynamics has, of course, long waved goodbye to Gex, having released the likes of its Legacy of Kain series, Marvel's Avengers, and numerous Tomb Raider titles in the years since. Currently, the studio - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">announced layoffs earlier this year</a> - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">assisting Microsoft with its troubled Perfect Dark reboot</a>, and continuing work on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">untitled Tomb Raider game in partnership with Amazon</a>. This latter title was presumably planned to launch alongside Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series, but recent reports have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-reportedly-dead">suggested the Phoebe Waller-Bridge penned show has been scrapped</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is, very obviously, a game where you roleplay as space fascists. Like, the game explicitly treats you as fodder for a war against various supposedly evil species all in the name of colonising other planets. It's not subtle! But it's also silly as hell, so the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> more or less gets away with it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a> just announced a new warbond though, and I'll be honest: the new outfits are probably the most fascist looking yet.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, the helmet of the RE-1861 Parade Commander outfit looks mightily similar to a Pickelhaube, those old German soldier helmets with the solo spike on top you've probably seen in war movies your parents always seem to have on. The RE-2310 Honorary Guard's cap looks like a cap a Nazi general might wear too, not to mention the rest of the outfit. Major fascist vibes! Borderline uncomfortable if I'm being real with you, but I'll trust Arrowhead on this one.

<p>
In terms of weapons, the thing you'll probably find most exciting is the CQC-2 Sabre, which is literally just a straight up sword. Nothing fancier than that! Quite simply a sword you can attempt to slice through some Terminids. There's also a new bayonet marksman rifle, the R-2 Amendment if you prefer your blades with a little bit of gun attached to them. You'll find a new throwable too, the G-142 Pyrotech, which spins rapidly while spitting out fire.
</p>
<p>
My favourite of all the additions though is the new stratagem, the One True Flag, which is literally just a Super Earth flagpole that you can use to stab enemies with. It's ridiculous, presumably useless, and I hope it is the only thing people use from now on.
</p>
<p>
This new warbond drops next week, May 15th, so you've not got long to wait until you get to dress up as a super fascist, if you're into that for some messed up reason.

It’s movement incarnate, and if you’re wise enough to invest in additional attribute points for Dexterity on the Passive Skill Tree, you’ll find the Huntress becomes a highly mobile, hard-hitting, and accurate woman with a grudge and a spear. </p><p>That said, don’t be like me. Initially, I incorrectly assumed that dropping points into Strength would ensure a higher damage output with my melee-based attacks and Spear Throw. While helpful in some odd cases, Dexterity reigns supreme here.

It’s especially useful in clearing groups with the following combo:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Whirling Slash x3</li><li>Disengage</li><li>Lightning Spear</li></ol><p>Whirling Slash is an excellent AOE (area-of-effect)attack that creates a whirlwind with your spear, dealing melee damage and causing knockback. Hit that two or three times, then pop Disengage to create a bit of breathing room, and immediately launch Lightning Spear into your Whirling Slash. It’ll combine with the whirlwind, enhancing your lightning damage significantly and wiping mobs with a satisfying pop!</p><h2 id="h422614"><a id="help"></a>Don’t be afraid to ask for a helping hand in chat</h2><figure id="" data-id="ccab9acab9b8331c113c998d2c2f519a" data-recommend-id="image://ccab9acab9b8331c113c998d2c2f519a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Whirling Slash and Lightning Spear combo in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Whirling Slash and Lightning Spear combo in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ccab9acab9b8331c113c998d2c2f519a" data-recommend-id="image://ccab9acab9b8331c113c998d2c2f519a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Whirling Slash and Lightning Spear combo in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As an active member of the <em>Path of Exile 2</em> community, I’ll be the first to tell you that those who hang around in global chat tend to be some of the sweatiest die-hard fans in the game. They’re looking to discuss the merits of specific builds or prophesize the end of <em>PoE 2</em> due to Grinding Gear Games’ decisions. Despite the loud-mouth players bogging down chat, if you take a moment to type out a quick message, a simple, “Hey, can anyone help me beat this boss?” you’ll find numerous players willing to drop everything to help.</p><p>That said, Huntress proves rather powerful. I managed to push through to endgame primarily solo, only asking for help for four or five of the big bosses, including Ketzuli and Viper Napuatzi, the former because my build didn’t have enough fire resistance. The latter because, well, it’s Viper. Everyone could use help with Viper.</p><p>The point is, don’t hesitate to ask for help, no matter your class!</p><hr><p><br><em>Path of Exile 2</em> “Dawn of the Hunt” is on now, and players are rushing to the endgame, so join the fun on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs!  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A heads up, however: this game takes a while to get going. You'll need time for setup, time to teach it to your fellow player, and time for the gameplay itself. It’s far more time than the box says, so be prepared for a longer haul time of gaming when you sit down with this.</p></div><p id="wayfarers-of-the-south-tigris"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Wayfarers of The South Tigris">Wayfarers of The South Tigris</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218901"><div id="218901" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wayfarers of The South Tigris</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wayfarers is a complex but satisfying combination of dice and worker placement game that surprised me with how fun it was it was. The worker placement is connected to dice rolls, giving a bit of a chance to combine actions with workers and decisions, which, when they click, can be rewarding. The game has a lot of decision space to determine your moves. It can seem intimidating at first glance, especially if you're not versed in heavier Euro games. I was first intimidated by this game, and then pleasantly surprised when I finally sat down to play a three-player game of it. While resources are tight, with multiple decisions being key, it provides a lot of replayability. Don’t pass on this game – you’ll miss out on a lot of fun if you do. </p></div><p id="darwins-journey"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Darwin’s Journey">Darwin’s Journey</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218902"><div id="218902" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Darwin’s Journey</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve always wanted to be a scientific explorer like Darwin, you’ll enjoy playing Darwin’s Journey.

I loved it despite the trials and pains of losing allied witches to an angry mob. I highly recommend finding your own coven and playing it yourself. You can also play this one solo if you’d like.

The player board is shaped like an amp, paired with your favorite head icon. It was one of Gen Con’s fan favorites. User warning, however: this game has several heavy themes and is not advisable for folks who are not prepared to encounter some very sad content that, while it does happen in the rock star life, is not always groovy to come across if you’re unprepared for it.</p></div><p id="age-of-comics-the-golden-years"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Age of Comics: The Golden Years">Age of Comics: The Golden Years</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218907"><div id="218907" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Age of Comics: The Golden Years</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Chances are that if you are here on IGN, you are like me and love <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/comics"><u>comics</u></a>.

Race other players on their own publishing journeys to create ideas and publish comics to sell and reach fandom. While the art is full of pulpy goodness, you don’t have to be a comic book fan to enjoy the game. Heck, you don’t even have to have your own original ideas to produce books in the game, either. They sometimes say that you have to fake it until you can make it. In Age of Comics, you can do both if you want to. This one is playable for up to four players but is best with three. Like Septima and some others on the list, you can play it solo if you desire to pull it off the shelf alone. It’s also one of the easiest games on this list to learn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Maelle’s weapon of choice is a fencing rapier; and you best believe she knows how to use it. Actually, so should you, since nearly all of her additional moves are, basically, fencing strategies disguised as stat changes. With only a couple of late game exceptions, and a couple of stray Fire abilities we’ll get into, <strong>the vast majority of her obtainable skills are about doing either heavy Physical damage, or applying some diabolical shit to enemies in order to do heavy Physical damage</strong>. Even if she’s not the one to do the damage, she’s got the skills to set someone else up for success. </p><p>“Oh ho ho ho,” you might say, “but those are all 1-3 hits and Fire skills. She still has her work cut out dealing with shields.” Au fucking contraire, mon ami, <strong>she’s got a skill called Breaking Rules that’s not even terribly far into her skill tree that literally nullifies shields, no matter how many the enemy’s got slapped on</strong>. You know that one Nevron with the floating orbs, and shooting one puts six shields on everybody else on the field? Light work. The game should literally come up with a prompt that asks “Are you sure you want to make the biggest mistake of your stupid life” if you ever try to remove Maelle from your party? </p><h2 id="h359011"><a id="stance"></a>Special mechanic: Stance</h2><figure id="" data-id="228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-recommend-id="image://228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle prepares to strike her enemies in Virtuose stance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maelle prepares to strike her enemies in Virtuose stance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-recommend-id="image://228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle prepares to strike her enemies in Virtuose stance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But of course, there’s the real reason you’re here, which is to figure out how to effectively use the Stance system. And the key word is “effectively,” because it’s extremely easy to get caught out there in Offense Mode, wondering why Maelle just got merked by a leaf hitting her face in a stiff breeze. </p><div><p>To be fair, the game explains her mechanic way too quick, so let’s go over bascis again.. <strong>Every one of Maelle’s abilities puts her into one of four Stances each with their own perks/drawbacks</strong>:</p></div><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Stanceless</strong>: Where you start in every battle. No effects. </li><li><strong>Defensive Stance</strong>: Take less damage; gain 1 extra AP on every successful dodge or parry.</li><li><strong>Offensive Stance</strong>: Deal 50% more damage, but also take 50% more damage.</li><li><strong>Virtuose Stance</strong>: Deal 200% damage.</li></ul><div><p>Now, while Maelle’s skill set can absolutely slay a field of enemies, you still have to think of her in fencing terms. Overextension can get you stabbed, while being a turtle on constant defense doesn’t get things done. Meanwhile, <strong>the game actually incentivizes you to keep moving by giving you an additional AP every time you change stances</strong>. So, figuring out what to put on her to give you the least vulnerability while still being as effective as she needs to be is the trick of it, but there’s a lot of flexibility therein. </p><p>The dream, of course, is to get in Virtuose Mode, where Maelle is become death, destroyer of worlds. But even then, you only get two turns to do the most damage with that, and your team may have other needs, like with one of her skills that grants Shell, or if, say, they’re all dead, and you need to use Phoenix Flame to rez them all. </p></div><h2 id="h359012"><a id="builds"></a>Recommended builds/synergy</h2><p>For much of the game, the only elemental damage Maelle will have access to is all Fire-based. You get Void damage way down the line. You’ll figure out how that plays out on your own by then. And even then, Fire is going to be enough, especially since <strong>the easiest way to get Maelle into Virtuose Mode most of the time is Burning an enemy and hitting them with Swift Stride</strong>. Yes, that means go get that off your Skill Board ASAP; it’s gonna be a mainstay through much of the first half of the game. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Gustave In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>So, naturally, giving Maelle or her companions Fire abilities to back her up and take advantage of the constant Burn is gonna be an imperative. But, even if you decide otherwise, Maelle’s got plenty of her own. She’ll start with Spark which will get the job done, just know that you’ll have to blow a turn to cast it and it’s already gonna cost you another one to cast Swift Stride. Screw that, let somebody else get that ball rolling, least till you pick up the far more devastating Rain of Fire skill for her later. Both are effective, though worth noting that while <strong>Spark will put Maelle in Defensive Mode, Rain of Fire ends with her in Offensive</strong>. Be prepared for whatever’s coming next. </p><p>Once she’s Virtuosed out, though, you’ll need to capitalize as best you can, and in the early going, the Critical Burn Picto/Lumina (Critical Hit chance goes up 25% on Burning enemies) is a pretty easy place to start. It’d be nice if one of your companions can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">slap a Mark</a></span> or Defenseless on your prey, but the irony there is that if the enemy is Burning already, that first hit will remove the status. <strong>Be mindful of the play order on the left of the battle screen so you can line that up just right and have Maelle go right after an enemy’s been afflicted</strong>. </p><p>Percee and Fleuret Fury are usually a death sentence for enemies after that, and since she’s likely gonna be the last thing a lot of lesser enemies see, Maelle can get a lot of use out of the Dead Energy Picto (3 AP after killing an enemy). But in the event those two skills don’t put a Nevron out of its misery, Fleuret Fury will at least re-up on Virtuose. The main issue here is that Fleuret Fury’s expensive. Keeping Maelle topped off on AP is crucial but, especially for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">a character like Lune</a></span> who’s less useful in a fight where the elements aren’t as effective, it’s worthwhile having someone whose primary job it is to keep Maelle juiced up if her Pictos haven’t gotten to kick in.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>Once she’s tapped out, though, your new job is making sure Maelle can build up to a full bar of AP again. And early on, that’s not as easy as it sounds. A Picto like Energising Pain (1 AP after taking damage) can help, but this is the exact situation Defensive Mode is good for, making sure she can take a hit and likely survive longer than her friends.</p><p>Nail these principles and our little fencer will be an absolute menace against anything that threatens the Expedition.</p><hr><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Her abilities range from mobility to attack, allowing you to disengage enemies quickly and hit hard with magic-infused spears. <br></p><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#disengage&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#disengage">Disengage</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#lightning&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#lightning">Lightning Spear</a></span><br>3. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#barrage&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#barrage">Barrage</a></span></p><hr><h2 id="h363713"><a id="disengage"></a>Disengage</h2><figure id="" data-id="911e21bab93d1248c4d1666d513cfecf" data-recommend-id="image://911e21bab93d1248c4d1666d513cfecf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier one Disengage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The tier one Disengage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="911e21bab93d1248c4d1666d513cfecf" data-recommend-id="image://911e21bab93d1248c4d1666d513cfecf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier one Disengage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>First and foremost, <strong>I recommend opting for Disengage for your tier-one skill</strong>. While Explosive Spear proves powerful and is a valuable skill to invest a gem in, that’s for later. Right now, let’s prioritize a movement ability that does damage and allows you to put some distance between you and your formidable foes.</p><p>Disengage, once activated, allows you to leap backward while rupturing the ground in front of you, sending spikes of dirt and stone toward your enemies. It’s an excellent AOE (area-of-effect) ability that grants invulnerability for a short period, too.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Tier</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: 6 Mana</li><li><strong>Cooldown</strong>: 1.50S</li><li><strong>Attack Damage</strong>: 93%</li><li><strong>Requires</strong>: Level 3, 9 Dexterity, Spear</li></ul><h2 id="h363714"><a id="lightning"></a>Lightning Spear</h2><figure id="" data-id="2a065dc246d3f3380c0094275a4cf552" data-recommend-id="image://2a065dc246d3f3380c0094275a4cf552" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier two Lighting Spear skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The tier two Lighting Spear skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a065dc246d3f3380c0094275a4cf552" data-recommend-id="image://2a065dc246d3f3380c0094275a4cf552" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier two Lighting Spear skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With Disengage tackling mobility, it’s time to invest in a hard-hitting projectile attack ability that, honestly, is currently one of my favorite skills in the game. <strong>Lightning Spear hits like an eighteen-wheeler</strong>, sending out a spear imbued with lightning damage that slams into single and group targets, electrocuting an area around where the ability lands.</p><p>It’s an excellent follow-up attack after popping Disengage. Remove yourself from a fight, tap Lightning Spear, and watch as electrical currents charge through the mob ahead of you. It’s also a useful skill when you want to kickstart a fight!</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Tier</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: 10 Mana</li><li><strong>Attack Speed</strong>: 50% of Base</li><li><strong>Attack Damage</strong>: 127%</li><li><strong>Requires</strong>: Level 6, 16 Dexterity, Spear</li></ul><h2 id="h363715"><a id="barrage"></a>Barrage</h2><figure id="" data-id="b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-recommend-id="image://b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier three Barrage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The tier three Barrage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-recommend-id="image://b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier three Barrage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>For your third major skill, the tier five ability, I’d opt for Barrage</strong>. While Rapid Assault hits fast and hard, and Storm Lance continues the theme of electrical damage-dealing attacks, Barrage allows you to tackle groups relatively easily. Like with Lightning Spear, albeit less situational, you can pop Barrage first to start a fight, dealing damage across a wide area and softening all targets, or use it after Disengage to finish a fight.</p><p>The downside to an area-of-effect (AOE) ability is dealing with a boss fight, which is generally a one-on-one showdown. While still effective if it lands right, an AOE isn’t as powerful against a single target.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Tier</strong>: 5</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: 16 Mana</li><li><strong>Cooldown</strong>: 2.00S</li><li><strong>Cast Time</strong>: 0.70S</li><li><strong>Requires</strong>: Level 14, 34 Dexterity, Spear/Bow</li></ul><hr><p><em>Path of Exile 2</em> Dawn of the Hunt is available now, with a brand-new class, five new Ascendancy classes, unique items and support gems, and additional endgame content to explore!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

the old country--that is, Sicily. Players take on the role of Enzo Favara, a mobster whose life began in forced labor in his childhood. Now, 2K says he's "ready to risk everything to become a man of honor in the Torrisi crime family."</p><p dir="ltr">The game will play like a "classic mob movie," 2K says, and this means players will encounter the criminal underworld and everything that entails.

It’s a non-franchise IP from a less-known studio, but backed by Square Enix and led by some of the biggest legends from <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s classic era. So if that caught your eye over <em>SaGa</em> or <em>Shiren the Wanderer</em>, it’s understandable. But don’t sleep on <em>SaGa</em>, you’re missing out.</p><p>Anyway, <em>Fantasian</em> is a distinct kind of RPG and it may feel like there isn’t much out there like it at first. I’ve made some connections to a list of games, some way less obscure than others, that can be reasonably compared to <em>Fantasian</em> for one reason or another. Check them out, if you haven’t yet! Especially the one with “<em>SaGa</em>” in the title.</p><p><strong>Editor’s note</strong>: Hi! I’ve also added a wonderful turn-based RPG from 2025 that is absolutely worth your attention if you dug <em>Fantasian</em>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4f15f3c95ba7c2d0b5bac00296cae66e" data-recommend-id="image://4f15f3c95ba7c2d0b5bac00296cae66e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Blue Dragon and the titular dragon behind him both give a thumbs up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Blue Dragon and the titular dragon behind him both give a thumbs up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4f15f3c95ba7c2d0b5bac00296cae66e" data-recommend-id="image://4f15f3c95ba7c2d0b5bac00296cae66e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Blue Dragon and the titular dragon behind him both give a thumbs up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> There’s no better place to start than the same studio’s other work. <em>Blue Dragon</em> is an old school-style RPG with a few twists, while <em>Lost Odyssey</em> is more of an ambitious, contemporary <em>Final Fantasy</em>-like experience that effectively leans into visual novels. Mistwalker reuses that technique in Fantasian, but for <em>Odyssey</em> it hired a career novelist for those moments and it <em>shows</em>.  </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b0ea59cefcc1be05d19e615988da7cf9" data-recommend-id="image://b0ea59cefcc1be05d19e615988da7cf9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character wields guns in a combat scenario." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character wields guns in a combat scenario." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Tri-Ace</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0ea59cefcc1be05d19e615988da7cf9" data-recommend-id="image://b0ea59cefcc1be05d19e615988da7cf9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character wields guns in a combat scenario." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Much like <em>Fantasian</em>’s creative combat system that combines puzzle-like solutions and positioning attack trajectory, <em>Resonance of Fate</em> is best known for thinking outside the box when it comes to battles. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzrONfwallY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzrONfwallY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEGA itself once described it</a></span> as a mix between “<em>Valkyria Chronicles</em> and a John Woo movie,” so you know Tri-Ace was cooking at the time.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d33fc8c92e6169436117836cf146bb31" data-recommend-id="image://d33fc8c92e6169436117836cf146bb31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two characters stand in a post office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two characters stand in a post office." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Slow Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d33fc8c92e6169436117836cf146bb31" data-recommend-id="image://d33fc8c92e6169436117836cf146bb31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two characters stand in a post office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We’re tackling the comparison from a different angle here. <em>Harold Halibut</em> is a strange (and sweet) indie adventure game that couldn’t have less in common with <em>Fantasian</em>. But there’s one exception: The visuals are strikingly similar in that <em>Halibut</em>’s world is entirely hand-made, every asset a high-resolution scan of a painstakingly-crafted physical object. It’s a great pairing with <em>Fantasian</em>’s hand-made diorama backgrounds. More like this please, video games!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="72bb6f0bfd8697791b40e8c735d065c6" data-recommend-id="image://72bb6f0bfd8697791b40e8c735d065c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pixel art landscape shows the silhouette of a cast of heroes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pixel art landscape shows the silhouette of a cast of heroes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="72bb6f0bfd8697791b40e8c735d065c6" data-recommend-id="image://72bb6f0bfd8697791b40e8c735d065c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pixel art landscape shows the silhouette of a cast of heroes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Obligatory. We’re talking about Hironobu “Father of <em>Final Fantasy</em>” Sakaguchi here. But the first <em>Final Fantasy</em> specifically shares some ideas with <em>Fantasian</em>’s fantasy/sci-fi genre blend. It gets weirdly washed out in the remakes, but later parts of the original NES version gradually remove the bright, organic colors in exchange for darker, dirtier tiles meant to convey metal, rust, and an unspoken explanation for why you start fighting robots. It’s fine if you just take my word for it and stick with the <em>Pixel Remaster</em> instead, though.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-recommend-id="image://d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cast of characters stand in a royal hall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cast of characters stand in a royal hall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-recommend-id="image://d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cast of characters stand in a royal hall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sometimes you don’t have to leave Square Enix territory if you like <em>Final Fantasy</em> but want something new and different. <em>SaGa</em> is a series often flying way under the radar, but those who know it swear by its unusual style, unique systems, and disinterest in player comfort. The recent <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em> remake dials back on the friction, but makes up for that sicko-enticing aspect with dense, rewarding systems and super slick combat.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bbb100c822441e1ea2d11e959e16c785" data-recommend-id="image://bbb100c822441e1ea2d11e959e16c785" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player fights monsters in a dark castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player fights monsters in a dark castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->59 Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bbb100c822441e1ea2d11e959e16c785" data-recommend-id="image://bbb100c822441e1ea2d11e959e16c785" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player fights monsters in a dark castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This might seem out of place if you haven’t finished <em>Fantasian</em> yet, but there are multiple dungeons in the back half that have you navigating dark, unmapped corridors in first-person. Wanna guess where that came from? DRPGs are a whole world unto themselves, and perhaps there’s no better place to start than Digital Eclipse’s remake of the O.G., <em>Wizardry</em>. Prepare for cruelty, but a real sense of accomplishment if you stick with it.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="147ea2d93c1adf1f55f23a8841eb2bb2" data-recommend-id="image://147ea2d93c1adf1f55f23a8841eb2bb2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters stand around in a fantasy town." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters stand around in a fantasy town." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="147ea2d93c1adf1f55f23a8841eb2bb2" data-recommend-id="image://147ea2d93c1adf1f55f23a8841eb2bb2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters stand around in a fantasy town." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you haven’t played <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and you like turn-based RPGs, you owe it to yourself to play <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. It is simply one of the best to ever do it, period. This is what happens when you put Sakaguchi together with <em>Dragon Quest</em> veterans Yuji Horii and Akira Toriyama (RIP), let them build a huge team, and go wild. They even got to use the beefier Super Famicom carts! You don’t let just anyone use the 32-megabit ROMs, you know.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3ded8b76e79f5005c5b9125d84d70ec9" data-recommend-id="image://3ded8b76e79f5005c5b9125d84d70ec9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1057" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters stand around in a desert wasteland." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters stand around in a desert wasteland." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Bearded Ladies</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3ded8b76e79f5005c5b9125d84d70ec9" data-recommend-id="image://3ded8b76e79f5005c5b9125d84d70ec9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1057" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters stand around in a desert wasteland." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This hidden gem from the folks behind <em>Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden</em> is an interesting one. It’s a sci-fi, post-apocalyptic tactical RPG set in the remains of Kentucky, which is already unusual. It also shares the idea of a technological threat to humanity with <em>Fantasian</em>, but does so by reminding the player what kind of person likely makes the key decisions just before the robots start wiping out humanity. <em>Miasma Chronicles</em> is rough around the edges in a few ways, but its unfamiliar (for video games) setting and real-world allegories mix quite well.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9ada4bca01769e7cd065d92ff0756ebd" data-recommend-id="image://9ada4bca01769e7cd065d92ff0756ebd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The heroes do battle against foes in a rocky, cliffside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The heroes do battle against foes in a rocky, cliffside." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ada4bca01769e7cd065d92ff0756ebd" data-recommend-id="image://9ada4bca01769e7cd065d92ff0756ebd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The heroes do battle against foes in a rocky, cliffside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Oh hi, Claire (with an e at the end) here to tell you about <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> if you haven’t heard enough of it already.
