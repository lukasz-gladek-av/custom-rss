		<p>Neon Abyss 2 is filled with cyberpunk vibes, absurd over-the-top weapons, and some of the most modern and disquieting takes on gods going. It’s a vibrant nightmare of a roguelike with plenty of style and flair, but it also feels incredibly reminiscent of the first game. That’s obviously not a bad thing – why fix what isn’t broken? – and fans of the first game will already have this on their wish lists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neon Abyss 2 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A86PCFApasQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’re once again thrown into the bright dystopia that has you fighting for your life after you drop out of a bar into the underworld. The general formula is much the same as it was before. That means you’ll be running around shooting things, trying to survive in different areas and gathering different currencies to then spend in shops and on upgrades. This doesn’t feel meaningfully different than the first game, but, to be fair, the first game felt very solid in this respect, so that’s fine.</p>


<p>Where the game does differ is in some of its general progression. The new Faith system basically lets you unlock special rooms as you’re playing that can have a variety of effects. Sometimes that means you’ll be able to gamble a lot of money to get fancy new items, sometimes it’ll be crafting, and sometimes it’ll just be an artifact of some kind. It makes it worth trying to play a little bit differently as you go, but you can often just sort of power through if you want as well.</p>


<p>The weapons feel better and more worthwhile now as well. Weapons have levels, with new ones often being higher level. However, if you decide to stick to the weapon you’ve fallen in love with, such as the gun that turns your eggs into a big old dragon to attack enemies with, then you can choose to stay faithful to it. If you do that, you can gain experience for the weapon to actually level it up, and when you do so you’ll get a reward. It’s a fun extra wrinkle in trying to decide what weapon to use.</p>
<p>There are some excellent choices now as well. Even the standard weapon fires a laser shot every so often, but you can get gloves that send out mighty long-range punches, weapons that convert your grenades into rockets, and a wide range of melee weapons that can slash through space. &nbsp;It’s pretty hard to argue with a katana that can cut through space and time, you know?</p>

<p>All-in-all, Neon Abyss 2 already feels very slick. A lot of the value of these kinds of roguelikes is hidden behind layers of secrets and unlocks though, so while I enjoyed my time with the preview build, I want to get my hands on the full version before settling into my thoughts on the game. For those who loved the first game and just want more though, you’ll be getting plenty of that with this follow-up, and you’re sure to enjoy some of the new systems and weapons as well. At least you don’t have too long to wait on that front.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/japanese-gaming-companies-shares-tank-due-to-us-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The burden of the US tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump is taking a heavy toll on the shares of Japanese gaming companies today. Sony was hit the hardest, losing just over 10% of its market value in a single session. Nintendo isn't far off, losing 7.85% today.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Big N is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a>. Pre-orders were supposed to go live on Wednesday, April 9; however, they have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> in the United States precisely because of the aforementioned tariffs, and now users fear the console and its accessories might get even pricier. Needless to say, investors aren't keen on the impact this might have on the console's success, either.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo, known for Dynasty Warriors, Ninja Gaiden, and Atelier among others, is losing 7.63%. Bandai Namco, publisher of franchises like Ace Combat, Dark Souls, Dragon Ball, and Tekken just to name a few, is losing 7.37%. SEGA Sammy, the legendary publisher of franchises like Shenmue, Virtua Fighter, Like a Dragon, Sonic, and Total War, is close by with -7.29%. CAPCOM, another revered Japanese gaming company (Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, Street Fighter, etc.), loses 6.61%. Square Enix (Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Star Ocean) loses 5.62%. Lastly, KONAMI is currently down 'only' 5.19%. The latter company has relied less on videogaming for some time, although that is changing rapidly with the revival of beloved franchises such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metal Gear Solid</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the tariffs will probably hit Western game companies just as hard as they are doing with Japanese ones. However, due to the timezone, this is the first glimpse we have at how the industry (which is already ailing due to increased budgets and stifled growth) is reacting to the application of the US tariffs. It's not looking good, that's for sure.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ashton-hall-gaming-latest-video-bag/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ashton-hall-bags-on-gaming-in-his-newest-%E2%80%98motivational%E2%80%99-video.1156887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ashton-hall-gaming-latest-video-bag/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ashton Hall, the viral personality behind the sensational ‘morning routine’ videos, has uploaded a new clip comparing his life in 2018 to 2025. It can be interpreted as a veiled bag on gaming – in the 2018 segment, he’s playing games multiple times a day and raging at cutscenes on Grand Theft Auto 5, for some reason.</p>



<p>However, when he hangs up the controller (which was never even switched on), he becomes a new man, waking up at 3 AM and plunging his face into ice bowls before making thousands of dollars in the blink of an eye.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-plot-holes">Plot Holes</h2>



<p>Ashton Hall has become a phenomenally successful creator following the viral trend around his morning routine videos. In the clips he has uploaded across social media, Hall has shown what his daily routine looks like, revealing a morning schedule that unfolds over several hours, prompting parodies worldwide.</p>



<div><article><p><span>2018 vs. 2025. First 4 hours will change everything ⏰</span></p></article></div>







<p>In his latest video uploaded to Twitter, Hall shows himself ‘in 2018’, playing video games in a dinky apartment, relying on snack foods and carbonated beverages for sustenance, and doom-scrolling on social media.</p>



<p>He becomes enraged at a cutscene on Grand Theft Auto 5 on PS4, throwing a controller that was never even powered on at the television, shattering it on impact. Later, he’s seen playing the same game on the same television set, so I’m not sure what to believe at this point.</p>



<p>His classic skewed timelines are also front and centre – it takes him 12 minutes to power on the controller after picking it up from a nightstand.</p>



<p>But it’s okay because after ditching the video games, Hall became a much better man with a regimented morning schedule that involves rubbing bananas on his face and spending four minutes suspended in mid-air over a swimming pool, so there’s that.</p>



<p>Generational run, indeed.</p>

            <p>Bungie will finally reveal details of its next game, Marathon, later this week.</p>
<p>The Destiny maker released a teaser video for a Marathon Gameplay Reveal, which will take place on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/MARATHONTHEGAME">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarathonTheGame">YouTube</a> on 12th April at 6pm UK time (10am PDT).</p>
<p>The teaser itself shows a character running through a bright jungle chased by some sort of robot or mech, though we don't see a full shot of either. We do, however, see an adorable pink cat curl up next to the (presumably dying) figure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">Bungie first announced it was reviving Marathon back in May 2023</a>, but very little has been heard about it since.</p>
<p>The original Marathon first-person shooter was released in 1994 and received two sequels. Now, Bungie is reviving the series as a "sci-fi PvP extraction shooter" featuring "evolving, persistent zones" that's set in the same universe as the original games.</p>
<p>Marathon will be the first new project from Bungie since Halo and Destiny, set on the mysterious planet of Tau Ceti IV where players will take on the role of cybernetic mercenaries Runners.</p>
<p>It's aiming for release across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungies-original-sci-fi-shooter-marathon-hits-steam-for-free">Marathon game was released on Steam for free</a>.</p>
<p>Then in October last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-says-marathon-on-track-but-a-little-early-to-show-in-first-developer-update">Marathon game director Joe Ziegler gave an update to explain the gameplay loop</a> but stated it was too early to show gameplay and more would be shown next year.</p>
<p>Now it's next year and, true to its word, Bungie is finally set to show off the game in action.</p>
<p>News of the game has been tainted by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">dismissal of former project lead Chris Barrett</a> following alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A number of Switch 2 listings have popped up on the likes of eBay, as retailers run out of stock following pre-orders going live.</p>
<p>Last week, Nintendo gave us all a much closer look at its upcoming Switch successor. Along with an overview of games and such, it also gave us a release date and retail price - Switch 2 will be released on Thursday 5th June, with a retail price of £395.99 for the console, or £429.99 should you opt for the Switch 2 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle.</p>
<p>However, once pre-orders went live, stock soon ran out, with places such as Argos already out of stock. "Sorry, this item is just too popular! But we may get more stock, so do check back at a later date," reads a <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7550333?clickPR=plp:1:9">notice on Argos' website</a>.</p>

<p>And, as to be expected, given this high demand, listings for the Switch 2 are now popping up on eBay, above that recommended retail price. At the time of writing, there are multiple Switch 2 listings via the online auction site in excess of £600.</p>
<p>On the completed sales side of things, one Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle was sold for £634.02, which is £204.03 more than the recommended retail price. A Switch 2 console without Mario Kart World included, meanwhile, has sold for £554.45.</p>
<p>While retailers such as Argos and Smyths have opened pre-orders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">Nintendo itself is enforcing strict criteria on pre-orders</a> from its own store in a bid to reduce scalping by implementing an invite-only system. Emails have started going out for those fortunate to be selected.</p>

			<p>With a brief teaser trailer, Bungie has <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1909021981275533601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the Marathon gameplay reveal showcase will take place on Saturday, April 12, at 10 AM Pacific Time.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in May 2023, the game revives the developer's sci-fi franchise, which was originally created in the 1990s. However, this time around, the genre is the trending extraction shooter. The development had a bit of a bumpy road, between the studio's layoffs and the scandal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involved the former Marathon game director</a>.</p>
<p>We don't know much about the game, though the developers did share a few details. The new director recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that users will be provided with many different tools to find in the game, such as weapons and equipment that changes their character's stats or modify some of their capabilities, such as healing consumables.</p>
<p>Players will pick a Runner character before entering the game. Each Runner has a few abilities that the player can further customize. While within the game, users will be assigned several objectives, each coming with its own risks and rewards. Furthermore, if the player cannot extract successfully, they'll lose all the loot they had gathered during the session.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Save the Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUv1-qR1Aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Earlier, the former Game Director had <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wants-players-actions-to-affect-everyone-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that player actions would influence the persistent world in Marathon.</p>
<p><em>We’re creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold, stories that are integrated with the overarching game narrative. We’re building a world full of persistent, evolving zones, where players create their own journey with every run they take. That might mean an unforgettable firefight against another crew vying for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while beset on all sides.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond just the “story of your last run”, however, we want to give players the chance to affect these persistent zones and the larger world as a result. For example, imagine a crew discovering a previously undiscovered artifact that, when activated, opens a new area of the map for all players to explore. In essence, at Bungie, we’re creating a game where the actions of players can have ramifications for the world and players with each unfolding season.</em></p>
<p>Marathon will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, with cross-play enabled between all platforms to unify the community.</p>

Like many fresh ideas, the concept of a deck-building game is startling in its simplicity. Card games where you build a custom deck before you play have been around a while. In a deck-building game, though, you build the deck <em>while </em>you play. Starting with a hand of currency cards, you cash them in for other, more interesting cards, and make a deck on-the-fly you think is good enough to win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't just gamers who got bowled over by the brilliance of the concept: It was designers, too. Gaming was soon awash in copycat games, many of limited interest. Since then, the mechanic has seen redeployment into other genres of game with mixed results, but there are loads of awesome examples. These are the best deck-building board games out there right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR: The Best Deck-Building Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#slaythespire">Slay the Spire</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#heat">Heat: Pedal to the Metal</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#arnak">Lost Ruins of Arnak</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#star-wars">Star Wars: The Deck-Building Game</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#dune">Dune: Imperium</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#el-dorado">The Quest for El Dorado</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#cubitos">Cubitos</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#quedlinburg">The Quacks of Quedlinburg</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#underdark">Tyrants of the Underdark</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#legendary">Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#dominion">Dominion</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#aeons-end">Aeon's End</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#clank">Clank!

So it's entirely appropriate that there's now a board game version of that game to close the circle. Rules-wise it's very close to its source material as you choose an adventurer and refine their combat deck through a series of tough encounters and merchant visits, climbing the titular spire to fight a terrifying boss. However the parent game is solo only, and a lot of the fun in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slay-the-spire-the-board-game-review">Slay the Spire: The Board Game</a> comes from the fact that you get to venture into the unknown and battle the gribblies with friends along for the ride.</p></div><p id="heat-pedal-to-the-metal"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Heat: Pedal to the Metal">Heat: Pedal to the Metal</h2></p><div catalogid="b34c3d5f-862d-4b67-ae09-2df14512bd66" id="195818"><div id="195818" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Heat: Pedal to the Metal</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Heat: Pedal to the Metal, your deck represents the engine of your car, with most cards showing a number of spaces to move. On your turn you can switch gears and then must play the corresponding gear number of cards from your hand, trying to avoid taking corners too fast and spinning off, in a nail-biting race to the finish on your choice of included tracks. Deck building in the basic game is limited to managing heat cards that you take in exchange for extra actions but which clog up your deck, however there's an advanced variant that lets you tinker with your engine deck in all sorts of other satisfying ways for a deeper strategic experience.</p></div><p id="lost-ruins-of-arnak"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lost Ruins of Arnak" id="arnak">Lost Ruins of Arnak</h2></p><div catalogid="12b47414-1a47-426c-9d08-c534eb78cc53" id="180361"><div id="180361" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lost Ruins of Arnak</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph" id="star-wars">Given the ongoing popularity of the Indiana Jones series, it's perhaps surprising that more board games haven't riffed on the adventurous archeaologist, but at least this one that does is an absolute cracker. Players race to gather equipment and companions to make expeditions deeper and deeper into the jungle, braving strange guardians and plundering ruins before feeding their gains back into the next expedition in a cool interplay of daring and forward-planning that's surprisingly strategic once you peel back its interlocking mechanics. One of those is your trusty deck of cards that you'll get to add to by spending your loot, before playing as you plan and execute your expeditions.</p></div><p id="star-wars-the-deckbuilding-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game" id="star-wars">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</h2></p><div catalogid="def0fa37-840a-4faa-9a9a-34e7e08852fd" id="177415"><div id="177415" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At first sight, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-deckbuilding-game-review">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</a> looks like a typical example of the genre where you start with a few cards that give you resources, which you spend to buy more cards to beef up your deck. In this instance, you’re looking for offensive cards that damage your opponent’s base as a route to victory. But there are some really fun tweaks to the formula beyond the appealing theme. For starters, you can attack cards before your opponent buys them, denying them good options and earning you a reward. There’s also a very deep well of card variety, with tons of interesting combos between their effects you can explore. Finally, destroying one base isn’t enough: you need three, and you get to pick which ones you use, with their special effects adding another layer to the game’s strategy.</p></div><p id="dune-imperium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dune Imperium" id="dune">Dune Imperium</h2></p><div catalogid="78ef26ef-33d1-4276-b2fd-590cf3dddef9" id="155275"><div id="155275" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dune Imperium</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review">Dune: Imperium</a> your deck represents resources that your noble house can draw on as you seek power and influence in the universe of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi epic. It’s married to another classic mechanic, worker placement, as each card play sends one of your agents to a board space, either courting influence with a faction like The Guild or The Fremen, or to the planet’s surface, to harvest spice or do battle for territory. It’s a clever melange of thematic and abstract concepts that mesh to create a fascinating whole with many parts to master. There’s also a whole new concept for deckbuilding called reveal turns where you discard your remaining cards to get a secondary effect, meaning you’re building and playing your deck on two different levels at once.</p></div><p id="the-quest-for-el-dorado"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Quest for El Dorado" id="el-dorado">The Quest for El Dorado</h2></p><div catalogid="a4337eee-9d52-427c-b50e-2db0194e4867" id="198605"><div id="198605" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Quest for El Dorado</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is what you get when Reiner Knizia, possibly the most prolific and talented game designer of all time, turns his considerable skills onto deck-building. The result is a seamless blend of deck management and race game as players compete to be the first to make it across the map, matching cards from their deck to terrain hexes on the board in order to move. But of course that’s only half the story: there are hidden surprises in many spaces to upend your strategy and powerful one-shot cards in the market that can make or break your game if timed correctly. Easy to learn, fun to play, but full of interaction and challenge: all the hallmarks of yet another Knizia classic that’s worth its weight in gold.</p></div><p id="cubitos"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cubitos" id="cubitos">Cubitos</h2></p><div catalogid="52477445-7671-4979-b7a1-7265ba9a1593" id="198606"><div id="198606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cubitos</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Dominion spawned the whole deck-building subgenre, various games have switched from a deck to a bag of cubes, but Cubitos<em> </em>takes things one step further and allows you to build a collection of actual dice. Your aim is to propel a running racer across the finish line first, but it’s the dice that do the propulsion when you roll the appropriate symbols to move. Other symbols let you buy more dice, thin your collection, even attack and defend with other players. But best of all are the blank faces, which do nothing except let you re-roll them unless you roll all blanks, in which case it’s turn over. With the thrill of rolling huge buckets of dice, the strategy of combining dice types to suit the action, and the addictive terror of push your luck, you’ll be winning with Cubitos even when you lose.</p></div><p id="the-quacks-of-quedlinburg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Quacks of Quedlinburg" id="quedlinburg">The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h2></p><div catalogid="17284768-0988-43e6-bfce-b1a1d8b45546" id="157129"><div id="157129" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each turn of this game (which you may also find re-branded as just plain Quacks), you’ll get the opportunity to add new ingredients to your secret bag, from which you’ll then draw counters to mix in your cauldron in a quest to create the most powerful potion. But watch out: Draw too many bomb counters and your mixture for the round will explode, ending your turn early. This simple premise is set into flight by the fact that you can change the effects of the other counters each game, choosing from a palette of different abilities that dovetail in new and interesting ways, adding more power to your potion and your purchasing ability as you race with your opponents to make the best brew. Add in a slew of other strategic levers to manage, and you’ve got the makings of a modern classic. And once you've mastered the contents of the base game there are all sorts of expansions to mix in, as we explain in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide">Quacks of Quedlinburg buyer's guide</a>.</p></div><p id="tyrants-of-the-underdark"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tyrants of the Underdark" id="underdark">Tyrants of the Underdark</h2></p><div catalogid="54095bdc-7b22-49e7-9e3b-df59a14ac86c" id="155296"><div id="155296" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tyrants of the Underdark</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tyrants-of-the-underdark-board-game-review">Tyrants of the Underdark</a> is another game where your deck corresponds to assets belonging to a noble house, only this time they’re minions in the employ of Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ fiendish dark elves. Card play spreads your troops, assassins and influence from your starting city over a network of Underdark locations from the well-known fantasy novel trilogy <a href="https://zdcs.link/MgPPg?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Legend of Drizzt</a>. There’s a real sense of struggle as you tussle for territory with other players, card and counter-card adding and removing pieces from the board. Many of the cards represent iconic characters and monsters from the role-playing game with art to match. And there are multiple card sets to combine for new and interesting strategic and tactical options with every play. </p></div><p id="legendary-a-marvel-deck-building-ga"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Ga" id="legendary">Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</h2></p><div catalogid="ba64de19-1607-413b-9d01-11cb5d637c32" id="164693"><div id="164693" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary does a couple of interesting things with the deck-building formula. For starters, it’s cooperative, with all the players working together to defeat a supervillain, although if you defeat them you can tally points and declare a top, legendary, player. Second, the villain has a deck too, which functions as a game engine and a scenario which dictates the win and loss conditions. You’re not, as you might expect, playing as individual Marvel heroes but rather controlling them as a group with your card plays, recruiting new cards and attacking the villain’s henchmen. It’s a riot of replayability with so many different combinations out of the box, plus it’s fast and smooth with lots of options to fine-tune the challenge level to your group’s needs. There’s a whole series of Legendary games built on the same mechanical engine, including the excellent <a href="https://zdcs.link/kv00W?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game</a>.</p></div><p id="dominion-2nd-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dominion: 2nd Edition" id="dominion">Dominion: 2nd Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="912e22f5-6a33-452d-bf80-12fd40392a7a" id="198818"><div id="198818" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dominion: 2nd Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Or you could start with the deck building game that started it all. Dominion wasn't only novel: It was also simple, with quick, three-step turns. All the complexity is on the cards themselves. The goal is to use the starting copper cards to buy better cards, allowing for more money and actions, working up to buying victory point cards. Strategy comes down to honing your deck into the leanest card-buying machine you can manage. With 25 card options, of which 10 got chosen for use in each game, it also has impressive replay value. Yet it's popular enough to have spawned a slew of expansions, of which <a href="https://zdcs.link/vwMMb?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dominion: Intrigue</a> is often considered the best, but we have a full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dominion-buying-guide-expansions">Dominion buyer's guide</a> if you want to shop around.</p></div><p id="aeons-end"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Aeon's End" id="aeons-end">Aeon's End</h2></p><div catalogid="c4e046c8-ff49-43e8-bfd5-9b9ba7fd94d9" id="201955"><div id="201955" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Aeon's End</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aeon's End takes deck-building into the popular category of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative games</a>. It's a smart move: deck-based games are often low on interaction, and having players work together is a solid solution. Here, you're all wizards working together to save a fantasy city from a marauding evil. And there are plenty of cards to heal and buff your fellow players, so there's plenty to think about. Its particular genius, though, is that you flip your discard pile over rather than shuffling when it's empty. This makes the order of card play critical, allowing you to set up combos for the next time you run through your deck. With other timing-based innovations and a tense random turn order, it's thrilling and challenging in equal measure. You can now choose from a variety of sets as we run down in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aeons-end-board-game-buying-guide">Aeon's End buyer's guide</a>, from facing off against demons in the original box to taking on the undead in a longer, more complex campaign with the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/VxPPY?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legacy of Gravehold</a>.</p></div><p id="clank-catacombs"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Clank!

Catacombs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Numbers are at the heart of what makes deck-building work, and they're at the heart of what makes the Clank! series special. Players are adventurers seeking to loot a dungeon and escape before a dragon wakes up. The engine of each hero is their deck, which lets them move and fight, open doors and spend gold. These are just abstract numbers that you use to overcome challenges: The real game is the frantic race in and out of the dungeon. That's where all the themes and thrills are. By separating the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> from the theme, Clank! manages to satisfy fans of both camps with a winning combination. Clank! Catacombs is the latest and greatest iteration of this series, adding more deck control, more variety and a dungeon built of randomly-drawn tiles to re-create the thrill of exploring the unknown. </p></div><p id="undaunted-normandy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Normandy" id="undaunted">Undaunted: Normandy</h2></p><div catalogid="f73d6c06-70d4-4669-8a3a-3e6e0df5d169" id="158884"><div id="158884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Normandy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck-building has proved a surprising proxy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">warfare</a> in several games. Undaunted is the best of them, using the flow of cards from your deck as a way to simulate casualties and command confusion on the battlefield. It's a great fit, giving players a real sense of running an infantry platoon from simple rules. Atop the deck-building strategy, there's the extra dimension of moving pieces on the map. This isn't so realistic, but it's still a ton of fun as you tussle over tiles using tactics and dice. A selection of scenarios and troop types ensures there's plenty of replay puzzling as you work the game's layers to gain the upper hand. There are multiple editions of the game to choose from. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ly1rZ?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Undaunted: Normandy</a> focuses on squad-level combat in France while <a href="https://zdcs.link/pPb1R?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Undaunted: North Africa</a> moves the action to single-soldier special forces and adds rules for vehicles, and for those who'd prefer to avoid the military theme <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review">Undaunted 2200: Callisto</a> is set in a far-future mining colony.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Deck-Building vs Deckbuilding</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck-building is a confusing term because it applies to both a genre and a gaming activity, and it means slightly different things in each case. The term originates in collectible card games, the best known of which is Magic: The Gathering. In this realm, deck-building means the process of deciding what cards from your collection you’re going to use in a deck with which to play the game. In the very earliest days of collectible games, before access to the internet was widespread, this was a key part of the strategic appeal of these titles as you had to decide which cards would work well together. Nowadays, it’s increasingly common for players to get deck-building suggestions from the internet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2008 there was a minor revolution in game design with Dominion, which invented deck-building as a genre. It took inspiration from deck-building as an activity but instead of building a deck before you play from a collection, in these games you build your deck while you play, from a market of cards. In many such games, like Dominion itself or Star Wars The Deckbuilding Game, your starting cards include currencies with which to buy new cards. It’s increasingly common to link deck-building to other game mechanics, as Dune: Imperium does, in which case the resource to buy cards may come from one of those other game elements. Either way you’ll get more and more powerful cards as the game progresses and, often, there will be ways to get rid of your weaker starting cards, too, linking the strategy and tactics of deck construction in new and interesting ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a fan of deck-building in both senses, you might also want to check out <a href="https://zdcs.link/8BVZ8?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Millennium Blades</a>, which uses the deck-building genre to simulate the process of building a collectible card game collection and using it to build decks. It works surprisingly well, is full of fun pop culture references, and features literal wads of paper money to spend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like these, be sure to check out of picks for the overall <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals">best board game deals</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-multiplayer-how-does-it-work/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1 is taking the world by storm, topping the charts on Steam and pulling in hundreds of thousands of players. It’s a shock hit that has come out of nowhere, and it’s dominating the gaming world despite having a bizarre theme. In this guide, we’re looking at whether Schedule 1 is multiplayer, and <strong>if it is</strong>, we’ll break down how to play with friends.</p>



<p>If you’ve been trying to play Schedule 1 co-op, read on to find out how it all works.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-co-op-in-schedule-1">How to Play Co-Op in Schedule 1</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to play Schedule 1 with your friends, you’re in luck – you can do so in both the free demo and the paid version of the game</strong>. To invite friends to your game, you’ll need to open the ‘Lobby’ menu that can be found in the top-right corner of the game scene. From there, you’ll utilise Steam’s friend mechanics to invite someone to your game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-schedule-1-multiplayer-work">How Does Schedule 1 Multiplayer Work?</h2>



<p>In Schedule 1 multiplayer modes, the host has all the power.</p>



<p>They’re responsible for saving the game, and any progress you make in someone else’s co-op lobby won’t impact your single-player adventure. That means if you buy Schedule 1 and boot it up and jump straight into your friend’s game, you’ll end up unlocking <strong>nothing in your single-player game</strong>.</p>



<p>You won’t even have a save file.</p>



<p>If you’ve already kickstarted a solo venture, you won’t be able to invite any friends to revel in your drug manufacturing madness.</p>



<p>It gets a little trickier when it comes to finances, too. Every dollar you earn and bank with your friends in Schedule 1 multiplayer is added to a collective pot – but the cash in your pocket is <strong>yours alone</strong>. Also, items can’t be shared between players unless they’re placed in storage.</p>



<p>Put simply, you need to put something down before another player can pick it up.</p>



<p>Oh, and you can only have a maximum of four players in both the demo and the paid version of Schedule 1.</p>



<p>That’s effectively everything you need to know about Schedule 1 multiplayer – have fun making drugs together!</p>

            <p>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has snuffed out reports that a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> movie is the "next" video game to get a silver screen adaptation.</p>
<p>Sweeney was responding to a tweet from movie industry insider Daniel "DanielRPK" Richtman, who'd suggested in a since-deleted post that whilst some studios had already "passed" on a Fortnite movie, the recent success of game-to-film adaptations like A Minecraft Movie and Super Mario Bros. Movie meant a Fortnite movie was likely to be "next".</p>

<p>"You just know Fortnite is next," Richtman wrote in the deleted tweet. "There was already talk of a Fortnite movie, but some studios passed on it. That’s obviously gonna change now."</p>
<p>Sweeney shot down the speculation with a succinct "False".</p> <div>

<p>Despite trying to clarify which specific part of the statement was incorrect, at the time of writing, Sweeney has yet to respond to Richtman's follow-up tweet (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/epic-games-ceo-fortnite-movie-response-video-game-adaptations/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>Sweeney wouldn't be blamed for considering it, though; earlier today, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie has generated $301m worldwide</a> - that's £233m - on its opening weekend. That's the biggest US domestic debut of any video game movie adaptation ever, with an opening weekend of $157m (£121.5m).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adding-the-walking-dead-assets-including-negans-baseball-bat-so-you-can-make-your-own-skull-cracking-mini-games">Fortnite recently returned to the world of The Walking Dead</a> by offering up a cache of assets for players and developers to go build themed mini-games with.</p>
<p>Whilst characters from The Walking Dead TV show such as Rick, Michonne and Daryl have previously popped up in Fortnite as player skins, this latest crossover with Robert Kirkman's zombie franchise will add antihero Negan, as well as his infamous baseball bat, Lucille. A selection of comic book-inspired walkers (zombies) will also be included.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Lightbringer Expansion - slated to release sometime in Q3/autumn this year - introduces three new Killers and four new Survivors, as well as new perks and "horrifying abilities".</p>

<p>The Gatekeeper expansion is also now available. This one includes five new Survivors with unique perks and five new Killers with 10 "hauntingly-detailed miniature figurines" to customise your experience.</p>
<p>As for the video game itself? Most recently, developer Behaviour Interactive confirmed Pinhead - and his Hellraiser Chapter DLC - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylights-hellraiser-dlc-is-getting-yanked-from-sale-soon">would be yanked from sale on 4th April</a>.</p>
<p>As explained in Behaviour's announcement earlier this month, he's only retreating from digital storefronts - existing owners can continue playing with him after 4th April, but no new purchases of the Hellraiser Chapter DLC would be possible. Behaviour didn't explain why the DLC was being removed from sale, but as Matt posited at the time, the answer is almost certainly licensing-related.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rainbow-six-siege-turn-based-tactics-game-reportedly-in-development-at-ubisoft.1156617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-turn-based-tactics-game-reportedly-in-development-at-ubisoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Tom Henderson revealed that Ubisoft is developing a turn-based tactics game set in the world of Rainbow Six Siege. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-turn-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the report</a>, this game is expected to launch in 2026 or 2027 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and 'possibly' Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Henderson's sources mentioned that it will feel a lot like XCOM, albeit with more cinematic cutscenes and the like. Players will select operators with different skill sets based on the current mission. The campaign is said to last between 25 and 30 hours, though that could change since the development is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege has been one of the most successful Ubisoft games in the last decade, and it's still being updated, so it's not surprising that the publisher is doubling down on the IP. It was also handpicked alongside Far Cry and Assassin's Creed to be handled separately as part of the new subsidiary that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> recently with the financial help of Tencent.</p>
<p>In a couple of months, Rainbow Six Siege <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will also be overhauled</a> with X, a new version featuring improved graphics and new gameplay elements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>New destructible items</li>
<li>Smoother rappel navigation with improved controls</li>
<li>Revamped audio experience with better propagation and reverberation</li>
<li>Refreshed onboarding experience to help new players master the basics through tutorials and field training before jumping into their matches</li>
<li>A new communication wheel to easily communicate with teammates</li>
<li>An updated Pick and Ban system injects a new layer of strategy by allowing teams to react and adapt to enemy strategies. Simultaneous bans every round will speed up the process</li>
<li>R6 ShieldGuard, a unified approach to all existing anti-cheat initiatives that also introduces new technologies to protect the game, including live security updates that will occur without the need for scheduled maintenance, making it harder to create cheats</li>
<li>An improved reputation system to ensure players behave appropriately during matches</li>
</ul>

<p>"I left feeling that The Minecraft Movie, something weirder and trickier and perhaps less formally careful, is out there somewhere, its bright potential untouched," our Chris Donlan wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">Minecraft movie review</a>, awarding it 3/5 stars.</p>
<p>"Minecraft hardly needs a film in the first place - it's already a phenomenon, a Pandora's Box, an essential formative aspect of the childhoods of millions of people around the world.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-and-skins/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/will-tarkov-arena%E2%80%99s-battle-pass-and-skins-make-it-to-the-main-game.1156587/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-and-skins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We never thought we’d see a battle pass or traditional season structure in Escape from Tarkov – and we’re kind of <strong>still not. </strong>But Escape from Tarkov: Arena, the session-based multiplayer arena shooter, is getting a battle pass system along with cosmetics and skins soon. On social media, Battlestate Games has spent the past couple of days teasing just that.</p>



<p>In a new post on Twitter, players are given a glimpse at the CQCM Mask, a favourite item amongst the game’s W-key spamming Chads, with a <strong>custom skin</strong>.</p>



<p>It starts with Arena – will it bleed into Escape from Tarkov proper?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-geared-up">Geared Up</h2>



<p>The <strong>free </strong>battle pass that’s coming to Escape from Tarkov: Arena is expected to behave exactly as you’d imagine. It’ll reward players with exclusive items, skins, and boosts in exchange for cold, hard XP grinds. The more you play, the more you’ll unlock.</p>



<p>That’s right, I said it’s <strong>free</strong>. That was something confirmed by Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov two days ago.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov: Arena isn’t free – you need to pay for that as it’s a spin-off from the core extraction shooter title.</p>



<p>Here’s the post on social media that revealed a snippet of the CQCM skin:</p>











<p>Players are now wondering how any crossover impact will ripple throughout the wider Escape from Tarkov ecosystem. Will there be a linking function allowing users to run their skins and cosmetics in Escape from Tarkov’s extraction shooter platform? I, for one, hope so. I’ve wanted to customise my gear more in Tarkov for the longest time.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov uses a ‘wipe’ pattern that typically involves resetting the game once every six months. That could easily pivot to a season structure equipped with a battle pass of sorts, but it would need BSG to pack it with content for it to be interesting. Given that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/months-add-escape-from-tarkov-gun/">takes months to add a single gun</a> to the game, that’s a <strong>huge </strong>ask that probably won’t be delivered.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to skins and a battle pass coming to Escape from Tarkov? Let me know in the comments, or check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
