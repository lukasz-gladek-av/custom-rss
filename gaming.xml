		<p>Two Point Studios must have a thing for leather elbow patches. A stereotypical part of college and university professor dress for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/two-point-campus-review/">Two Point Campus</a>, they’re also pretty prevalent in museum curators, I’m sure. Hence, Two Point Museum –&nbsp;the latest management sim that will have you reviving an ailing industry across Two Point County.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Supernatural Trailer (PEGI ENG)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3OAKLaDRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the elbow patches remain the same, and the general gist of a management sim will be familiar, the actual workings of a museum are rather different to a hospital or university. Instead of managing a flow from diagnosis through to treatment, or trying to teach and train students to get a passing grade from one semester to another, a museum has much more in common with a theme park. You want a museum to entertain as much as it should enlighten, and there needs to be a flow through the building, taking people from exhibit to exhibit, before dumping them into a gift shop to buy all the kinds of tat that will actually pay the bills.</p>


<p>The thing you really need to be thinking about when designing a layout and an exhibit is the “buzz” that it provides, the excitement and interest that it instills in your guests. As wondrous as a giant prehistoric footprint might be, it means very little without a bit of info alongside, so you’ll naturally want to put up a few info stands to provide that. And since it’s a prehistoric artefact, why not dress up the environment a little to theme it around this? You will want an expert on hand to make sure that a stand is well preserved and maintained, but between the buzz it generates, the knowledge that is imparted and the general decoration that you put down, you’ll build up the environment score of an exhibit.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget to place some donation bins for people to chuck coins into as a reward for your hard work. That’s before they get to the gift shops that you can fill with themed items to match your museum and exhibits.</p>


<p>The building tools are really nice and straightforward, bringing the ease of creation from the previous games, dropping items down with a handy snap to grid to keep things in order, creating blueprints for rooms, and more. There’s some really extensive colour options to let you get exactly the look that you want, and there’s greater ease for putting things on an angle with diagonal internal walls, halved floor tiles, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, just because they’re paying your bills doesn’t mean you can really trust visitors. Whether it’s vandals, thieves or invariably bored children getting up to no good, you’ll need to have security cameras and guards meandering around to try and make sure your exhibits are kept in good order. You can help to keep them on the rails, as it were, with tour guides that take groups through the museum in a more orderly fashion, as well.</p>
<p>As you would expect, there’s a great humorous twist to all of the exhibits that you can display through your museums, with Two Point Studios well known for their pun-filled games. I particularly enjoy the stone-carved computers, goofy looking dioramas, frozen prehistoric men still in their ice blocks, and even when it’s a fairly sensible looking dino skeleton, it’s got a great cartoony style. The marine life museum goes all in on oversized tentacle monsters and strange-looking fish, while the freshly announced ghost museum has you featuring spectres in Polterguest Rooms, floating furniture, haunted TVs and puppets, and more.</p>

<p>But where do these exhibits come from? You can’t just pop to the history shop to buy a Sharpontops skeleton, after all. This is where your hired experts come in handy, as you send them out on expeditions to dig sites and other locations to try and find those precious artefacts and bring them back. You can choose how much time and leeway they should have on these missions, whether speedy, safe or detailed in their search, and that will impact how likely they are to be successful in bringing things back. Skeletons will take multiple expeditions to find all of the parts, and each expedition location on the map will have a number of discoverable items to search for.</p>
<p>Should they find something, they’ll come back with a big ol’ crate for you to open up&nbsp;– replete with a glorious loot crate animation –&nbsp;and then decide where you want it to go.</p>

<p>That’s not the only thing that they can bring back with them, as a risk of every expedition is that experts come back with some kind of physical ailment. They could end up with sticky feet that make them tardy, they could be snake bitten, and plenty more besides. Thankfully it’s not too difficult to sort them out with recovery pods that you can place in the staff room for them to heal up in –&nbsp;I’d love to see some kind of tie in back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/30/two-point-hospital-review/">Two Point Hospital</a>. but this might be wishful thinking.</p>
<p>After Hospital and Campus, Two Point Museum brings another fresh setting for the team’s fun-filled take on management games. I’ve really enjoyed the themes revealed so far, and can’t wait to see what the wider game has in store when it comes out in March.</p>

			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard delivers decent image quality and great performance on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, complete with ray tracing in Quality Mode.</p>
<p>In a new tech review posted a few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the console versions of the latest entry in the series by BioWare, confirming details such as resolution, visual features, and more. On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the game runs at 1080p resolution, upscaled to 4K using a custom version of AMD FSR 2.2 complete with some ray tracing features like ray-traced reflections and ambient occlusion in Quality Mode, and at 720p, upscaled to 1440p using dynamic resolution that can drop as low as 504p. Still, AMD FSR 2.2 seems to be doing a decent job, and image quality isn't massively impacted even with such low resolution, although it is definitely noticeable under scrutiny. Performance, at least, seems to be solid, consistently hitting the 60 FPS target.</p>
<p>Things don't fare as well on Xbox Series S. On the system, Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs at 648p in Quality Mode and 432p in Performance Mode, targeting 30 and 60 FPS, respectively. Despite some issues, such as a lack of motion blur in Quality Mode that prevents the 30 FPS gameplay from being smoother and lower image quality in Performance Mode, Digital Foundry found the experience serviceable on the system.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-lays-off-staff-and-closes-uk-studio.1024056/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>developer Inflexion Games has become the latest studio to be hit by layoffs, with the developer blaming what it calls "the stark realities of the industry".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayNightingale/status/1851671600078143563" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Inflexion CEO Aaryn Flynn says that his studio has explored "every possible option" to lift itself out of an "incredibly challenging" situation, but that he has had to "make the difficult decision to let go some of our remarkable and talented team members".</p>

<p>Separately, an Inflexion employee <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dozens-of-staff-laid-off-at-inflexion-as-part-of-restructuring" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed to GamesIndustry.biz</a>&nbsp;that the number of layoffs is at least 22, based on internal company communications that employee apparently has access to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inflexion-games-nightingale-layoffs-umbrellas.jpg?itok=Y3M0UxRc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inflexion-games-nightingale-layoffs-umbrellas.jpg?itok=5i8Kv46h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>developer Inflexion Games is laying off a number of staff and closing one of its offices.</figcaption></figure><p>Flynn goes on to say that while his studio is "proud" of&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>, the game's Early Access release hasn't achieved the level of commercial success necessary to "continue development at our studio's previous size".</p>

<p>As such, not only will these staff be laid off, but Inflexion's UK office will also be closing entirely. Flynn says he and his studio will "support each member of the team affected by the reductions".</p>

<p><em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>itself will seemingly continue development; Flynn says he will provide "more details on our upcoming updates soon", so we'll likely get to find out what&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>'s future direction will be in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In our&nbsp;<em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nightingale-preview">preview</a>, writer Robert Adams declared that there's "plenty of fun to be had" in the game, but that players should be aware of the game's "flaws" before diving in, which might give some idea as to why&nbsp;<em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>hasn't been more successful.</p>




<p>It also looks as though a major initiative to fix some of&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>'s biggest problems, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4569553448608139865" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dubbed "Realms Rebuilt"</a>, hasn't been as successful as Inflexion had hoped.</p>

<p>Of course, this won't come as much of a salve to Inflexion, but it's not the only studio losing employees at the moment. The industry is still in the grip of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">layoff wave</a>&nbsp;that has affected (and looks like it will continue to affect) companies both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-league-of-legends-layoffs">big</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">small</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to check out&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>, it's available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928980/Nightingale/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right now on PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283527/puzzmo-weather-memoku<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Weather Network can be a very useful website, but that’s mostly true when the weather is bad. So when the company began collaborating with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">the Hearst-owned</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23929222/puzzmo-newspaper-games-crossword-zach-gage">puzzle platform Puzzmo</a>, it had a specific goal: to get people coming to the site even when it’s nice out. “Why would you check the weather on a sunny day?” veteran game designer Zach Gage remembers asking himself. Eventually, the Puzzmo team came up with an answer in the form of <a href="http://puzzmo.com/+/weather"><em>Weather Memoku</em></a>, an extremely chill game that combines elements of memory, sudoku, and, well, the weather.</p><p>“A very important idea was: can we change checking the weather from being a thing you check off your to-do list, to being a chance to take a moment for yourself?” explains Gage.</p><p>The game takes place on a 6 x 6 grid, and the goal is to flip over tiles to find matches, much like in a classic game of memory. The twist is that it also follows the rules of sudoku. This means that each of the six symbols appears in each row and column only once, turning <em>Weather Memoku</em> from a pure guessing game to one with a bit of strategy. It’s also incredibly charming, with symbols that change based on the weather. There are cute little frogs on a rainy day and penguins when it snows out. When you complete the puzzle — which will probably take a minute or two — you’re presented with your score in addition to an hourly weather report. You can also share this, much like your <em>Wordle</em> score.</p><p>According to Gage, who previously <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21334116/good-sudoku-iphone-ipad-app-game-zach-gage">developed the sudoku app <em>Good Sudoku</em></a>, <em>Weather Memoku</em> is meant to be an iteration of what he calls “arcade sudoku,” which is basically the standard way of playing without using high-level strategies. <em>Weather Memoku</em> takes the same core gameplay — looking at a grid to figure out where things belong — and streamlines it even further. “Being wrong is part of the game,” Gage explains. “In this game, if you don’t know something and you guess, you can tap anywhere and now you have a new piece of information and your board has changed. It really feels like an interesting evolution of arcade sudoku.”</p><p>That streamlined nature is important for what the game is meant to be. <em>Weather Memoku</em> is a fun way to learn a piece of information, but it’s also designed to feel like “a little meditation” that would make you want to keep coming back to the site each day, much like a crossword puzzle or sudoku challenge. “You can have this meditative experience and then when you’re done, you actually have the weather,” says Gage. “You’ve left with a tangible piece of information that’s valuable to you.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Lodge is now overshadowed by tales of furniture moving by itself, a dreadful train whistle echoing across the valley and other blood-curdling rumors.</em></p><p><em>As Curator, your task is to join the ghostly front-of-house Winston Wailon and discover show-stopping exhibits that will turn the old haunted hotel into a bustling location once more. Create immersive Polterguest Rooms to turn wandering spirits into museum guests and send expeditions into the neighboring Netherworld Rift, treating its historic remnants with care and respecting the eerie past of the relics.</em></p></blockquote><p><em><em>Two Point Museum</em> will launch for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,282 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,331 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,600 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on March 4, 2025</em></p><!-- AD: content --><p><em>

The app is free to download and use--provided you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p><p>Nintendo has curated a handful of playlists out of the music currently available, from title-screen songs to tracks themed around a certain character. Also, since users will be logging in with their Nintendo Switch Online accounts, a separate list will include games that account has previously played--along with an option to hide songs that are potential spoilers.</p><p>The list of soundtracks currently available on the Nintendo Music app are as follows:</p><ul><li>NES  <ul><li>Metroid</li><li>Metroid (Famicom Disk System version)</li><li>Super Mario Bros.</li></ul></li><li>Game Boy  <ul><li>Kirby’s Dream Land</li><li>Dr. Mario</li></ul></li><li>Super NES  <ul><li>Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island</li><li>Donkey Kong Country</li></ul></li><li>Nintendo 64  <ul><li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</li><li>Star Fox 64</li></ul></li><li>Game Boy Advance  <ul><li>Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade</li></ul></li><li>Gamecube  <ul><li>Metroid Prime</li></ul></li><li>DS  <ul><li>Tomodachi Collection</li><li>Nintendogs</li></ul></li><li>Wii  <ul><li>Super Mario Galaxy</li><li>Wii Channels</li></ul></li><li>Nintendo Switch  <ul><li>Pikmin 4</li><li>Pokemon Scarlet/Violet</li><li>Splatoon 3</li><li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</li><li>Kirby Star Allies</li><li>Super Mario Odyssey</li><li>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild</li></ul></li></ul>

            <p>Today is 31st October, which means one thing: It's Halloween!</p>
<p>To honour the occasion, Google has come over all bewitching with a spooky little mini-game to help while away the time before we can shut down our computers and head out trick or treating.</p>
<p>The game itself pops you into the shoes, or paws, of a little witch cat in a space helmet, who needs to ward off a number of creepy evils by drawing spell runes with their wand. This is done with your mouse, and let me tell you, it is all quite engrossing and more than a tad tense.</p>

<p>I gave the game a whirl myself (I want to be thorough with my reporting, it has nothing to do with frivolous fun I promise...) and managed to get to the final level before my hearts were all depleted. My top score was 16000, which was better than Tom's so I can sleep easy tonight knowing I am clearly <strong>The Best Gamer</strong> on the news team.</p>
<p>I do want to finish the final level, however, so I will go back again later to try again.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to give the game a go yourself, <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?ddllb=1&amp;doodle=306734893&amp;hl=en-GB">you can try it out here</a>. Have fun!</p>

            <p>
Nintendo's leftfield launch this month of Alarmo, an interactive alarm clock, was something of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>
Less of a surprise is the fact that enterprising electronics fans are now taking it to pieces, and trying to work out how it... ticks.
</p>
<p>
Alarmo has a relatively robust set of security protocols under the hood, though Wii U reverse engineer GaryOderNichts has gotten far enough to run custom code on the alarm clock via a USB (thanks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/random-someones-figured-out-how-to-run-custom-code-on-nintendos-alarmo">Nintendo Life</a>) and display... a photo of a cat.

<p>
Getting to this stage looks (relatively) straightforward - there's no taking Alarmo to pieces needed for this. (And indeed, <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html">he did previously take Alarmo to pieces</a> to try and make more progress that way.)

There's no practical use to any of this at the moment, but work by Gary and others is continuing. What games would you like to see working on Alarmo's 2.8-inch LCD screen? With two buttons and a rotational dial, I reckon Tetris might work. And you wouldn't even have to leave bed!

			<p>THE BROTHERHOOD, an independent game development studio based in Cape Town, South Africa, and known for the games STASIS and <a href="https://wccftech.com/beautiful-desolation-kickstarter-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beautiful Desolation</a>, has recently announced a new game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2591790/ANIMAL_USE_PROTOCOL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Use Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike their previous titles, which were point-and-click isometric adventure games, Animal Use Protocol is a full-fledged 3D first-person horror game made in Unreal Engine 5. The trailer already shows excellent visuals and the preliminary PC system requirements are suitably high.</p>
<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600</em><br>
<em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 1080 or AMD Radeon RX 580</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 12</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Sound Card: DirectX-compatible sound card</em><br>
<em>VR Support: N/A</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: To Achieve a solid 30FPS at default Settings.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 30 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA RTX 4070 or AMD RX 7900 XT</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 12</em><br>
<em>Storage: 30 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Sound Card: DirectX-compatible sound card</em><br>
<em>VR Support: N/A</em></p>
<p>As you might have guessed already from the game's title, Animal Usage Control is heavily themed around animals. You'll play as a highly intelligent chimpanzee called Penn who is attempting an escape from a laboratory where animals are being experimented on. Armed only with your wits, a gravity manipulator, and a scrappy rat sidekick called Trip, you'll stealthily navigate the dystopian Anchorage Station while being relentlessly pursued by all sorts of monstrous experiments gone wrong.</p>
<p><iframe title="Animal Use Protocol Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aws6p_Z_2uc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The developers also promised highly immersive environments, exploration-driven gameplay with interactive objects and environmental storytelling, intense and unscripted encounters with a terrifying enemy, limited resources and inventory management for high-stakes decision-making, and voiced dialogue and audio logs for deep narrative immersion. Development on Animal Use Control started in December 2023 and is scheduled to launch on PC in the latter half of 2026, while a console launch will come later.</p>

</div><div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stationeers">Stationeers</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/icarus">Icarus</a> developers RocketWerkz are making a spiritual successor to beloved space sim Kerbal Space Program, which is currently titled "Kitten Space Agency" in a flagrant display of adherence to wholesome internet trends. It's based on an actual <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> pitch the studio threw at Take-Two subsidiary Private Division back in the day. RocketWerkz CEO and original DayZ creator Dean Hall has hired several former KSP and KSP2 developers to work on the game, and is describing it on social media as a "KSP killer".</p> <!--more-->
<p>I'm not sure KSP2, at least, needs to be "killed" at this point. The sequel - which once thrilled with talk of interstellar travel and lightyear-wide braking manouevres - appears to have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-producer-confirms-mass-layoffs-contradicting-ceos-remarks">abandoned</a>, with Take-Two gutting developers Intercept Games back in May. Still, I'm happy to learn that somebody else is wrestling with the important problem of how you simulate an entire solar system without blowing up your office.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Hall - who has made KSP mods in the past - has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/ksa_the_ksp_replacement_from_rocketwerkz_seamless/">posted about the new game on Reddit</a>, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-18">passed on</a> by tireless Maw feeder MiniMatt. "Our studio actually was in the bidding to make KSP2 and we made it to the top three bids," Hall writes in the thread. "The final step was a call [with] Private Division.</p><p>"I put a lot of work with into a good design document and opted to keep the focus entirely on this design and the technical aspects of the project," he continues. "This was a serious problem for two of the people on the call who said we were the only pitch that did not contain art. Obviously our studio wasn't chosen." (I have fixed a couple of Hall's typos here, because I am nice.)</p>
<p>The studio's catlike KSP slayer/reviver is being made with a set of in-house C# development tools, the BRUTAL Framework, which RocketWerkz feistily advertise as being "complicated, slow, and difficult to use". The key asset of the BRUTAL Framework seems to be that it lets developers and modders work directly with your GPU via the Vulkan API, allowing for "tremendous" scale.</p>
<p>There's a fair bit of technical detail in that Reddit thread, a mix of game engine specifics and abbreviated ruminations about physics. I fear to quote much of it in case I capitalise the wrong letter and accidentally delete my computer, or switch off local gravity. A lot of it is tilted towards modders: there are a few modders on the KSA team. But hidden in amongst phrases like "dealing with floating point precision loss" there is some chat about the project's direction and features for us regular, Earth-dwelling folks.</p>
<p>Hall <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun4djj/">says</a> they're aiming "To replicate the same feeling, commitment, and challenge of existing KSP", because "base KSP is a great compromise between many factors when it comes to scale, and so we are not trying to reinvent that". Instead, they're focusing on "solid datastructures" and "ease of development for modders". They're planning to include off-world base building, life support systems, multiplayer functionality, and seamless movement between screens with no loading breaks during multicraft space missions.</p><p>The current builds use real-life solar system data for testing purposes, but the developers aim to construct their very own solar system for the game. The ship-building elements will be familiar, but RocketWerkz want to expand it with combinable "subparts" such as fairings and small tanks. And yes, Hall says the game currently has kitten characters, though that may change. "I think a certain amount of whimsy is important," he notes.</p>
<p>One reachier goal is to add an n-body physics system. I'm going to screw up describing this, but essentially, an n-body physics system dynamically simulates the relationships between bodies based on gravity, rather than "baking in" their motions. It's very hard to do this without dropping planets everywhere like balls of wool. RocketWerkz say there's a "small chance" of RocketWerkz developing such a simulation internally - they're currently trying to hire somebody with a PhD to apply the requisite high-density brain-magic - but it's likely this will be left for modders to figure out.</p>
<p>RocketWerkz won't charge for the first version of KSA, because Hall feels that KSP players are justifiably wary of committing to anything new and KSP-ish, after the disappointment of KSP2. "I think the community is very burned out," he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun9mwq/">comments</a>. "Which is why the first version of KSA will be free, so people can try it out before wanting to follow progress and then later buying it when it releases." The initial release won't have any DRM, either.</p>
<p>You might wonder what Kerbal Space Program rights holders Take-Two Interactive make of all this. Are RocketWerkz concerned about getting sued for copyright theft or patent infringement? Not at all, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/luncebw/">says</a> Hall. "They are welcome to try! Would be some great publicity for us. Also, I'm very bitter as I think they are a terrible company. So bring it on! We have great lawyers." Well then.</p><p>As for when they'll share more - Hall says modders should get "behind-the-scenes access late this year or early next to initial builds for feedback". Hall's hope is that open access might follow "maybe mid next year". In the Reddit thread he stresses that "it is critical to be skeptical" of a project this complex, so by all means drop into that thread and hold his feet to the fire. I'll just carry on tending to Spaceship RPS in the starless void of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/weve-temporarily-closed-comments-for-maintenance-but-theyll-be-back">temporarily suspended comments</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a>‘s SMGs are excellent for close-quarters combat, especially on the smaller maps. The PP-919 is among the strongest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons in BO6</a> due to its large magazine and all-around balanced stats.</p>



<p>For those looking to leverage the PP-919, here’s the best loadout for the SMG in Black Ops 6, packed with the attachments, Perks, and Equipment you should be using.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-pp-919-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>

<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-pp-919-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-pp-919-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best PP-919 attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>Merlin Mini</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Ergonomic Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> No Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>The PP-919 is an SMG that can perform well at close and even medium ranges in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a>. So, to empower its strengths, the <strong>Merlin Mini</strong> Optic will provide a clean sight for you to take on enemies outside of close range, while the <strong>Suppressor </strong>keeps you off the enemy minimap and the <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> boosts the gun’s damage range and bullet velocity.</p>



<p>Lastly, the <strong>Ergonomic Grip</strong> and <strong>No Stock</strong> attachments will both improve the weapon’s mobility and handling. This means you can get the first shot off quickly after sprinting and avoid bullets by strafing faster.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-pp-919">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for PP-919</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Ninja</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Vigilance</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Flak Jacket</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Frag</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>For Perks, we’ve chosen <strong>Ninja </strong>for a more silent approach, <strong>Forward Intel</strong> for more minimap information, and <strong>Vigilance</strong> so that you know when your position has been exposed. These three provide the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong> too, giving you wallhacks when you spawn and a HUD indicator for when you’re spotted.</p>



<p>The <strong>Perk Greed Wildcard </strong>allows us to choose one more, and I find <strong>Flak Jacket</strong> incredibly useful as it has saved my life many times by reducing enemy explosive damage, especially when capturing objectives.</p>



<p>You’ll want some solid Equipment to compliment the best PP-919 loadout in Black Ops 6, hence why we’ve selected the tried and tested <strong>Frag </strong>and the <strong>Stim Shot</strong>, which keeps you topped up on health straight after a fight. Finally, the <strong>Trophy System</strong> is a solid pick for any game mode, blocking the opposition team’s Equipment to better you and your team’s survival.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-pp-919">Best Secondary for PP-919</h2>



<p>My favorite Secondary for the P-919 is the <strong>Grekhova</strong>. It’s the only fully automatic Pistol in Black Ops 6, making it the best option for close-range gunfights and when you just need to land a couple more shots on the enemy.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-pp-919-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock PP-919 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the PP-919 in BO6 by hitting <strong>Level 37</strong>. This may take some grinding, but you should get there fairly fast by playing objective-based modes and completing daily challenges as much as possible.</p>

<p>Yes, the PP-919 is one of the meta SMGs in Black Ops 6 thanks to its large 64-round base magazine, which frees up space for an attachment elsewhere. It also has extremely easy-to-control recoil and decent damage.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for an alternative, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-tanto-22-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanto .22</a> is another SMG that performs well at medium range, providing a slower fire rate to balance it out.

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched on October 25 and it had an enormous, record-setting debut. The game had the "biggest" three-day opening weekend in franchise history when looking at total number of players, hours played, and matches.</p><p>During an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Black Ops 6's release on October 25 set a record for new Game Pass subscriber additions on launch day, though he didn't offer a specific figure. Nadella <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1851744627226734807" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">went on to say</a> that Black Ops 6 sales on PlayStation and Steam were up "over 60% year-over-year" compared against 2023's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</p><p>Modern Warfare III was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4951">2023's No. 2 best-selling game overall in the US</a>, trailing only Hogwarts Legacy. It will be interesting to see how Black Ops 6 stacks up in terms of unit sales, but that comparison won't be perfect, of course, because many people will play Black Ops 6 on Game Pass without buying the game outright. But people are buying Call of Duty games--and lots of them. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a>, the Call of Duty series has now passed 500 million copies sold since the franchise debuted in 2003.</p><p>For comparison, that's ahead of the <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9eb38a0e-f871-4c59-8af2-c0c41ca99c07" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">430 million lifetime sales of GTA games</a>. This figure is poised to grow in a big way soon, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6 launches in 2025.</a></p><p>Big numbers for Black Ops 6 were expected prior to launch. Not only is the Black Ops brand highly popular, but the game launched into Game Pass, a much-discussed move that seems to have paid off in the short term for Microsoft.</p><p>Before this, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he anticipated Call of Duty helping to drive Game Pass subscribers for Microsoft, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">only for a period of time.</a> As Zelnick sees it, releasing a major new game into a subscription service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">makes little sense and is a "lost opportunity" for sales.</a> Zelnick, of course, runs a third-party publisher and has his own set of unique opinions for his business that might not compare directly to Microsoft's own business objectives.</p><p>Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-subscribers-by-25m-to-4m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Microsoft putting Black Ops 6 could lead to up to six million in lost sales; he estimated that 25% of existing Game Pass subscribers would have bought it anyway. Pachter said Microsoft could see as many as four million new Game Pass subscribers thanks to Black Ops 6.</p><p>Black Ops 6 expands this week with the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-iconic-nuketown-map-arrives-to-black-op-6-this-week/1100-6527448/" data-ref-id="1100-6527448">highly anticipated Nuketown multiplayer map on November 1</a>. After that, Black Ops 6 Season 1 begins on November 14, and this also includes the introduction of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-start-date-confirmed-and-its-very-soon/1100-6527474/" data-ref-id="1100-6527474">Call of Duty: Warzone's newest map, Area 99.</a></p><p>For more, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops 6 campaign</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review/1900-6418309/" data-ref-id="1900-6418309">multiplayer reviews.</a></p>

            <p>Toby Fox has assured fans that the next two <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> chapters will be released next year. In fact, the developer is "100 percent" on that.</p>
<p>Deltarune charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World. It's a spiritual successor to retro-style RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, though it takes place in a different setting.</p>
<p>Its first chapter launched as a free download <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-says-the-rest-of-deltarune-has-not-been-made-yet">towards the end of 2018</a>. A second free instalment then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapter-2-arrives-this-week-on-pc">arrived in September 2021</a>, and the promise of more to come followed. We are still to actually get our hands on the next chapter, however, but Fox has now shared a small morsel of an update on its arrival.</p>

<p>After sharing a Deltarune image for Halloween on social media platform X, the developer went on to state that he was "very eager" to share what's being worked on.</p>
<p>Fox said chapters three and four would "100 percent come out in 2025". However, the developer couldn't give a more specific time frame right now, due to "localisation and console porting" on the development side of things. In October of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-release-strategy-altered-will-be-available-to-purchase-sooner">Fox said chapter three was "content complete"</a>.</p>
<p>"Please hear me clawing at the door trying to escape the shallow coffin I have been buried in," Fox's post closed. Well, it is Halloween.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-working-on-deltarune-chapters-3-to-5">previous plan</a> was to release chapters three, four and five of Deltarune together, and make the game available to purchase. Last year, however, this plan changed, as Fox said chapter 5 was still a way off.</p>
<p>"And I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything. Especially me," Fox explained at the time.</p>

		<p>A fresh exhibit and location has been revealed for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, the latest quirky management game in the Two Point series, with Ghostology featuring spooks, spectres, the undead and more. Two Point Museum is set to launch across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/two-point-museum-curates-a-march-2025-release-date/">4th March 2025</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Supernatural Trailer (PEGI ENG)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3OAKLaDRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With all the tongue-in-cheek japes and jokes sprinkled throughout the game, it’s good fun to try and spot all the references in the trailer. I definitely spotted a The Ring TV set, a haunted puppet and more generic floating tables and poltergeists.</p>
<p>This range of exhibits will be most heavily featured in the Wailon Lodge level, an old holiday hotel that lies in ruins, until you turn up to turn it into a supernatural museum. The Lodge will see you join up with Winston Wailon to curate a bunch of exhibits throughout, with Polterguest Rooms to invite spirits to be residents and expeditions to the Netherworld Rift to bring back historic remnants and creepy relics.</p>

<p>I think it’s pretty safe to say that, as quirky and fun as the exhibits might look, this probably isn’t a museum you want to spend a night at!</p>
<p>Wailon Lodge joins previously revealed locations at Memento Mile and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tI85pecH1g">Passwater Cove</a>, with Two Point Studios cooking up a bunch of inventive levels that you might consider turning into a museum.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing more of Two Point Museum, given our love of the first two Two Point games. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/two-point-campus-review/">Two Point Campus review</a>, “If Two Point Hospital was a triumphant return of the Theme Hospital style management sim, then Two Point Campus is a true heir. It takes the same tongue-in-cheek tone and applies it to a new setting, it learns from the journey its predecessor went through, and it deepens the experience for anyone that wants it.”</p>

            <p>Two Point Studios has announced the next museum type coming to its forthcoming Two Point Museum, and it's a spooky one in time for Halloween.</p>
<p>Yes, players will be able to manage their very own supernatural museum in the form of Wailon Lodge and its Ghostology exhibits.</p>
<p>This remote, old-fashioned and haunted location in Two Point County is far from a cosy holiday destination, but with the help of "ghostly front-of-house" Winston Wailon, players will transform the hotel into an eerie museum.</p>

<p>Of course, the big question is what sort of exhibits will we be able to put on show?</p>
<p>In this museum, players can create "immersive Polterguest Rooms to turn wandering spirits into museum guests", while expeditions into the Netherworld Rift will yield new exhibits and relics.</p>
<p>The trailer above also shows levitating furniture, a giant man-eating plant, and ectoplasm splatters. So, plenty of ways to scare the crap out of museumgoers, then.</p>
<p>Ghostology joins the already-revealed prehistoric and aquarium exhibits. I'm still hoping for an art gallery heist level, personally.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-opens-for-visitors-next-march">Two Point Museum is set for release next March</a> across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's reveal, I spoke with design director Ben Huskins and executive producer Jo Koehler on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-turns-a-fresh-slice-of-mundane-life-into-a-wacky-british-adventure">how Two Point Museum develops the series formula</a> from Hospital and Campus to mix the mundane and the whacky.</p>
<p>"We have some stuff that is grounded in reality," said Huskins, "so we obviously look at what are the sorts of things people would expect to see in a museum, because we always want that grounding. But then we have those slightly more out-there things that make sense in the world of Two Point County.</p>
<p>"It's about getting that variety, both in terms of what these cool exhibits look like but also how they behave and how the player interacts with them."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>From developers Cannibal Interactive, the creators of Purgatory Dungeoneer, springs forth a new labyrinth game. This one is called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/labyrinth-of-wild-abyss-layeredux">Labyrinth of Wild Abyss: LayeRedux</a> and it has labyrinths. Except the labyrinths don't just have single paths to their centres, but tube monsters covered in eyes who'll stalk you slowly and methodically as you meander. Personally, it's not the vibe I'm after when I sit down in the evening and I think, "I would like to play a video game that makes me feel somewhat pleasant". But hey, it might be for you.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>LayeRedux is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>, then. A horror game that's less focused on jump scares and more on the feeling of being lost and not knowing what's around the next corner. There are <em>lots</em> of corners, spread across 50 handcrafted labyrinths with multiple floors, all kitted out with a single monster that'll kill you instantly if they touch you. Think you've lost them? Nah, sorry, you've probably passed an eye on the wall that would've alerted them to your precise location. You can't outsmart them. You can't have a nice chat with them. "There is no hope but to run", says the Steam page.</p>
<p>Moments of respite can be found at toilets, which also act as save points. It's here where the monsters can't get you. Although, these toilets can't be found on every floor of a labyrinth, so you best be careful.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">"Labyrinth of Wild Abyss: LayeRedux", a horror game about paranoia and persistence predation, is now out on Steam for $2.99! Enjoy vast hand-crafted labyrinths and the despair of escape! There is no reasoning with Monsters. There is no hope but to run.<a href="https://t.co/4j3D8MLtOg">https://t.co/4j3D8MLtOg</a> <a href="https://t.co/hml3yeO11h">pic.twitter.com/hml3yeO11h</a></p>— Damien Crawford (@TheWorstRPGDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWorstRPGDev/status/1851882608730460642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>I've not seen the film It Follows, but I've heard that it has a similar schtick? From what I gather, something in a human guise will follow you to the ends of the earth at a normal walking pace. So you could be at a train station looking up at the notice boards, when all of a sudden you notice a person staring directly at you and gently shoving others aside without breaking eye contact. That'll be the monster. And if they catch up with you: you die. I think that's a far from ideal situation and LayeRedux only goes and puts you directly in the monster's lair. No thanks.</p>
<p>But if you're like, "Yes thanks", then you can find the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3285660/Labyrinth_of_Wild_Abyss_LayeRedux/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a post on social media, the developer shared a playful gif showing off the impressive download number. It also left us with this interesting little factoid. Apparently of those 50m downloads, 10k of those were players renaming Baldur's Gate 3's mysterious Undead entity, Withers.</p>
<p>And, what are people renaming him? Well, Bone Daddy, of course! "So, uh, glad we could facilitate that," Larian wrote in its post.</p>

<p>We knew mods were a hit for Baldur's Gate 3 players already. In fact, in less than 24 hours of mod support going live on PC, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-is-pretty-big-says-baldurs-gate-3-director-as-over-1m-mods-are-installed-in-less-than-24-hours">developer announced more than 1m mods had been installed</a>.</p>
<p>Mod support then came to console and Mac players in October, when the team revealed over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-says-baldurs-gate-3-console-mods-smashing-records-just-a-week-after-release">1.7m mods were downloaded in the first 24 hours of release on consoles</a>.</p>

<p>The developer is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has launched Nintendo Music, a new music download and streaming app for your smartphone with access to a library of the company's top video game tunes. 
</p>
<p>
Available now via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604">iPhone App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znba&amp;pli=1">Google Play</a>, the app requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to let you mooch around with Mario or pick up your morning jog with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Music features playlists from dozens of Nintendo games across the years, with more to be added over time. You can play themes from specific games, or from playlists themed around certain Nintendo characters, music genres and moods. 
</p>

<p>
There's also the ability to curate your playlists, and hide music from games you haven't played (or don't want to hear) via a Spoiler function. 
</p>
<p>
Best of all, tracks can be extended (you can choose from either 15 minutes, 30 minutes or a full hour) allowing you to bliss out to some relaxing Animal Crossing or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-4">Pikmin 4</a> vibes all night long. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has increasingly taken a sterner stance towards the hosting of its music elsewhere on the internet, and the decision to provide an official source for its tunes (and the ability to extend them - an offering that is a YouTube favourite) is an interesting step. 
</p>
<p>
So far, Nintendo Music hosts music from: 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>Splatoon 3</li>
<li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</li>
<li>Kirby Star Allies</li>

            <p>The creative director of Insomniac's upcoming Wolverine game has moved across to Xbox, and joined the team working on the Perfect Dark reboot.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox">Game File</a>, Brian Horton hasn't been part of the PlayStation Marvel project since the summer. Horton was announced to be serving as Wolverine's creative director back in 2021.</p>
<p>The game will now be led by Marcus Smith, who has taken on the role of creative director in Horton's stead. Mike Daly is Wolverine's game director, while the game's previously announced game director Camerson Christain will remain with Insomniac, but will serve in a different role. Smith and Daly previously worked together on Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, as creative director and game director.</p>

<p>According to sources close to the matter, the recent changes on the Wolverine development team are "the result of creative decisions around the game".</p>
<p>Following his departure from Playstation, Horton has now moved to Xbox, where he has joined the Perfect Dark reboot team as creative director. Horton will be "bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series," an Xbox representative said.</p><p>We finally got a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">gameplay for the Perfect Dark reboot back in June</a> during an Xbox showcase, four years after the game's initial announcement. The reboot is being co-developed by Microsoft's The Initiative and Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics (where Horton once worked on Tomb Raider). In May, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">described as still being in a "very rough state"</a>.</p>
<p>There's still no release window for the Perfect Dark reboot yet but it'll be a day one Game Pass title when it arrives.</p>
<p>As for Wolverine, it was first announced in several years ago, but little official has been heard about the project since. </p><p>In 2023, Insomniac was subject to a cyber attack, following which people were playing - and uploading footage - of an<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-posting-footage-of-marvels-wolverine-from-stolen-early-version"> incomplete early development build of the game</a>, found within the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">files stolen from the developer by ransomware hackers</a>. Insomniac issued a statement following this incident stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-issues-statement-addressing-hack">Like Logan... Insomniac is resilient</a>."</p>

		<p>Nintendo has launched a brand new Nintendo Music app, putting a big bundle of game soundtracks into the hands of Nintendo Switch Online subscribers.</p>
<p>That’s right, hot on the heels of that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/09/nintendo-alarmo-is-an-alarm-clock-and-not-switch-2/">alarm clock</a>, this is a new perk for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online, letting us all more legitimately delve into the soundtracks for a good selection of Nintendo games – as opposed to, you know, just looking them up on YouTube.</p>


<p>There’s some modern greats included, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> sure to get an awful lot of playtime, but you can also head back to all-timers like the original Super Mario Bros., Metroid, and fan favourites with Nintendogs and the Wii Channels music – yes, the music from the console menus, from when Nintendo still had fun console menus.</p>
<p>Personally, I think this is great, and I can’t wait to see how Nintendo will expand and grow the line up. Sure, they can fill out the library with more obvious soundtracks, but I’d love to see some oddments like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/17/cadence-of-hyrule-review/">Cadence of Hyrule collaboration</a> make an appearance, and collaborations with third parties.</p>

<p>The full line up of soundtracks and games is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Country (Super NES)</li>
<li>Dr. Mario (Game Boy)</li>
<li>Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade (Game Boy Advance</li>
<li>Kirby Star Allies (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Kirby’s Dream Land (Game Boy)</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Nintendo 64)</li>
<li>Lylat Wars (Nintendo 64)</li>
<li>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Metroid (NES)</li>
<li>Metroid (Famicom Disk System)</li>
<li>Metroid Prime (Nintendo GameCube)</li>
<li>Nintendogs (Nintendo DS)</li>
<li>Pikmin 4 (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Super Mario Bros. (NES)</li>
<li>Super Mario Galaxy (Nintendo Wii)</li>
<li>Super Mario Odyssey (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Super Mario World 2:Yoshi’s Island (Super NES)</li>
<li>Splatoon 3 (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Tomodachi Collection (Nintendo DS)</li>
<li>Wii Channels (Nintendo Wii)</li>
</ul>

			<p>Stephen Totilo <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=150949805&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> via Game File that the Perfect Dark reboot recently added a new Creative Director: Brian Horton. He's an industry veteran with credits dating back all the way to Disney: Pocahontas, released in 1996 for the SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive console.</p>
<p>Most of his credits are in the art department. He was, for instance, the Senior Art Director for Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider while at Crystal Dynamics. Horton then switched to a Creative Director position when he did a couple of years <a href="http://wccftech.com/rise-tomb-raider-art-director-leaves-crystal-dynamics-join-infinity-ward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at Infinity Ward</a> and kept the same role when he joined Insomniac to work on Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2. More recently, he was the creative director of the upcoming game Marvel's Wolverine, which Horton <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolverine-ps5-full-size-mature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> briefly three years ago. Given that the Perfect Dark game is largely being developed at Crystal Dynamics in a joint venture with The Initiative, this is a return home for Horton. An Xbox spokesperson told Game File:</p>
<p><em>Brian Horton will be bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series.</em></p>
<p>We finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-first-gameplay-footage-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got </a>our first look at the game during this Summer's Xbox Games Showcase. The gameplay trailer was definitely promising and we also learned a few concrete details. The developers have taken inspiration from elements of the first two installments while creating an entirely new story and universe for the reboot.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark will be a single-player experience with a set of missions that offer various choices on how players complete them. Traversal and gadgets are going to be very important. The focus was on creating an intuitive movement system to let players find interesting ways to tackle their tasks. The combat system has been designed to allow for both melee and gunplay, stealth, and gadgets. Supposedly, the development teams want to blend elements from first-person shooters, immersive simulations, and stealth games into a cohesive whole, delivering a complete secret agent fantasy.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark doesn't have a release date yet, but it will launch on PC and Xbox Series S|X. As all games developed by studios owned by Microsoft, it will be available on Game Pass from day one. As for Marvel's Wolverine, Horton has been replaced by Marcus Smith as the new Creative Director for Insomniac's game.</p>

            <p>Almost ten years after Inquistion offered up a thrilling herb-harvesting adventure, today sees the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-4-release-date-trailer-details-theories-and-predictions">Dragon Age: Veilguard</a>. I’ve popped the release times below. The internet's Aged Dragons are naturally quite excited, and there’s been some lovely interactions over on Le Epic Musk Zone, where veteran Bioheads are celebrating the RPG studio’s history of animation quirks, <a href="https://x.com/ChachiBobinks/status/1851307428656161158">specifically the ‘Bioware Turn’</a>. Here’s a clip:</p>

<p>Violet McVinnie, currently of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resistor">Resistor</a> studio Long Way Home and previously a cinematographer at Bioware on games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a>, has chimed in to speak about the animation.</p>
<p>“Ex Bioware dev here,” <a href="https://x.com/VioletMcVinnie/status/1851558624461496555">wrote McVinnie</a>. “I'm responsible for some of the "Bioware Turns". This anim is part of a set called "Posebreakers" which are intended to move characters around the area if a scene is feeling too static. We'd combine them with the infamous "Exit Left/Right" between cuts.”</p><p>People in McVinnie’s replies are also curating a collection of their favourite Bioware-isms, including 'flick of the wrist accusatory point', 'walk away nonchalantly while looking back over the shoulder', ‘worried forehead rub’, and ‘aggressive headshake after drinking alcohol’ (“just from the mocap recording”, says McVinnie).</p>
<p>One player asked why “everyone in Mass Effect break(s) eye contact and look(s) off to the side when handing objects to people?”, to which McVinnie replied “if it’s the hand off anim I think it is, it was baked into the animation file before we started using it. Not sure of the origin. Many animations propagate through lots of Bioware franchises. ME3's Thane/Kai Leng fight cutscene has a lot of Jade Empire combat animations stitched together.” We do love to see a bit of canny asset reuse.</p>
<p>I done wrote Wot I Think about Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">here</a>. In short: It’s not much of an RPG, and its action wears thin sooner than I’d have liked, but it’s got such heart and enthusiasm it won me right over by the end. Oh, I just remembered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/weve-temporarily-closed-comments-for-maintenance-but-theyll-be-back">comments are temporarily down</a>, too! Sera best companion. Dragon Age 2 wasn’t that great. Anyone moaning about Marvel dialogue in the new game, fair enough, but I must ask if you’ve somehow erased Alistair from your memory. Happy Veilguard day to those who celebrate, and happy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3184110/Widget_Inc/">Widget Inc</a> day to those who don't.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today in "person you already like says something you already agree with, but it’s still good to hear them say it" news, Arkane founder and im-simmy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> studio WolfEye head Raphael Colantonio has spoken on Microsoft’s decision to shutter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2017">Prey (2017)</a> studio Arkane Austin - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">alongside a handful of others</a> - back in May.</p>
<p>Colantonio, who founded Arkane in 1999 and departed in 2017 to form <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/weird-west">Weird West</a> studio WolfEye, recently chatted to Jeremy Peel <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/microsoft-closing-arkane-austin-was-a-dumb-move-says-founder-and-former-president">for PC Gamer</a> about Arkane’s closure, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think if you look a little bit, it's obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again. I think it was a decision that just came down to, 'We need to cut something.' Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They're playing a different game.</p></blockquote>

<p>"The rules that they play, we might not understand them. It's a different thing. It's hard to know why they did what they did,” said Colantonio. "The only thing that I stand by is saying that the specific choice of killing Arkane Austin, that was not a good decision."</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Recreating a very special group like that is, I would dare to say, impossible. It takes forever. When you have that magic of Harvey [Smith] and Ricardo [Bare] etc that all come together, it's a specific moment in time and space that just worked out this way, that took forever to reach. Those people together can really make magic. It's not like, 'Doesn't matter, we'll just rehire.' No, try it. That's what big groups do all the time. They try to just hire massively and overpay people to create those magic groups. It doesn't work like this. So to me, that was stupid. But what do I know?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Arkane Lyon - the original 1999 French studio from which Arkane Austin spun off in 2006 - are currently at work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-blade">Marvel’s Blade</a> - the last we saw of it was some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkane-release-new-marvels-blade-concept-artworks-hinting-at-missions-combat-and-levels">concept art</a> last December. WolfEye’s next project is an “<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfeyes-new-first-person-rpg-is-an-evolution-of-prey-and-dishonored-featuring-mechs-magnets-and-a-continuous-world">evolution of Prey and Dishonored”</a>, and it sounds great. We’re currently expecting a ‘limited private alpha test’ next year. In August, we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> studio Tango - shuttered by Xbox at the same time as Arkane Austin - had been rescued, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">in a manner of speaking</a>, by Plunkbatters Krafton.</p>

			<p>Early signs on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 sales and overall reception were great, and now we have confirmation from Microsoft and Activision. During the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-fy25-q1-total-gaming-revenue-up-by-43-all-from-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q1 2025 earnings</a> call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that the game set new franchise records and also helped the Game Pass subscription service reach records of its own.</p>
<p><em>One year since we closed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, we are focused on building a business positioned for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and services. You already see this transformation in our results as we diversify the ways that gamers access our content. We set new records for monthly active users in the quarter as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform. Game Pass also set a new Q1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber. And as we look ahead, our IP across our studios has never been stronger.</em></p>
<p><em>Last week's launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day 1 players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day. And unit sales on PlayStation and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens they spend their time on.</em></p>
<p>Granted, there were little doubts in both cases. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is, after all, the first new game in the franchise to launch day and date on Game Pass, which would inevitably have expanded its player base (and the subscription service's user base). The bigger question is whether, in the long term, this will be financially beneficial compared to the traditional way the game has been sold before the massive acquisition.</p>
<p>Activision is also celebrating, of course. The official X account revealed that, unsurprisingly, Black Ops 6 has registered the biggest opening weekend ever for Call of Duty in terms of total players, hours played, and total matches. Moreover, the publisher <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> The Washington Post that the first-person shooter franchise has now surpassed 500 million units since its debut twenty-one years ago.</p>

<p>After a 14-year-long wait, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games</a> has finally released their 2010 hit title, Red Dead Redemption, on PC. So, if you’re looking for a fresh start to John Marston’s story, don’t forget to implement these best PC graphics settings during your playthrough.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-graphics-settings-for-red-dead-redemption-on-pc">Best Graphics Settings for Red Dead Redemption on PC</h2>

<p>Considering Red Dead Redemption is over a decade-old game, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements</a> are more on the demanding side. However, even if you have somewhat dated hardware, you can still enjoy the game at higher frames without losing quality. Just use the settings mentioned above.</p>



<p>Unlike Red Dead Redemption 2, where the graphics options are much more robust, you don’t get that in this game. But to get the optimal performance, you can tweak it a little bit as per your liking.</p>
