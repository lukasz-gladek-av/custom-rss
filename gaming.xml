		<p>Morbid Metal is vicious. It’s ready to tear its steel-like teeth through the unwary player, soft fingers and pliable plastic controller at a loss to the visceral violence unfolding in front of them. Morbid Metal provided a gleaming, grinding antithesis to the candy-coloured RPGs found elsewhere at TGS, and as a statement of intent for developer Felix Schade, who started this project on his own, it’s a brutal barrage of expertly-tuned violence.</p>
<p><iframe title="Morbid Metal - Characters Trailer - Games Baked In Germany" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUbz2F7Du58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Morbid Metal is a roguelite. Structurally, that’s the zeitgeist, the norm, the expectation, of gaming in 2025, and it’s interesting to see how well it now fits into modern gaming and modern attention spans. What that means is that death is part of the plan, with your incremental improvements, your first stuttering steps, slowly becoming firmer, stronger and more assured as you grow, both in knowledge and skill.</p>


<p>It all feels like a natural fit here. Morbid Metal doles out its first death with gleeful abandon, and your initial robotic warrior barely lasts more than a few minutes. I like to think I’m pretty handy with a dodge button and a sword – I’ve lived and breathed games like Devil May Cry, Bayonetta and Nier Automata – but I still found myself wanting as I got used to the speed and ferocity of the enemies in the opening areas. Back to the start…</p>


<p>The movement is an immediate highlight, with a great sense of speed and certainty produced by the tight controls. That’s exemplified by the enjoyable platforming you take part in between each encounter, and I’m hoping that this forms a key part of the game’s progression. The central cog, though, is combat. Drawing on games like Bayonetta, a perfectly timed dodge will result in a brief counter-attack window. From there, you can take any angle you want and cause untold damage to any enemy brazen enough to be in range. It’s extremely satisfying to get the timing just right.</p>
<p>As you arrive in each area, you’re locked into a battleground arena, invisible walls setting in place the locale for some severe sword-based action. Completing that skirmish then gives you the choice of three potential upgrades, beefing up your abilities, and letting you tailor your loadout to your playstyle.</p>

<p>That’s made more complicated as you unlock the alternative forms of fighter. Flux, your initial warrior form, is slick and swift, recognisably familiar to fans of Dante and Bayonetta. Your second form, Ekka, slows things down, giving you a massive two-handed blade that eviscerates the defences of shield-bearing enemies and utterly changes up the way you play. More forms will be available through the full game, providing distinctive styles to blend together.</p>
<p>Not only can you shapeshift between different forms in the midst of battle and even a combo, the upgrade options can apply to individual moves for individual forms, making your decisions harder than ever to weigh up. Get the right upgrades, though, and you can really start to roll through the world, with inflated damage making short work of enemies. The choices get trickier as you find Devil’s Bargains, which can give both positive and negative effects, such as boosting the critical chance for both your attacks and those of your enemies, adding further risk and reward to your build.</p>

<p>The world of Morbid Metal looks absolutely fantastic. The metallic foes are all instantly identifiable, and their brutalist design makes them all the more satisfying to destroy. From there you move between the enticing natural decay of some areas through to the unbridled futurism of others, and I can’t wait to see where the journey through the game will take you as you delve ever deeper into Schade’s vision.</p>
<p>The demo built up to an encounter with a robotic monkey boss, Saru, leaping around the arena, unleashing energy pulses to try and dodge. It’s a fun encounter, dashing in and out to deal damage, targeting his fists for locational damage which can affect the attacks he later unleashes.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Saru (from Morbid Metal) - Music Video | Blue Stahli" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qu2ewImdfuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is all complemented by a soundtrack that, on first impressions alone, is going to absolutely rip. You can check out the music video for Saru right now, composed by Blue Stahli, and it’s a heady mix of metalcore guitar work and thumping trance beats, which feel like the perfect fit for the fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping combat.</p>
<p>As we’ve recently seen with Lost Soul Aside, publishers are peeking into the world of solo devs and finding a rich vein of talent and creativity that’s been shorn of the wear and tear of large-scale commercial development. Borne from a university project, Schade subsequently spun Morbid Metal’s development team out into his own company, SCREEN JUICE, before aligning with Ubisoft, one of the biggest publishers in the world. You’d have to hope that we see more of this sort of thing.</p>
<p>With its stylish visuals and slick combat, Morbid Metal could join games like Hades and Risk of Rain as a go-to roguelite. It ties together the instinctive action gameplay of Devil May Cry and Bayonetta with a progression system that rewards commitment and study. I can’t wait to see more when the game arrives in Early Access.</p>
<p><em>If you’re interested in checking Morbid Metal out for yourself, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866130/Morbid_Metal/">you can download the demo via Steam right now</a>, and sign up to a playtest that will feed the planned early access release</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few months ago, Gaijin Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced path traced global illumination to the PC version of War Thunder</a>, significantly improving visual quality over the game's previous ray traced global illumination solution. </p>



<p>In doing so, War Thunder joined an extremely elite club of games that feature real-time path tracing: <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rt-overdrive-mode-is-the-new-pinnacle-of-graphics-and-performance-on-an-rtx-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, DESORDRE, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-pc-performance-benchmarks-nvidia-dlss-3-5-path-tracing-photorealistic-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, Black Myth: Wukong, <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-path-tracing-incredible-performance-cost-rtx-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F1 25</a>, DOOM: The Dark Ages (whose developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-tracing-took-six-months-to-implement-doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have just opened on on their path tracing implementation</a>), and FBC: Firebreak, Remedy's second game on this list.</p>



<p>We contacted Gaijin to organize an email interview that would dive deeply into this tech advancement for War Thunder and the whole Dagor Engine (also used in other games published by the studio, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/enlisted-devs-talk-about-crossplay-progression-system-and-dx12-ultimate-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the MMOFPS Enlisted</a>). At last, we received the responses back, courtesy of Anton Yudintsev (co-founder of Gaijin Entertainment), László Perneky (lead programmer), and Gergo Horvath (programmer). You can find them after the embedded footage.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="War Thunder 4K HDR Full Ray Tracing - USA Tank Crew &amp; Sound Mod RWSM IV Demonstration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oArxTRcbGW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>How long did it take for you to implement Path Traced Global Illumination in the Dagor Engine? Was it complex to go from ray tracing to path tracing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> The ray tracing framework we have is very flexible. We can reconstruct any surface on the whole map with quality very close to rasterized ones, and we keep the ray traced scene in sync with the rasterized scene. With this at our disposal, the first working prototype went fast, in just a couple of weeks. But then the devil is in the details. We had to make sure the results were good in all cases. When rendering airplane cockpits, you need special considerations compared to rendering a tank from behind. We needed to prepare PTGI for all the cases the player can encounter.</p>



<p>Performance is also a big concern. PTGI replaces RT ambient occlusion, which gives us some headroom but is also much heavier, so we needed to make tons of small decisions on optimizations. In the end, we spent about a month on the initial version, but we are still tweaking/refining it ever since.</p>



<p><strong>Will the open source version of the Dagor Engine be updated with path tracing support?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> Probably by the end of the year.</p>



<p><strong>Do you consider the Leviathan update to have added the final version of PTGI, or do you believe there is still room for improvement? If so, is it for quality, performance, or both?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> There is almost always room for improvement for both quality and performance. While the idea of Path Tracing itself is “uber-solution”, implying that we achieve the best possible result by tracing lighting data for each pixel, in reality, a naive approach would be prohibitively slow (~8 million rays with few bounces each), so virtually all real-time solutions use some form of temporal upscaling and so, some kind of denoising. And that would be an area of improvement for visual quality. Also, each game uses its own set of tricks for achieving faster ray-tracing itself (especially for foliage, etc). Performance-wise, it is always possible to do something, although eventually, efforts start to provide diminishing returns. That said, we are rather satisfied with both quality and performance for such quality achieved.</p>



<p><strong>You wrote that you are planning to add support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-ada-lovelaces-opacity-micro-maps-feature-and-how-it-can-boost-ray-tracing-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Opacity Micro-Maps (OMM)</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ada-lovelace-follow-up-qa-dlss-3-ser-omm-dmm-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shader Execution Reordering (SER)</a>. How much of a performance boost do you expect from those additions? Also, do you have an ETA on when they might be introduced to War Thunder?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> Absolutely. In fact, both are underway. For SER, we need to change our ray generation method, as to use it, there are some constraints, like you can’t use it in compute shaders. For OMM, we already have a working prototype, and while it doesn’t do wonders, it brings decent improvement in tracing performance, especially with areas with denser foliage. Microsoft recently made both of these features part of the core Direct3D system. We are still waiting for the final GPU drivers with support for these technologies. But by the time those arrive, we can probably finish the work on them in Dagor and War Thunder and release these features early next year.</p>



<p><strong>What do you think about DirectX's Work Graphs (<a href="https://wccftech.com/directx-12-work-graphs-cpu-bottlenecks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to developers a year and a half ago</a>)? Are they as important as Microsoft is claiming? Will you implement them for your engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> This is the long-awaited step to a more GPU-driven rendering pipeline. In some cases, it can provide significant GPU workload optimization and almost always free some CPU. Unfortunately, its benefits are only possible on rather new hardware. We do want to implement Work Graphs support as well in the upcoming years.</p>

<p><strong>Could PS5 Pro support some version of path tracing? Also, do you have any future improvements coming to the PS5 Pro version, and if so, which ones?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> Technically, it could; the only question is with performance. It is a decision for the future, though. First, we focus on releasing RT support for consoles, with all the effects except PTGI (hopefully very soon). Then, we will have a better picture of how much GPU budget we have to include PTGI and if we can make changes to it to fit that budget.</p>



<p><strong>Are you adding AMD FSR 4 support at some point?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gergo Horvath:</strong> FSR4 is a high priority for us as it is an often-requested feature from players. We have had some divergence regarding upscaling and frame generation technologies supported by each of the games. Even though they are using the same engine. We had XeSS-FG and XeLL added to WT as well as AMD FSR3 with frame generation to War Thunder and now Enlisted is lagging behind. We are planning to remedy the situation by converging support of these technologies in all of our games by the end of the year, and AMD FSR4 will also be part of that package for PC. If and when FSR4 would be available for consoles we will already be ready.</p>



<p><strong>Will Enlisted also receive a PTGI update? If so, is there an ETA?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> Yes, it is planned to have PTGI in Enlisted as well – internally, we do have a running version with it already. Although our current GI solution is giving very similar results to PTGI with significantly higher performance, it is always good to be able to compare to the “ground truth” solution. We aim to release it this year, though no hard deadline yet.</p>

<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 is out now, and it's being sold like hotcakes. Are you considering a Switch 2 port for War Thunder and/or Enlisted?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> We’re always eager to be among the first to support new devices, so we’re definitely considering Switch 2 versions of our games. Unfortunately, right now we’re still waiting for the requested Switch 2 dev kits.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: From Best to Worst Deal in Gaming]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-from-best-to-worst-deal-in-gaming.1315942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year has not been kind to Xbox users as Microsoft continually finds new and creative ways to make their customers mad. Xbox's attempt to kill its own brand is making huge progress as they <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">increased the subscription costs of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>&nbsp;by 50%. Amusingly enough, the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate price hike is being advertised as the "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" rel="nofollow">most expansive upgrade yet, including more day one games than ever before.</a>"</p>

<p>For a service that was once considered the best deal in modern gaming history, the new $30 monthly bill borders on daylight robbery. For 1.5 times the previous price, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate would fundamentally function as it did before, with no particularly noteworthy added features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to retain the current cost of $20 per month, you'll have to settle for the Premium tier at $15.&nbsp;The Premium tier does not have day-one access to Xbox-published games, which may be withheld for up to a year after launch before it is added to the Game Pass library. You also lose out on EA Play, which was part of the $20 pricing of Game Pass Ultimate.</p>

<p>It should be noted that it seems as though a large number of third party games are being locked behind the Ultimate tier as well. The Xbox store page <em>for&nbsp;Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> for example <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9N116V0599HB" rel="nofollow">specifies that it is included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, whereas the store page for <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/deep-rock-galactic-survivor/9PHGQPRBBSXK" rel="nofollow">only mentions Game Pass Premium</a>. As it stands now, Xbox's Game Pass page lists 838 available games for Ultimate and 372 games available for Premium users. Whether or not this will change when the new subscription prices goes live remains to be seen.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: What's Cost-Benefit Analysis?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-change.jpg?itok=giOGHC-p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-change.jpg?itok=QhMBYzEG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maybe Xbox should consider a custom plan instead where people can pick and choose what they want instead. Nah, that'd make way too much sense.</figcaption></figure><p>Historically, Xbox Game Pass' main selling point was that it was usually more cost efficient than buying a game. At $20, you get three months of Game Pass Ultimate for the price of a $60 game.&nbsp;Three months should be sufficient playtime for the average person to finish most full-priced games. They could then play one of the many other games in the Game Pass library, which might keep people in the ecosystem under the guise of affordability and convenience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the new subscription prices, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will only offer two full months of value for the full cost of a AAA game. This is especially relevant now that $70 and $80 games are starting to enter the equation. Game Pass Ultimate would have remained competitive at $20 in such an environment. There is no scenario where $30 can be considered by most people.</p>

<p>To put this into perspective, one month of the new Game Pass Ultimate subscription costs more than outright buying <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>At two months, you can get the Deluxe Edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur:&nbsp;</em><em>Expedition 33</em></a>. Of course, you can drop down to Premium tier for a better exchange rate, but you're giving up day-one access to first-party Xbox games for up to a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox is attempting to offset this by bundling&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Crew, EA Play, and Ubisoft+ Classics with Ultimate.&nbsp;The problem is that EA Play has been a part of Game Pass for years by now, and Ubisoft games were routinely being added to the Game Pass library regardless.</p>

<p>Logically, if people were that interested in EA or Ubisoft games they would've subscribed to their respective services already.&nbsp;Those who are long-term subscribers to Xbox Game Pass likely care more about first-party Xbox games, smaller third-party titles, and indie games since these games make up the majority of the Game Pass library.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: Where're the Games, Phil?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-games.jpg?itok=5MZIKik5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-games.jpg?itok=-7oaUUEd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So, how's that Bethesda and Activsion Blizzard acquisition working out for ya, Xbox?</figcaption></figure><p>Ironically, all these changes might end up decimating the player base of first-party Xbox games.&nbsp;Even the best games in the world are not worth the additional $15 monthly charge for the mere privilege of day one access. Most people would simply stick with Premium (if they remain subscribed at all) and then switch to Ultimate for a month or two if they really wanted to play a specific game that was not available on Premium. Or they could simply buy the game.</p>

<p>That's assuming that those first-party Xbox games are worth playing, or exist, to begin with. Despite spending a literal fortune on Bethesda and Activision Blizzard King, neither purchase has resulted in an increased variety of games for the end user, to say nothing of new IPs. Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">news of workers being fired and game development studios being closed down</a> isn't exactly inspiring confidence in anyone.</p>

<p>One would almost think that Sony has someone feeding ideas to Xbox leadership because the changes to Game Pass Ultimate are absolutely incredible... for PlayStation. For starters, a monthly subscription to PlayStation Plus Premium is $18, while the current cost of a Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription is $20. The new Game Pass pricing scheme would put Ultimate at $30, a full 60% more than the comparable service offered by PlayStation.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass only returns to a competitive price at the Premium level, but at that point Game Pass is ceding its massive advantage in library size and day-one access for a monthly discount of $3. If there was ever an attempt to position Xbox as the affordable way to game, then this Game Pass update just torpedoed those efforts in less than 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: Gearing Up for the Next Console War?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-hardware.jpg?itok=WynVXDHd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-hardware.jpg?itok=4-lUgrTI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's a bold strategy to make everything an Xbox, let's see if it pays out for them</figcaption></figure><p>Without the niche of offering a superior subscription service, it's hard to make a case for Xbox hardware. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/xboxconsoles?icid=DSM_Gaming_Consoles_AllXboxConsoles_Slot01" rel="nofollow">2TB Xbox Series X is selling for $730</a>. Meanwhile, a&nbsp;<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console" rel="nofollow">2TB PS5 Pro goes for $750</a>. The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/handhelds/rog-xbox-ally" rel="nofollow">ROG Xbox Ally is projected to sell for $600</a>. A <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-system-123669/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 has a price tag of $450</a>&nbsp;by comparison.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saving $20 on hardware between PlayStation and Xbox hardly counts for much if the monthly subscription costs for Ultimate are going to be $30. If Ultimate was $20 with all of its perks intact, then an argument for long-term affordability can be made, especially if individual games are $70 or $80.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Xbox does have a slight advantage over its competitors in that Xbox Game Pass has cloud-gaming functionality available for PCs, most modern phones, tablets, and some TVs.&nbsp;Ultimate users are apparently given priority access, though whether or not that's worth the added cost is up to you.</p>

<p>Perhaps the idea is to give up on consoles altogether and leapfrog the high cost associated with PC hardware via Xbox Game Pass' cloud gaming functionality. In theory this would make everything a potential Xbox and everyone a potential Xbox Game Pass subscriber. The PC and phones would thus become the next battleground, given that one or the other are almost mandatory to have in this day and age.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: A Lesson on How to Shoot Yourself in the Foot</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-perks.jpg?itok=5_9p_gRG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-perks.jpg?itok=Zipq8EeI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's kind of funny how Xbox keeps advertising in-game bonuses for otherwise free-to-play games as if they're a huge draw for Game Pass rather than just... bonuses.</figcaption></figure><p>Even if the strategy is to abandon traditional consoles and move Xbox into a multiplatform publishing role, no one on PC is going to spend the equivalent of four to six full-price AAA games on a year of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. You can probably make a case for Premium, but it's going to be difficult when Xbox releases games on Steam anyways.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this seems to be the worst possible time for Xbox to agitate longtime fans of Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>&nbsp;are releasing within the next year, all games that could've otherwise boosted Game Pass numbers. Not to mention that Hideo Kojima's next (Xbox published, mind you) project, <em>OD</em>, finally got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-productions-10th-od-physint" rel="nofollow">reveal trailer</a>.</p>

<p>The real victims in this whole fiasco would be the smaller or more obscure game developers who might've found new audiences thanks to Xbox Game Pass. Games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/haven" rel="nofollow"><em>Haven</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/trek-to-yomi" rel="nofollow"><em>Trek to Yomi</em></a>, and <em>OPUS: Echo of Starsong</em> were excellent additions that fully deserved their spot in the Game Pass library, serving as fantastic examples of how a subscription service does have its use cases in the gaming industry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re just days away from Big Prime Deals Day over at Amazon. This is a multi-day sales event put on during the slower purchasing months to help kickstart some sales. That means if you’ve been patient, waiting for the right moment to buy that espresso maker or bidet you’d been eyeing, next week on October 7 and October 9 might be the best time to pull the trigger. And yet, even though it’s not officially here yet, some items have already begun dropping in price. Take this mini PC for example. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4467/">You can get the AceMagic mini PC right now for 25% off. It’s normally going for $200, so you’ll save a good $50 as it comes to just $150 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4467/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Get a Mini?</h2>
<p>If you don’t have that large of a living space, like if you live with roommates or just have&nbsp; one bedroom or studio in an expensive city, you probably consider what little space you have to be precious. You may not want to take up your entire desk with a massive PC tower. A mini PC offers versatility while keeping the footprint small.</p>
<p>Lots of modern TVs already have built-in smart features, allowing you to download app like Netflix and Hulu directly to them. And if your happens not to be one of those, streaming sticks like the Fire TV and Roku are pretty cheap to come by. That all may be the case, but there are still reason to power your home theater with a mini PC instead. They are full-on Windows devices after all. That means you’d have a wider range of compatibility, playing various video formats and even playing locally saved media. And the small form factor is easy enough to keep hidden behind your TV or within its stand.</p>
<p>Mini PCs also make for wonderful PLEX servers which means you can access your media files anywhere you are. Some gamers tend to flock toward mini PCs are they are the perfect emulation machine for retro games given the minimal amount of processing power they require. Now if you are choosing to do that, be sure it’s only for storing ROMs of games you already happen to legally own. I won’t be personally checking, so you don’t have to pinky swear me anything.</p>



<h2>Specs on Specs on Specs</h2>
<p>This mini PC from AceMagic is equipped with the 2025 Twin Lake N150 processor along with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It’s pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro and has multiple USB ports to connect to your peripherals.</p>

<p>Over the years, racing sims <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/assetto-corsa-are-ps4-and-xbox-one-ready-for-a-true-driving-simulator/">have come a long way</a>. Gaming PCs and consoles have become more powerful, physics and tire models have become more accurate, and after COVID, it seems like nearly everyone has a sim rig setup at home. Sim racing has even become an accepted route into the world of real-life motorsport (not to be confused with the Indy Racing League).</p>
<p>But what if you aren't looking to become the next Max Verstappen? What if you miss the more carefree days of old, where the fidelity wasn't quite so high, nor were the stakes? <em>Rally Arcade Classics </em>is worth a look.</p>
<p>Developed by NET2KGAMES, you might think of <em>RAC</em> as a spiritual successor to legendary titles like Sega Rally and Colin McRae Rally. Forget about the Nürburgring or even street circuits laid out in famous cities you might have visited; instead, this game is about point-to-point racing against the clock—mostly—across landscapes that long-time World Rally Championship fans will remember.</p>

<p>There's Finland, with plenty of fast dirt roads, complete with crests that will launch your car into the air. Or the dusty, sinewy mountain roads of Greece. Catalyuna (in Spain) provides technical tarmac stages. And Monte Carlo combines tarmac, ice, snow, and challenging corners. But since this is rallying, each location is broken into a series of short stages. Oh, and some of them will be at night.</p>
<p>Then there are the cars. This is an indie game, not a AAA title, so there are no official OEM licenses here. But there are plenty of cars you'll recognize from the 1970s, '80s, and '90s. These comprise a mix of front-, rear-, and all-wheel drive machinery, some of them road cars and others heavily modified for rallying. You start off in the slowest of these, the Kopper, which is an off-brand Mini Cooper, a car that won a famous victory at the 1964 Monte Carlo Rally, despite being many, many horsepower down on the mostly RWD cars it beat.</p>
<p>The models of the cars, while not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/gran-turismo-7-reviewed-the-legend-turns-25/"><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a>-level, are close enough that you don't really notice the Peugeot 205 is called the Paigot 5, or the Golf GTI now being the Wolf. The Betta is a Lancia Delta Integrale, the Fourtro is an Audi Quattro, and the Selicka is the Toyota Celica, but I must admit I'm not quite sure why the Subaru Imprezas are called the Imperial R and the MR Bang STI—answers in the comments if you know, please.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I've come to Sensei Takahashi to learn the way of the yari, but we are sitting on the edge of a cliff facing the ocean, painting sumi-e. Ghost of Yotei gives you plenty of opportunities to take a break from slaying ronin to partake in the East Asian painting style, but this is the first time it's been part of protagonist Atsu's training.</p><p dir="ltr">It makes sense, though. Sucker Punch's highly anticipated sequel to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima tells the story of a woman warrior on a quest for revenge, and in between bouts of brutal killings, Atsu follows many of the same practices as the original game's protagonist, Jin Sakai. She meditates at hot springs, honors deities at shrines, follows animals to points of interest, and releases captive creatures.</p><p dir="ltr">But Atsu is even more connected to nature than Jin, and her affinity for the arts, coupled with her dogged, deadly determination, makes Ghost of Yotei a divine take on the power of femininity.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The warrior woman</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Astu, portrayed with impressive depth by actor Erika Ishii, is a complicated young woman. Though she is stubborn and rigid in her belief system (that the people who killed her family all those years ago must die by her hand, no matter what), there is a softness about her that she seems determined to hide from other people. When travelers come to sit by her campfire, she reflexively reaches for her katana--only when it's clear that they're someone in need, or a lover of the shamisen (Japanese string instrument), or a member of the Ainu (the indigenous people of Hokkaido), does she soften.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579688" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579688"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>That barrier is for her own protection, of course. Being a woman in 1600s Japan meant being obedient to your husband and other men. Women weren't permitted to travel alone, though working-class women were expected to work, either alongside their husbands or, if in urban areas, as hostesses at sake shops or as maids. Atsu has no husband, and she spent the majority of her life learning how to fight and roaming to earn money doing it, so any encounter with a stranger brings questions and incredulity.</span></p><p>"Like hell we will; she's a woman," a settler spits when his friend offers to pay Atsu to ride along with them for protection.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond incredulity, there's the ever-present threat of violence. A woman you meet along the way tells a story of how, for years, she hid amongst men, at one point silently sustaining a brutal branding for fear of revealing her identity. Another moment sees Atsu enter the private quarters of a samurai leader, just to find him undressed and expecting a sex worker. Later, she moves virtually unseen through a sake house because she has (reluctantly) worn a kimono. While playing a game of zeni hajiki (inspired by the Japanese children's game ohajiki), her opponent regales Atsu with a story of how a meek, demure woman came into his gambling den years ago and fleeced all the men who underestimated her. We later learn that it was Atsu's mother.</p><p dir="ltr">Even when it's not the center of the story or the cause of conflict, Atsu's womanhood is ever-present, like a paper-thin veil draped over the world. Will those men up the road try to attack, or offer to sell her their wares? Will this bloodthirsty despot accept the bounty she has brought him, or throw her in jail and subject her to horrors only women know?</p><p dir="ltr">Ecofeminists point to the problems that arise when we connect women to nature, just to subjugate both. At the behest of a mad leader known only as the Oni, fire-wielding Oni Raiders stalk a corner of Yotei, setting farms ablaze and destroying the landscape, black scars cutting through large swaths of the land. When a woman tries to escape their prison, those same men kill her and hang her body in front of the jail cells, a warning to any who dare resist.</p><p dir="ltr">Atsu sees these people for what they are: a danger not only to her, but to any vulnerable creature or blade of grass in Yotei.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579647"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A force of nature</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Atsu is most vulnerable around the creatures of Yotei and when she's exploring its forests, plains, and mountaintops, because she's at home there. She's safe there. It's there that she frequently stops to pull out her sumi-e tools and paint waves crashing against the bluffs, or bows in front of a small wooden sign just to be enveloped in Japanese fireflies, or plucks her shamisen while astride Shimaki, her horse.</p><p dir="ltr">She possesses a seemingly supernatural ability to connect with nature--whether it's finding and soothing runaway horses to lead them back to their owner, playfully wondering where a fox is leading her just to discover something spectacular, or summoning a wolf to her side with the strum of her shamisen. Atsu is a literal force of nature: a woman with the wind always at her back and wolves ready to be called, fangs bared, to dig into some man's flesh.</p><p dir="ltr">When Atsu relaxes at a hot spring, she'll often be joined by an animal friend or two: a massive snowy buck or a few chittering foxes. She prefers these friends to the ones who look like her. "Sometimes I wish I had people to talk to, but then people open their mouths and talk and talk and talk--and then I remember why I'm alone," Atsu says, neck deep in milky-blue water.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579642" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579642"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Talking to people, for Atsu, often ends with them at the end of her katana. "I don't hurt kids or animals," Atsu says. Instead, she hurts the men hurting animals, sometimes with those very same animals by her side. She is the personification of nature's rage, her sword piercing through armor like the icy wind atop Mount Yotei.</p><p dir="ltr">Though you could argue that Yotei is an extension of Tsushima's Shinto themes (an indigenous Japanese religion that believes gods are found in nature), Atsu's connection to the natural world is much deeper than Jin's. And when interwoven with the rumors swirling around Yotei that she is an onryō (a vengeful spirit refusing the afterlife until their revenge is doled out), Atsu's ties with nature grow even stronger.</p><p dir="ltr">She can summon this feminine, supernatural power to let loose an Onryō Shout, terrifying the men in front of her into submission--she pulls her arms inward, seemingly drawing in power from the air around her, before letting loose a blood-curdling scream that shakes the earth, flattens grass, and drops men to their knees.</p><p dir="ltr">Atsu is a force of nature, and a soldier in the protection of it. Throughout Ghost of Yotei, we see her summon its power to mete out justice for men, women, children, and animals who have been mistreated by the men in power, by the people who would rather burn the land than watch it flourish. It's easy to root for her, to get sucked into playing just one more side mission where you slaughter wolf trappers or climb just one more rock face to bow at an altar resting at the mouth of the sky. She is nature's protector--a divinely dangerous woman--and we're just helping her along.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="e52bc8cecf5d2"><a title="Metroid Prime Title Screen" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e52bc8cecf5d2/metroid-prime-title-screen.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> has one of the best title screens ever.</p>
<p>It starts off with edge-lit glimpses and silhouettes, a bit like a Bond intro. But instead of naked bodies and <em>wait-was-that-a-nipple,</em> there’s something grotesque and alien and impressively FMV in the darkness.</p>
<p>There’s those classic Prime-y choir synths, which might be the mournful sounds of an ancient civilisation, or just a planet’s history given voice.</p>
<p>And the text comes with such <em>awesome</em> panning and scanning and general UI maximalism, with this honeycombed screen texture and skittering letters flicking on and off — some of the letters from <em>Retro Studios Game</em> become <em>Metroid</em> — and noises that are part hacking, part insectoid trills, with a heartbeat sound underneath.</p>
<p>The choir goes one note higher for the fourth note, there are two more lub-dub pulses before a crucial beat of silence, and then <em>that drop</em> of the main theme, clear and bright - a signal from space. Then the best bit! That weird shimmer-shudder sound as the Metroid Prime 2 title enters the screen. You can feel it in your ASMR gland.</p>

<p>And don't get me started on the sense of epic heroism from raising the last two notes of the phrase when the melody gets repeated.</p>
<p>So much of the Prime series’ appeal is here. The mood, the music, the mechanical scanning and interfacing with worlds historic and natural, and you've not even pressed Start! (You should press Start.)</p>
<p>But maybe you like the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Prime</a> one more; the eerie crackle and fade-in of <em>Nintendo and Retro Studios presents</em>, the Lucozade orange that might be a Metroid's innards, the spooky version of the main theme.</p>
<p>The 2023 remaster 'fixes' the short animation cycle so that the tendril sways up and down but it looks a bit silly. That abrupt VHS loop in the original had the sinister feel of found footage, like the scene of a crime.</p>
<p>But the title screen was more than just a flashy entry point, a nice hallway to the house (read: deadly planet). It set the tone, framed the game. And in my memory, it’s now part of the game’s texture and movement: When you press Start, it does that little swing into a different part of the Metroid (with more bioelectric fizzing), and then after choosing your save, there’s that swooping guided tour and slow fade-out.</p>

<p>This sequence of that spacey intro theme followed by the more upbeat choral blare of the file select, before Samus emerges to that iconic five-note fanfare, is a cadence as inseparably linked in my mind as the track sequence on an album. After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4">In The End</a> comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t2WkCudwfY">A Place For My Head</a>.</p>
<p>Heck, I’ve not even played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Prime 3</a> and yet I somehow ‘remember’ the title screen, probably just from some YouTube archaeology. But it still stuck because it <em>rocks</em>, with that tragic, vaguely female siren synth and an ink blot of infestation across text that's gelled together like cells.</p>
<p>Recognisably Prime, with that meld of the organic and the technological, and you can forgive that too-long fade-to-black and the goofy font of ‘Corruption’ because in the second bit of the tune there's that desperate high note wail as the <strong>Terminator</strong> drums kick in.</p>

<p>So good. Who even needs to play the game?! (I do, Nintendo - please release those remasters.)</p>
<p>But then again, maybe you prefer the 2D Metroid title screens, and I can respect that.</p>
<p>You might like the cinematic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, with its alarm shrill escalation before that full-screen reveal of bodies deathly still beside a moving (but still caged?) Metroid at the centre, the thick bass coming in waves like a planet’s pulse.</p>
<p>Or the stars and surface of OG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_zero_mission">Zero Mission</a>, beginning with the crust of the world before the adventure beneath. Or the impressively creepy off-key dissonance of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid 2</a> one, that progresses to a tune that includes the low health alarm as a sample/anxiety trigger. Wild!</p>
<p>Or maybe you prefer the straighter Metroid font used in the Mercury Steam games, without the skew that gives it that <strong>Star Wars</strong>-intro sense of vastness and adventure. (Why would you prefer this?)</p>


<p>Some people are apprehensive about Prime 4 because of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-open-world-confirmed">a motorbike in a PS2 desert</a>, which is fair, I guess. I think it looks rad personally, and am excited for the prospect of more Prime. More of that slow-grow of knowledge and abilities, the weighty feeling of squelch and scrunch as you traipse through gorgeous biomes, the organic curve of alien architecture.</p>
<p>But also the pleasure of engaging with something so gorgeous and evocative that I might still think about its title screen 20 years later.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles features 23 Jobs with unique abilities that determine what each Job can do. With so many choices available and ample customization options, choosing the best Jobs to win battles with ease can be overwhelming. With our tier list, however, you can easily learn which Jobs provide the highest damage and the best utility.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note: This Job Tier list is based on Enhanced Mode’s Tactician difficulty, but the ranking is largely applicable to other difficulty settings.</strong></em></p>

<figure><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles Job tier list. Created with <a href="https://tiermaker.com/">TierMaker</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>S</td><td>Top-tier Jobs. Extremely versatile, powerful, or broken. They excel in multiple roles and remain strong throughout the game.</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Strong Jobs. Very effective in most situations but slightly less versatile or powerful than S-tier. </td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Mid-tier Jobs. Situationally strong and useful.</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>Low-tier Jobs. Supportive with limited usability, but solid as secondary Jobs.</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>Bottom-tier Job. Outclassed by every other Job.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Ninja is among the best Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ninja</strong> - The king of physical damage. Thanks to its unrivaled speed growth and innate Dual Wield ability (allowing two attacks per turn), the Ninja can act first and deliver very high damage. In addition, the Dual Wield support ability is the most crucial skill for nearly every physical-focused endgame build. Its only drawback is its low HP, making it a glass cannon that constantly needs support.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Monk</strong> - An indispensable, versatile physical Job. The Monk is a self-sufficient Job that needs no weapons to deal massive damage, as its attacks scale with its excellent Physical Attack and Brave stats. Its Martial Arts skill set is among the game's best utility kits, offering free, instant-cast healing and MP regeneration (Chakra), resurrection (Revive), and ranged physical attacks (Aurablast/Shockwave).</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Arithmetician</strong> - One of the most broken Jobs in the game. Its unique Arithmetic skill allows for instant-cast, map-wide magic with zero MP cost, bypassing casting time and range limits. It requires heavy JP investment and a high-Faith unit, so it takes more effort to make it effective than Ninja and Monk. Although its damage has been nerfed in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, the Arithmetician is still a devastating Job that can clear entire maps solo with the proper setup.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Samurai offers superior versatility in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Samurai</strong> - A powerful hybrid job. While its physical attacks are standard, though they can be improved with the Doublehand Support Ability, the Iaido Job Command provides versatile magic-based abilities like area-of-effect healing, elemental damage, and buffs without consuming MP, at the potential cost of the katana used to activate the skill. Its signature Reaction Ability, Shirahadori, grants high evasion rates against physical attacks, making it a staple for any build.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Chemist </strong>- The most efficient support class in the game, available from the start. The Item Job Command has zero casting time and can instantly heal, restore MP, or revive allies from a distance, bypassing the Faith mechanics and casting times of spells. The Auto-Potion Reaction Ability and the Support Ability Throw Item are crucial for survivability, making the Chemist a great choice as a secondary Job as well.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Black Mage</strong> - The main offensive spellcaster in the game, specializing in high-damage, area-of-effect elemental magic. The Black Mage has the best Magic Attack growth among the standard magic-based Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, allowing its spells to deal massive damage throughout the adventure. Its main weakness is the long casting time, which may cause involuntary friendly fire. Its Magic Attack Up Support Ability is also essential for every other magic-based Job.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Time Mage</strong> - The master of turn manipulation. The Time Mage's abilities, such as Haste and Slow, are critical for gaining a decisive advantage. Support ability Swiftness is a fundamental ability for any serious spellcaster, although less than in other versions of the game due to faster casting time for some spells. The Movement Ability Teleport, which ignores height and terrain restrictions, provides excellent mobility that works great for most Jobs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Although far from being one of the best Jobs, the Dancer is a solid choice in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Geomancer </strong>- A highly versatile class that uses Geomancy, which are instant-cast spells tied to the terrain. These spells always hit, can inflict a variety of status effects, and scale off of both Physical Attack and Magic Attack while ignoring Faith, which is great for hybrid builds. The Attack Up Support Ability is an essential skill for all physical damage-based classes.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mystic </strong>- A magic caster specializing in Mystic Arts, spells that inflict status effects and permanently raise or lower a unit's Bravery and Faith stats. Although it falls off during the late game due to an optional, much better character, this Job works decently as a secondary Job for units with high Faith. The Defense Boost Support Ability also gives it better survivability on the frontlines.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Dancer </strong>- A special female-only class that uses Dance abilities to cast debuffs on all enemies with a 50% success rate. Though fragile and focused on support, some of the Dance abilities are extremely useful, such as Forbidden Dance to cause random status afflictions, and Last Waltz to reduce enemies' CT to 1. This makes the Dancer a solid choice in some scenarios where debuffing the enemy is more important than going straight for damage.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mime </strong>- A powerful but very situational Job that can learn no skill. The Mime's only action is to perfectly replicate the last non-Mime action taken by any friendly unit on the battlefield, which makes them devastating if paired with an Arithmetician, but also tricky to use in scenarios where one isn't available. Its excellent stat growth is offset by its high unlock requirements.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Dragoon </strong>- A physical fighter and excellent tank with high HP and access to heavy armor and shields. Their signature command, Jump, launches the unit into the air, making them untargetable for a short time before they come down for a powerful, high-range attack. Their low speed, Jump charge time, and lack of versatility, however, impact their usefulness compared to other physical-oriented Jobs that can deal more damage more quickly.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Summoner </strong>- A strong magic-based Job that can deal elemental damage at a wider AoE than the Black Mage. The high charge time of some spells and their high MP cost, however, require way more upkeep than the Black Mage, resulting in a still viable, but less effective Job.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mediator </strong>- A unique support-focused Job that provides buffs and debuffs via the Speechcraft abilities and can naturally equip Guns. Though essential for recruiting monsters, there are Jobs that do what it does in a more effective way. </li>
</ul>







<h3 id="h-c-tier">C Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Though generally useful, the White Mage is quickly outclassed by other Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>White Mage</strong> - A support-focused Job specializing in restorative and protective magic, offering single-target and AoE healing, defensive buffs, and even damage with the Holy spell. Although useful, a Magic Attack-focused Samurai build outclasses White Mages at what it does best, making it a good choice only for some experimental builds, like a Dragoon hybrid build that takes advantage of its solid speed growth to make Jump more effective.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Knight </strong>- A durable physical job with high HP, strong Physical Attack, and access to heavy armor and shields. The Arts of War abilities have some utility in certain scenarios, but other Jobs are more effective at debuffing without engaging enemies head-on. Also, a late-game special character's unique skills completely outclass the Arts of War abilities with guaranteed success, relegating endgame Knights to being tanks and not much else.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Thief</strong> - A high-speed, high-mobility Job whose Steal command is the only way to obtain some rare weapons and gears. Due to their low damage output and low HP, the Thief Job is a mediocre main Job, and works best as a secondary Job for other, better Jobs that can take better advantage of the Steal command and Movement +2 ability. </li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Squire</strong> - The starting job for all male units and the foundation for all physical melee classes, the Squire Fundamentals abilities can be put to great use by other Jobs, such as Focus for a Job like Monk. JP Boost, which increases Job Point gain, and Movement +1 are solid abilities for any Job, making the Squire a great secondary Job even in the late game. Its unspecialized nature and limited gear selection, however, make it a good choice as a main Job only at the beginning of the game.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Bard </strong>- A special male-only class that uses Songs to cast buffs on all friendly units. Although not too different from the Dancer in function, debuffs have far more utility, making this Job worthwhile mainly to learn the Movement +3 ability, or in some special challenge runs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-d-tier">D Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Even with some buffs, the Archer remains one of the worst Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Archer</strong> - As the only Job capable of equipping Bows, the Archer can extend its attack range with height. Unfortunately, this Job falls off very quickly even during the early game, due to its average Aim Job Command, which requires time to charge an attack to deal increased damage, and the low damage of Bows and Crossbows. The Concentrate Support Ability, which prevents attacks from being evaded, and Adrenaline Rush Reaction Ability, which increases speed when the unit receives damage, have some utility, but they are too little to prevent the Archer from being the worst Job in the game.</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-is-reportedly-preparing-to-launch-a-free-version-of-xbox-cloud-gaming-with-ads.1315900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It seems that after hiking the prices for Xbox Game Pass by 50%, Microsoft isn't done making changes to its Xbox gaming services, as a new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">The Verge</a> alleges that a new free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming is currently being internally tested, with a public test to be announced soon. The catch to this version being free is, unexpectedly, it'll be free *with ads.</p>



<p>How it'll work, according to The Verge, is that players will be able to stream free-to-play games, some games that players own, and a collection of Xbox Retro Classic titles. How the ads will work is that players will have to sit through two minutes of ads before they can stream a game, and they'll reportedly only get five free hours per month, in one-hour sessions.</p>



<p>It'll be available on PC, consoles, and handheld devices. The first public beta test is apparently coming "<em>soon</em>," with its full release set to be out "<em>in the coming months</em>."</p>



<p>We've had hints that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-vp-hints-at-more-affordable-xbox-cloud-gaming/">Microsoft is looking to make Cloud Gaming "<em>more affordable</em>"</a> before, which could easily be seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">as the new price changes for Xbox Game Pass</a>. Yes, the price for the service went up by 50%, but you no longer have to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate to use Xbox Cloud Gaming, and can stream games through the cloud from the cheapest Essential tier.</p>



<p>This would go a step further, though it's worth considering who would be satisfied with one-hour sessions and a total of five hours across the span of a month. It feels like the kind of restriction that wouldn't exactly satisfy anyone who would want to stream games in the first place, pushing them to simply get an Essential Game Pass subscription for a reasonable experience.</p>



<p>Regardless, even with this tier being free, it's doubtful this would be met with enthusiasm and positivity from players. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">console price hike</a>, followed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">removal of cost-saving features</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">discounts for subscribers</a>, now likely followed by more ads being pushed in front of players just trying to play some games don't exactly make for a winning public reception. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-streaming-free-ad-supported-report-price-increase-2000631520</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Xbox is reportedly close to announcing a new ad-supported version of its game streaming service. Apparently, Microsoft has been internally testing ad-supported cloud streaming with employees, letting them play games without a <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">Game Pass</a> subscription.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">On October 3,<em> The Verge</em> reported</a> that sources familiar with Microsoft’s future plans have confirmed with the outlet that the tech giant will soon announce a new way to stream Xbox games without a Game Pass subscription. Currently, you need a Game Pass subscription to stream Xbox games. This new free streaming option will reportedly feature pre-roll ads that will appear before playing a game.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Xbox about this report.</p> <p><em>The Verge</em> further reports that sources with knowledge of the internal testing of the service say these ads are about two minutes long. There’s also a limit of one hour per session and about five hours max a month, though this might change if and when the service is rolled out to the public. It sounds like this upcoming free ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming will let folks stream some games you already own, some other select eligible games, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-retro-classics-app-activision-blizzard-games-free-1851781736">retro titles</a>.</p>

 <p>This new ad-supported free streaming option will be available on Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. Reportedly, Microsoft is planning to test out this new option via a public beta. A full rollout of the service will happen in the months that follow.</p> <p>It’s been a not-so-great week for Xbox Game Pass. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">On Wednesday</a>, Xbox announced a massive price increase for all tiers of Xbox Game Pass while also completely reorganizing and renaming parts of the popular subscription service. In doing so, Xbox made everything a bit worse and more expensive. The gaming giant also quietly announced that, unlike all other Xbox first-party games, future <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483"><em>Call of Duty</em> games would not migrate to Game Pass Standard within a year of launch</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228">This all follows in the wake of Xbox raising the price of its consoles last month</a>, which was&nbsp;the second Xbox console price hike to happen in 2025.</p>

            <p>Following its early access launch, Skate's first season will arrive next week, bringing new areas, events, challenges, and more.</p>
<p>Called Hesh &amp; Fresh, the first season is inspired by the '90s and will run from 7th October until 2nd December.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-six">mentioned last month</a>, the season will bring an updated lighting system to ensure the city of San Van is "more grounded and lived in", while the skate.Pass allows players to earn in-game seasonal currency (called Tix) with which to purchase cosmetic rewards.</p>

<p>Two events will be added this season. The first is Skate-o-Ween, based on Halloween (obviously) but with an emphasis on amusing outfits. It'll run from 21st October to 11th November.</p>
<p>That will be followed by the 7-Ply Maple Harvest from 18th November until 2nd December, calling back to the 70s and the wood used for skateboard construction at that time.</p>
<p>Both events will have community parks updated in celebration, as well as themed cosmetics.</p>
<p>The season will also add 40 new challenges rotating weekly, new brands in the in-game store, and 21 new songs from 90s artists like Bad Religion, Dinosaur Jr., Ice Cube, and more.</p>
<p>Skate arrived in early access last month and has so far proven a success, in particular with players sharing their stunts on social media. It proved especially popular on its first day, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-players-stuck-in-lengthy-queues-for-online-only-skate-those-who-made-it-in-are-comparing-its-bouncing-belly-flopping-traversal-to-mario-64">leading to lengthy queues</a>.</p>
<p>"After an absolute age, EA's wheelie classic is back with great handling and a whole world of slightly jarring niceness," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-early-access-review">Skate early access review</a>.</p>
<p>Skate is published by EA, which this week announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">planned private acquisition by a group of investors</a> including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in a private transaction worth $55bn.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed what you can expect from the first season of free-to-play skateboarding sim&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>when it arrives next week, and there are a ton of new cosmetics up for grabs, plus more.</p>

<p>As detailed in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/skate-season-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's official blog, the first season of&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>will bring two seasonal events with it, as well as "a little makeover" for San Vansterdam, lots of new challenges and objectives for you to pursue, and, of course, a brand new battle pass.</p>

<p>First up, it's the first of two seasonal events, Skate-o-Ween. It's San Vansterdam's annual Halloween celebration, but EA says it's "less focused on the spookiness" and "more about getting a chuckle out of someone". It runs from October 21st to November 11th.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-season-1-details-skating.jpg?itok=9GkDyJ_V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-season-1-details-skating.jpg?itok=x-M6o5tQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skate</em>'s first season is bringing new stuff galore next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The second big event this season is the 7-Ply Maple Harvest, which begins on November 18th and ends on December 2nd. Both events will feature updated community parks, plus new themed cosmetics you can grab either via in-game challenges or by visiting the Extravert Shop.</p>

<p>Completing seasonal events will earn you event currency, and you can then use that currency to grab special cosmetic items. EA says it'll have more info about both events before they go live in&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>.</p>

<p>Season 1 will also bring new general cosmetics for you to earn outside of the specific seasonal events, but of course, the battle pass will have both a free and a premium track, and you'll have to cough up some cash if you want to get premium items.</p>

<p>It's not all about spending money, though; several new music tracks are also being added for Season 1, including the likes of Bad Religion's "Against the Grain", Jane's Addiction's "Stop!", and Gang Starr's "Full Clip", among others.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/skate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/skate-game-preview/9PHF9K5Q6ZLZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and its first official season kicks off on October 7th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is getting ready to announce an ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell <em>The Verge</em> that the software maker has started testing ad-supported games streaming internally, allowing employees to play select titles free without a Game Pass subscription.</p><p>I understand that the free ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming will include the ability to stream some games you own, as well as eligible <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/tag/free-play-days/">Free Play Days</a> titles, which let Xbox players try games over a weekend. You’ll also be able to stream <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/672037/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-activision-retro-classics">Xbox Retro Classics</a> games.</p><p>Sources tell me the internal testing includes around two minutes of preroll ads before a game is available to stream for free through Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft is also currently testing a limit of one hour for sessions, with up to five hours free a month. These limits may well change when the service is officially launched.</p><p>The ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming version will be available on PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices, and via the web. Microsoft is planning to test free streaming through a public beta test soon, before launching it fully in the coming months.</p><p>Microsoft’s free streaming test comes in the same week that the company expanded Xbox Cloud Gaming access to its Xbox Game Pass Premium and Essential plans for the first time, as part of a revamp to Game Pass and a 50 percent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/790658/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-console-price-hikes-notepad">price hike for Ultimate subscribers</a>.</p><p>Xbox Cloud Gaming also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789461/xbox-cloud-gaming-launch-1440p-resolution-bitrate-changes">came out of beta</a> this week.

            <p>It's inching closer to last thing UK time on a Friday, so my job is to bring you the single most devastating and depressing bit of news I can to get the weekend started right. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/building-relationships">Building Relationships</a>, the funky little game in which you play a house in search of a romantic connection with another building, has had its full release delayed to early 2026.</p>
<p>See, I told you it'd be devastating. A few months' extra wait until you can engage in more vaguely flirty banter with a windmill. I knew I should have insisted we develop some embeddable tissues which could be inserted into articles.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It was a tough decision, but I wanted to give more time for the game to breathe -- to polish on the narrative and ensure that the game feels smooth," developer Tanat Boozayaangool wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2666920/view/526481129361900884?l=english">Steam post</a> about the delay. "I want to tell a meaningful story through this game, but right now, everything feels rushed. I'm thankful for the reception on this game so far, grateful for all the opportunities that the community has enabled for me.</p>
<p>"But looking at the game as a whole, it just needs a lil bit more time. This will also give the team time to work through bugs, optimization, and accessibility features to ensure that we launch with the best version of Building Relationships. Rest assured, that the end is in sight: the story arc has been set, the plot determined -- I just need to give it a bit more polish."</p>
<p>They then shared a teaser image of the player building sitting next to a windmill in a garden. COME ON, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING THE ADDED WAIT EASIER.</p>
<p>I digress. While I played the Steam demo for Building Relationships (which is still live if you want to dive in) after reading some <a href="https://www.vg247.com/building-relationships-steam-next-fest-demo-made-me-crush-on-a-windmill">Next Fest coverage Oisin wrote about it</a> back when both of us were at brash and occasionally funny RPS sister site VG247, both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/building-relationships-is-a-short-hike-but-you-are-trying-to-chat-up-toy-houses">Edwin</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-am-happy-to-report-that-building-relationships-has-more-than-one-joke-and-most-of-them-are-pretty-good">Nic</a> have also written about it here. Here's an except from the former's piece that neatly sums out what the game's all about:</p>
<blockquote>Building Relationships stands out the most in hindsight because it felt the most at ease in its own skin and also, because it's not every day you get to chat up a small apartment building. (I personally wouldn't date an apartment building because all the ones I've lived in had mold, but this one had a certain forlorn charisma, reminiscent of that friend who's too busy pairing off everybody else to find love himself.) It's a pocket open worlder with boisterous katamari physics in which you bounce about fluttering your curtains at bungalows and completing very simple quests, such as fishing (in this case, for cars). It is a game wholly invested in the act of enjoying a pun, which is surely the definition of a promising first date. It has pleasantly daft writing, blossoming biomes that remind me of Proteus a bit, and some amusing camera angle choices during conversation.</blockquote>
<p>Right, I'm off to try and distract myself until early next year with some non-building related puns.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! It’s Friday, and I’m so happy because today is my last day before I go off on a two-week vacation. But before I leave, I have one more Morning Checkpoint for you all. Yup, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other cool stuff is back again, and this time we’re looking into the rumored <em>Halo</em> remake, mourning the death of AOL dial-up, and preparing for so many damn games to launch in October. Enjoy, and I hope you get to go on a vacation very soon. You deserve it.</p> <h2><strong>Amazon is erasing guns from old James Bond posters</strong></h2> <p>Here’s something strange. Amazon, the new owners of the James Bond franchise, are allegedly digitally erasing guns out of old promo images of various Bond actors and using those censored images on Prime Video. <a href="https://hmssweblog.wordpress.com/2025/10/03/altered-007-images-raise-fan-concern-about-amazon/">This was documented by 007 fan blog <em>The Spy Command,</em></a> and it’s all really silly, with some images simply cropped to hide a gun and others changed more drastically. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/philnobilejr.bsky.social/post/3m2c4ko55zc2j">There’s also evidence that some of the images are being tweaked using AI tools.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <h2><strong>The rumored <em>Halo </em>remake is reportedly being developed by the <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> company</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/10/02/rumor-halo-ce-remake-co-devleoped-by-a-virtuous-studio/">As first reported by YouTuber Mr.Rebs and corroborated by XboxEra</a>, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-remake-ps5-xbox-1851523975">previously reported but not yet announced remake of the original <em>Halo</em></a> is allegedly being developed by Abstraction Games, a studio owned by Virtuous.&nbsp; Virtuous is the same studio that developed this year’s smash hit RPG, <em>Oblivion Remastered.</em></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Payday 3</em>‘s promised offline mode has been canceled</strong></h2> <p><em>Payday 3</em> launched in 2023 to negative reviews, and players flocked back to <em>Payday 2 i</em>nstead. Since then, the devs have been trying to improve the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/payday-3-solo-offline-mode-beta-update-june-27-heist-pc-1851560236">In June 2024</a>, the studio behind the game launched a pseudo-offline mode that still required the internet. At the time, it was called a “stepping stone” to a true offline mode. Well, that’s not actually going to happen after all.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/as-if-things-werent-bad-enough-payday-3-has-canceled-its-promised-offline-mode/">As reported by <em>The Game</em></a><em>r</em>, during a recent livestream,<em> Payday 3</em>&nbsp;general manager Jonas Skantz confirmed that the studio wasn’t planning to make a true offline mode, claiming that adding the fan-requested feature “is not feasible for where we are going with the game.”</p>

 <h2><strong>Five of the most wishlisted games on Steam are launching in October</strong></h2> <p>We’ve talked a few times about how October is going to be a month packed with video game releases. And here’s more evidence of that. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/buckle-up-five-of-the-most-wishlisted-games-on-steam-are-all-coming-out-this-month/">As spotted by<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> some of the most wishlisted games on Steam right now, including <em>Battlefield 6</em> and <em>Little Nightmares 3,</em> are all launching in October. Good luck out there, folks.</p> <h2><strong>AOL’s dial-up internet service is officially dead</strong></h2> <p>*SCREECHING NOISES* *DIFFERENT LOUD NOISES* *DEEE DEEE DDEEEEE DOO DOO DOOOOOOO* Okay, finally online. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/aol-dial-up-internet-shuts-down-08162912737f2fb221f10ba87ce5fc41">Now to look up news about my internet provider AOL, and oh no….</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-toasty-guy-from-mortal-kombat-has-left-the-studio-after-30-years-2000631151">The Toasty! guy from<em> Mortal Kombat</em> has left the studio after 30 years</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-sora-2-videos-pokemon-spongebob-dragon-ball-2000631137">OpenAI’s new video tool is producing slop featuring copyrighted characters like Goku</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-game-boy-build-masterpiece-mario-zelda-2000631059">Hey, the new Lego Game Boy is awesome and not very expensive</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>Microsoft is gearing up to announce an ad-based version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, according to a new report. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge's sources</a> said Microsoft is now testing an ad tier for the streaming service, with employees trying it out now before it may launch publicly for everyone.</p><p>The report said the free ad-based tier for Xbox Cloud Gaming will allow players to stream "some" of the games they already own, along with select titles from the "Free Play Days" promotion that allows people to play select titles on weekends at no cost. Xbox Retro Classics titles may be included, too.</p><p>In terms of the ads themselves, the report said the current iteration has people watching two minutes of preroll ads before jumping into a game. The report also mentioned that there could be streaming limitations, including a cutoff of one-hour sessions each and up to five hours for free each month. It's possible things change before the ad-based program goes live, if it does at all.</p><p>The Xbox Cloud Gaming version with ads is said to be in the works for PC, Xbox, handheld devices, and internet browsers.

                <p>So, you're bored at work, probably sitting in front of your computer scrolling nothing to look busy. (Did I just snitch on myself?) Maybe you'd rather be playing Sucker Punch Productions' new samurai fantasy sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>, but you've got however many hours until you get home. Well, if you wanted to make the wait easier, you should definitely check out the recently released "Music from Watanabe Mode" soundtrack. It's a total vibe.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei is the PlayStation 5-exclusive sequel to 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. Many things in Yotei are similar to Tsushima, but there are a few differences. One of them is the newly introduced Watanabe Mode, a collaboration with Samurai Champloo director Shinichirō Watanabe that features original lo-fi music created under his direction. You could only listen to these beats on your PS5 if you selected Watanabe Mode--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-brings-back-kurosawa-mode-adds-new-modes-from-samurai-film-directors/1100-6533108/" data-ref-id="1100-6533108">one of three playable options</a> based on samurai film directors like Akira Kurosawa and Takashi Miike--but now, Sony has dropped the soundtrack on music streaming services.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_EoEz8oFso" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4_EoEz8oFso" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Released on October 3--one day after Yotei hit PS5--<a href="https://ghostofyotei.lnk.to/watanabe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the "Ghost of Yotei - Music from Watanabe Mode - EP"</a> houses nearly 30 minutes of chill beats to kill (time) to. You can listen to it just about everywhere: Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, Pandora, YouTube Music, and a streaming service I've never heard of called Deezer.</p><p>It's a real chill vibe. If you're familiar with Samurai Champloo and the artists Watanabe collaborated with for that legendary anime's soundtrack, then you know what to expect from this brisk but banging EP. It could fit right in with an episode of SamCham, and really brings that lowkey energy to Yotei's vengeful scenarios. It's a nice juxtaposition between the serious and the calm.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launched on PlayStation 5 to generally favorable reviews from critics. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a>, writer Richard Wakeling awarded it a 9/10, saying it "builds and improves upon its predecessor with a gripping story, rewarding exploration, and fantastic combat, with each aspect emphasizing the characteristics of a new protagonist." Now that it's finally out, we've been busting ass on a bunch of guides to make your time in 1600 Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido, Japan) easier. This includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-weapons-locations-guide/2900-7098/" data-ref-id="2900-7098">where all the weapons are</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-best-skills/2900-7091/" data-ref-id="2900-7091">the best skills to unlock</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-wolf-den-locations/2900-7102/" data-ref-id="2900-7102">how to find all the wolf dens</a>, and more, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/which-ghost-of-yotei-mode-should-you-play/2300-6466416/" data-ref-id="2300-6466416">which mode you should play</a>. (You want my opinion? Play Watanabe Mode. It's perfect.)</p>
