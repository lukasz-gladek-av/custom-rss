But a post shared on the official <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> X account earlier today says it’s been released “in response to the crashes and graphical bugs” reported by players.</p><p>Following the PS5 update released September 12th (24.06-10.00.00), people playing <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>and some other games, like <em>Star Wars Outlaws, Death Stranding</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em>, reported stutters and other issues. In<em> Final Fantasy, </em>players reported game crashes while loading save files or fast-traveling. Others experienced severe graphical issues, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/1fhe841/do_not_play_ff16_on_performance_mode_what_is_this/">black squares that would end up covering</a> large portions of the screen, making the game unplayable. </p><p>At the time, <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1835956338180214969">Square Enix said it was working</a> with Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) to determine what was causing the bugs and encouraged players to wait for further updates.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The flights through the darkness only existing as a very involved load screen. But there’s fun to be had out there! It’s a good idea to spend some time in the captain’s seat of the Trailblazer.<br></p><p>Once you’re in orbit, you’ll note several points of interest on your map, most of which you can interact with in some way. There’s loot to uncover, opponents to dogfight, and space stations to infiltrate. If you’re struggling to spot them, hit R3 to have more details highlighted.</p><figure id="" data-id="896de0c10636e473557eec6cc5b9ebfd" data-recommend-id="image://896de0c10636e473557eec6cc5b9ebfd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spotting loot locations on the map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spotting loot locations on the map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="896de0c10636e473557eec6cc5b9ebfd" data-recommend-id="image://896de0c10636e473557eec6cc5b9ebfd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spotting loot locations on the map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Wrecks</strong>: The left-behind wrecks of varying-sized starships provide easy pickings for the thief with a keen eye for loot.

You’ll need to be willing to fight through enemy fighters, the occasional cruiser, and the debris fields that often accompany the point of interest.</li><li><strong>Stations</strong>: The orbit around each of the game’s planets features a space station or two—typically controlled by the Imps—where you can find high-end loot and stealth gameplay opportunities. Quests may take you to the stations before exploration does, though.</li><li><strong>Terminals</strong>: Let’s assume you picked clean the wrecks and landmarks—the factions and Imperials won’t like that, and they’ll likely send enforcers to your position.

As you’re minding your own business, exploring the stars, and looting leftovers from the various wrecks, you’ll find roaming pirates, faction starfighters, and Imperial cruisers constantly vying for sector control. You can’t avoid a dogfight. But you can end it early by learning to become an ace pilot.<br></p><p>You’ll primarily take the offensive with your Laser Cannons, which have a significantly shorter cooldown than your backup Missile Launcher. Thankfully, Laser Cannons automatically lock on to nearby enemies, giving you a clear target that tells you how far to lead your shots to land a hit. But Laser Cannons take time to cut down targets.<br></p><p>Your Missile Launcher makes quick work of nimble starfighters, but only if you land your shot. You can designate a target by hitting ‘A’ (Xbox) or ‘Y’ (PlayStation) on your controller to prep the missile, then the same button again to launch the ordinance. So long as you’ve locked on, the rocket will pursue your foe until it either explodes or fails to strike the target.<br></p><p>Don’t let up, though! Immediately after firing a rocket, continue pushing your advantage with your Laser Cannons or, ideally, the Laser Turret to take down enemies while your rockets refresh!<br></p><h2 id="h84283"><a id=""></a><strong>How to travel to other planets</strong></h2><p>Star Wars Outlaws features four expansive planets for you to explore, along with a fifth reserved solely for confined story experiences, and you can travel to each of them with your spaceship, the Trailblazer. But you won’t unlock your hyperdrive until you progress deeper into the game’s main story. For that, you must finish “The Wreck,” the seventh story mission.</p><p>Once you unlock the hyperdrive and it’s installed in the Trailblazer, take off from Toshara. Once in orbit, press right on your controller’s D-Pad to activate the hyperdrive. You’ll receive a list of the in-game planets available to jump to, and you can select any of them to visit next. Once chosen, press both analog sticks up to initiate the jump and soar through space and time to the next system! Why don’t you hit stuff at this speed? <em>Don’t ask that</em>.</p><h2 id="h84284"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t forget to upgrade the Trailblazer</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="3c6b81a25e7a0eb27b877cf2cd3f082d" data-recommend-id="image://3c6b81a25e7a0eb27b877cf2cd3f082d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrades screen for the Trailblazer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The upgrades screen for the Trailblazer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3c6b81a25e7a0eb27b877cf2cd3f082d" data-recommend-id="image://3c6b81a25e7a0eb27b877cf2cd3f082d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrades screen for the Trailblazer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While not completely necessary while exploring orbit around Toshara, you’ll want to eventually upgrade the Trailblazer with additional weapons, stronger armor, and a better hull and engine. You can still run into trouble around the game’s first planet, and more so down the line as you use the hyperdrive to explore the likes of Kijimi and Tatooine.<br></p><p>Thankfully, every major settlement in the game features one spaceship mechanic that will sell you upgrades. Like with the speeder bike upgrades, you must first accumulate credits and the necessary crafting components stemming from merchants or quest rewards.</p><p>Once you meet the requirements for an upgrade, we recommend focusing on Engines, Armor, Shield, and Laser Cannons. They’ll be the most worthwhile improvements and provide a noticeable boost to your power and survivability while flying the Trailblazer.</p><hr><p>Space travel in Star Wars Outlaws is more than just a way to get from planet A to planet B; it’s a useful distraction that rewards exploration and can help you find the materials you need for your next upgrade. It’s also an excellent way to kill some time while you wait for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-faq-pvp-spawns-servers-veteran-co-op-1851652630&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-faq-pvp-spawns-servers-veteran-co-op-1851652630">everything new coming to Space Marine 2 in the future</a></span>!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A new report has revealed the jaw-dropping sum of money that Microsoft reportedly spends each year to encourage third-party developers and publishers to bring their games to Xbox Game Pass.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-20/xbox-president-sarah-bond-predicts-the-future-of-microsoft-s-next-game-console?embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that, "Microsoft now spends $1 billion a year getting third-party games on the subscription service." The site said Microsoft offers "flat fees of millions of dollars upfront" to add titles from smaller publishers to Game Pass.</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an effort to get more details on this. Presumably Microsoft would pay more for a developer to bring a new release to Game Pass at launch compared to a licensing arrangement for an older title. </p><p dir="ltr">In 2021, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer spoken openly about how there is no one defined path for the deals it makes for Game Pass releases. He told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a> that Microsoft's Game Pass deals are "all over the place," and he understands that this might sound "unmanaged."</p><p dir="ltr">In some cases, Microsoft will completely fund the development costs of a game, and the studio can go sell their game on rival stores like PlayStation and Steam, or at retail, while Microsoft enjoys the benefit of having another Game Pass game. "For them, they've protected themselves from any downside risk. The game is going to get made. Then they have all the retail upside, we have the opportunity for day and date. That would be a flat fee payment to a developer," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">In other cases, a game might be finished, and then Microsoft works out a straight cash deal to bring it to Game Pass, Spencer said. Still, other deals involve usage and how much monetization a game has through in-game sales. If this all sounds like the Wild West, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/" data-ref-id="1100-6498307">it's because it is.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Spencer has been frank in acknowledging Microsoft doesn't have all the answers. "We're open [to] experimenting with many different partners, because we don't think we have it figured out. When we started, we had a model that was all based on usage. Most of the partners said, 'Yeah, yeah, we understand that, but we don't believe it, so just give us the money upfront,'" he said.</p><p>While Microsoft can pay smaller publishers big money to bring their titles to Game Pass, larger publishers don't always take the money or agree to put their titles on Game Pass, for any number of reasons. Strauss Zelnick, the head of GTA and Red Dead company Take-Two, told Bloomberg that putting its big games on Game Pass at launch doesn't make "any sense at all."</p><p>Zelnick has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">saying this for a long time</a>. Take-Two has, however, brought some of its older titles to Game Pass, including Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption II, though both have since rotated out of the catalog. Recently, Zelnick discussed Microsoft's decision to put Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass at launch, saying it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">will help drive Game Pass memberships, but only for a period of time.</a></p><p>Many have questioned the economic sustainability of launching brand-new games on Game Pass, and that's one of the reasons <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-defends-ps-plus-price-hike-explains-why-it-wont-put-games-there-day-one/1100-6518715/" data-ref-id="1100-6518715">why Sony doesn't launch new PlayStation games into PlayStation Plus.</a></p><p>In other Game Pass news, a new Standard tier of the service just launched, though it has some key differences between the other versions. For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-games-tiers/1100-6524825/" data-ref-id="1100-6524825">GameSpot's breakdown of all the Game Pass tiers. </a></p>

<p>"In Windblown, players will leap with speed through vast, ever-changing islands in the sky as they use a variety of powerful weapons to destroy the Sentinels – deadly minions of the Vortex that threaten their home," Motion Twin teases.</p>
<p>"Movement is simple yet precise, with dashes launching the player between floating islands and platforms, evading deadly Sentinel assaults, and advancing towards the player’s next inevitable encounter. From the first leap into the Autumn biome and beyond, players will overcome countless adversaries whilst picking up different Weapons, Trinkets, Gifts and Fish to help unleash their Leaper’s full potential."</p>
<p>Whilst we still don't yet have a firm release date, the end of the teaser reveals that Motion Twin still plan to release the game in early access on PC in 2024... and there's only three months left of 2024, of course.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developers-next-game-is-lightning-fast-combat-roguelite-windblown">Motion Twin's Windblown was announced at the end of last year</a>. Described as "tough but always fair", it's a combat-focused adventure - playable either solo or with up to three friends online - that casts participants as Leapers, warriors charged with protecting their home world, The Ark, from the deadly Vortex and its Sentinel minions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/20/concords-future-still-unknown-as-the-games-director-steps-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>‘s Director, Ryan Ellis, has stepped down following the game’s dire launch last month which ultimately resulted in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Sony pulling it from sale</a> and refunding everyone who purchased a copy.</p>
<p>Since being taken offline, there has been no communication as to what comes next for Concord or, more importantly, the staff at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a> impacted by its failure to sell copies. According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811">Kotaku</a>, who has spoken to sources within the development team, Ellis (who formerly worked at Bungie as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>‘s Creative Director) still remains at the company but will now adopt a supporting role.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Launch Trailer I PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQB_2FF2G1o?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While there are no doubt critical discussions being had in regards to the future of Firewalk and its flagship title, Sony’s radio silence has opened the door to rampant speculation. Having invested millions of dollars and years of development time into creating Concord, it seems unlikely that it would be completely abandoned, especially when you consider how fun the core game is. Despite the circumstances surrounding the game’s launch, it played really well with fun, frenetic first person shooting and interesting character loadouts. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord review</a> we scored it an 8/10 and were admittedly saddened to see the axe fall so soon, casting doubt over its promising future.</p>
<p>Although it was refreshing to see a multiplayer game eschew the heavily-monetised free-to-play model, it’s evident that fans of the genre weren’t willing to pay a one-time fee of £34.99 for a PvP-only video game. Pulling a U-turn and squeezing Concord into that F2P mould now seems like the most likely course of action though it won’t happen overnight. Firewalk would potentially need to consider which elements to lock behind a paywall, how to implement earned and premium in-game currencies, and whether future content should be rolled out in a monetised season pass.</p>

<p>Giving the game away to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> subscribers isn’t completely off the table, though it would leave a question mark over Concord’s PC version. Seeing how poorly it performed on Steam, would Sony abandon the platform completely to focus on its core PlayStation audience?</p>
<p>There’s also the possibility that Concord may never return and that Firewalk will now support other PlayStation Studios. Finally, there’s a grim chance of major layoffs and a scenario in which the developer is shut down entirely, given the tumultuous industry landscape right now.</p>
<p>We’re still hoping for the former outcome. There’s a great game in Concord and one that could reach the audience it deserves if smartly repackaged and relaunched at the right time.</p>

But there’s a bit of a twist, as there are actually three release dates to look out for.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As announced through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1836941948042555820&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1836941948042555820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show’s X</a></span> (formerly Twitter) account on September 19, the final season of <em>Arcane </em>will be airing on Netflix in three acts. The first act will be released on November 9, only a couple of days after the three-year anniversary of the show’s first season dropping on Netflix. The second act will follow a week later, on November 16, and the third a week after that on November 23. This release schedule follows the example of the first season which had three episodes in each act, and while we still don’t know exactly how many episodes each act of season two contains, it’s likely it will be the same.</p><p>Netflix does seem to love its staggered releases lately. Just this year, <em>Bridgerton </em>and <em>Emily in Paris </em>both divided their most recent seasons into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/netflixs-split-in-half-shows-are-now-less-relevant-than-ever/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/netflixs-split-in-half-shows-are-now-less-relevant-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-part events</a></span> that aimed to boost viewership and keep subscribers around. The streaming era has also caused a lot of debate about whether a week-to-week release schedule or dropping a show all at once is better. I think there are benefits to both, depending on the show, but as someone who has been waiting for three years to see how <em>Arcane </em>concludes, I have to say I just want it all right now.</p><p>In addition to dropping the release dates, Netflix did tease fans a bit more with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/netflix/status/1836933796890890548&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1836933796890890548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new clip</a></span>. This footage shows an in-depth look at the pit-fighter Vi we’ve seen hints of in trailers. After the events of season one, in which her relationships with both her sister and her newfound ally Caitlyn falter by show’s end, Vi is not in a good place. She’s drinking, getting the shit beat out of her, seeing visions of Caitlyn and her dead friends, all while we get to see Jinx look on in the crowd. It sets up the finale to be a pretty dark conclusion to the story of Vi, Caitlyn, and Jinx, and I couldn’t be more excited.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/frostpunk-2-s-developers-didn-t-want-it-to-be-a-jackass-simulator-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via 11-Bit Studios.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What's the purpose of letting players be cruel?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Well it's fun," most developers would say. That's a valid answer! Games with moral choices like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> give players the freedom to be good or evil because those are valid choices in the context of each adventure. Games are about acquiring power, and what is a villain if not one who lusts for power above everything else?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But 11-Bit studios has won praise time and time again for thinking about cruelty in a different way. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This War of Mine</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it explored the dark choices people make in times of crisis. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> carries forward that tradition, bringing players back to the frozen city of New London after it survived the events of the first game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now those choices come in a different context. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players struggled to survive a blizzard consuming the entire planet. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players must now decide what society will look like on this new snowy earth. Multiple factions (some moderate, some fanatical) lobby the player on different paths for the future. Each one contains the potential for immense harm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's 11-Bit's hope that players don't become desensitized to these choices—or that if they do, it helps them reflect on how people in power become so cold. The studio was determined—as Game director Jakub Stokalski put it—to not make the game a "jackass simulator."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/alone-in-the-dark-etrospective" target="_self">Shining a flashlight on Alone in the Dark, on the eve of its reinvention</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Frostpunk 2"><span>Frostpunk 2</span>'s Zeitgeist system measures moral values to force choices on the player</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stokalski is himself something of a fanatic—a fanatic for meaningful game design, that is. He's given </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1029351/The-Language-of-Gameplay-and">talks at events like Game Developers Conference</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about how developers should be taking advantage of what he calls a "new language" to explore ambitious ideas. "We have a unique opportunity to build playgrounds for players...but also to explore experience with more nuanced [values]," he said, gesticulating for emphasis. The power he said, is how developers can build values into game mechanics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, those mechanics are embodied in what 11-Bit Studios calls "the zeitgeist system." It's a system that interacts with the core survival mechanics of the game, which include faction sentiment, tension, heating needs, health, cleanliness, food supply, and crime. Keeping all of those elements in balance while exploring the Frostland is the basic element of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While variables like temperature drops and population growth can drive those numbers, the zeitgeist system upends players by forcing them to bounce the different faction's needs off each other. Each faction is given different values. The Evolvers want society to adapt to the new frozen world, while the Faithkeepers "seek ascension through technology," and want to build a "perfect" mega city in New London.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/preserving-the-past-with-charles-cecil-game-developer-podcast-ep-46" target="_self">Preserving the Past With Charles Cecil: Game Developer Podcast Ep. 46</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Evolvers frown on laws and tech tree updates that ease life in the city at the expense of expansion, and the Faithkeepers despise expansionary improvements. They express their approval or disapproval after the player completes certain quests, passes laws, or researches advancements in the tech tree.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "council" system is one Stokalski said 11-Bit is particularly proud of. It's a space for the conflicting values to directly clash, and push the player to wheel and deal for different votes, which keep the push-and-pull of managing New London moving along. "You end up basically [making] a parliament—which I hate by the way," he joked. "We are really making an effort to frame all of our political stuff in a way that is speaking to the core of what politics are, which is negotiating a common future, rather than the technicalities of [real-world] parliaments."</span></p><p>Image via 11-Bit Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are two fun design advantages the system offers. First, it opens the door for players to undo laws, something they couldn't do in the first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If they committed to an oppressive decision, there was no turning back for them. Factions demanding players revisit laws drive the upgrades that shape the state of the city are constantly upended.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-petals-preludes-texas-chainsaw-massacre-with-a-simple-photo-mode" target="_self">How Petals preludes Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a simple photo mode</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second has to do with the vote count itself. Most policies start with a mix of voters opposed to a law and in support of it, with the remainder "uncertain." Players can secure votes from factions by making promises, or just let it ride and see where the votes land. Instead of just spitting out a result, 11-Bit created a display that shows the votes being tallied up—creating visual tension as players wait to see if a vote succeeds or fails. It has the same energy as watching a dice roll in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just like real-world politics, there's a bit of exhilaration in watching the fate of society be decided before you.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How do you build your own Zeitgeist system?">How do you build your own Zeitgeist system?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experiencing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s Zeitgeist system is a thrill. One can see the hard work 11-Bit put in to keep the state of New London in constant tension. Even when things are going well and everyone is in harmony, there's a sense that any second </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>something</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will go wrong and the player be back at the table, scrambling to secure votes, or weighing whether they can afford to crush a protest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also sounds like it was hard as hell to make. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has been in development since 2020 (not counting early prototyping in 2019). 11-Bit switched among three game engines during the process. And because of how the studio operates, each early prototype and vertical slice needed a great deal more polish than what other games usually target, in order to express the "mood" the team is going for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even after the game direction and tools were set, the Zeitgeist system needed constant testing, as every new feature added complexity that upended existing work. Stokalski explained that 11-Bit did not hard-code certain kinds of decisions in for the factions, wanting every reaction and demand to be as emergent as possible. "It's about making sure whatever is driving the variability in your system is actually built into the system itself, rather than trying to play whack-a-mole with all the different problems that can happen," he said.</span></p><p>Image via 11-Bit Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the team ever wanted a faction to react a specific way to a decision, a custom quest would be created that would make clear to the player this was a hard negotiating point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making the system fun and coherent also sometimes showed the limits of Stokalski's passion for the "new language" of game design. Making the Zeitgeist system meant sacrificing many of the organic oddities that can spring out of relationships between ideological factions in the real world. The game doesn't express how the strange rules of legislative bodies like the American </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/17/1072714887/filibuster-explained">filibuster</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can shape the process for what kinds of laws can be passed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also can't fully capture the intentional hypocrisy of a "law and order" party </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/politics/trump-fbi-wray-analysis/index.html">turning on law enforcement agencies</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> when they are investigating its constituents and preferred candidate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that's the cost of making sure a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is compelling, and not just a half-hearted attempt to simulate reality.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cruelty in ">Cruelty in <span>Frostpunk 2</span> is not the point</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stokalski neatly broke down why enabling player cruelty is such a useful tool in game design: cruelty often represents player freedom, while pursuing the moral high ground sometimes means turning away from features or content in a game. "You only do evil stuff if you're doing it for fun," he observed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He doesn't mind those systems (they're just not the ones he wants to make), but he said if a game wants to explore morality, it would benefit from remembering "no one wants to be an evil person."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You don't set out to do evil things because you want to be evil, you set out to do these things because you are driven by a certain set of values," he said. "The trick is these values are not the same for everyone."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, doing evil deeds like starving a population, enabling torture, or condemning a faction to death are meant to emerge from whatever values are driving the player's strategy of managing society.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That would be the major difference from making it—as Stokalski called it—a "jackass simulator."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-on-pc-wants-64gb-ram-to-run-at-its-best/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you plan on playing Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on your PC <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/flight-simulator-2024-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it launches</a> in November, you should make sure you have a powerful enough PC. </p>



<p>Microsoft released the PC spec requirements for the game, and they can get quite beefy. </p>



<p>According to the release specs, Microsoft recommends players have at least a AMD Ryzen 7 2700X or Intel Core i7-10700K CPU, an AMD 5700 XT or Nvidia RTX 2080 GPU, and 32GB of RAM for the game. For an “ideal” experience, though, it’s suggested players have a Ryzen 9 7900X or i7-14700K CPU, an RX 7900 XT or RTX 4080 GPU, and a whopping 64GB of RAM in their machine. </p>



<p>There are lower minimum specs for players who just want to play on the lowest-available settings. Those require just a Ryzen 5 2600X or Core i7-6800X CPU, an RX 5700 or RTX 970 GPU, and just 16GB of RAM. So, if you’re worried about not being able to play it at all, you should be able to in some way if you have a remotely modern PC.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are concerned about being able to play it, the game will be available via Xbox Game Pass. That allows you to either play it with your subscription or, if you’re new, sign up for a trial to see if it’ll run before you make a purchase decision. </p>



<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">launches November 19</a> for Xbox Series and PC.</p>



<p>Are you going to have to upgrade your PC to play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024? Let us know in the comments, and take the discussion further in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">official Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

The controller's haptic feedback can be felt when hitting enemies with close-range weapons, and the adaptive triggers give off resistance when shooting with firearms. The controller's light bar are changes colors depending on the status of the player's HP. Since Silent Hill 2 is a horror game, the PS5's 3D audio is also highlighted.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill 2 - Immersion Trailer | PS5 Games</p>
      </div>
<p>The end of the trailer says that the game is a PS5 console exclusive, but in small text at the bottom reads, "Also available on PC. Not available on other formats until 10.8.2025." This means that it'll be at least a year from release until Silent Hill 2 can be released on other platforms like Xbox, and possibly even the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch successor</a> when it eventually comes out.</p><p>Silent Hill 2 launches on October 8 for PC and PS5. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/the-silent-hill-2-remake-is-significantly-better-than-the-trailers-youve-seen-gamespot-preview/2300-6464866/" data-ref-id="2300-6464866">Silent Hill 2 remake preview</a>, we said, "After spending about three hours with Silent Hill 2 Remake, I feel confident the puzzle-driven horror game will honor the original's tones and excite old fans while also creating plenty of new ones."</p>

			<p>There's a chance BioWare might release the Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creator ahead of launch, as other roleplaying games have done before (CAPCOM's Dragon's Dogma 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-character-creation-tool-is-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes to mind</a>). Game Director Corinne Busche said as much during a roundtable Q&amp;A at the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview event</a>:</p>
<p><em>It's a much-requested feature. We're TBD on that, but it would be pretty cool.</em></p>
<p>The character creator crafted by the developer for the game has received unanimous praise so far. In his hands-on, Kai wrote:</p>
<p><em>BioWare has invested a great amount of time into the character creation suite of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. For the player's own iteration of the Rook, players can change everything from the body type and pronouns down to freckles and hair growth. A player could easily spend a solid hour trying to come up with the perfect character, only to change their minds midway through the adventure. To remedy this, there is a magic mirror inside the main base of operations that serves as aesthetician and barber all in one.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>During the aforementioned Dragon Age: The Veilguard roundtable Q&amp;A, Corinne Busche also said about the character creator:</p>
<p><em>One of the things I might also add is of our three core design pillars, be who you want to be was the first, that was the starting point. We wanted everyone to feel like they belonged in this game to the best of our ability, we wanted that you could relate to the characters, so that meant sclera color. It meant cataracts. It meant vitiligo. Freckles. Respectful skin tones that react to light properly. I'm tremendously proud of the team and everything they put together to make sure that all of the players can feel seen, too.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launches on October 31 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-apparently-revealed.986991/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is, of course, published by Nintendo, but the Japanese gaming giant has been characteristically quiet about who's developing it. Luckily, it looks like some&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>fans have uncovered the truth.</p>
<p>As noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-seemingly-confirmed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by Eurogamer</a>, players who have pre-ordered&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>ahead of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced">its release next week</a>&nbsp;have spotted what appears to be the game's developer contained within the <a href="https://x.com/naetoru60/status/1836743459262116136" rel="noopener" target="_blank">copyright information</a> in the game's eShop listing.</p>
<p>Honestly, the developer behind&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as a surprise; it looks like it's Grezzo, the studio responsible for the 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening"><em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>remake</a>. The two games have virtually identical visual styles, after all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-desert.jpg?itok=1-cXiBGz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-desert.jpg?itok=AVp6SiE2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is being developed by Grezzo.</figcaption></figure><p>Nowadays, Nintendo is notoriously secretive about who's developing its games.&nbsp;<em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em>, which was released earlier this year, was developed by&nbsp;<em>Yoshi's Crafted World&nbsp;</em>studio Good-Feel, but Nintendo wasn't exactly enthusiastic to reveal that information.</p>
<p>Similarly, we still don't know exactly who's going to be developing the upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, which was revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-june-2024">during a Nintendo Direct earlier this year</a>. One thing's for sure, though: it won't be longtime developer AlphaDream, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-and-luigi-dev-alphadream-files-for-bankruptcy">declared bankruptcy in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly, Nintendo doesn't feel like it's under any obligation to reveal the developer of the new <em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game as part of its pre-release marketing blitz, but the absence of Grezzo's name from marketing materials is pretty disappointing, to say the least.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is the latest in the long-running&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>series. It combines the top-down perspective of classic&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games with the experimental gameplay of more recent entries like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>.</p>
<p>In a break from tradition, you'll play as Princess Zelda, who must save Link after he disappears into one of a number of rifts that suddenly appear around Hyrule.</p>
<p>Unlike Link, Zelda's not much of a direct fighter, so she'll fight indirectly by controlling enemies and using <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-swordfighter">her Swordfighter Form</a>. She can also conjure up objects to help her explore the world, and&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>takes a pretty freeform approach when it comes to where you can place those objects.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>launches for Nintendo Switch on September 26th. You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-brilliant-creative-player-freedom">check out our preview here</a> to find out how the latest&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game is shaping up.</p>

When I was making my character during a hands-on preview at publisher Electronic Arts’ Redwood City studio earlier this month, I started to wonder, if I wanted to get closer to a certain character, would it benefit me to choose that character’s Faction so we’d have common interests and history? I asked BioWare at the event and it sounds like while relationships won’t be locked behind your Faction, the shared background may bring new layers to some relationships.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

It seemed like a good place to start the game, as I knew the intro began in the Tevinter capital Minrathous, and the idea of being a freedom fighter in a magical cyberpunk city was a hook I could get behind. Then as I played through the opening hours, I met Neve Gallus, a detective in the city who also was part of the Shadow Dragons’ efforts to reform Tevinter. When we had a moment alone to chat, she remarked “you know me,” to which my Rook, who had known her for hours, at most, rightfully responded, “do I?” Neve said that we were both Shadow Dragons and from Minrathous, so even if we’d never met face-to-face, our work most certainly had.</p><p>I was able to respond that Shadows have to stick together in Tevinter, and I wondered at how many points throughout <em>The Veilguard</em> I’d be able to connect with Neve over our shared plight. That’s a common occurrence in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, as mage players can discuss their shared experiences with mage party members, or elves can get into debates with characters like Sera and Solas in <em>Inquisition</em> about their people’s history and future. Hell, in <em>Inquisition</em>, the Solas romance was exclusive to elven heroes. So, while at the hands-on preview, I asked creative director John Epler about how your Faction can affect relationships with your teammates, and it’s one of the multiple ways your Rook’s background affects your connections to others However, BioWare doesn’t want your Faction to block any potential romances or friendships.</p><p>“I wouldn’t say it makes for the deepest relationship [to be the same faction as a party member], it would be a different relationship,” Epler said. “We never want you to feel like, ‘if I want to romance this character, [I] have to be this,’ but you’ll get different content. That’s true of both faction, but it’s also true, for example, if you’re an elf and you talk to Bellara. You’re gonna have a very different conversation with the [elven] gods being out than if you are a human or a dwarf or qunari. Because there is that shared link. These are your gods out in the world versus for example, a dwarf or human and qunari who may have a lot of empathy and sympathy, but they’re not sharing the same experience. But again, it’s not more content, it’s just different content.”</p><p>So, there you have it. Your Faction won’t prevent you from entering into certain relationships, but it will give it a different <em>flavor</em>. Almost makes me want to be a Grey Warden so me and the handsome elven warrior Davrin can bond over our both being <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Calling&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Calling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doomed by the narrative</a></span>. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692">on October 31</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Concord's director, Ryan Ellis, has reportedly stepped down from his role at Firewalk Studios to move over to a support one while the studio's future remains unclear.</p><p>According to a report from <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Sony has not come to a decision on how or if it will continue with Concord yet.

            <p>
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's shock move to launch legal action against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> looks to hinge on a patent relating to how players throw Pokéballs. 
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo confirmed it was suing Palworld maker Pocketpair for the infringement of "multiple" patents</a> - but did not detail which ones. Later in the day, Pocketpair itself said it was still to hear which patents it stood accused of breaching.
</p>
<p>
Now, fingers are being pointed at a recent Pokéball-throwing patent jointly filed this summer by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. Indeed, the companies requested this patent was given an accelerated review process - perhaps in preparation for this legal action now. 
</p>
<p>
The detail here comes from Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara, speaking to <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/59f880c5e13b9292f0e3ab2d1d55ce8bdbfdb97f">Yahoo Japan</a> and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/whats-the-killer-patent-nintendo-is-suing-palworld-for-japanese-patent-attorney-offers-in-depth-analysis/">Automaton</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The patent in question describes how a character catches a Pokémon by aiming and throwing a capture item, like a Pokéball, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes "owned by the player". 
</p>
<p>
In Palworld, players catch Pals by aiming and throwing a capture item, named a Pal Sphere, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes owned by the player.
</p>
<p>
"[It's a] killer patent," Kurihara said. "It seems like it would be hard to avoid if you want to make a Pokémon-like game, and it's easy to infringe if you're not careful."
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/20240920-37391.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Patent No. 7545191, owned by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
While filed this summer, Kurihara highlighted this patent had been filed onto a pre-existing "parent" patent filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in December 2021, preceding Palworld's launch. This means it could indeed be used in a patent battle with Palworld now. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld has been dogged by suggestions it has copied Pokémon since launch, though many of the comparisons between the two franchises have focused on the similarity of many monster designs. This - something more likely to be covered by a copyright complaint - does not seem to be Nintendo's tactic here.
</p>
<p>
While interest in Palworld has tailed off since its stratospheric lauch, when 25 million players tried the game, Nintendo will likely be eyeing future developments carefully. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-community-manager-teases-ps5-version">PlayStation version of Palworld looks set to launch at some point</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-signs-sony-deal-to-expand-franchise-beyond-video-games">Sony has invested in Pocketpair to help set up Palworld Entertainment</a>, a division designed to expand the brand beyond the world of gaming. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for more detail, as Pocketpair awaits to hear the details of what it has been accused of.
</p>
<p>
"[Pocketpair's] statement does imply that the final complaint (which should list the patents allegedly infringed) has not been delivered/filed yet," video game legal expert Richard Hoeg told Eurogamer. "First thing defendant gets to know in every jurisdiction is what they are alleged to have done. So they may have received notice that they are a named party, but not the complaint itself."
</p>
<p>
For its part, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">Pocketpair has said it intends to fight the lawsuit</a> to battle what it perceives is an attack on its creativity on behalf of other indie developers. There's concern, too, among Palworld fans over whether the lawsuit could see the game removed from sale - in Japan, or worldwide. 
</p>
<p>
"The reach of Japanese patent law ends at Japan's borders," said Lisa Phillips, an IP and patent attorney with Fisch Sigler LLP in Washington DC. "Which means there won't be any immediate impact of a decision in that court on Palworld's US operations. Of course, Nintendo, which has substantial intellectual property rights in the US could also bring suit against Palworld here, too."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/20/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review-bombed-over-controversial-sony-policy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Almost a couple of years after its original PS5 release, Sony’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a> PC port is finally here and it’s getting review bombed by angry gamers on Steam. At the time of writing, it sits on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2322010/God_of_War_Ragnark/">a “mixed” 65% user rating</a>. The reason behind this? While there’s nothing inherently wrong with the deity-bashing sequel, Sony’s recent policy of requiring a PlayStation Network account to access its PC titles isn’t going down too well.</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Ragnarök - Launch Trailer | PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBwxyqq1ON4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Given that God of War Ragnarok is a singleplayer-only game, many are questioning why a PSN sign-up is required as there’s no essential online or multiplayer component. There are also concerns that Steam users in parts of the world where PSN isn’t available simply won’t be able to witness the end of Kratos’s saga despite having purchased and played the original game on PC.</p>
<p>So, why is Sony pushing this requirement so hard? The likely answer is that with so many of its cherished first party games popping up on PC, its looking to draw this player base into its wider PlayStation ecosystem – something the company will no doubt utilise as it introduces new hardware and gaming services further down the line.</p>
<p>Still, the PSN signup requirement is a hurdle some die-hard PC players aren’t willing to navigate. It doesn’t help that Sony negatively impacted the reputation of its celebrated bug hunting shooter, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, by implementing its controversial policy post-launch earlier this year. Players who had already purchased the game were hit with a warning that they needed to obtain a PlayStation Network account to continue playing.</p>

<p>As the company continues to convert its coveted exclusives for PC, it will be interesting to see whether this furore dies down over time. The review bombing casts a dark albeit small cloud over what is one of the strongest open world action games of the current console generation.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/03/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War Ragnarok review</a>, we said, <em>“Kratos has come a long way since first flinging himself into the Aegean all those years ago.God of War, as a series, has come a long way too, pushing the boundaries of hack and slash action to their goar-soaked limits, then breaking free of a years-long slumber to become one of the biggest names in modern gaming. As our own winter approaches, God of War Ragnarok makes for the perfect adventure to lose yourself in.”</em></p>
<p>Since the game launched at the end of 2022, it has since received a meaty free <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/god-of-war-ragnarok-free-valhalla-dlc/">Valhalla update</a>, adding a wealth of new content and features.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/chef-rpg-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are many subgenres in the RPG space, but "cooking RPG" is a woefully underserved category. The world of cooking RPGs just got a little bigger, and we'll tell you what makes this new game so special in our&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;preview.</p>
<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="44cf653b-58ac-4749-a3eb-f1c6caec42ff" href="https://techraptor.net/games/chef-rpg"><em>Chef RPG</em></a>&nbsp;puts gamers in the shoes of a trained chef who has recently taken over an abandoned restaurant. You're tasked with restoring these hallowed halls of cuisine to their former glory while also sharpening your cooking skills and helping the town get back on its feet. There's a lot to love in this unique game, but it also has its fair share of stumbles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chef-rpg-preview-charcoal-grill-minigame.jpg?itok=fVNMNmeZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chef-rpg-preview-charcoal-grill-minigame.jpg?itok=4ZFQxOKy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every cooking station has an associated minigame, and these minigames can get quite complex — but that's part of the fun.</figcaption></figure><h2>Cooking Up Something Special</h2>
<p>The simplest way to explain&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;is to compare it to&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="98bb9fc6-d071-4d2f-9670-92bbc1934cec" href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>, but with one small change: swap out the importance of farming for cooking. Cooking is a side activity in farming RPGs; in&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>, farming is the side activity and cooking is the star of the show.</p>
<p>Cooking's central role should come as no surprise. It's your main story motivation and, indeed, the best way that you can make money. No amount of foraging for wild berries or digging around in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55aa35e9-ac63-45d6-826b-4a4f88b9017a" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-mining-guide-how-to-get-into-caves">the mines</a> can equal the kind of Credits that you can pull in by filling the stomachs of your customers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, cooking ain't easy. You'll only have a couple of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7066a12f-a028-4b79-a6f5-07deebfbd349" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-cooking-guide-how-to-beat-minigames">cooking stations</a>, a few recipes, and some donated ingredients to get started. You'll need to slowly build up your money so you can expand your operations with more tables, chairs, equipment, and ingredients.</p>
<p>This certainly isn't a cozy, laid-back game. All cooking is done via minigames that require precise rhythm and timing. You're under constant time pressure as the day wears on. Get the job done right and you'll fill your pockets with money. Screw up too many times, however, and you'll barely turn a profit while sullying the burgeoning reputation of your revived restaurant.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chef-rpg-preview-talking-with-mae-lou-at-greenstalk.jpg?itok=vvFTrdPb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chef-rpg-preview-talking-with-mae-lou-at-greenstalk.jpg?itok=nsFiu7xv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shopkeepers carry a random assortment of limited items every day. It's a good idea to design your menu to avoid using too much of any one ingredient.</figcaption></figure><h2>Supply Chain Shortages</h2>
<p>As you might expect, a big part of&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;is collecting the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="205074bb-53be-40cd-b9fc-38776df855a3" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-ingredients">ingredients</a> you need to cook your recipes. The Early Access launch version, however, is a little too difficult in this respect.</p>
<p>Let's start with the shopkeepers. Shopkeepers will only carry a few random ingredients every day; it's entirely possible to find that an item you sorely need is out of stock, especially if it's a rarer quality item. You can increase the quantity and quality of items in a shop by becoming friends with the shopkeeper, but this won't happen overnight.</p>
<p>You could, of course, hunt animals and forage. This is a good way to supplement your supplies; however, it's impractical to do this every day. Some items can't be foraged at all and must instead be grown in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6846f4a-247f-4421-a02b-8e0db576251b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-farming-guide-how-to-grow-food">your greenhouse</a> or produced with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1bba44a8-f0e0-4626-bb5e-e429695e4616" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-brewing-guide-how-to-make-drinks">brewing</a> machinery (in the case of alcohol).</p>
<p>Eventually, you'll be able to unlock the ability to get deliveries from shopkeepers, but these are limited, too; you can only get six types of items from each shopkeeper and no more than 20 of those item, five days a week. That sounds like a lot, but you can easily go through more than 20 Elk Rib or Asparagus in a long cooking session.</p>
<p>That leaves you with two options: you can either carefully craft your menu to use a wide range of ingredients so you don't run out of any one thing too fast, or you can supplement your daily deliveries by buying items from the shops — shops that are already delivering to you every day — and foraging for what you can in the wilderness.</p>
<p>I understand the intent behind the design here — having a steady supply of ingredients is important for any restaurant and it's the same in&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>. The limitations of the system as it's implemented at launch are far too unforgiving for anyone who wants to run a large menu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chef-rpg-preview-milo-hinting-at-his-favorite-gift.jpg?itok=z-Nk_H2d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chef-rpg-preview-milo-hinting-at-his-favorite-gift.jpg?itok=1DrKeti9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Give a character too many incorrect gifts and they'll give you some hints about what they might like instead.</figcaption></figure><h2>Occasionally Undercooked</h2>
<p><em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;has its fair share of bugs and mistakes like any Early Access game. Some of these bugs are minor, some are severe, and some are downright comical.</p>
<p>Many of the silliest mistakes come down to spelling. The refrigerator in your restaurant is a main feature of the game that you'll look at every single day, and yet somehow the developer missed that it was incorrectly spelled "refridgerator" at launch. A forgivable mistake, yes, but this was just one of many spelling and grammatical errors.</p>
<p>There are lots of little hiccups here and there. You'll occasionally have to walk away from an object because you can't interact with it. Sometimes, menus just refuse to close altogether. NPCs won't actually leave or enter an area until you leave it and reload that area into memory.</p>
<p>One of the biggest bugbears in my 60+ hours of gameplay, though, was <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6a0f825d-e922-4316-a025-c47a729b4213" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-research">the research system</a>. Each research facility has two cooking stations that you need to interact with and it was impossible to interact with them most of the time. A prompt appeared and I furiously tapped the interact button from every conceivable angle, but sadly, they were well and truly broken.</p>
<p>Bugs like these are an annoyance to be sure. To the developer's credit, none of the bugs I encountered were show stoppers (save for the problems with research) and there have already been six hotfix patches since the game launched a week ago. I expect the game to be in much better shape overall in another week or two at most.</p>

<p>Simply put,&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;captures the wonderfully capitalistic vibe of farming RPGs while nudging farming out of the limelight and replacing it with cooking. Every cooking minigame is fun, and the controlled chaos of running your own restaurant is compelling.</p>
<p>Yes, it has its rough edges, but those are being smoothed out at an admirably fast pace.&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;will certainly appeal to the legions of fans who love farming RPGs but are looking for something a little different; if that sounds like you, then I can wholeheartedly say that&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;is worth checking out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-cycle-fortnite-map-yager<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Cycle: Frontier&nbsp;</em>may be dead, but developer Yager isn't letting sleeping dogs lie, as the studio has created a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>map based on the game using the battle royale title's UEFN creative tool.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://yager.de/2024/09/19/the-cycle-prospect-island-a-uefn-project/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post on its website</a>, Yager says it created&nbsp;<em>The Cycle: Prospect Island&nbsp;</em>out of a desire to "keep the spirit alive" and to pay tribute to the game, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cycle-frontier-shutting-down">shut down in September last year</a>.</p>
<p>Yager says that although it's currently working on its "different co-development ventures" and "new projects", it wanted to pay homage to the "tragic story" of&nbsp;<em>The Cycle</em>, which it says is "beloved" not only by its fans but by Yager as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-cycle-prospect-island-yager-fortnite-map.jpg?itok=f_a0_tSU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-cycle-prospect-island-yager-fortnite-map.jpg?itok=a7OZ37kN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yager's&nbsp;<em>The Cycle Fortnite&nbsp;</em>map contains many references to its deceased shooter.</figcaption></figure><p>In the post, Yager admits that "not everything that made&nbsp;<em>The Cycle: Frontier&nbsp;</em>shine can be brought into this project", but it says that the developers who worked on the map "brought as many ideas and visuals back to life as feasible".</p>
<p>If you load up the map, you'll begin in Prospect Station, and you can visit offices for&nbsp;<em>The Cycle</em>'s various factions, where you'll get contracts you can fulfil in order to unlock new gear and play as individual "faction classes".</p>
<p>Once you've obtained your contracts, you can drop down to the main Prospect Island map, where you'll be able to encounter other Prospectors who are looking to complete their own contracts.</p>
<p>The titular Cycle will also appear "from time to time", causing certain areas of the map to become unsafe, so you'll need to sprint to your nearest evac zone in order to protect yourself from the storm's effects. Beware of other Prospectors, though!</p>

<p>Yager isn't the only developer to dabble in UEFN projects based on its games; Keoken Interactive, developer of&nbsp;<em>Deliver Us the Moon</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deliver-us-the-moon-fortnite-map">created a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>map based on its game</a> last year, for instance.</p>
<p>You can download and play&nbsp;<em>The Cycle: Prospect Island&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>right now. The island code is as follows: 8495-9375-7199. You'll also still get battle pass XP while you're playing it, which is pretty neat.</p>

And while it generally hits the news when a classic card is sold for a ludicrous price, the actual competitive game it’s created for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-euic-tcg-scarlet-violet-championships-1851400530&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-euic-tcg-scarlet-violet-championships-1851400530">has never been more popular</a></span>. This is something The Pokémon Company International (TPCi) is hoping to better take advantage of with a brand-new free-to-play mobile game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pokémon TCG: Pocket</em></a></span>—the <em>Marvel Snap</em>ification of the brand. I went hands-on to see how it compares to both <em>Snap</em> and the existing <em>Pokémon TCG Live</em>.</p><p><em>Pocket</em> takes the core <em>PTCG</em> game and strips it down, streamlining it as a concept to make a faster, more phone-friendly game. The live game, while not as complex as <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, is surprisingly involved, and the ever-changing meta with new cards added every three months means even playing the digital version can be a tricky world to enter. <em>Pocket</em> is very clearly an attempt to sweep all that aside and create a mobile game that’s as instant and speedy as <em>Marvel Snap</em>, except infused with <em>Pokémon </em>magic.</p><p>The instant pull here, for <em>Pokémon </em>fans at least, is that <em>Pocket</em> gives every player two free packs of cards to open every day. Each pack, disappointingly, only contains five cards—real world packs have 10, and we’ll get into why this change is a bummer later on—but all have an equal chance of containing some of the rarest cards in the game. And those rarest cards can be something astonishing, putting <em>Snap</em>’s excellent 3D effects to shame. <em>Pocket</em> has, if you’re exceptionally lucky, so-called “Immersive Cards” that, when tapped, turn into gorgeous animations, where the camera swoops into the full-art picture, revealing entire realms, filled with Pokémon<em>&nbsp;</em>in their element, before eventually pulling back out to the original piece of art. It’s actual magic.</p><h2 id="h84521"><a id=""></a>Mobile Shrinkflation</h2><figure id="" data-id="91d91f41c8ed2f5c9cee6f224961591e" data-recommend-id="image://91d91f41c8ed2f5c9cee6f224961591e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle deck, with its card box above it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A battle deck, with its card box above it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91d91f41c8ed2f5c9cee6f224961591e" data-recommend-id="image://91d91f41c8ed2f5c9cee6f224961591e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle deck, with its card box above it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The game itself is a lot more different to the mainline version than I was expecting. First of all, while a <em>TPCG</em> game is played with a deck of 60 cards, <em>Pocket</em> has decks of only 20. Energy, a vital part of any 60-card deck that’s used to power a Pokémon’s attacks, isn’t played as a card at all, but is rather a resource given out each turn. There are no Prize Cards—the six cards in a live game that must usually be won by a player in order to win the game—but instead victories are based on scoring three “K.O. points,” earned by knocking out an opponent’s cards. Oh, and there are no damage dice. (Trainer cards <em>are</em> still a part of the game, but during my demo they really didn’t come up, so it’s hard to say exactly how they’ll work at this point.) That’s a lot of change!</p><p>However, what’s important to recognize about <em>Pocket</em> is that it’s <em>not</em> an attempt to recreate the live game digitally—that’s what <em>Pokémon TCG Live</em> is (meant to be) for. This is something new, something else, and accordingly it is far more removed from the rest of the TCG.</p><p>Let’s take a tangent to <em>Pokémon TCG Live</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-live-online-migrate-card-game-tips-guide-1849789809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-live-online-migrate-card-game-tips-guide-1849789809">It’s <em>awful</em></a></span>. The previous <em>Pokémon TCG Online</em>, made offline in 2022, was crumbling, decade-old tech, but as a way to play the TCG in the digital realm, it did the job. Both games are played using packs opened by scanning the Code Cards found in every real-world <em>Pokémon TCG </em>pack, box, tin, etc. Scan the code, and you get a digital equivalent to open, and then can build collections and decks, and take part in online battles against other people. But when <em>Live</em> replaced it, it also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-silver-tempest-lost-origin-code-cards-1849820076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-silver-tempest-lost-origin-code-cards-1849820076">slashed the number of cards you got from every code card</a></span> you scanned from 10 to five, deleted swathes of cards if you had more than four of any, and entirely removed the “T” from the title entirely—there is no longer any way to trade in the digital trading card game. It was such a crashing dud that it put me off playing online at all.</p><h2 id="h84522"><a id=""></a>Genetic Apex</h2><figure id="" data-id="f7736714b4803a277b2caab29d6b2300" data-recommend-id="image://f7736714b4803a277b2caab29d6b2300" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Eevee playmat art, with Jolteon, Vaporeon and Flareon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Eevee playmat art, with Jolteon, Vaporeon and Flareon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7736714b4803a277b2caab29d6b2300" data-recommend-id="image://f7736714b4803a277b2caab29d6b2300" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Eevee playmat art, with Jolteon, Vaporeon and Flareon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Pocket</em> therefore gains a lot more appeal, and exists with no overlap at all. Sets of packs created for <em>Pocket</em> are completely unique—with the 200-card launch set given the astoundingly terrible name of Genetic Apex—featuring a mix of classic art going back as far as the 1990s, as well as lots of original artworks. There are no real-world code cards, and no real-world versions of the original art. (During my hands-on, another journalist asked if there were plans to release any of the game’s art in a future physical set, and the PR began some obfuscatory waffle. I leaned over and said, “Of <em>course</em> they are.” Of course they are.)</p><p>We were given a rather unrealistic number of digital packs to open, and during this time I was exceptionally lucky (genuinely—while they were supplying us far more to open than would be possible for free in the real game, the packs themselves were the real ones with the real odds that any player would have), pulling some stunning full-art by both known and new <em>PTCG</em> artists. Cards so beautiful that it kind of hurt that they were stuck on a mobile phone screen, and not something you could hold and store in a binder.</p><p>Although, saying that, <em>Pocket</em> has a metric ton more sense when it comes to things like this than <em>Live</em>, with lovely digital binders you can store cards in, and ways to display and share your collection. And talking of sharing, it also features the Wonder Pick—a daily way to try to get lucky and pull a specific card you want from a pack opened by someone else. They don’t lose anything, but you have a chance to gain.</p><h2 id="h84523"><a id=""></a>I Choose You, <em>Pokémon Pocket</em>!</h2><figure id="" data-id="e0fd3374de1487e0deb0f85b81f95438" data-recommend-id="image://e0fd3374de1487e0deb0f85b81f95438" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The opening Battle screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The opening Battle screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0fd3374de1487e0deb0f85b81f95438" data-recommend-id="image://e0fd3374de1487e0deb0f85b81f95438" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The opening Battle screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>OK, the battles themselves. You need a 20-card deck to play, but the game’s opening sequences and tutorial will guide you toward that. There are also so-called “Rental Decks” that can be “borrowed” and used to play, but not added to your collection.</p><p>Like the live game, you begin each game by drawing cards and placing a Pokémon in the Active Spot, and up to three others on your Bench. You then use attacks by matching Energy to cards (here, an Energy Zone generates you an Energy each turn, and shows you which type will be generated next turn), and chipping away at your opponent’s health. You can then evolve your cards as normal, switch cards in and out from the Active Spot, and play Trainers to gain advantages. All of the effects are, in a sense, nerfed from the live game, to make these smaller-scale battles more tactical. It’s far less likely you’ll one-shot an opponent with reduced attack powers, and Trainers will give you the ability to pull a couple of cards from your deck, rather than the fives and sevens possible on a table top.<br></p><p>It works. It’s zippy, less involved, but has enough going on to let tactics be relevant. And, importantly, it plays nothing like <em>Marvel Snap</em>, which is where it could really have come unstuck, not least after “borrowing” the idea for 3D holographic cards and so on. It plays like a diluted version of the TCG, and feels very much a part of that realm.</p><p>This all adds up to a simpler game, but not a simple one, that’ll be neat for quick bursts on your phone, whether against the game’s AI or other real-world players. It’s nothing mind-blowing, but it also doesn’t need to be. It just needs to be fun. And this is, after all, an app that’s putting pack opening and card collecting at its forefront.</p><h2 id="h84524"><a id=""></a>That’s How They Gacha</h2><figure id="" data-id="cb36e215137aadc9cb4eb6e13f425d02" data-recommend-id="image://cb36e215137aadc9cb4eb6e13f425d02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Sabrina card with extra sparkles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Sabrina card with extra sparkles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cb36e215137aadc9cb4eb6e13f425d02" data-recommend-id="image://cb36e215137aadc9cb4eb6e13f425d02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Sabrina card with extra sparkles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which, yes, does also point us toward the dark cloud that’s hanging over this otherwise jolly time. Two free packs a day, one released every 12 hours! Ways to get an extra card with a Wonder Pick! But you need at the very least 20 cards to play at all, and many times more than that to build a solid deck. Oh, and those collections! 200 or more cards to collect in the very first set! Gotta catch ‘em all! And yeah, this is unavoidably a gacha game, isn’t it?</p><p>Because, of course, there are ways to spend real money here. The in-game currency is Poké Gold, and it has the magical ability to hurry along access to your next free pack, 1 Gold reducing the wait time by two hours. 5 Gold will cost 99c, and I can only assume a wealth of new ways to use that Gold will be revealed by the time the game is out on Halloween. There’s also the option to spend $9.99 a month on a Premium Pass, which grants you an additional booster pack a day, alongside access to “premium missions,” so essentially a battle pass, with rewards for completing these goals—things like unique promo cards and in-game decorations like playmats, sleeves and coins.</p><p>There are also an array of cosmetics you’ll be able to acquire, and then apply to cards to make them your own. These amount to special foil effects and sparkly decor that will show up in play, which is a great idea, but—and again, I’m assuming here—also another way to spend money.</p><p>And of course, this is a “free” app, and it’s a business, and it’s looking to make money. But it’s also <em>Pokémon</em>, and as much as we adults would like to pretend, it’s a franchise primarily aimed at and marketed toward children. And gacha plus kids makes me uncomfortable. One of the real joys about <em>Pokémon TCG</em>&nbsp;<em>Live</em> is that there’s genuinely no way to spend money within it. Sure, code cards cost money, but you can also buy nine-hundred-trillion of them for cents if you look in the right places, and the code cards come as an extra with the actual physical (gacha) cards you paid for. It’s an app you can set your kids free on, and never worry about them either stealing your credit card, or nagging you to dig it out yourself. With yet another monthly $10 outlay to beg for on <em>Pocket</em>, you can add it to the teetering pile of VBux, Robux, <em>Minecraft</em> subscriptions, and so many more that you might already be on the hook for.</p><hr><p>I dearly wish <em>Pocket</em> could have been built around the same money-free basis as previous digital versions of the TCG, but also recognize how unlikely that would be. As someone who is deeply into the card game and collecting it, I know I’ll be playing this more for the collections than the battles, but I’ll certainly be playing it. It could be <em>huge</em>. I just might be not be telling my son about it.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can almost sense its launch lineup coming into focus as the company’s developers prepare to put their finishing touches on whimsical new experiments. Rumors and speculation around a supposed Switch 2 have reached a fever pitch as fans await a possible official reveal any week now. So it’s our last chance to share our hopes and predictions for the new hardware before dreams become reality. Here’s what we want from a Switch 2, and what we think we’ll actually get. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="985ffbecf7839530e6a23ee6f76c5af2" data-recommend-id="image://985ffbecf7839530e6a23ee6f76c5af2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1840" data-height="1035" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Splatoon 3 is displayed on a Switch OLED" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Splatoon 3 is displayed on a Switch OLED" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="985ffbecf7839530e6a23ee6f76c5af2" data-recommend-id="image://985ffbecf7839530e6a23ee6f76c5af2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1840" data-height="1035" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Splatoon 3 is displayed on a Switch OLED" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I’m not a snob when it comes to screens. My computer monitor is small, off-brand, and doesn’t even have an HDMI port. I play most of my PS5 and Xbox Series S games on a $300 LED TV that I sit 10 feet away from and isn’t even 4K. So when I upgraded from a regular Switch to the OLED model, I was genuinely surprised by just how much better it looked. The contrast was better. The colors were warmer. Everything popped. Even so-so games looked incredible on the vibrant display sitting 12 inches from my face.</p><p>An OLED screen doesn’t amount to a hill of beans for Switch 2 owners who plan on just playing the console in docked mode, but it’s night-and-day for anyone who primarily uses the device as a handheld, which is where I think the hardware excels most anyway. Give me a $400 Switch 2 and a $550 OLED version at launch and I’ll scrape together my pennies to get the latter. Just please don’t make me wait several years. — Ethan</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-recommend-id="image://adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Virtua headset sits in front of a teal background " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Virtua headset sits in front of a teal background " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Evan Amos</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-recommend-id="image://adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Virtua headset sits in front of a teal background " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>My greatest desire is for there to be something <em>weird</em> about the Ultra Switch U. Nintendo is at its best when its consoles force developers to think differently. Just think of the way the Wii drove companies to create bizarre and fascinating games because of its Wii-motes and nunchucks, or how the two screens of the DS demanded a new level of creativity and imagination. While I recognize that the New Switch XL will have to conform on some level to allow cross-platform gaming, I still want that bonkers twist no one sees coming.<br></p><p>Maybe it can produce smells as you’re playing. Or it projects holograms from its screen. Or a good idea. But just not a slightly more powerful version of the Switch, with a bigger screen. I mean, I’d buy that tomorrow. But I really wish for that old Nintendo magic to surprise everyone. — John Walker</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c1fbdddeb149b94ec6e0329ac5a02de8" data-recommend-id="image://c1fbdddeb149b94ec6e0329ac5a02de8" data-format="png" data-width="1130" data-height="518" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Leaks of a possible Switch 2 prototype render " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="c1fbdddeb149b94ec6e0329ac5a02de8" data-recommend-id="image://c1fbdddeb149b94ec6e0329ac5a02de8" data-format="png" data-width="1130" data-height="518" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Leaks of a possible Switch 2 prototype render " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I have seen so many tech companies ruin a good thing with needless iteration. They’ll call it “innovating” and trying not to be “stagnant.” The Switch is, as far as I’m concerned, a perfect device. Console-quality games on a handheld are all I really want most days. The Switch is one of the most affordable portable gaming devices on the market right now, and it fills a niche that Sony and Microsoft are probably too scared to try and touch, given how embedded the Switch is as the go-to item for portable gaming. It is such a perfectly executed concept that I don’t want Nintendo to mess with it too much. Just give me a beefier device that can handle games the base system can’t. Sure, fix problems like Joy-Con drift. But above all else, I want the device to keep what made the Switch so revolutionary. Every Nintendo system has been substantially different than the last, but I would rather see the company innovate in its games than fuck up a good thing, because if the next Nintendo console doesn’t continue to improve upon everything the Switch has given us in the past seven years, it’s a huge loss for everyone. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5151621394e0c3b9739f88c2a15386da" data-recommend-id="image://5151621394e0c3b9739f88c2a15386da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wario plays with treasure " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wario plays with treasure " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / MobyGames</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5151621394e0c3b9739f88c2a15386da" data-recommend-id="image://5151621394e0c3b9739f88c2a15386da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wario plays with treasure " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>2017 feels like a lifetime ago, which is unfortunate because back then, Nintendo could get away with selling a brand new console for just $300. Given the recent announcement of the PS5 Pro and its $700 price tag, I’m wary of what Nintendo will say at the unveiling of the Switch 2. There’s no chance in hell that it’s <em>that </em>high, as I feel Nintendo is savvier than a lot of folks give the company credit for, but there’s similarly no chance it’s as low as previous price points have been, either. The OLED was proof that Nintendo could charge a bit more and people would still come running, and I paid about $400 for my own <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>OLED system. That feels like <em>just about </em>the right asking price, given the upgrades that have been rumored for months now, and it’d <em>still </em>be undercutting its competitors. Now to cross my fingers and hope that Nintendo sees things the way that I do. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb2af4e9826d5c57e88836e75a5abddc" data-recommend-id="image://bb2af4e9826d5c57e88836e75a5abddc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario jumps over mice.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is the most I will ever sound like a spoiled brat, but Nintendo, it has been<em> long enough</em>. You gave us <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>back in 2017 and <em>Bowser’s Fury </em>as an additional, experimental side game packaged with a remaster in 2021. The streets want a new 3D <em>Mario </em>game and they want it immediately. The children may yearn for <em>Astro Bot </em>these days, but the rest of us need a return to our favorite world-hopping, triple-jumping Italian plumber. I’ll even take a sequel to <em>Super Mario Sunshine </em>at this point, just…please. My crops are dying. Alternatively, if you ever want to <em>finally </em>bring <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2 </em>to modern systems, I’d heavily welcome that too. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1616bf1bec4126a4e94c060ca4ec21a7" data-recommend-id="image://1616bf1bec4126a4e94c060ca4ec21a7" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ness talks to a Mr. Saturn" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ness talks to a Mr. Saturn" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1616bf1bec4126a4e94c060ca4ec21a7" data-recommend-id="image://1616bf1bec4126a4e94c060ca4ec21a7" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ness talks to a Mr. Saturn" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Over the years, the Nintendo Switch has cultivated one of the most baller catalogs of any console in my lifetime. It’s got everything you could want from a Nintendo system, including a number of <em>Mario </em>and <em>Pokémon </em>games that have sold gangbusters, but it’s also been the site of a few revivals. Most notably, Nintendo seemingly resuscitated its dormant <em>Metroid </em>franchise, and has even brought back the <em>Famicom Detective Club </em>games. I guess when you sell as well as the Switch has, you begin to feel like maybe you can perform a few miracles, and I want Nintendo to lean into that. There are so many beloved series that could either use full ports or remasters, or better yet, a brand new installment. <em>Mother </em>is the thing that comes most to mind, especially considering its influence on so many modern RPGs like <em>Undertale </em>and the enduring popularity of both Ness and Lucas in the <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>games. But also, give me a new <em>Star Fox</em>, y’all. Stop being cowards. — Moises Taveras<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af96f199c98f1944f0af983601d3c6c3" data-recommend-id="image://af96f199c98f1944f0af983601d3c6c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="855" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue 3DS sits opened" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blue 3DS sits opened" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af96f199c98f1944f0af983601d3c6c3" data-recommend-id="image://af96f199c98f1944f0af983601d3c6c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="855" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue 3DS sits opened" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A lot of people, including myself, obviously love the Switch, but it still feels like Nintendo’s most sterile console. The Wii went all in on motion controls and Miis, which featured in tons of niche games like <em>Wii Sports</em>, and carried over to the 3DS. That handheld had features like StreetPass, encouraging a sense of community among its adopters, and even packaged in minigames that used the Miis that you collected from interacting and walking past other 3DS users. There used to be an offbeat whimsy to the kind of experiments that Nintendo would bundle with its systems that never really found its way to the Switch. Hell, it doesn’t even have customizable backgrounds, which feels like such an easy layup given how beloved Nintendo’s first-party properties are. There’s <em>so </em>much room for improvement in this department, and it’d probably do a lot for my own engagement with the console. I wasn’t necessarily glued to either my Wii or 3DS for the quality and quantity of games on them, but I did find myself coming back because they felt like unique and playful systems that engaged me in a way other consoles didn’t. Let’s get back to that. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bf14b173c9745903b804c44a9a4438e6" data-recommend-id="image://bf14b173c9745903b804c44a9a4438e6" data-format="png" data-width="958" data-height="674" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A green N64 box shows the translucent console" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A green N64 box shows the translucent console" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bf14b173c9745903b804c44a9a4438e6" data-recommend-id="image://bf14b173c9745903b804c44a9a4438e6" data-format="png" data-width="958" data-height="674" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A green N64 box shows the translucent console" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While plenty of people love the Nintendo Switch because it’s a portable powerhouse, able to play tons of indie games and exclusive Nintendo titles, I’m here to ask for a non-portable Switch. Yes, I know it kind of defeats the purpose of the console. It’s supposed to have the ability to “switch” between handheld and home console. But Nintendo eventually released a Switch Lite which wasn’t compatible with the standard Switch Dock and was offered as a portable-only alternative. With the Switch 2 likely being a much more powerful console, I can imagine a lot of PS4/Xbox One ports will show up in the years that follow its launch. And a lot of those games are best enjoyed on a couch with a controller in front of a TV, not hunkered over a handheld that will have its battery drained rapidly.<br></p><p>So come on Nintendo, offer up a Switch 2 Pro or Switch 2 Home Edition or whatever that ditches the touchscreen and Joy-Cons, comes bundled with a Pro Controller, and costs $50-$100 less. A sleek and tiny black box I can toss behind my TV and never think about again. – Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
