He explains he isn’t interested in leaving his own mark on many previous FromSoftware IP because series like Kings Field and Enchanted Arms are too connected to the work of other developers.</p><p>“I think a lot of these games are so intertwined with the directors who almost invented that style of game,” he said.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I don’t think there’s a scenario where I myself would make a King’s Field. The same can be said about Otogi and Enchanted Arms.</p></div><p>Miyazaki continued: “I don’t think there’s a scenario where I myself would make a King’s Field. The same can be said about Otogi and Enchanted Arms."</p><p>The one exception to this rule is the Armored Core series. Miyazaki served as a planner on Armored Core: Last Raven and chipped in for other games in the franchise, too. As a result, he feels equipped to potentially return to that universe.</p><p>"I worked on Armored Core 4 and Armored Core: For Answer," he added. "It enabled me to put my own interpretation on Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon and develop that.”</p><p>We'll have to wait to see if Miyazaki's vision for a traditional JRPG comes to fruition. Meanwhile, FromSoftware is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-times">beginning to roll out substantial Elden Ring DLC in the form of Shadow of the Erdtree</a>. While the studio’s next project remains a mystery, the FromSoftware boss recently revealed that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-still-isnt-the-ideal-fantasy-rpg-in-the-eyes-of-fromsoftwares-hidetaka-miyazaki"><u>the world he co-created with George R.R. Martin isn’t quite his idea of an “ideal fantasy RPG.”</u></a></p><p>"While Elden Ring is not quite it, it's pretty close,” he said at the time. “It's getting close."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For more, be sure to read up on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-may-consider-beginning-to-end-total-co-op-in-future-fromsoftware-games"><u>how the team might introduce new co-op elements to future titles</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-dubbing-challenge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday Ubisoft, a company worth <em>billions</em>, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/assassins-creed/news/5JEWsSKwGmJDmlvvM12PpN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced </a>a competition where a fan could win the chance to provide the voice of a non-player character (NPC) in the upcoming <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intel-optane-905p-1-5tb-ssd-fire-sale-available-for-only-299/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Intel's Optane SSDs were one of a kind, using 3DXPoint instead of NAND for storage. They had many advantages over traditional SSDs, amongst which include unusually high endurance ratings and extremely low latency. Even today, Optane SSDs like the 905p provide faster loading times than the best PCI-e 4 and PCI-e 5 SSDs on the market.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons that Optane failed to catch on with enthusiasts was the price. When the 905p was initially released, the 1.5tb model sold for a jaw-dropping $2,199.99 - a price higher than the fastest consumer GPUs on the market!</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Optane-Loading-Times.webp"></a>I recently benchmarked Intel's Optane P5800X and 905p drives in Final Fantasy while paired with an Intel i9-14900K. The "old" Optane 905p still leads over NAND SSDs, beating Kingston's Fury Renegade by 2.27 seconds. Now let's be real - that's not a huge amount of time saved. But when you look at it from a performance perspective, that's an impressive 46% faster than the Fury Renegade's 7.19 seconds.</p>
<p>Optane's production has been discontinued, and as a result prices of the remaining units on the market drop every day. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=jb4H9BKWZ98&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https://www.newegg.com/intel-optane-905p-1-5tb/p/N82E16820167505" rel="sponsored noopener">NewEgg currently has a sale for the 1.5tb unit for only $299 USD with promo code SUMMER673.</a> This price is still more expensive than high end NVMe SSDs, but if you want the absolute best loading times nothing on the market beats Optane yet - not even the fastest PCI-e 5 SSDs.</p>

<p data-characters="293" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em> DLC rolls out to players worldwide, Steam Deck fans have discovered a glitch that makes the game impossible to play. The glitch seemed to arrive alongside <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-v1-12-patch-notes-shadow-of-the-erdtree-weapon-and-skill-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update 1.12</a> and will seriously halt your game if you leave your Tarnished alone for too long. </p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">Steam Deck users noticed an issue that made the game unresponsive to any inputs. FromSoftware took to Twitter/X to confirm that this occurs if you leave the game running but leave your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes. The developer is working on hotfix for the glitch, but it’s not here yet. To avoid the issue happening to you, it’s important to keep your Tarnished moving.</p> <h2 id="h-don-t-stop-moving-in-elden-ring-if-you-re-playing-on-steam-deck-because-there-s-no-beating-the-inactivity-glitch-boss" data-injectable="false">Don’t stop moving in <em>Elden Ring</em> if you’re playing on Steam Deck because there’s no beating the inactivity glitch boss</h2> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="784" data-injectable="true"><em>Elden Ring</em>‘s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC is one of the most highly-anticipated releases of 2024. Some might be playing right now and, in the middle of their runs, need to put the Steam Deck down and go take care of something. However, doing this without batting a button or joystick every few minutes like an impatient cat will cause the game to lock you out entirely at the moment.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Note: a Steam Deck related issue has been identified and a hotfix is being worked on.</p><p>Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs.</p><p>We apologize for inconvenience.</p><p>The date and time of the hotfix will be announced separately.</p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true">FromSoftware is working on an update, but hasn’t announced when it will be able to release a patch to fix <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this issue</a>. Thankfully, this error popped up on the day that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> was released, so the developer was likely waiting for error reports. Not all errors are created equal, though. Some take a few hours to be patched, while others can take much longer.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Since the release of the latest patch, I’ve seen a couple of <a href="https://x.com/BillalNX/status/1803730889387495585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports of errors</a> in <em>Elden Ring</em> on social media. They aren’t common enough that it looks like everyone is affected, but quite a few players have launched the game and have been waiting until the DLC goes live, only to be met with an error screen and an inability to load their perfectly placed Tarnished.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true">If you’re playing the game on Steam Deck, the safest way to do so is to just keep moving. Don’t leave your game for longer than 5 minutes, or you’ll likely need to reboot. Mercifully, <em>Elden Ring</em> runs well on Valve’s handheld device, so this shouldn’t be too much of a problem for loading screens.</p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">My best advice for you is to just be mindful of when you’re taking breaks, and for how long. If you plan on putting the Steam Deck down before the hotfix is out, maybe make sure you’ve saved and quit. We’ll update the piece as soon as FromSoft has a fix online.</p>

You can find this "first and last" Elden Ring DLC expansion on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/">Steam</a>, the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pre-order/9N5P5SC2RZ7K/0017">Xbox Store</a> and in the suppurating depths of your very worst nightmares. Am I overdoing it yet? No matter. Let's press on.</p><!--more-->
<p>Perhaps you've never heard of Elden Ring's Erdtree DLC. Perhaps you've sauntered in here expecting a nice game about looking at antique rings while lying under some shady topiary. Come child, I'll soon birth thee anew. Shadow Of The Erdtree is a lategame Elden Ring add-on which rudely attaches a grotty new region, The Land Of Shadow, to the base game's festering Lands Between. Here you'll find a host of new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapon-types">weapons</a>, enemies, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-locations">bosses</a> and stories concerning the fate of Miquella, a character who is of huge importance to the main Elden Ring storyline.</p>
<p>Once again: this is a lategame add-on, designed to sizzle the nerves and parboil the synapses of all but the most seasoned and well-equipped Tarnished adventurers, though it does at least have more or less the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-system-requirements">system requirements</a> as the main game. Our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-what-level">recommended Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree starting level</a> is between 120-150, and you'll need to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">reach certain areas and defeat certain bosses</a> before you can enter the Land of Shadow, though you don't need to finish the game. If you're a NG+ player in need of reorientation, we've also written a guide to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-fastest-way-to-reach-shadow-of-the-erdtree">fastest way to reach Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> - 24 steps, each more harrowing than the last. Speaking as a lapsed player who keeps meaning to get back into Elden Ring and failing, I am currently squatting on step 11.5 - "Sob uncontrollably on the bridge of Redmane Castle".</p>
<p>If you're already hip to all these Elden antics, you might be more interested in knowing whether Shadow Of The Erdtree is any good. I don't know for sure, but I know somebody who does: Ed Thorn, aka Starscourge Edders, who went to the trouble of publishing an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree review</a> a few days ago. He was a bit ambivalent, actually, describing the expansion as a "pseudo-sequel" and praising its greater emphasis on crafty exploration, while sternly withholding the Bestest Best badge.</p>
<p>"The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies," Ed wrote. "For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis." Recollection paralysis! I'm pretty sure that's what you get from Basilisks.</p>
<p>Now that Erdtree is out, the insatiable gamer brain promptly turns to what FromSoftware might work on next. President and Dark Souls series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki has already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-hidetaka-miyazaki-reflects-on-how-becoming-a-father-might-influence-his-future-games">offered some wistful ruminations on the experience of fatherhood as an inspiration, if not a direct theme</a>. Personally, I'd like to play a FromSoftware game that gets away from the "corrupted rulers in need of purgation" premise that has broadly defined FromSoftware's output since Demon's Souls. I'm not sure what I want, but I don't want to have to topple another ruined king. A man may tire of destroying or usurping a polluted cosmic order. How about you?</p>

<p id="heqSYs">When you first enter the vicinity of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23944909">Shadow Keep</a>, you’ll be given two mysterious on-screen prompts saying “Somewhere, a great rune has been broken” and “And so too has a powerful charm.”</p>
<p id="77UR1g">This is nothing to be concerned about if you wish to continue exploring the Scadu Atlus region, as what it means that <strong>a new region of the map has unlocked</strong> somewhere in the Realm of Shadow, and <strong>that the charm refers to something which happens to certain characters</strong>.</p>
<p id="XFE1yQ">If you don’t mind spoilers, here is where to find the newly unlocked location...</p>

<p id="kWawK9">If you’ve visited the Cerulean Coast before exploring the Shadow Keep or venturing to the Cathedral of Manus Metyr, you probably spotted a large hole in the southwest section of the map. Drop down the ledges to find<strong> a yellow barrier with Miquella’s symbol</strong>. If you try to interact with the seal before the above prompt, this line will appear on your screen, “Sealed and obscured by Miquella.”</p>
<p id="0ciGt8"><strong>After the seal has been broken</strong>, you can return to the Stone Fissure to learn more about Miquella’s story in the realm of shadow. Without spoiling too much about what is behind the broken seal, you’ll be able to progress in a certain NPC’s questline and face off against a mighty boss.</p>

<p id="uqoBBv">Don’t forget that a powerful charm has been released from Leda and her allies! Hop around from NPC to NPC to learn that Miquella has seemingly charmed all of her followers. Everyone seems to be in disarray wondering if they were right in following Miquella and what they should be doing now. The story of Miquella’s followers will change based on your decisions from here on out, so tread carefully!</p>

By now, you would have seen our IGN review for this phenomenal  <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">10/10 masterpiece</a> of a DLC that almost feels like a sequel in its own right. Which, let's be honest, is what you love to hear about a bit of add-on content that's very reasonably priced.
</p><p>Another thing many of us love to hear: a touchstone gaming event like this, that's garnered almost universal praise, has been suitably celebrated with a whizbang edition for diehards. FromSoftware has indeed taken that route with the <strong>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Edition</strong>, a not inexpensive bit of kit that we'll be unboxing and tracking bargains for in a moment. (While stocks last, and hopefully before the scalpers descend, like a horde of head sucking leeches with arms.)
</p><p>And now, without further ado, let's get you sorted for prices on this rock solid contender for GOTY 2024. Or, possibly, DLCOTY 2024.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/leechy-1718857581069.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Pictured: scalpers, sucking the fun out of a normal retail experience.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Best Shadow of the Erdtree Standard Prices</h2><div id="201626"><p><h3>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Ed.</h3></p><div><p>Avaliable on Xbox Series X and PS5.</p></div></div><p>- Buy <strong>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</strong> digital on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> - <strong>$59.95</strong></p><p>- Buy <strong>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Edition</strong> digital on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> - <strong>$119.95</strong></p><h2>Best Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Prices</h2><div id="202224"><p><h3>Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Ed.</h3></p><div><p>Available on Xbox Series X and PS5.</p></div></div><p>- Buy a <strong>PC edition</strong> direct from <a href="https://store.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring-physical-full-game-pc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-collector-edition-e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bandai Namco</a> - <strong>$449.95</strong></p><h2>Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Unboxing</h2><p>Truth be told, I've been all the way through Shadow of the Erdtree already, and I know the subject of this Collector's Edition like the back of my Malenia's Gauntlet. Posterboy of the entire DLC and star of at least one lead-up trailer, Messmer the Impaler, is a foe that is both eye-catching in his design and lifebar-destroying in his merciless onscreen assaults.</p><p>The Elden Ring universe is chock full of memorable boss battles and bad-ass beasties—Messmer deserves his place both at the top of the boss food chain and in that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtrj9h3D8Ug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pool room</a> display cabinet in your own castle.</p><p>His Poke-ness rests entombed within a Collector's Edition box that's coated in runes and measures 20x27x38 cm. Breaking the seal on this prison reveals a range of items besides Messmer which should be quickly scooped up into your inventory.</p><p>The full list includes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Shadow of the Erdtree DLC code (no base game)</em></li><li><em>Exclusive hardcover art book</em></li><li><em>Digital soundtrack</em></li><li><em>Preorder Bonus Gesture</em></li></ul><p>With regards to the artbook, it's a high-quality visual odyssey into some parts of the Shadow Realm that I, honestly, still have PTSD from. Wonderful tourist destinations that are <em>to die for</em>, like the Ancient Ruins of Rauh, the Hinterlands, and the always breathtaking Cerulean Coast. They're all locales you'll soon come to fear as well as swoon over.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/1-1718869625472.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Figurine vs in-game appearance.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Speaking of swooning, let's cut to the main event—that 46cm Messmer the Impaler figurine. For reasons unknown (to me at least) Messmer is an especially lanky sort who would always get selected first in a pick up game of Shadow Realms b-ball. Our boy will tower impressively over the 23cm Malenia figure that came with the original Elden Ring Collector's Edition, if you're lucky enough to own that as well.</p><p>The visage on display here is one of tall, dark, and gruesome. Messmer is nothing less than a conversation piece, with topic at hand being <em>Well, How On Earth Does One Kill This Bastard?</em> That information I do in fact know, thanks to many an attempt plus trial and error, but I'll leave you all to discover it yourself.
</p><p>Starting at the head of the snake (so to literally speak), Messmer has an open faced helm that provides more than adequate protection from Fire, Lightning, and other projectiles covered in your average OH&amp;S guide book. I also love the detailing on the snakes that adorn his crown, the dragon-esque winglets on the sides, and those Centurion galea face-guards.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/front-1-1718869692358.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Model: Ciri</figcaption></figure></output><p>When it comes to actual facial detail, this is a more than decent rendering of a fiercely brooding demigod. I particularly like the accurate portrayal of Messmer's unearthly eyes—the same sort of peepers that dragons and runebears have in this universe, which suggests old mate has an ability to Dr. Doolittle with like-minded beasts.
</p><p>Indeed, we're already given that impression with the three slithery sidekicks that wind about our subject. One in particular hangs over his right shoulder, in proximity for a quick parseltongue chit-chat. All of these are recreated from the in-game asset that I'm intimately familiar with—particularly the little winglets that protrude from those little death noodles. I'll not reveal why they're going to be bad news for you...</p><p>When it comes to finery, Mr.' Snake Hips Himself is draped in the imaginatively named Messmer's Armor (which, pro tip: provides especially good damage negation to Lightning and Fire, but isn't the best against Slash). The blood red cloak that furls out dramatically in-game has been recreated quite nicely here in the physical realm. Only Batman rocks a cape with more pizazz than this guy. And when it comes to the fine fur detailing on the cloak edges, John Wayne ain't got nothing on our fringe game.
</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/back-1718869739891.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>"<strong>Doth Mother Know You Weareth</strong> Her Drapes?"</figcaption></figure></output><p>Beneath that battle drape is a finely detailed chainmail curiass with additional material accents around the hips. Incidentally, it's a theme that all the cool kids are wearing in the Shadow Keep this season—you'll soon meet a cadre of Fire Knights, Messmer loyalists who ape their bosses style without exceeding it. Because upstagers probably get impaled in that workplace.</p><p>Moving below the equator, we're hiding our modesty today with the Roman-esque Messmer Greaves. These are essentially wrapped leather shingards that conjoin with a pair of open toe sandals. Every little pig is accounted for and clearly Messmer has gone with open toe as a means to keep cooler—overheating can and will occur when you're a pyromaniac who spews flames and ground-pounding explosions all day long.</p><p>Last but not least, and speaking of flambe, this figurine is dominated by the presence of the Spear of the Impaler. Long enough to be God's own letter-opener and devilishly OP enough to be Satan's favourite pitchfork, this weapon is indeed a 1:1 replica of the in-game stick that jabbed me into a 'You Died' many a time.</p><p>The intricate (faux) metal work that makes up the crossguard is impressive, as is the detailing of the mid-shaft handle that reveals the true nature of this stick. Yep, this Great Spear is just as much a throwable javelin as it is a CQC shanker. The only thing that could have made it more authentic would be a hint of flame at the business end—because this stick can be made to explode if you have the mind to R2 charge it up.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/20/spear-1718870320360.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>This Great Spear is quite a lot to handle.</figcaption></figure></output><p>At the end of the unbox, what we have here is more authenticity than you can poke a red hot stick at. If you want to adorn your game cave with a stark reminder of how many times you had your butt handed to you by Messmer the Impaler, there is no finer way to do it. (And that includes this Messmer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gqKzZYZz5QA?app=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helmet</a> replica that I feel caters more to the cashed-up cosplay crowd.) 
</p><p>Essentially, I think the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Edition can stand proud and tall alongside FromSoftware's many other premium figurines, like this especially dashing <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dark-souls-3/Collector's_Editions">Dark Souls 3</a> one. 
</p><p>If Hidetaka Miyazaki speaks true, Erdtree might well be the last piece of the Elden universe we'll get to experience. I'm certain, then, in the years to come that my eyes will wander over to this figurine and remember back to the great struggle that was. With a thousand-yard stare. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53FDkWb7Mv4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adagio For Strings</a> plays.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output> <em>Thanks to Bandai Namco AU for providing a unit for photography purposes.</em></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC Review</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Fast and aggressive endgame Spirit Ashes</h2><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-best-spirit-ashes/2900-4094/" data-ref-id="2900-4094">best Spirit Ash summons</a> are more important in Shadow of the Erdtree than they were in The Lands Between, if only to distract bosses while you learn their patterns and figure out when to strike. Pretty much every major enemy in Elden Ring’s DLC is faster and deadlier, so you’ll likely want to leave your tanky summons at home. We’ve selected a few high performers that make life easier and, by the time you start Shadow of the Erdtree, should already be in your inventory.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Mimic Tear</h3><p dir="ltr">From Software might have nerfed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-mimic-tear-where-to-get-this-powerful-spirit-ash-and-why-you-should/1100-6501311/" data-ref-id="1100-6501311">Mimic Tear</a> shortly after Elden Ring launched, but this fantastic Spirit Ash summon is still a valuable asset to bring with you into the Land of Shadow. It copies your build and attacks without fear of taking damage, which is a bit annoying if you need it to survive, but also a handy way to take chunks out of boss HP bars until the Tear dies. It requires HP to summon, instead of FP, so it’s essential for builds that don’t invest much into the Mind stat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322509-elden-ring-best-spirit-ashes-dlc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322509" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322509-elden-ring-best-spirit-ashes-dlc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322509"></a><figcaption>Nerfs can't stop this.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322509-elden-ring-best-spirit-ashes-dlc.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Black Knife Tiche</h3><p dir="ltr">Tiche’s speed is a massive help in Shadow of the Erdtree. She’s much better at avoiding boss attacks than most Spirit Ash summons, and she’s still capable of dishing out a fair amount of damage as well.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Dung Eater Puppet</h3><p dir="ltr">Getting the Dung Eater Puppet locks you out of finishing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-dung-eater-quest-guide/1100-6501519/#:~:text=The%20Dung%20Eater%20shows%20up,the%20Dung%20Eater%20has%20arrived." data-ref-id="1100-6501519">Dung Eater’s quest</a>, but it’s worth it for the summon. He’s aggressive, strong, and can tackle most challenges with comparative ease.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Nightmaiden and Swordstress Puppets</h3><p dir="ltr">These two aren’t quite as powerful as some legendary Ashes, but the point is there <em>are</em> two of them. They’re agile and move a lot, and they make for excellent distractions while you retreat to heal or figure out a strategy.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best Talismans to start Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</h2><p dir="ltr">The Land of Shadow is home to several new talismans, including some that are essential for practically any build. Make sure you’ve obtained every talisman pouch in Elden Ring before touching Miquella’s nasty dead hand and starting the DLC. Some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-talismans-in-elden-ring/1100-6502463/" data-ref-id="1100-6502463">best Talisman choices</a> include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Great-Jar’s Arsenal (increases equip load)</li><li dir="ltr">Carian Filigreed Crest (reduces FP consumption from skill use)</li><li dir="ltr">Godfrey Icon (buffs charged spells and skills, not useful if you don’t use those)</li><li dir="ltr">Radagon Icon (shortens spell casting time, essential for any magic user)</li><li dir="ltr">Moon of Nokstella (increases spell memory slots, also essential for magic casters)</li><li dir="ltr">Erdtree’s Favor (raises HP, FP, and equip load)</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Elemental grease</h2><p dir="ltr">Okay it’s not technically gear, but you’ll want a few grease items before taking on the Land of Shadow’s big challenges, particularly:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Fire Grease</li><li dir="ltr">Lightning Grease</li><li dir="ltr">Rot Grease</li><li dir="ltr">Freezing Grease</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Dragonwound Grease is eventually useful as well, but not until the expansion’s back half.</p><p dir="ltr">You didn’t really have to think much about elemental weaknesses in Elden Ring, but exploiting those weaknesses in Shadow of the Erdtree is often one of the only ways to make a tough fight manageable, including boss battles. Spells and specific ailment-inducing weapons are fine, but grease items let you use any weapon to target elemental weaknesses and make life a lot easier than having to respec for a different weapon.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best armor to start Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</h2><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-armor-in-elden-ring/1100-6502489/" data-ref-id="1100-6502489">best Elden Ring armor</a> with high resistance goes a long way toward making Shadow of the Erdtree more manageable in its opening hours. If you haven’t upgraded your outfit in a while, now’s the time to do it.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Light armor</h3><p dir="ltr">Malenia’s set is an excellent choice if you’re running a lighter build thanks to its hefty immunity-boosting stats. Enemies throw status ailments around left and right in the Land of Shadow, and they build up quickly. Good immunity keeps you safe a bit longer so you can retreat and let it die down or use a consumable.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don’t feel up to challenging Malenia, the Black Knife armor is a solid replacement, and it even helps you sneak around more efficiently.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, an option with a bit more resistance built-in is the Ronin Set, which you get from the Mountaintop of the Giants’ Zamor Ruins. It has higher immunity than Malenia’s set and a set of respectable magic resistances as well, much more so than you’d expect from most light armor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322510-elden-ring-best-armor-start-dlc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322510" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322510-elden-ring-best-armor-start-dlc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322510"></a><figcaption>Effective, attractive, and easy to get.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4322510-elden-ring-best-armor-start-dlc.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Medium armor</h3><p dir="ltr">D’s set, which you get during Fia’s quest, is hefty, but it offers some of the best physical resistance in the base game and can carry you through the Mohg fight as you start the DLC. The Carian Knight set--dropped from Raya Lucaria’s Carian Knights, as you might expect--is lighter and has comparable resistances, in addition to a strong set of magic resistances as well.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Heavy armor</h3><p dir="ltr">You can’t go wrong with Tree Sentinel Armor if you have the endurance to wear it. Few sets have better physical resistance stats, and it also gives you a substantial immunity and robustness boost. Its lightning and holy resistances are a bit middling, though. Bull-Goat Armor, which you can get by taking Patches out for the Volcano Manor crowd, is slightly less sturdy, but easier to obtain.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Mage armor</h3><p dir="ltr">Magic users who don’t want to run a typical light armor set have a few options.

<p data-characters="406" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In the massive new <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Elden Ring</em> DLC, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>, you don’t have to actually complete the base game in order to access it. However, you do have to have advanced pretty far, as you need to kill a late-game boss as part of the pre-requisites. Here is how to access the new area, the Shadow Realm, in the <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC and where you can find the entrance to the new area.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-new-area-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc" data-injectable="false">Where to find the new area in <em>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC</h2> <p data-characters="539" data-current-count="839" data-injectable="true">As long as you have defeated Starscourge Radahn at the Redmane Castle in Caelid, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-mohg-lord-of-blood-in-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mohg, Lord of Blood at Mohgwyn Palace</a>, you are eligible to enter the new Shadow Realm area in <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. Once you have defeated those two bosses, head to the Cocoon of the Empyrean Site of Grace as indicated in the screenshot above. This is the Site of Grace that was created after defeating Mohg, Lord of Blood. The Cocoon of the Empyrean is also the <em>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</em> starting point for beginning the DLC content.</p>
 <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">At the Cocoon of the Empyrean, you will see an NPC, a follower of Miquella, to be exact. She tells you that her fellow followers are already inside the Shadow Realm, awaiting your arrival. In order to enter the new area, simply interact with the cracked cocoon nearby with a long withered arm hanging out of it. You will then get the prompt asking if you want to “Head to the realm of shadow?” Select YES and you will enter the new Shadow Realm area in the <em>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC and begin the expansion.</p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">If you attempt to interact with the cocoon but do not get a prompt to enter, it means you either do not have the DLC activated or you have not killed Starscourge Radahn or Mohg, Lord of Blood. Complete these tasks and you will be able to enter the new <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> zone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/you-should-get-some-chinese-in-ear-monitors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are certain objects that are so cheap and immediately useful that I consider them must buy recommendations. For people who solder, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23541478/pinecil-best-cheap-soldering-iron-open-source" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Pinecil costs next to nothing</a> and has become my go-to for soldering irons. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23551860/electric-air-duster-cleaning-pc-compressed-air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electric dusters</a> are a game changer when it comes to cleaning. In that same vein, if you stream or do basically anything on a computer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-ear_monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEMs </a>(in-ear monitors) have gotten tremendously good over the last five years, to the point where you should absolutely get a pair.</p><figure><figcaption>These things cost $25 bucks and perform very solidly. Credit: <a href="https://www.linsoul.com/products/7hz-x-crinacle-zero-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linsoul</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>To radically oversimplify for people who don’t post on audiophile forums, IEMs are kinda the professional equivalent of earbuds, although there are many differences. They wrap around your ears with a detachable cable, fit much more snugly, and offer have better audio fidelity than consumer earbuds. IEMs are often used for monitoring and in live performances so the performer can hear the mix clearly. That thing in a musician’s ear at a music festival? That’s an IEM. &nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These things are fantastic and addressed everything I did not like about the original Zeros, which were great but I found “shouty”. Much flatter. I can do work on these without EQing them.

(I have done this for <a href="https://www.crystalguardian.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom earplugs</a> before; the process feels very weird.) But like many things recently, a lot changed as Chinese companies have gone from simply producing audio goods to being major players in the market and now dominating some corners handily.</p><figure><figcaption>Companies like Topping dominate big parts of the amplifier market, even on the high end. Credit: <a href="https://shenzhenaudio.com/collections/speaker-amplifier/products/topping-la90-discrete-ultra-high-performance-discrete-power-amplifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shenzhen Audio.</a></figcaption></figure><p>Go on a forum like Audio Science Review and you see just how well Chinese audio companies, a market segment colloquially dubbed “Chi-Fi,” are doing in the space. HiFiMAN, based out of Tianjin, has been one of the best values when it comes to <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/hifiman-sundara-review-headphone.22529/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planar magnetic headphones</a> since it was founded in 2005. When it comes to Digital Audio Converters (DACs) and amplifiers, companies like <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/topping-la90-review-integrated-amplifier.33374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Topping</a> and <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/smsl-su-1-stereo-dac-review.44029/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S.M.S.L</a>. regularly knock the competition out of the park at a fraction of the price. And when it comes to a multi-room audio streamer, my money is not on the expensive and proprietary Sonos, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23571271/wiim-mini-multi-room-streamer-chromecast-audio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WiiM</a>: a tiny, versatile puck/box that works with basically every platform you can imagine. WiiM even has their own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/22/23972352/wiim-amp-airplay-2-chromecast-wireless-receiver-vintage-hi-fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">integrated amplifier</a>, and it’s <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/wiim-amp-streaming-amplifier-review.52372/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-loved.</a></p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23571271/wiim-mini-multi-room-streamer-chromecast-audio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I have said it many times</a>, WiiM is just a better deal than Sonos when it comes to multi-room audio. Credit: WiiM</figcaption></figure><p>This shift in a specific nerd market is in no way unique. No matter where you turn, Chinese companies are increasingly dominating more and more niche hobbies under their own company names, from affordable watches and electric vehicles to bike components and fountain pens. And barring some massive geopolitical shift, it’s going to continue to happen for the foreseeable future.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I can't believe this earphone is $20..." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMy3DJ18ntE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The original video that sold the Moondrop Chus like hotcakes. It has since been replaced by the Chu II, which has a detachable cable. I own those and they're very solid.</figcaption></figure></div><p>When it comes to IEMs, the company that changed everything was Moondrop. The 80 dollar Moondrop Aria, itself a slight refinement of the 129 dollar Moondrop Starfield, impressed people for the money at the time. But nothing could prepare people for the Moondrop Chu. It cost 20 dollars, and although it did not have removable cables, it was EQ’d flat and very well tuned. For the money, a usable pair of earbuds that sounded that good was unheard of. Sure, the lack of removable wires was not ideal, although that would eventually be refined with the <a href="https://shenzhenaudio.com/products/moondrop-chu-2-10mm-dynamic-in-ear-headphone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chu II</a>. And yes, it did have a somewhat embarrassing anime waifu as a mascot (most Chinese IEMs do, it’s kind of a bit). But they cost less than most entrees at Chili's and had an unheard of level of fidelity at that price point.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the market for Chinese IEMs has exploded, in part due to one YouTuber named Crinacle. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@crin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crinacle</a> runs one of the larger single databases of IEMs, <a href="https://crinacle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In-Ear Fidelity</a>. Using his measurements or <a href="https://autoeq.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AutoEQ</a>, along with software like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Equalizer APO</a> or <a href="https://eqmac.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eqMac</a>, IEMs can be tuned exactly to correct for minor imperfections or to better balance out the monitors to a sound more suited to the taste and purpose of the listener. Crinacle, a charismatic and brashly opinionated personality, went from simply maintaining the database and creating content to becoming involved in the process of tuning and selling IEMs himself. He has since collaborated with <a href="https://crinacle.com/collabs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple IEM producers</a> like TRUTHEAR and 7hz on IEMs like the <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/7hz-x-crinacle-zero-2-iem-review.50534/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7hz Crinacle x Zero:2</a>.&nbsp; I have owned the <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/truthear-hola.41070/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hola</a>, the <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/truthear-x-crinacle-zero-iem-review.37380/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Truthear Zero</a>, which I broke in a very foolish mishap, and the follow up <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/truthear-x-crinacle-zero-red-iem-review.44865/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero:RED</a>, the latter of which was tuned in a way I preferred much more. I did not mind buying it twice because it sounds very good and costs about $47 dollars.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Why you SHOULDN'T trust me" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n69THTIrmWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Crinacle’s video on conflicts of interests. Lucky for him, his IEM colabs are really solid.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The market for good IEMs in the $20-$100 dollar range has blown up and you can find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/o9ty5v/my_chifi_iem_collection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than you can count</a> on either Amazon, Aliexpress or more specialized sellers like <a href="https://shenzhenaudio.com/collections/headphones?sort_by=best-selling&amp;filter.v.price.gte=&amp;filter.v.price.lte=&amp;filter.p.m.custom.wearing_style=In-ear+Headphone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shenzhen Audio</a>.

I bought a pair of the Moondrop <a href="https://shenzhenaudio.com/collections/headphones/products/moondrop-chu-2-10mm-dynamic-in-ear-headphone?_pos=6&amp;_fid=927ebd1d4&amp;_ss=c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chu II</a>s for less than 20 dollars for my girlfriend so she could listen to music on the train. For that price, they sound fantastic, although I was disappointed by the quality control of the cable. Luckily, high quality replacement IEM cables have also gotten very affordable as well, and I bought her an upgrade pair of purple cables from Linsoul.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wanted some earbuds for my GF and got the Moondrop Chu II, a follow up to the original.

Whenever I stream and I don’t want my ears to get too hot under bright lights, my IEMs are a no-brainer. As a backup in case I ever lose my earbuds, a pair of IEMs plus the 9 dollar Apple USB-C dongle will always do me right. And at my desk, they sound so good that I end up leaving them plugged into my audio interface more often than not. If you’re even remotely interested in buying some new headphones for less than $50 bucks, you’re in luck, because thanks to the many new companies out there, it’s tremendously hard to screw that up.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>But says it's looking into it.</p>

            <p>
With one hand FromSoftware giveth (a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-big-new-patch-finally-lets-you-summon-torrent-to-fight-the-elden-beast">goat-horse in a more opportune location</a>, for instance) and with the other it taketh away; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s newly released 1.12 update has introduced a bug that can break things on Steam Deck - but FromSoftware says it's investigating.
</p>
<p>
As detailed on the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427">developer's social media feed</a>, leaving Elden Ring inactive for too long on Steam Deck renders the game unplayable in some instances - something you'll probably want to be mindful of if you need to wander off and punch something, or have a little cry.
</p>
<p>
"A Steam Deck related issue has been identified and a hotfix is being worked on," the studio wrote on X. "Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than five minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs. We apologise for inconvenience." For what it's worth, I left Elden Ring running for multiple five-minute windows in the interests of science and had no problem resuming each time - so it's possible this isn't an especially widespread issue.

<p>
As for when a fix is likely, that's currently unclear, with FromSoftware only saying, "The date and time of the hotfix will be announced separately." Replies to the developer's post also include multiple reports of Steam Deck users being blocked from playing online after receiving the message, "Inappropriate activity detected". FromSoftware is yet to acknowledge these reports, but hopefully concerned player will have more news soon. 
</p>
<p>
In other Elden Ring news, its hugely anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is currently approximately 23 minute away from releasing. I'm now going to close my laptop, sit on the sofa, and stare at Steam until it arrives. Goodbye!

One such material is Amber. Let’s go over how to acquire it in its Rough Amber form, and how to turn that into Cut Amber.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,191683,194440" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Cut Amber can be used to make rare axes within <em>Lego Fortnite</em>, which will help you mine cactus, granite, knotwood, and more.

<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I had never heard of <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em> until I was starting to fill out my Genesis collection. This was back in the ‘00s when that was actually an affordable thing to do. It quickly became (and remains) my favorite game on the console.</p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">I didn’t understand why it wasn’t more talked about, but that was back when I thought that quality had a correlation with popularity. Oh, how naïve. Now that I’m older I realize that it’s all marketing and maybe sometimes people shouting, which is a form of marketing.</p> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">Now I’m going to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/by-the-wayside-rocket-knight-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shout at you</a> about <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection</em>. I’m going to tell you about the overall quality of the collection, but none of that matters. You should play <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em>, and this is your chance.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="466" data-injectable="true"><strong>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection<strong><strong> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2728190/Rocket_Knight_Adventures_ReSparked_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rocket-knight-adventures-re-sparked-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10006837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS4</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10006837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a>)<br>Developer: Konami, Limited Run Games<br>Publisher: Konami<br>Released: June 11, 2024<br>MSRP: $29.99</strong></strong></strong></p>
 <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">The <em>Rocket Knight</em> series centers around an anthropomorphic opossum named Sparkster as he works to protect his kingdom, and usually its princess, from invasion. Each time, he faces off against his foil, Axel Gear, who seems motivated to just be a dick. That seems to be his only ambition. He partners up with the enemy each time and harrows Sparkster. There’s maybe an indication in the Genesis version of <em>Sparkster</em> that he just wants to test himself against the protagonist, but partnering with an invading force seems like going a bit far.</p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">I’m already off track. <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection</em>, contains <em>Rocket Knight Adventures, Sparkster, and Sparkster</em>. The former <em>Sparkster </em>is <em>Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2</em> for Genesis/Mega Drive, and the latter is <em>Sparkster </em>on the SNES.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">Beyond that, the <em>Re-Sparked</em> collection has a music player and an art viewer with production documents. There’s also a boss rush mode, which is appropriate for these games. Really, the most striking part of the package is the fully animated cartoons interpreting the gameplay. Aside from that, these are straight ports from their home consoles with few bells and whistles.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Rocket Knight Re-Sparked! Collection | Launch Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AA8tRgYsXzQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">Of the games, the original <em>Rocket Knight Adventures </em>is the standout. If I haven’t oversold it enough, it’s one of the best 16-bit platformers. All three games have Konami royalty behind them, but, well, we’ll get to what drags the other two down.</p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">With <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em>, however, it’s just a fun production. While the mechanics are straightforward, they get stretched in every direction. Each level presents something new and different, and it’s rarely just a platformer. One moment you’ll be jetting across the surface of a lake, and the next, you’ll be judging your jumps off the reflection of undulating water.</p> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="843" data-injectable="true">One particularly fantastic level has Sparkster assaulting an enemy airship. He’s fired out of a cannon and punches right through the side of the craft, like Doomguy in <em>Doom Eternal</em>. You travel a short distance through the interior before heading to the top, where you battle against intense wind. You move to the front of the airship before dropping down to the railings beneath it. You then return to the interior and move to the front to finish the boss off.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">It doesn’t let up. There are only a couple of issues. The first is that it’s really hard to gauge what kind of damage you’re doing. You can dash into enemies, hit them with your sword, or just hit them with a projectile that is fired when you swing your weapon. You can also spin in place, which sometimes just happens when you hit an enemy at the right angle. But what actually does more damage is hard to tell.</p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">Likewise, it’s pretty vexing that touching an enemy does significantly more damage to Sparkster than getting hit with a projectile. If your only option for getting out of the way of a projectile is to get danger-close to the enemy, it’s sometimes worth it to take the hit rather than risk getting brushed and taking twice the damage.</p> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">Lastly, there are limited continues, and to actually play the entire game, you need to be on “normal” difficulty. This wouldn’t be so bad, but the default difficulty is easy, so you have to know to check. Also, North America’s “normal” corresponds to Japan’s “very hard.” It’s not impossible, but it is deceptive.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">With the two <em>Sparkster </em>sequels, it looks like Konami’s marketing department or management got involved and gave the mandate “more like <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>.” It’s rather obvious because Sparkster in <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em> looks like a rat in a trash can, while in the <em>Sparkster</em> games, he’s all ‘tuded up. Stringy limbs, pointy ears, spikey hair; the works.</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">The artwork you can view in the collection really reinforces this. The sketches of Sparkster in <em>Rocket Knight Adventures </em>showed him snoozing or snacking on apples. There are early design documents for <em>Sparkster</em> that changed his design, but not in such an aggressive <em>Sonic</em> kind of way. I preferred him looking more earnest than cool.</p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">I would have loved to hear about how these changes came to be, but even if the <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection</em> had interviews (which it doesn’t), I doubt they’d really include talks of corporate meddling.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">The Sega Genesis version of <em>Sparkster</em> goes further to imitate Sonic. The levels are more open and have more exploration involved. One of the side goals is collecting seven swords scattered throughout the levels, and doing so powers up Sparkster and turns him gold. To be fair, <em>Sonic</em> just lifted that from <em>Dragon Ball</em>, but it’s more obvious when an anthropomorphic rat with spikey hair does it.</p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">Speaking of which, Genesis <em>Sparkster</em> has a cold opening that involves fighting Axel Gear in a robot suit. It’s so easy to lose that you may think this is a scripted defeat to set up their rivalry, but you are actually supposed to win it in order to get the first sword. Pro tip.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">As for SNES <em>Sparkster</em>, it’s mostly fine. You’re fighting wolves, and if you hit them, they get knocked out of their armor and display their chiseled physique.</p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">It follows the same ‘tuded up design as Genesis <em>Sparkster</em>, but the levels are more linear and there are no swords to collect. It’s an above-average platformer and does feature some variety and ambition, just nowhere near as much as the original.</p> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">That’s kind of the issue with the two <em>Sparksters</em>. They’re competent, but they only have a fraction of the soul of the first game. The changes in visual design just put a big spotlight on this.</p>
 <p data-characters="498" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">As for Limited Run Games’ <em>Resparked </em>collection, I once again have to wonder why I can’t rebind the controls. I understand that, on console, most people just use the stock controller configuration, but is it really that hard to allow the option to change it? I’d suspect not since the original versions of the games allow you to change the bindings which, for some reason, they removed from the versions in this release. I’m so frustrated, I just want to play with a Genesis-like controller.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">Aside from that, these are basically just emulated versions of the game. I feel like the main point of these collections is to make the games available on a modern platform. Any changes made are rarely impactful. For example, updating the graphics on <em>Gargoyles</em> didn’t suddenly make it a better game. The rewind and save states are appreciated, and I found the included production art very interesting to look at.</p>
 <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">There isn’t anything mindblowing here. I would have loved to see interviews with the staff or design documents beyond just concept art, but I guess that wasn’t in the cards. The only thing that really elevates the <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection</em> beyond, say, the recent <em>Felix the Cat</em> collection is mainly the animated openings and the boss rush modes. The entire collection is rather pricy for three emulated games. It is, for comparison, $10 more than the <em>Castlevania Anniversary Collection</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">On the other hand, if you get anything from this review, it’s that <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em> is an underappreciated classic, and you should definitely play it. The two <em>Sparkster</em> games are more Sparkster, but more disposable and with a feeling of cynicism. Whether you wait for a sale is your decision. <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection</em> is fine, just play <em>Rocket Knight Adventures</em> already.</p>

For about ten bucks, you can cop <em>Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age 2</em>, <em>Dragon Age Inquisition </em>and all of the major DLCs and expansions for each title. I repeat, ten bucks will get you everything you need to get <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-inquisition-origins-what-to-play-1851538846">caught up before <em>The Veilguard</em></a></span>.</p><p>Before jumping into the series, you should know that the <em>Dragon Age </em>games are…an unwieldy bunch to say the least. Though some have been released to critical acclaim, like <em>Inquisition</em>, others have not, and time has been equally gracious and cruel to the wider series. One of the larger problems that seems to have held the games back in the past is that it felt like <em>Dragon Age </em>lacked a cohesive vision underpinning the whole thing. For example, <em>Origins </em>is a harcore CRPG and you should never play it on console like I did (twice), whereas its immediate sequel was a much more intimate and downsized action-RPG with light CRPG elements.</p><p>However, experiencing the series firsthand, as opposed to via some lore recap, will be handy. The first game deals heavily with the Grey Wardens, a faction that has remained a large part of the <em>Dragon Age </em>series. One of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857/slides/9&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857/slides/9">companions in <em>The Veilguard</em></a></span> belongs to this faction, and so you may as well learn all about them firsthand. The second game introduces <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602">Varric</a></span>, who has become a major (not to mention beloved) character over the course of <em>Dragon Age 2 </em>and <em>Inquisition</em>, and he seems to be play a big part in <em>The Veilguard</em>,<em> </em>too. <em>Inquisition </em>is the most important game of the bunch to play, if only because it and its <em>Trespasser </em>DLC explicitly establish the main conflict and antagonist of the forthcoming game.</p><p>While each of the games is stylistically distinct from the others, they have largely tried to tell the same ongoing story of the mage-templar conflict that has ripped Thedas several new ones over the course of three games and several DLCS. The latter two dive into this matter in more depth, and considering we’ll be heading to the Tevinter Imperium—an oft-mentioned corner of <em>Dragon Age</em>’s world—for the first time with <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’re going to want to know the role it has played in the ongoing political tensions of the world.</p><p>This incredible sale on the <em>Dragon Age </em>games ends on June 24 at 1 PM ET, so you’ve got the weekend to consider what else in your life <em>really </em>needs those ten dollars. I already own the games and even I’m biting the bullet again to have them on a better platform. What’s your excuse?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="221" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Daniel Radcliffe, known famously for portraying the protagonist in the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies, has shared that he would love to see the final Harry Potter book and the movies being adapted for the upcoming <em>Harry Potter</em> show.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">After winning his first Tony award, Radcliffe was asked by <a href="https://people.com/daniel-radcliffe-reveals-harry-potter-book-he-is-most-excited-to-see-adapted-in-tv-series-8664233">People</a> in an interview about which book he’s most excited to see the show adapt. He said, “The last one, I mean, it’ll be a while before they get to that, I assume, but that was always one of my favorite of the books and of the films.”</p> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">For those unfamiliar, the final <em>Harry Potter</em> book was <em>The Deathly Hallows</em>, and its story was split into two movies to end the <em>Harry Potter</em> saga. The reboot series will adapt all seven <em>Harry Potter</em> books from J. K. Rowling.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Harry Potter Max Original Series | Official Announcement | Max" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o07u0uKkV_g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">Radcliffe is right about the wait, since the show is <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently going to run for 10 years</a>. Moreover, the <em>Harry Potter</em> show adaptation will premiere in 2026 on HBO’s Max. Taking that release window into account and time needed to get there, it would be a while.</p>
 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="false">As for the fans who are hoping for a Daniel Radcliffe cameo in the show, the actor has shut down the idea twice in the past. He previously told <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1402023/will-daniel-radcliffe-join-the-harry-potter-tv-series-he-says">E! Online</a> that he does not think there is a cameo for him in the show since the show has to be a “clean break”. The actor also shared with <a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/news/harry-potter-daniel-radcliffe-reboot-tv-show-hbo-max-return/">ComicBook</a> in 2023 that he is “very excited to have that torch passed” and feels that there is no need to “physically pass it” with a cameo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-oathbreaker-paladin-build-in-baldurs-gate-3-bg3/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-oathbreaker-paladin-build-in-baldurs-gate-3-bg3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="155" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Oathbreakers are the quintessential evil paladins, and there’s almost no better class to choose when doing a dark playthrough of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">In the tabletop version of <em>D&amp;D </em>5th edition, the Oathbreaker class was included in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide </em>and intended for villainous NPCs, but the class has caught on with players in a big way. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/baldurs-gate-3-paladin-update-patch-9-news/">Oathbreakers came late to <em>BG3</em></a>, but Larian clearly understood what made the class such a hit at the table. Paladins are already massively powerful half-casters that can smite their enemies with glee, but the Oathbreaker subclass adds some undead magic and dark power to the mix.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-break-your-oath" data-injectable="false">How to break your Oath</h2> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">One does not simply start out as an Oathbreaker Paladin. You’re going to have to choose a different Paladin subclass and then break your Oath once the game gets going. It doesn’t matter what you choose because your Oathbreaker features replace whatever you start out as. </p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">The easiest option here is to start as an Oath of Vengeance Paladin, then talk Arka out of killing Sazza when you reach the Emerald Grove. You can also get the ball rolling by killing an innocent person as an Oath of Devotion Paladin, or an innocent animal if you took the Oath of the Ancients.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-best-race-for-an-oathbreaker-paladin" data-injectable="false">Best race for an Oathbreaker Paladin</h2> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="726" data-injectable="true">The good news is that you can’t really pick a bad race for an Oathbreaker. That said, you should remember that even though Oathbreakers can cast spells, they’re really melee fighters. Because of that, Githyanki and Half-Orc Oathbreakers are going to be extra powerful. Githyanki get psionics and mobility options, and Half-Orcs have Relentless Endurance and Savage Attacks. Crafty or skull-crushing, the choice is yours.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-ability-scores-for-an-oathbreaker-paladin" data-injectable="false">Best ability scores for an Oathbreaker Paladin</h2> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="328" data-injectable="false">Oathbreakers need to make sure they have a good mix of Strength, Constitution, and Charisma scores. The former pair helps Oathbreakers become masters of melee combat and the latter makes sure Oathbreakers can use the handful of spells they unlock as they progress. Here’s the setup I’d recommend at character creation:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Strength </strong>– 17</li> <li><strong>Dexterity </strong>– 10</li> <li><strong>Constitution </strong>– 14</li> <li><strong>Intelligence </strong>– 8</li> <li><strong>Wisdom </strong>– 10</li> <li><strong>Charisma </strong>– 15</li> </ul>
 <h2 id="h-best-background-for-an-an-oathbreaker-paladin" data-injectable="false">Best background for an an Oathbreaker Paladin</h2> <p data-characters="534" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">The best backgrounds for Oathbreaker Paladins make good use of the Charisma attribute. Paladins need high Strength for their weaponry, but they also need a reasonably high Charisma for all their magic. Since you’re already going to have a high Charisma score, you might as well pick a background that gives you some social skill proficiencies. You can choose one that boosts your Persuasion and helps mitigate a low Intelligence/Wisdom score, or you can embrace your weaknesses and focus on terrifying and pummeling your foes.&nbsp;</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Guild Artisan </strong>– Insight, Persuasion</li> <li><strong>Haunted One </strong>– Medicine, Persuasion</li> <li><strong>Noble </strong>– History, Persuasion</li> <li><strong>Soldier </strong>– Athletics, Intimidation</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h2 id="h-best-feats-for-an-oathbreaker-paladin" data-injectable="false">Best feats for an Oathbreaker Paladin</h2> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">When it comes to picking feats, Oathbreakers are in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-feats-for-paladin-in-baldurs-gate-3-bg3/">the same boat as all the other Paladins</a>. Depending on the build, Oathbreakers only get 2-3 feats, and it’s tempting to only take ability score increases because you need to boost both Strength and Charisma. Items can help you smooth out those scores, however, so these are the feats I’d recommend considering:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong> – You really should take at least one to boost Strength. The more often you hit, the more often you Smite.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Great Weapon Master</strong> – This should take your second feat slot, since it greatly increases the chance you have to get in multiple attacks each turn.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Alert </strong>– Going earlier in initiative is always great, but this should really only be a pick if you choose not to multiclass.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
 <h2 id="h-best-multiclass-for-an-oathbreaker-paladin" data-injectable="false">Best multiclass for an Oathbreaker Paladin</h2> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Oathbreakers are a bit limited when it comes to multiclassing because their signature ability – Animate Dead – doesn’t become available until 9th level. There are still some good multiclass options, though, especially if you’re willing to give up that particular spell.&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Oathbreaker 9, Warlock 3</strong> – This is the route to go for Oathbreakers that want a little bit of everything. You have enough Paladin skills to jump into melee combat and start Smiting your enemies, but you can also save spell slots by leaning on your Charisma modifier with Eldritch Blast while letting your Animate Dead servants do the grunt work. Take Paladin first level, then do your Warlock dip before finishing out your Paladin levels.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Oathbreaker 7, Bard 5</strong> – Multiclassing with a College of Sword Bard is always a fantastic option for Paladins. They already have the Strength needed to make great use of the College of Sword’s new attack abilities, and all the Bard’s spell slots can be turned into Smites to really dump on the damage. Going this route sacrifices Animate Dead, but by taking Paladin up to level 7 you can still get all your Channel Oaths and the Aura of Hate damage buff for you and your allies.&nbsp;Once again, you’ll want to start as a Paladin to get proficiency in every type of armor, then you can push to level 4 to get a Feat before starting your multiclass. </li> </ul>
