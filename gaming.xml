            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253623/sony-pearlescent-chroma-playstation-5-slim-colors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/first-look-at-the-chroma-collection-an-all-new-iridescent-line-of-ps5-accessories-available-to-pre-order-this-october/">launching shiny new “Chroma” console covers</a> for the PlayStation 5 Slim that come in pearl, indigo, and teal. And if having an iridescent console isn’t eye-catching enough, you can also get new DualSense controllers to match.</p><p>The Chroma console covers will cost $64.99 USD, while the DualSense controllers will cost $79.99. Sony is launching the Chroma pearl and indigo accessories on November 7th, followed by teal on January 23, 2025. The new colors look neat, but they’re quite intense — I’m not sure I’d want to swap out the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031802/sony-ps5-slim-new-colors-hands-on-photos">sleek blue, red, or gray of the PS5 Slim</a> for these.</p><p>You’ll be able to preorder covers and controllers from the collection on October 3rd, with availability in the US, UK, France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Sony is also opening preorders for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249013/sony-playstation-ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-retro">30th Anniversary PS5 and PS5 Pro on September 26th</a>, which deck them out in the colors of the original 1995 PlayStation — but we don’t yet know if Sony will sell those throwback grey covers separately. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That's a long time to wait for a couple of classics of the '90s RPG form to become available again.</p>

            <p>
Sega has announced the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> Movie Pack will be coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-sonic-x-shadow-generations-i-can-finally-admit-shadow-is-better-than-sonic">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> as DLC just ahead of the film's release.
</p>
<p>
And yes, it'll star Keanu Reeves as the voice of Shadow.
</p>
<p>
The DLC will be inspired by scenes from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-trailer-reveals-keanu-reeves-shadow">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a> and arrive ahead of its release on 12th December.

<p>
The news was shared at tonight's PlayStation State of Play with a glimpse of gameplay from the DLC. Shadow sports a furrier design akin to that of the film and is seen racing through Tokyo as seen in the film's latest trailer.
</p>
<p>
"This title has been developed to satisfy not just the Sonic game fans, but also those who see the Sonic movie and become fans of Sonic and Shadow for the first time," said series producer Shun Nakamura on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/movie-shadow-coming-to-sonic-x-shadow-generations/">PlayStation Blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
"But of course, we didn’t expect to have Shadow from the movie included in this game, as the world for the movie and game are different – we thought that it would be challenging to do so.
</p>
<p>
"However, we saw an almost festival-like opportunity where we have the movie and game being launched almost at the same time. We decided to pursue it and have work on movie-related content with development starting last Autumn."
</p>
<p>
The aim is for fans to watch the film and then re-experience it as part of Sonic x Shadow Generations. The DLC won't have a strict story relating directly to the film, but is inspired by the Tokyo setting.
</p>
<p>
As for including Reeves, Nakamura stated: "It was an incredibly secretive process, so when we started to implement the voice in the game, we actually weren't told who this voice is. The voice recording was handled by Iizuka-san in the US, so when we received the recorded voice files, we listened to it and felt, is this that actor…?, so we were also surprised after the official announcement from Paramount!" 
</p>
<p>
The Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack is included in the game's digital deluxe edition. The film will be released on 21st December.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, more Sonic news was shared during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-sonic-and-dc-comic-collaboration-at-sonic-central-stream">Sonic Central stream</a>, including new gameplay of Sonic x Shadow Generations and a forthcoming comic collaboration with DC.

		<p>Probably one of the worst kept secrets of recent times has finally been confirmed, the original Horizon Zero Dawn is being remastered for PlayStation 5 and PC. The game will launch on 31st October 2024 and if you own the original PS4 title you can upgrade for $9.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMN-x9goE7M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As well as update the graphics so they match those found in Forbidden West over ten hours of dialogue has been re-recorded and facial animations are improved.</p>
<p>We scored the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review/">a great 8/10 upon its original 2017 release</a>, enjoying the deep sci-fi tale that Guerrilla told, the precision battling against the robots that now roam the Earth, and soaking in the technical showcase that Guerrilla had cooked up on PS4. However, we did find that Aloy was rather&nbsp; lacking character,&nbsp; and I would assume that it’s her dialogue and animations that have been improved.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/03/a-horizon-zero-dawn-ps5-remaster-is-reportedly-in-development/">Horizon Zero Dawn remaster was first reported on in 2022</a>, the initial story from&nbsp;<a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-horizon-zero-dawn-remake-remaster-in-the-works-for-ps5-horizon-multiplayer-game-in-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP1ST</a> and then being backed up by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-horizon-zero-dawn-remaster-is-in-the-works-for-ps5-its-claimed/">VGC</a>, claiming that an updated version of the 2017 hit would bring the title to the newer iteration of Guerrilla Games’ engine from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, updating it with new character models, lighting, animations, and also refining things like accessibility features and add quality of life improvements to the core gameplay.</p>

<p>There have been numerous repots of the game since then including one just last week when Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered was rated by the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40023/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered/">ESRB</a>, with the revitalised game set to come to both PC and PlayStation 5 according to the listing.</p>
<p>Horizon is also getting a LEGO game in the very near future, that looks a lot of fun, and there’s also a fantastic homage to the game in the recently released Astro Bot.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has a release date, and it’s set for 28th February 2025, the long-awaited monster hunting sequel coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Release Date Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dJpKRWYNkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There were plenty of new revealed within the announcement trailer, which debuted a new main monster: the White Wraith.&nbsp;There were plenty of other story teasers, monsters, details on the Scarlet Forest location, and more.</p>
<p>With the release date confirmed, Capcom also explored pre-order options. Pre-ordering will net the Guild Knight Layered Armour and Hope Charm Talisman. A PS Store exclusive is the Digital Mini Artbook.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Premium Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, 3 DLC packs and all this other stuff:</p>


<p>Oh, and if you played Monster Hunter World and Iceborne, then there’s bonus Palico equipment that will be waiting for you – you need to have save data from these games though.</p>
<p>As always, there’s plenty of new ideas being added into the mix with a new Monster Hunter game, even if the main point remains the same.&nbsp;Players will have access to new gadgets and companions like the Seikret, a new creature that you can mount and ride across the open world. The Seikret can also automatically follow the trail to get you to the target monster, and give you time to heal, sharpen your weapons and grab useful items and materials that you meander past. It also has a holster to let you swap between primary and secondary weapons.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Slinger, which is standard gear for hunters in Monster Hunter Wilds and will replace the Wirebug from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. It can shoot out ammo gathered in the environment, and can grapple to draw in distant items (even while riding the Seikret), or interact with certain parts of the environment.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game recently, sharing impressions in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">our Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>. Nic said, “Time will tell how Wilds eventually plays out, but I must say — I am more excited than ever to get my hands on the final game. Just like at the Meowscular Chef’s kitchen, this small taste of a gorgeous offering from Capcom has me desperately wanting more.”</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter is one of Capcom's best-selling franchises, and today, during the September State of Play, Monster Hunter Wilds got its official release date trailer. The game is slated for release on February 28, 2025. If those interested in the game decide to pre-order the game, they will get exclusive bonuses for pre-ordering on PlayStation 5. This includes some cosmetics, such as a talisman, a unique armor set, and a mini digital artbook. The pre-order also comes with save data bonuses, which can be transferred over to Monster Hunter: World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, which can give you cosmetics for your Felynes.&nbsp; At the moment, it's uncertain whether these pre-order exclusives will also be available to those on PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 4th Trailer | Release Date Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZMBqJZW6_9k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this trailer, players got to see some of the high-definition gameplay that they can expect to dive into once the game releases, as well as some of the new monsters that players will be encountering as well as some of the story elements, all of which are showcased in a short trailer of three minutes and a half.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off the Scarlet Forest, one of the new regions that players will get to explore in the upcoming game. Monster hunter Wilds is one of the most highly anticipated games, with the game-winning multiple awards at Gamescom, despite the fact it is not due to release until February next year.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has received multiple trailers thus far, and although they are usually a couple minutes long, it never feels long enough trying to uncover the huge world that Monster Hunter Wilds is shaping up to be.</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d4AJ0NPwifNhAZXSMBQK8R852O9UzVklkCZrJ0WqBwM/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three editions</a> that people can purchase: The Standard Edition, the Deluxe Edition, and the Premium Deluxe Edition, where people will get the most cosmetics and bonuses in the Premium Deluxe Edition.</p>
<p>Capcom will also be confirmed to be an exhibitor at the Tokyo Game Show 2024, which takes place on 26 September, where it's confirmed that they will be showing off Monster Hunter Wilds alongside games such as Street Fighter 6, Monster Hunter Now, and Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, for example.</p>
<p>Whether this means that people will get more trailers for Monster Hunter Wilds will have to wait until September 26, with the event taking place at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET / 3 PM BST.</p>
<p>If you want to know whether the game is worth picking up, Francesco did a <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">preview of the game</a> over at Gamescom.</p>

The game was praised <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai">for its quiet, contemplative moments</a> as much as it’s Akira Kurosawa-style samurai action. Earlier this year, Sucker Punch released a PC port of <em>Tsushima </em>and confirmed that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350484/sony-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-film-director-john-wick-sucker-punch">a movie based on the game is in the works</a>, with <em>John Wick</em> director Chad Stahelski tapped to lead the project.</p><p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/">the blog post announcing the game</a>, Sony stated that <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> was Sucker Punch’s first game built specifically around the PS5. According to the developers, <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>will offer the same kind of beautiful observation moments as its predecessor while adding new features as well.</p><div><figcaption><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>“We have massive sightlines that let you look far across the environment, whole new skies featuring twinkling stars and auroras, even more believable movement from wind on grass and vegetation,” said Andrew Goldfarb, communications manager at Sucker Punch. “Our new setting also gives us the opportunity to introduce new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and even new weapons.”</p><p>Sony didn’t share release date details, only pegging the game to a 2025 release window.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the show must go on, and so it does with today’s State of Play presentation. The 30-minute showcase put a spotlight on upcoming PlayStation 5 games. If you want to watch the full show, you can do that below. If you just want to know the highlights, read on.<br></p></div></div><div><p>Starting off the show is a brief trailer for <em>Astro Bot</em>, which is getting a free update with new speedrun levels and new character cameos from <em>Helldivers </em>and <em>Stellar Blade, </em>among others<em>. </em>The update will launch this fall. </p></div><div><p>Next up is <em>The Midnight Walk</em>, a clay, stop-motion-styled horror game from Moon Hood Studios, the developers who made <em>Lost in Random</em>. The game will come to  PlayStation 5 and PSVR2.</p></div><div><p>Keeping the creepy vibes going but with a bit of a twist is <em>Hell Is Us</em>. The science-fiction soulslike had a moody trailer with some frightening enemies that delve into body horror. </p></div><div><p>We got a new look at <em>Metro Awakening </em>ahead of its November 7 PSVR2 release date. Your mileage may vary on if this is what you were looking for after the series has been dormant for five years, since 2019's <em>Metro Exodus</em>.</p></div><div><p><em>Archeage Chronicles</em> is a fantasy action game that looks like a real tough, fast-paced challenge, but it will also include multiplayer to bring friends along on some of the fights. It’s coming to PS5 in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Well, this is awkward. <em>Palworld</em>, the “<em>Pokémon </em>with Guns” survival game, is here and coming to PlayStation today, fresh off the announcement that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124?_gl=1*1ji0za5*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzIxMzkzMy41OC4xLjE3MjcyMTU5OTcuNTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124?_gl=1*1ji0za5*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzIxMzkzMy41OC4xLjE3MjcyMTU5OTcuNTQuMC4w">Nintendo is suing its developer for patent infringement</a></span>. Get it while you can, I guess.</p></div><div><p>Two classic PlayStation RPGs are coming to PS5 and PS4 in spring 2025. The <em>Lunar Remastered Collection </em>includes both the original <em>Lunar: The Silver Star Story Complete </em>and <em>Lunar: Eternal Blue Complete </em>with updated visuals and widescreen mode.</p></div><div><p>We got a new update on <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em>. This included a brief look at the <em>Radical Reptiles </em>DLC, which adds new playable characters Mondo Gecko and Mona Lisa. The game is also getting a remixed soundtrack with several guest composers. Both additions are available today.</p></div><div><p>Holy shit! Keanu Reeves is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog in a post-launch update for <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations, </em>featuring Reeves’ version of the character from the upcoming <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> movie in levels based on the film. The update will launch on December 12.</p></div><div><p>Bringing back the RPG vibe is <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>. Producer Hironobu Sakaguchi showed a bit of the game’s turn-based battle system and put a spotlight on the soundtrack, which is composed by <em>Final Fantasy </em>legend Nobuo Uematsu. The game launches on December 5 on PlayStation 4 and 5.</p></div><div><p>BioWare showed off some new footage of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, spotlighting Taash, the Qunari companion who we haven’t seen much of before today, and, more notably, a boss fight with a dragon. The game launches on October 31.</p></div><div><p>Next we get a trailer for <em>Alan Wake II</em>’s <em>The Lake House </em>expansion. It’s spooky as fuck and coming in October.</p></div><div><p>Bringing us back to the “big franchise people want more of but in VR this time” trend is <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em>. The PSVR2 game is coming in December.</p></div><div><p>It <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/soul-reaver-remaster-remake-psn-leak-state-of-play-ps5-1851656134&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/soul-reaver-remaster-remake-psn-leak-state-of-play-ps5-1851656134">leaked earlier today</a></span>, but <em>Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered </em>is bringing the classic PlayStation games to PS4 and PS5 on December 10.</p></div><div><p>While it’s not an old PlayStation game, <em>Fear the Spotlight </em>looks a lot like one. Blumhouse’s upcoming horror game was one of the coolest things I played at Summer Game Fest, and it’s coming to PS4 and PS5 on October 22.</p></div><div><p>Next up is <em>Towers of Aghasba</em>, an island-building game coming to early access in November.</p></div><div><p>Epic announced that it’s bringing a splitscreen mode to <em>Lego Fortnite</em> to support local play on one system. Also, there’s an ugly <em>Fortnite </em>DualSense controller coming, with pre-orders going live on October 3<em>.</em></p></div><div><p>Koei Tecmo made an appearance with <em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em>. Along with a new trailer of the upcoming Musou game, the studio confirmed it will launch on January 17.</p></div><div><p>Capcom brought a new trailer for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which spotlighted a terrifying fight with a giant sea creature, a giant bear, and some silly little guys dancing. It has something for everyone. The game launches on February 28.</p></div><div><p><em>Horizon </em>gets a big ol’ spotlight with both a new trailer for <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> (which for some reason doesn’t acknowledge the game is also coming to Switch), as well as the rumored <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> coming to PC and PS5. It has re-recorded mocap and brings the game up to the level of visual fidelity its sequel <em>Forbidden West</em>. It will launch on October 31. If you own the original PS4 version, you can upgrade to the new one for $9.99.</p></div><div><p><em>Stellar Blade </em>is getting a photo mode update, which is available today. Also available today is the game’s soundtrack on all your favorite streaming services. This game sounds like it has some bangers, actually? Oh, also, <em>Stellar Blade </em>is getting a <em>Nier </em>collaboration later this year. We briefly see what looks like a 2B skin for the main character.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="501baa244c7111ec1214aacb4883bb2c" data-recommend-id="image://501baa244c7111ec1214aacb4883bb2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2880" data-height="1800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie and Riley are seen in a moment from Left Behind during Sony's State of Play showcase." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Riley are seen in a moment from Left Behind during Sony's State of Play showcase." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="501baa244c7111ec1214aacb4883bb2c" data-recommend-id="image://501baa244c7111ec1214aacb4883bb2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2880" data-height="1800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie and Riley are seen in a moment from Left Behind during Sony's State of Play showcase." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next, Sony gave a few updates on games coming to PlayStation Plus.

It looks a lot more freeform than the original, which dealt mainly with a land under siege from a foreign invader.</p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p>“People come to North to disappear,” a man says at the start of the trailer. He’s later killed by a wandering female samurai who then sets out across lush valleys, dense autumn forests, and beautiful snowy fields in search of something —though we don’t quite know what. The end of the trailer teases the mysterious warrior Atsu looking out at the mountain Yōtei alongside an allied wolf while dual-wielding swords. </p><p> “This area was outside the rule of Japan, and filled with sprawling grasslands, snowy tundras, and unexpected dangers,” Sucker Punch comms manager Andrew Goldfarb wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over on the PlayStation Blog</a></span>&nbsp;following the announcement. “It’s a far cry from the organized samurai clans who lived in Tsushima, and it’s the setting for an original story we can’t wait to tell.”</p><p>Taking place hundreds of years after the first game, it seems like <em> Ghost of Yōtei</em> will be a fresh start, offering the chance for players to explore a new cast of characters, betrayals, and, most importantly, a vast new map. While some fans will no doubt be sad to leave the protagonist of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, Jin Sakai, behind, hopefully the new slate gives this game the opportunity to make some bold choices and explore different kinds of gameplay.</p><p> It will also no doubt look amazing on the PS5 Pro, adding something for players who were initially skeptical of the expensive new hardware to look forward too. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The team at Shift Up has revealed that the long-awaited photomode function is headed to Stellar Blade. This will be made available in a future update, allowing players to set Eve up in various poses, tweaking the environment and adding filters as they see fit. It’s a feature that many believe the game should have been released with, but it’s better late than never, right?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-you-dare">Don’t You Dare</h2>



<p>The introduction of photomode in Stellar Blade will inevitably lead to more than a few lewd pictures surfacing on social media. Part of me believes that’s why Shift Up neglected to include this feature in the first place. As soon as it drops, gamers worldwide will be flocking back to Stellar Blade to don the skimpiest outfits imaginable and go wild snapping digital photos.</p>



<p>That’s not all that’s coming, though. The team also confirmed that a digital soundtrack is being released on streaming platforms, allowing users to bask in the battle tracks or ambient compositions that unravel as they’re exploring the semi-open-world environments of Stellar Blade.</p>



<p>Later this year, a Stellar Blade x Nier Automata crossover is coming, marking the arrival of the game’s first substantial expansion. It basically writes itself at this point, though.</p>

The title promises to deliver the most intense combat of any game in franchise history.</p><p>As seen in the stirring new video, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> begins during the dawn of an era of tremendous upheaval in the Three Kingdoms, when the original protagonist—a traveling martial artist with amnesia—finds himself in the middle of great conflict. Here, the game’s hero partakes in this dramatic tale of ancient China, where he plays an active role in the storyline while giving players first-hand experience in the drama of the war-torn land. Throughout the journey, players will make various choices as the protagonist—but he too carries a secret—which will have an impact on the Three Kingdoms, helping illustrate a turbulent time in history in exciting new ways.</p><p>Throughout his battles, the nameless hero will sometimes forge into combat on his own, while at other times, he’ll join alongside allied officers and soldiers to storm towards large forces of enemies. Players can rely on the strength of accompanying Musou officers, issue commands to units, or charge forward into oncoming armies, varying up strategies to conquer the deadly battlefield in this epic showcase of 1 vs. 1,000 <a title="Genres > Action [2,184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</p><p>Throughout <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, there will also be many well-known and powerful officers such as Lu Bu waiting to test the young martial artist’s skill. Battles against these officers who possess near superhuman strength results in combat that is both highly action-oriented and challenging while keeping players on the edge of their seats throughout every encounter. This extraordinary power also thrives within your allies as the Companion officer that accompanies the protagonist can become temporarily playable if certain conditions are met during battle, leading to an exhilarating experience of clearing out enemies with dominance on a completely different scale!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

      </div>
<p>In the visuals department, Zero Dawn will have new shaders and textures, upgraded character models, and "more than 10 hours of re-recorded conversation mo-cap," which means a whole lot of the dialogue and conversations in Zero Dawn should see significant improvements. The game will also support Sony's DualSense controllers with their adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, as well as Sony's 3D audio tech.</p><p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is set to release on October 31. If you already own the original Horizon Zero Dawn, you can upgrade to the PS5 version for $10.</p>

Announced during the PlayStation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">State of Play</a>, the next entry in Capcom's massive Monster Hunter series will land early next year, and there's a new trailer to go along with the date.</p><p>The trailer showed off some new monsters, including an aquatic one that looks like a stingray, along with some more glimpses at the big bad of the story, Arkveld. On top of the story teases, there were small glimpses at some gameplay features, like the ability to use environmental hazards with your grappling hook. They also showed some hunter throwing barrel bombs instead of just placing them, which may allow for more ranged attacks with the barrels.</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>Dead Space Remake (PS5)</li>

In other PlayStation Plus news, The Last of Us Part 1 will join the PlayStation Plus catalogue this Thursday 26th September, ahead of the franchise's annual The Last of Us day. 
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blood-omen-legacy-kain">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a> and Dino Crisis will be added to the PS Plus Classics catalogue later this year.
</p>
<p>"A fine piece of craft and a sumptuous reworking of the setting," wrote Edwin Evans-Thirlwell in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-remake-review-a-horror-original-re-engineered-as-a-franchise-prequel">Eurogamer's Dead Space remake review</a>. "The results can be compelling, but make sure you play the 2008 game first."</p>

            <p>If you, like me, are a fan of Guerrilla's Horizon series, you are going to want to have a Grazer at this.</p>
<p>During this evening's State of Play, PlayStation announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> - which is described as a "playful and light-hearted" take on Guerrilla's franchise - will launch on 14th November across platforms.</p>
<p>In addition, the team gave us another look at the bricky chaos we can get up to on the game's release. You can check out the latest trailer below.</p>

<p>Lego Horizon Adventures will be available in a Standard and Digital Deluxe Edition. The Digital Deluxe Edition includes several bonuses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roller Coaster Customisation: </strong>No need to choose between roof or coaster; you can have both and bring some theme park fun to Mother's Heart!</li>
<li><strong>Three iconic Horizon outfits:</strong> Pay homage to Aloy's adventures in the icy north with the Banuk Armor, channel your inner Eclipse with the Shadow Stalwart outfit, or fight metal with metal as "Alloy" Aloy!</li>
<li><strong>Ratchet and Rivet outfits:</strong> Join the thrilling journey as intergalactic super-mechanic Ratchet or trans-dimensional Resistance fighter Rivet.</li>
<li><strong>Sackboy outfit:</strong> Trading cloth and stuffing for bricks and studs, LittleBigPlanet's Sackboy is available to join the party!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you fancy pre-ordering, you will be able to do so from 3rd October onwards. This will get you a Lego version of the iconic Shield-Weaver outfit in-game, regardless of which edition you plump for.</p>
<p>You will be able to find Lego Horizon Adventures on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lego-horizon-adventures/">PlayStation Store,</a> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2428810/LEGO_Horizon_Adventures/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lego-horizon-adventures">Epic Game Store</a>, and the Nintendo eShop.</p>

It wasn't much of a secret given it'd already been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-for-ps5-and-pc">rated by the ESRB</a>, but Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> remaster is finally official, and it'll be launching for PS5 and PC on 31st October this year.
</p>
<p>
Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered (which was first rumoured all the way back in 2022) is the work of series developer Guerrilla Games and the Sony owned Nixxes, and promises a range of enhancements for the now seven-year-old original. 
</p>
<p>
As per Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-tonights-playstation-state-of-play-right-here-with-us">latest State of Play broadcast</a>, it'll include "more than ten hours" of rerecorded conversation motion capture, as well as "countless" graphical improvements said to give the remaster the same visual fidelity of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. These include upgraded character models, improved shaders and textures, enhanced conversation cameras to go with the new mo-cap, plus support for 3D audio, DualSense haptic triggers, and even your old saves.

<p>
Accessibility wise, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered supports many of the features introduced in  Horizon Forbidden West, including remappable controls, haptic cues, and assist toggles.
</p>
<p>
Sony is also touting native support for its upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro, although it gets bit vague on the specific enhancements your <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">£700</a> will get you, promsing "improved" graphical features and "ultra-high fidelity at blazing fast framerates". 
</p>
<p>
As for the PC version, it'll include the PlayStation overlay with Trophy support, as well as a range of PC-exclusive features. Expect support for ultra-wide resolutions, NVIDIA DLSS 3, and AMD FSR 3.1, with more details due to be shared at a later date.
</p>
<p>
And if that grabs you, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered - which includes all content seen in the Complete Edition - will cost $49.99 USD on the PlayStation Store, Steam, and Epic. Plus, there's some good news on the upgrade front, with Sony confirming existing owners of Horizon Zero Dawn or Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition (including those that acquired the game through PlayStation's Play At Home initiative) can upgrade to the new PS5 or PC version for $9.99.
