			<p>The WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers final PC system requirements have been confirmed, and they are significantly lower than the previously known requirements, although with a caveat that doesn't bode too well.</p>



<p>As confirmed on the game's Steam store page, the game requires at least an Intel Core i5-8400/AMD Ryzen 5 1600 CPU, 1 6GB RAM, and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB/AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB GPU. The recommended specifications aren't significantly higher than the minimum, as the developer recommends an Intel Core i7-9700/AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU, 16 GB RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070/AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT/INTEL Arc A750 GPU. These specifications, however, were tested with NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR enabled with no mention of target resolution or framerate, so it's impossible to say how well the game will run at any given resolution on these system configurations.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>MINIMUM</strong>:<br>OS: Windows10 64bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400/AMD Ryzen 5 1600<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB/AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 60 GB available space<br>Additional Notes: HDD Supported, SSD Recommended. The above specifications were tested with DLSS/FSR enabled.<br></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong>:<br>OS: Windows10/11 64bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700/AMD Ryzen 5 5500<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070/AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT/INTEL Arc A750<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 60 GB available space<br>Additional Notes: SSD Required. The above specifications were tested with DLSS/FSR enabled.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As already mentioned, early WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers PC system requirements were shared a few months back, and the recommended specifications were much beefier, listing more powerful CPUs and GPUs and way more RAM than the updated system requirements shared today. You can check the previous requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-opens-pre-orders-and-shares-pc-specs-ahead-of-july-24-launch/">here.</a></p>



<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on July 24. The game will also be added to the Xbox Game Pass library on day one.</p>

            <p>Virtuos, the company best known for working with other studios to deliver the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-remastered">Dark Souls Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, are reportedly preparing to lay off staff. 300 people are cited as being at risk.</p>
<p>That's according to reporting posted to Bluesky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t">Gauthier Andres</a> of French outlet Origami. Andres' post dropped same day Virtuos lead game designer Adrien Jouannet appeared on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> livestream to talk about the studio's work with CD Projekt on the futuristic RPG's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more">latest update</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Andres reports that 300 Virtuos staff are at risk of redundancy, or around 7% of the company's total staff. <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/about-us/">Virtuos' website</a> cites them as employing over 4200 people in total.</p>
<p>The report suggests these layoffs will primarily affect Virtuos' workers in China, but that staff in other regions of the world will also be hit, including at the French studios that worked with Bethesda on Oblivion Remastered. As of writing, Virtuos have studios based in 25 locations across the world, with five, including UK-based Third Kind Games and a new studio in South Korea, having been acquired by the company since the start of August 2024.

</span></p><p>"Virtuos is said to have made significant efforts on Oblivion, with a policy of over-delivering on quality relative to the budget, and a contract without royalties (no bonuses tied to the game's success)," reads a translation of Andres' post <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/gauthier-andres-origami-mass-layoffs-are-currently-underway-at-virtuos-the-studio-behind-oblivion-remastered-and-the-upcoming-mgs-%CE%94-300-people.1245135/">on ResetEra</a> which closely matches a machine translation we've done, "The result: teams were pushed to their limits for a pure showcase project, with its profitability likely to be questioned."</p>
<p>It also asserts that working on the likes of Oblivion Remastered and Snake Eater were part of an effort by Virtuos to shift their strategy towards working on bigger projects or series, rather than lighter remakes. We've reached out to Virtuos for comment.</p>

            <p>Brendan and I once had a podcast conversation about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a> in which we predicted that IO Interactive would be limited by James Bond's license holders MGM to a maximum of three toilet drownings, one fish spearing, and absolutely no duck explosions. While we can't yet confirm specifics, IO's franchise director Jonathan Lacaille has said that MGM were "a lot more daring than (the studio) thought" in a recent chat with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/how-much-hitman-dna-is-in-007-first-light-io-interactive-talks-james-bond/">Very Gary Computing</a>.</p>
<p>It doesn't sound like they restricted IO very much at all, actually, aside from asking them not to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>'s Bond "a killing machine!". Lacaille actually credits Hitman's, um, restraint in helping them secure the license in the first place.</p>

<p>"In Hitman, you shoot maybe once per level, or not at all, sometimes," Lacaille says, which he thinks helped "open the conversation" with MGM. "If you get to shoot, you kind of fail the mission", he says later. I have been harping on about this forever re: Hitman's pointless amount of guns for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth game</a>, and it is very nice to be vindicated.</p>
<p>This said, it sounds like First Light's Bond might be a bit more gung-ho anyway. Hitman is "a very patient game," Lacaille says, "versus First Light, the character - in a sense - is young and a bit reckless, and sometimes doesn’t have enough patience". Which lines up with earlier comments about IO's Bond being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">"more reckless"</a> than Ian Hitman.</p>
<p>"If the other game is more methodical," he continues, "this one will be more about making you think fast under pressure, giving you a lot of options and you have to think – right, or left, or do you take all these guards? Do you blow your cover? We bring you forward all the time. So in that sense, the game is probably not as open".</p>
<p>But the game will open up more "when it makes sense to," says Lacaille. "When we want to make an homage to what the franchise is about, which is sometimes very big stunts and cinematic moments".</p>
<p>First Light is set for release next year, but IO have already spoken about the potential to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">spin out a trilogy</a> from the game, as well as hinting toward Hitman-style<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-sounds-like-itll-be-getting-hitman-style-post-launch-missions-but-with-more-actiony-things"> post-launch missions</a>, possibly with all the pisser drownings my awful heart could desire.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-bonds-license-holders-let-io-be-a-lot-more-daring-than-the-hitman-studio-thought]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t">BlueSky by Gauthier Andres</a>, a reporter for the French-language publication Origami, seven percent of the company's workforce will be subject to layoffs. That's 300 people.</p>
<p>These layoffs will allegedly be across the United States, Asia, Europe, and three branches in France. Andres' sources said the initial layoffs will affect those in China.</p>

<p>"Virtuos is said to have made significant efforts on Oblivion, with a policy of over-spending on quality and a royalty-free contract (without bonuses tied to the game's success)," Andres wrote (via machine translation). "The result: teams put under severe strain for a purely showcase game, whose profitability is doomed to be questioned."</p>
<p>The company reportedly put a freeze on raises and reduction on bonuses back in February of this year. This move led to questions regarding layoffs from staff to Virtuos' management. As a result, Andres said a strike is taking place at Virtuos Lyon, which will protest the layoffs and aim to "protect the future capacity of the branch".</p>
<p>According to sources, Virtuos is also making a move towards the use of generative AI. "In one year, we've gone from a few group-level presentations to basic but mandatory training for employees," Andres was told.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Virtuos for comment on the report.</p>
<p>Layoffs have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">a depressingly regular</a> story in the video games industry over the past few years. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">Microsoft began another round of layoffs at the company impacting in excess of 9000 people</a>. This saw games cancelled and studios closed.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/studio-behind-oblivion-remastered-one-of-2025s-biggest-hits-subject-to-mass-layoffs-report]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The team behind the upcoming Mortal Kombat movie sequel - aptly known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> - has released a new teaser for the film, with a certain Mr Johnny Cage taking centre stage (poetry!).</p>
<p>The teaser itself is called Uncaged Fury, and sees Karl Urban's Johnny Cage taking on a load of would-be assailants by whacking them all with pipes and leaping around in a rather athletic way. This leaping includes him jumping over a recently launched Bazooka missile, which despite being aimed at the ground manages to miss Johnny and hit… actually, I won't say, because you really do have to see it to believe it.</p>
<p>You can check out the new teaser trailer for Mortal Kombat 2 below.</p>

<p>In addition to Urban, Adeline Rudolph - who previously starred in Netflix's The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-adds-another-sabrina-star-this-time-as-kitana">will play Princess Kitana</a>. Meanwhile, fellow Sabrina alum Tati Gabrielle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharteds-tati-gabrielle-set-to-play-jade-in-mortal-kombat-2-film">Kitana's bodyguard, Jade</a>.</p>
<p>This is not Gabrielle's first foray into the video game adaptation scene. She also starred as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-uncharted-film-is-the-treasure-ive-been-looking-for">Jo Braddock in 2022's Uncharted film adaptation</a>, and recently starred in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">The Last of Us' second season as Nora</a>, "a military medic struggling to come to terms with the sins of her past".</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film when it came out a few years ago, calling it boring.</p>
<p>"There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent the Mortal Kombat movie from being a complete disaster, but it's tough to recommend when it costs £16 to rent online. A tenner straight to Blu-ray feels like a better fit," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat movie review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-trailer-sees-johnny-cage-jumping-over-a-bazooka-missile-with-some-very-wide-legs]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Imagine your perfect island retreat. Perhaps there’s white sandy beaches, possibly lush green forests, or maybe mountainous terrain is more your jam. Now imagine a quaint town, with fountains on every corner and houses built straight into the cliff-face. You head to the harbour to watch the fishing boats and look out to the picturesque horizon. Feel more chilled? Me too.</p>
<p>No, you haven’t just fallen into a relaxation exercise hosted by your court-appointed therapist because you went too far with your road rage. Again. This is Islanders: New Shores.</p>
<p><iframe title="ISLANDERS: New Shores | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3hCDB-29iI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Islanders: New Shores claims to be a minimalist city-building game, but I’d argue this description is too simple in its own right, because there’s nothing minimal about the joy this relaxing game brings to the player. The gameplay is gloriously simple and beautifully accessible, not needing to mess around with complex menus and long-winded tutorials. Dropping you straight into the first of twenty levels, you receive a quick overview of the basics of camera movement and placing buildings and you’re off.</p>
<p>As the levels progress, you unlock new and exciting buildings to add to your island. Each new building has its own specific placement requirements, including variations in height, light levels, nature and accompanying buildings. It’s easy to get the hang of which buildings go where to rack up the most points. Plus, the more points you gain, the more boons you unlock to help you on your paradise-building adventure.</p>


<p>Even though Islanders: New Shores is a score-based game, it feels in no way competitive. You find you want to rack up more points because then you get to keep on playing. Because Islanders: New Shores is addictively relaxing. And if the point-scoring feels like it gets in the way of you achieving your chillest form, there’s a tranquil sandbox mode to potter around in too.</p>
<p>So how does Islanders: New Shores manage to be so darn soothing? The original soundtrack sets the mood with peaceful vibes for you to unwind to. Plus, the gameplay visuals truly are stunning. The combinations of vibrant colours are serene and dreamlike, the building designs intricately detailed. It’s important to also mention the islands themselves. With each new level, the player gets to choose which island and feature they’d like to play with next, but even if the basic features are similar, you’ll never see the same island twice. New layouts and landscapes keep each level fresh and interesting.</p>
<p>The same goes for the buildings. The more of each structure you place, the more variants you’ll get to see. Each new harbour has different boats in it. Each new mansion has a different rooftop configuration. For some structures, like the houses, seaweed farms and platforms, the game provides you with different building shapes and encourages you to slot them together, tetris-style, to maximise your points. The game guides you by clearly marking when your building can or can’t fit into certain spaces and displaying the score you’ll gain – or lose – when you set it down. Choose wisely, because there’s no moving your buildings after the fact and hitting “undo” too much can reduce your score multiplier at the end of the level. This can be a bit tricksy, especially when the subtlety of the selection highlight occasionally makes it unclear as to what you’re going to come out with once you’ve tapped your controller button.</p>

<p>You would think with the requirement for jigsaw-puzzle precision placement you need to be able to get in real close to slot your buildings in with accuracy to maximise your score. Sadly, the zoom option can be a little hit and miss at times. The taller your island, the less you’ll be able to see of the items you place closer to sea level. This is a real shame because the intricate details of the building designs deserve to be admired up close and personal.</p>
<p>So now you know, Islanders: New Shores is so much more than just a minimalist city-building game. The radiant visuals and atmospheric soundtrack add a sense of tranquillity to this easily accessible and relaxingly straightforward paradise-builder.</p>

<p>What a find!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Pikachu" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b9699422f05d/pikachu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's amazing what you can find in the bottom of a bin sometimes, right? Not that we frequently go scurrying around in trash, you understand... But y'know, there are definitely occasions when something rare and potentially very valuable has been unknowingly thrown away.</p>
<p>Case in point, Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ElbowDeepInElmo/">ElbowDeepInElmo</a> (lovely...) has posted images of a Pikachu statue that they state was rescued from the trash by a printing company responsible for the early runs of Pokémon cards (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pikachu-statue-that-was-salvaged-from-the-trash-turns-out-to-be-official-promotional-material-from-1999-us-premiere-of-pokemon-the-first-movie/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>According to the poster, it's not just any statue, but rather a piece of promotional material that was used for <strong>Pokémon: The First Movie</strong> when the film had its premiere at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood in 1999.</p>

<p>The Pikachu is sadly missing its tail, which was likely thrown away at the same time as the main statue itself, but the poster is hoping to have a replacement tail 3D printed to make the statue complete once again.</p>
<p>It's also been made clear that the statue is not currently for sale or trade at the time of writing. We reckon it might be worth quite a bit at this point, mind you, even if it is missing its tail.</p>
<p>You can <em>just about</em> see the statue in the archival footage from the premiere below, which in itself is a wild trip down memory lane, even if you weren't there yourself. Ah, those were the days...</p>

<p><em>What do you make of this extraordinary find? Have you got any rare or interesting Pokémon merchandise or promotional material from back in the day? Let us know with a comment.</em></p></section>

Chinese action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is out in a week, and it's high time we heard about the system requirements, which don't seem that high for a game in which you can lob lightning at supersized peacocks and leave a delicate furrow through new-fallen snow.</p>
<p>An Intel Core i5-8400, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060, 16GB of RAM and 60GB's worth of SSD are all they're asking for the chance to become an amnesiac pirate swordswoman during the age of the Ming dynasty, tasked with murdering a whole lot of bird people before she becomes a bird person herself.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
We have not covered Wuchang since 2021, when Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-looks-like-a-chinese-take-on-bloodborne">pronounced it a Chinese Bloodborne</a>, with the requisite lamentation that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> still isn't on PC. Little birds tell me that developers Leenzee have <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-brings-color-to-the-muted-soulslike-genre">tweaked the visuals since then</a> to make the game's setting, Shu, less redolent of Yharnam. Still, parallels abound. As in From Software's game, Shu is subject to a monstrous plague: in this case, it gives everybody feathers. The result is not a realm of jovial bluetit shopkeepers plus the occasional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_(film)">sobbing mutant Natalie Portman</a>, but a place of bossfights and upgrades. Here's a trailer to catch you up.

Playing as Wuchang, the titular pirate lady, you must rediscover your own past while trying to stave off the Feathering disease. You can use "Red Mercury" to unlock new techniques - guessing it comes from bodies, not pharmacies - and enchant a variety of weapons to inflict escalating grades of buttkick. "As you piece together Wuchang's lost memories, your choices will lead you to one of several endings - each determined by the choices made, secrets unearthed and the allies you choose to trust," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/">the Steam page comments</a>.

<p>Chaser: the Nvidia hardware above makes use of DLSS 4. If you're not hip to such jargon, don't panic, because I know somebody who is. Here's our hardware editor James Archer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">Nvidia DLSS 4 explainer</a>.</p>
<p>
Chaser 2: If <em>you</em> had to turn into a bird monster, what kind would you prefer? I used to have a thing for albatrosses, with their ginormous wings. They can stay aloft for weeks, allegedly, sleeping in mid-air. No idea whether they're good at parrying, but they should have decent reach.</p>
<p>Also, while we're talking boids, what's the best collective noun for a group of soulslikes? A host? A covert? A murder? OK, I'll shut up now. Wuchang launches on 24th July.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bird-bashing-soulslike-wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-some-pc-system-specs-and-they-are-not-brutal]]></content:encoded>

A standalone expansion to 2023’s entertainingly authentic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business takes Robo’s relentless rampage off the scum-riddled streets of Old Detroit and up through the heavily guarded heights of OMNI Tower in an all-new, 10-hour killing spree. The bad news is that with precious few new weapons and enemy types, the action of Unfinished Business never really elevates enough to match the skyward trajectory of its setting or distinguish itself as little more than a replay of the original. There’s still plenty of ultra violence to indulge in here, but it’s a form of mindless fun that’s as familiar as it is ferocious. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not unlike the 2012 sci-fi splatterfest movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/dredd-3d">Dredd</a>, the action of Unfinished Business is contained almost entirely within the one highrise building and sees RoboCop making his way from the ground floor to its upper reaches in search of some stolen OCP equipment. It borrows a bit of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> as well, since Robo is initially led along by an anonymous assistant on the other end of a two-way radio, and that helps to lend a welcome air of mystery to the story’s opening half – even if it doesn’t eventually pay off with any shocking plot twists like Irrational Games’ underwater classic.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As was the case with the previous game, the success of Unfinished Business’ storytelling largely hinges on the often hilarious deadpan delivery of original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/robocop">RoboCop</a> actor Peter Weller in the main role. Whether he’s repeating iconic lines from the movies or making subtle mockery of almost everyone he meets, Weller’s performance is a noticeable cut above the rest. Admittedly, that’s not a super high bar to clear since the supporting cast often sound like they’re voiced by hastily dashed-out placeholder recordings someone forgot to fill in with the real ones, and each seem to draw from the same shallow pool of character heads, making it tough to really distinguish one from the other. In the end, I was happy to go along for the ride all the way to Unfinished Business’ bullet-riddled gore-gasm of a climax, in spite of the fact that I didn’t particularly feel compelled to focus on anyone other than the scumbags standing squarely in front of my ironsights.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Business As Usual</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the story, though, Unfinished Business is a fairly flat 10 hours because while it increases the amount of bad guys you have to shoot, it doesn’t do nearly enough to expand the variety of ways you do it. If you’ve played 2023’s Rogue City, then you’ve already experienced the bulk of what Unfinished Business’ combat has to offer. Once again, you’re able to ricochet bullets off walls to stylishly snipe enemies hidden behind cover, perform breach-and-clears on almost every door you come across in bloodsplattered slow-motion, and shoot explosive barrel after explosive barrel as you RoboStop and RoboDrop absolutely every criminal you come across. It’s all presented with the same fan-pleasing flair, from the green Apple IIe-like graphics of Robo’s heads-up display to the iconic theme music that swells along with the increasing enemy numbers, and that certainly still goes a long way. It’s just a shame to see the skill and Auto 9 upgrade systems copied across seemingly unchanged. You unlock the exact same perks like armour-piercing rounds and the ability to automatically deflect incoming enemy fire, just a little faster this time thanks to the story’s shorter runtime. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’ve played 2023’s Rogue City, then you’ve already experienced the bulk of what Unfinished Business’ combat has to offer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a handful of new mechanical enemy types to contend with at least, though none of them really shake things up to a dramatic degree. I did find myself making more consistent use of Robo’s returning slow-mo skill in order to combat the fast-moving robobombs that rapidly roll towards you, as well as the swarms of flying security drones that dart unpredictably through the air above. But while the nimble killbots that cartwheel around the place seem threatening at first blush, they quickly prove to be about as resilient as a jar of baby food as I either shattered their robot skulls with a quick burst of bullets or simply picked them up and disposed of them like katana-wielding Kleenexes, even on the hardest difficulty setting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">OMNI Tower itself does offer the occasional interesting space to host the slaughter in, from the vibrant video arcade and cinema found in the relaxation zone to the trashbag-strewn underbelly of waste management (complete with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope">Star Wars</a>-style trash compactor to frantically blast your way out of). Those are the exception, though, and most of the carnage takes place in the charmless concrete corridors in between. That’s to be expected from a tour through a corporate dystopia, sure, but it doesn’t make for a lot of fun surprises. Despite the striking gallery of gore and particle effects that shower over each firefight, there were times that Unfinished Business’ drab interiors made it feel less like a thrilling action adventure and more like wandering in circles through a shopping mall carpark trying to work out where I left my 6000 SUX. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the biggest problem I had with Unfinished Business’ gunplay was the same one I found with 2023’s Rogue City. That is, Robo’s signature Auto 9 – blessed as it is with unlimited ammo, easily upgradeable attributes, and an undeniable cool factor – makes the dozens of other firearms found throughout the campaign almost entirely redundant. It’s just so overequipped to deal with everything that’s thrown your way that I never found a good enough reason to holster it. It would be akin to a Star Wars adventure in which you default to the use of a lightsaber – you’re probably not ever going to clip it to your belt and pick up a Tusken Raider’s gaffi stick to crack heads with instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one exception: the cryo cannon that’s introduced in the second half proved to be worth a few charged-up trigger squeezes, especially since its sub-zero rounds turn your targets into instant ice sculptures that can be subsequently shattered like the T-1000. That’s a time-honored video game tradition that dates back to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/duke-nukem-3d">Duke Nukem 3D</a>. But otherwise I almost never felt the need to bend over and grab any other dropped firearms – and not just because Robo appears to have the knee joints of an 80-year-old man (as well as the voice of a 78-year-old). <span tabindex="-1" role="button">Tap to Reveal</span>  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Murphy’s Law</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfinished Business’ structure is effectively built around a cycle of using your Auto 9 to deep-six hordes of mercenaries, pausing to settle disputes between citizens in side missions that veer from moderately humorous to completely banal, and then flicking some switches and turning valves in its basic puzzle sections to open the path ahead before resuming the unrelenting blaze of glorious gore. There are only a handful of detours along the way that at least try to mix up the otherwise predictable pacing, with varying degrees of success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one flashback mission we get to pull on the kevlar-lined vest of Alex Murphy in his pre-RoboCop days, as he and his fellow officers are dispatched to investigate the whereabouts of some known perps. I enjoyed this small glimpse of Murphy’s origins in the Metro South precinct even if the stilted banter between his squad was more than a little wide of the mark, and there were some fun Easter eggs to find here including a memo that referenced the ominous rise of a new criminal on the scene that I won't spoil here. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the setting of this sequence lacks imagination given that its abandoned mill surroundings are a bit too similar to the site of Murphy’s infamous ‘crucifixion’ scene witnessed in the first film, and its combat feels somewhat topsy turvy. Where RoboCop must scramble to find OCP charges in order to replenish his rapidly depleting health, regular flesh-and-bone Murphy somehow magically regains it in between shootouts. That’s typical for a lot of first-person shooters, but it’s less of a contrast to playing as a walking tank than I’d been expecting. On the flipside, Murphy can only wield his boring old service pistol, which is frustrating because this was one of the few times I actually wanted to pick up a gun I found but couldn’t. It all makes for a diversion that’s important to the plot, but not particularly compelling to play.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[RoboCop] always seems to be lit with ambient neon lights like he’s emerging out of the driver’s side of a Ford Taurus on the poster for the 1987 film. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the same can’t be said for the late-game level where you get to pilot an ED-209 mech. This fabulously frenetic stretch of fan service allows you to use twin arm cannons to shred through each hapless human like they’re that one poor bastard executive that probably should have hid in the bathroom during the original ED-209 demonstration, blast through concrete walls with rocket barrages, and even trample over a model of Old Detroit’s skyline while battling rival robots like you’re revelling in a small-scale clash of Kaiju. Sure, it’s perhaps not as cathartic as it could have been given that by that point I’d already very efficiently turned hundreds of mercenaries into mincemeat with Robo’s Auto 9. But I can’t pretend I wasn’t grinning like an idiot through the entire sequence, which ratchets up the carnage to ludicrous levels and doesn’t linger long enough to outstay the welcome of playing as a near-invincible killing machine.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite First-Person Shooter Campaigns</h3><p>Trigger warning!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I never got tired of seeing RoboCop himself onscreen either. As was the case with the previous game, his polished steel armour looks absolutely spot-on and he always seems to be lit with ambient neon lights like he’s emerging out of the driver’s side of a Ford Taurus on the poster for the 1987 film. That said, outside of the smooth lines of Robo’s movie-accurate character model there’s a noticeable roughness to Unfinished Business, at least on the PlayStation 5 version that I played. During my time with it I suffered frame rate dips, audio dropouts, animation glitches, dodgy lip syncing, ridiculous moon physics during slow-motion breaches, characters disappearing completely during finishing moves and story cutscenes, and even the occasional crash to the home screen. After a while I started to wonder if the “Unfinished Business” title was a nod to RoboCop’s everlasting quest for justice or merely a reference to the launch state of the game itself. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">As someone who delighted in blasting through the original RoboCop: Rogue City, my hopes for this standalone Unfinished Business expansion were higher than a junkie on Nuke. However, outside of the exhilarating playable cameo from ED-209, there’s really not enough new here to make another 10 hours as everyone’s favourite baby food-slurping supercop worth going out of your way for. Peter Weller’s deadpan delivery is as endearing as ever, and the cryo gun is an icy blast (though ironically still not quite as cool to use as the Auto 9), but the supporting cast of characters is seriously shoddy and the raft of performance issues on PlayStation 5 make for a bumpier ride than accelerating up the exit ramp from the Metro West carpark. If you thirst for some more Auto 9 bursts flourished with TJ Lazer-inspired twirls then RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business will certainly scratch the itch on your trigger finger, but it’s far from the future of law enforcement. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Osprey Games has announced <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition. Celebrating the game's 10th anniversary, this limited printing of the fantasy skirmish miniatures game brings high-quality materials and the most comprehensive version of the game's rules.</p>

<h2>The <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition Announcement</h2>

<p>The <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition is a solid gift for both newcomers and veterans to designer Joseph A. McCullough's award-winning skirmish miniatures game. It is a leatherette-bound copy of the second edition of the core rulebook embossed with the silver-foiled logo. In addition, it is protected in a slipcase with twin book ribbons, ensuring the book is built to last.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostgrave-limited-deluxe-edition-book-banner.jpg?itok=TzJSETB0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostgrave-limited-deluxe-edition-book-banner.jpg?itok=lqGXptMY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Notably, this copy of the game includes rules for its rarest, most mysterious artifact. Yes, this book contains rules for the Ring of Transference. This is notable because prior printings of the game contained the item in the rulebook, but no rules or mechanics. If you don't like hunting down errata, this book helpfully provides.</p>

<p>Frostgrave takes place within the frozen ruins of the ancient city of Felstad. Each player takes on the role of a wizard specializing in one of ten schools of magic, as well as a band of followers. These followers then duke it out in elaborate wizard duels and fights. All so one arcane scholar can learn the secrets of the city's long-lost empire.</p>

<p>The game won several awards in 2016. Those honors include Best Miniatures Game at UK Expo 2015, a 2016 Silver Ennie for Best Miniature Product of the Year, and Best Miniatures Game award at Beasts of War 2015. It is a miniature-agnostic game, which makes it considerably cheaper to get into compared to the money sinks of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition will be available exclusively on Osprey Games' website. The book is set to ship out on November 18 in the United States and on November 20 in the UK.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>"When our fathers stood against the Persians," spake Greek statesman and general Pericles, "they had no such resources as we have now". Time, of course, muddies the clear waters of specifics, but I'm basically sure he was talking about the ability for each of his men to keep a thirty foot ladder snuggled safely away in their rectal passage just in case they encountered any massive walls.</p>
<p>Which is probably where Total War got the idea from. Since launch, The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> series has given each troop, from the lowliest Chaos Chosen to the bravest and most beautiful ratman, the ability to magic a ladder from nowhere during sieges. There's a<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3425174065"> mod for Total War: Warhammer 3 that removes them</a>, but now the end of arse ladders is getting official support, including tweaks to hopefully teach the AI how to behave without them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Joining the ladder changes is a rebalance to siege equipment, and the first of many planned settlement layout reworks. All this comes courtesy of a new Proving Grounds beta, as detailed by battle team lead Milcho Vasilev in <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/76-total-war-warhammer-iii-siege-proving-grounds">a new blog</a>. Proving grounds means the changes will only exist in a separate beta branch for a bit, and likely won't go live until players have had a chance to test them and give feedback for iteration.</p>
<p>A bit more detail on the arse ladders. The bung rungs, if you will. The scaffolds that chaff-old. First up, you will be able to toggle your intestinal escalades back on if you wish. No judgement. Something's up there that long, starts to feel like a part of you. Secondly, CA say they've "fixed over 50 issues related to how the Battle AI plays" in sieges in general, so they might now have some devious new ideas of how to cope without the ladders.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, towers are getting their range reduced but their damage buffed, and gates will be more durable. You'll be able to build siege towers and battering rams quicker, and their speed and durability has been adjusted. "In addition," reads the blog, "we are changing the way Siege Attrition works and turning it into a linear progression making it be stronger and stronger with each consecutive turn a settlement remains under siege".</p>
<p>Do have a read of the blog for the full breakdown. This beta round runs for two weeks, from the 24th of July to the 7th of August. There'll also be a livestream with Vasilev on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/totalwar">Twitch</a> today at  3:30PM BST/2:20PM UTC/4:30PM CEST. I don't think they've done a dev stream for a while, and I'm a sucker for the nitty gritty stuff they've been sharing more of recently. Rest in pelvic prolapse, arse ladders.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-total-war-warhammers-arse-ladders-2016-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has added a Black Library logo to its official Big Summer Warhammer Preview showcase, sparking speculation the company may announce new novels that finally move the overarching Warhammer 40,000 narrative forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Summer Warhammer Preview, set for this Friday, July 18, will contain reveals for Games Workshop’s main tabletop games, including Age of Sigmar, The Horus Heresy, and of course Warhammer 40,000. Its initially released digital poster for the event did not feature the logo for Black Library, Games Workshop’s in-house book publishing division. However, on July 16, it released a new version of this poster with the Black Library logo added, sparking speculation that fans will get new novel announcements as well.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/517658642-1124351393077178-5591934164739581769-n-1752732406910.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Black Library logo suggests new novel reveals. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Why is this exciting for fans of the setting? There is a great deal of speculation that Games Workshop may finally be ready to move the Warhammer 40,000 narrative forward with either a brand new series of books, the teased meet-up between two returned primarchs, or the long-awaited third book in Dan Abnett's Bequin trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-mere-mention-of-an-nda-by-a-games-workshop-author-has-sparked-all-sorts-of-speculation-about-what-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-might-be">IGN has reported on the now mythical Pandemonium before</a>, when fans speculated its delay might have something to do with Games Workshop and Amazon getting their narrative ducks in a row ahead of the Henry Cavill-fronted Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe. It is perhaps the most-anticipated book in all Warhammer fandom. The first novel in the Bequin series, Pariah, came out in 2012. Its sequel, the Warhammer 40,000 lore treasure trove that is Penitent, followed nearly a decade later, in March 2021. Pandemonium does not have a release date, and the wait for an announcement is fast becoming Warhammer 40,000’s version of George R. R. Martin’s M.I.A. Game of Thrones book, The Winds of Winter. Some fans are speculating — perhaps more with hope than expectation — that now is finally the time for a Pandemonium reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's heightened interest in Pandemonium because it promises to actually move the overarching Warhammer 40,000 plot forward. Penitent ended with a significant lore revelation (it has to do with the identity of the mysterious King in Yellow, which we won’t spoil here), and so the ramifications of Pandemonium for the wider Warhammer 40,000 universe could be huge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps more realistic is a new novel series set during the period known as The Scouring. This is the largely unexplored time in Warhammer 40,000 history when the Imperium ran down the traitor legions following the defeat of Horus 10,000 years before the current setting. With the Horus Heresy seemingly wrapped up following the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature">Era of Ruin</a>, The Scouring seems like a natural next step for Games Workshop if it wants to continue filling in the gaps in the Warhammer 40,000 narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or this may all be much ado about nothing, and Black Library’s presence at the show ultimately goes down as a disappointment. You’d like to think that Games Workshop knew what it would do to fan expectations by slapping the Black Library logo on its preview poster, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads me neatly into why Warhammer 40,000 lore fans get excited by teases like this in the first place. As I’ve reported before, the Warhammer 40,000 story, such as it is, is a slow moving beast. The scribes at Games Workshop sometimes take years to inch the overarching plot forward. Take, for example, the return of beloved primarch, Lion El'Jonson, which was announced in March 2023. Now, over two years later, the character is yet to do much of anything in the setting, his hotly anticipated reunion with his brother, Roboute Guilliman, seemingly further away than ever. Could a new novel finally detail this sure to be spicy meet up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe, on Friday, we’ll finally get some answers. The Big Summer Warhammer Preview is set for 7pm BST / 11am PDT on Friday, July 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>It's showtime in 'Uncaged Fury'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Mortal Kombat II movie hype train is about to leave the station, with Warner Bros. today releasing a teaser tied to the upcoming action movie, which is arriving in cinemas on <strong>24th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It's actually an "in-universe film trailer" for 'Uncaged Fury' starring Johnny Cage, who is played by The Boys superstar Karl Urban. Here's the description <a href="https://youtu.be/Sccu5MKUfuA">via IGN</a>. And just a word of warning, there is some swearing and a rude gesture (Johnny flipping the bird) in the video above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Uncaged Fury sees the legendary Johnny Cage take on a band of goons with ease, making use of pipes, fast-paced combat skills, and an aura unlike any other."</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The battle between <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/704606/subnautica-2-delay-krafton-unknown-worlds-bonus"><em>Subnautica 2 </em>publisher Krafton and the three former executives</a> at its developer Unknown Worlds continues. Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire — the three executives who Krafton terminated earlier this year — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/704956/subnautica-2s-fired-bosses-are-suing-krafton">have filed a lawsuit</a> detailing the alleged attempts by Krafton to torpedo the early access release of <em>Subnautica 2</em> with the express purpose of avoiding paying a promised earnout bonus of $250 million.</p><p>“Krafton’s actions have already severely damaged fan anticipation and undermined the potential release of Subnautica 2,” the lawsuit says.</p><p>That earnout was promised by Krafton to the former executives and roughly 100 developers and was to be paid should Unknown Worlds hit revenue goals by the end of 2025. <em>Subnautica 2</em>, slated for early access release sometime in late 2025, would have all but assured those goals were met.</p><p>According to the lawsuit filed today in a Delaware chancery court, Krafton also knew <em>Subnautica 2</em> was on track to meet if not exceed the revenue target to trigger the payout and began to take steps to essentially prevent that. The original <em>Subnautica</em>, an underwater survival adventure game, was a critical and commercial success, and its sequel has become the second most wishlisted game ever on Steam.</p><p>The lawsuit details a meeting between Krafton’s US and Korean employees concerning the marketing strategy for<em> Subnautica 2</em>. After that meeting, Krafton’s US employees, who worked closely with the<em> Subnautica 2</em> team, reported that Kafton’s attitude about the game had changed.</p><p>“Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.”</p><p>The lawsuit additionally states that Krafton’s US employees explicitly revealed to the Unknown Worlds founders that “Krafton’s legal team was combing through the agreements looking for any opening to terminate the Founders if they proceeded with the planned release.”</p><p>The lawsuit provided the details of the deal in which Krafton purchased Unknown Worlds back in 2021. The lawsuit says that part of that deal was an agreement that the founders would maintain control of the company and the release schedule of <em>Subnautica 2</em>, while Krafton could not impede the game’s development nor fire Unknown Worlds’ founders without cause.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Krafton launched a campaign to do both. Krafton allegedly failed to follow through on several of its development responsibilities for <em>Subnautica 2</em> including pulling marketing and localization support. “Indeed, one of Krafton’s El Segundo publishing employees reported to Gill that Krafton Headquarters told all Krafton teams to stop all creative tasks related</p><p>to Subnautica 2.”</p><p>The lawsuit claims that Krafton took these obstructionist actions to delay the game to explicitly avoid the $250 million payout. At a meeting between Krafton CEO Changhan Kim and Charlie Cleveland, Kim allegedly stated that, “if Unknown Worlds released the game on its planned timeline [...], it could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton.” Krafton declined to comment.</p><p>After the initial story broke regarding the alleged reason for <em>Subnautica</em>’s delay, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that Krafton <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707905/some-potentially-good-news-for-subnautica-2s-developers%E2%80%99">agreed to extend the timeline for the earnout</a> to account for <em>Subnautica 2’</em>s later release. Previously, the company denied that it delayed <em>Subnautica 2</em> for any other reason but to polish the game. Earlier this week, an internal document regarding <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s development <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">were leaked on Reddit.</a> The document, consisting of two pictures taken of a computer screen, outlined the content originally planned for the game’s early access launch and how some material had to be changed or removed to meet the release date.<br>Krafton acknowledged the veracity of those documents saying, “Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document,” possibly to bolster its argument that <em>Subnautica 2</em> was not ready for its early access release.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/708676/subnautica-2-former-ceo-lawsuit-krafton-sabotage]]></content:encoded>

They also say they tried to negotiate for developers who had joined the team later and were not currently eligible for bonuses to receive them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The former leaders claim that upon learning this, Krafton began to suggest the game be delayed, allegedly combing through contracts to determine if they had a legal standing to force a delay, despite the contract saying the decision lay with Unknown Worlds. They say that Krafton even went so far as to take action to make it difficult or impossible for it to release on time. Krafton began offering feedback that the game was not ready for its early access launch, pulled marketing materials, and refusing to follow through on certain pre-launch commitments. Ultimately, the founders say this culminated in Krafton letting the three of them go earlier this month and officially delaying Subnautica 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Krafton has since extended the bonus period for the remaining employees to receive their earnout if targets are hit, notably Krafton has claimed that the former leadership was eligible for 90% of the bonuses, meaning Krafton would only have to pay a maximum of $25 million if targets are met, not $250 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The founders' lawsuit accuses Krafton of breach of contract and demands payout of the full bonus promised as well as damages and other costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The drama around Subnautica 2 kicked off earlier this month when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">Krafton announced suddenly</a> that it was replacing the three founders with former Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis effectively immediately, which Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-developer-breaks-silence-after-shock-removal-to-find-that-im-no-longer-able-to-work-at-the-company-i-started-stings">claimed was a "shock" to them</a>. In the following weeks, reports have emerged regarding the $250 million bonus promised to staff, and Krafton has made statements accusing the former leaders of neglecting their duties and saying that Subnautica 2 was not in an acceptable state for launch. In particular, Krafton alleged that Cleveland was told to stop devoting time to a personal project and focus on his duties at the studio. The lawsuit, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-leadership-files-lawsuit-against-parent-company-krafton-as-row-over-250m-bonus-gets-personal">filed last week</a>, counters that this personal project was a Subnautica film, and was worked on at the explicit request of Krafton.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The readiness of Subnautica 2 remains an open question. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leaked documents</a> since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-drama-gets-even-messier-as-krafton-confirms-internal-document-leak-is-real">verified by Krafton</a> confirm that Unknown Worlds was receiving feedback from the publisher that the game was not ready for early access launch.
