<figure data-uuid="7ecc99f80aabf"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7ecc99f80aabf/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's share price has been on a downward turn over the last several months, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;sq">currently sitting at 9,950 yen</a> following an all-time high of 14,795 yen in August 2025.</p>
<p>Fluctuations are inevitable in this business, but according to <a href="https://kantangames.com/">Kantan Games</a>' CEO Dr. Serkan Toto, Nintendo's investors are "spooked" by the prospect of price rises along with the lack of any major first-party titles in 2026 (so far!).</p>
<p>In a post on X (via <a href="https://xcancel.com/serkantoto/status/2011080382108913781#m">XCancel</a>), Toto states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo stock in Japan is sliding: All-time high of 14,795 yen in August 2025, and closed at 9,950 yen today.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"So -33% in 5 months: Investors are spooked by possible price hikes, lack of 1st-party hits and US/EU hardware discounts during the holidays."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, we're not sure what the heck is going on with that last point. Was anyone really expecting to see a console discount within the first year of sale? Christmas or not, that just seems bonkers to us.</p>
<p>Either way, it's a noteworthy downturn, but we're not worried at the moment. The Switch 2, despite some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-sales-reportedly-struggled-over-the-christmas-period">apparent struggles over the Christmas period</a>, is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">still the fastest-selling console of all time</a>. Furthermore, we're confident Nintendo will have some more big games up its sleeve for the latter half of 2026. <strong>Pokémon Gen 10</strong>, anyone?</p>

            <guid>1404805</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Battlefield 6</strong> was one of the biggest commercial successes in 2025, not just for <strong>EA</strong>, but across the video game industry overall. It was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">best-selling games on Steam by revenue in 2025</a>, and as of November 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">it was the best-selling game in the US overall</a>. But while EA has been enjoying its commercial success, the players around the game have begun to feel the lack of new content, with concurrent player numbers (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">at least on Steam</a>) practically falling off the map compared to where they were when the game launched.</p>



<p>That's why, when EA announced in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-and-redsec-season-1-january-update">today's January Update blog</a> that the next major batch of content, <strong>Season 2</strong>, wouldn't arrive until <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>, one of the first comments, which sums up community sentiment quite well, was, "<em>Is this a joke?</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Season 2 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylKfsTB3uKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 launched on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">October 10, 2025</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Season 1 and its highly anticipated REDSEC battle royale mode launching on October 28, 2025</a>. Since October 28, there have been content updates for the game as part of Season 1, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-now-live/">with the introduction of new maps and limited-time modes</a>, but the launch of Season 2 arriving in February means that players will have gone almost four months without any major new content.</p>



<p>To a certain vintage of player, it may seem ludicrous for this to be an issue the community is complaining about, but that's simply the world we live in when it comes to modern-day live-service titles. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">Marvel Rivals</a></strong>, for example, doesn't let its community go a single month without new content, with a new season every two months and new characters and maps introduced at the halfway point. </p>



<p>Like it or not, that is the pace of modern live-service games, and while Battlefield 6 and Marvel Rivals offer different experiences to players, if EA hopes to keep up with free-to-play games like Marvel Rivals, it can't keep players waiting months for new maps.</p>



<p>In fairness to EA and Battlefield Studios (DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect), the team is aware that this is a longer wait than players would have expected, and claims the decision was made "<em>in order to keep our promise</em>" to the community to deliver the best possible experience. </p>



<p>"<em>During our ongoing development, we've continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2</em>," the team writes. </p>



<p>"<em>Season 1 will be extended past its in-game end date of January 20, and we will launch Season 2 on February 17. The Season 1 extension update to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will be released on January 20, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season 1 Battle Pass until the start date of Season 2</em>."</p>



<p>As part of Season 1 getting extended, EA is adding new cosmetics, free rewards, and XP bonuses for players, including a Frostfire Bonus Path that players will be able to complete alongside the Season 1 battle pass rather than having to choose between them, which is how players currently work through the several battle pass paths. There will also be a Valentine's Day update arriving later, with double XP weekends, login rewards, and more. </p>



<p>It's a nice attempt from EA to try and hold players over until Season 2 is ready, but it's doubtful community sentiment will change until we start to see what Season 2 will bring. Hopefully, it's enough to bring the players who have dropped Battlefield 6 due to a lack of content back to the game. Otherwise, EA and Battlefield Studios may be in for a rough 2026.</p>

              <p>Developers at two of Meta’s virtual reality game development studios are posting online that massive layoffs have happened and that the studios might be shutting down completely.</p> <p>On January 13, multiple developers from Twisted Pixel and Sanzaru Games posted online that they had been laid off from the studios. Many of the affected staff have suggested that both studios, and others owned by the company formerly known as Facebook, might be completely shutting down. Meta has not confirmed this. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to the company for more information about the future of the VR studios and the publicly confirmed layoffs.</p> <p>“Welp. As many will hear soon, several Meta game studios were closed today, including Sanzaru. It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I’m really glad to have gotten to know everyone there,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs/">posted senior-level designer Ray West on LinkedIn on Tuesday.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p><span>“I’ve just been laid off. It appears the entire Twisted Pixel </span>games studio has been shut down.<span> Sanzaru Games, </span>too,” <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">posted another developer on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, I was part of the layoffs today at Meta, and will be seeking a new role,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kathrynyu.com">said Twisted Pixel VR gameplay designer Kathryn Yu on Bluesky</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-reality-labs-vr-horizon-worlds-teams-2026-1">This follows reporting on Monday</a> that Meta was looking to pivot away from VR and the metaverse to AI and augmented reality tech after that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/29/meta-earnings-report">part of the company lost $4 billion.</a> Meta is reportedly looking to cut 10 to 15 percent of Reality Labs, its VR sector, which includes 15,000 employees as well as numerous game studios like Sanzaru. These teams were developing exclusive Meta Quest games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514">like last year’s <em>Deadpool VR</em></a>, which was developed by Twisted Pixel.</p>

 <p>Sanzaru was acquired by Meta in 2020 following the release of<em> Asgard’s Wrath</em>, a popular and critically acclaimed RPG, in 2019. It developed a sequel that launched as a free pack-in game with the launch of the Quest 3 in December 2023. Twisted Pixel previously worked on games like <em>Splosion Man</em> and <em>Lococycle</em> before being bought by Meta in 2021 to work on VR titles.</p>

Both leaderboards and an enemy affix are currently bugged.</p><p dir="ltr">In a post on the Diablo 4 <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/psa-leaderboard-issues/240211" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forums</a>, community manager Marcoose let players know that while The Tower is still accessible, leaderboard results aren't currently populating correctly for all classes. Blizzard is investigating the issue but, as of writing, does not have any updates on the problem.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpaz0etTqJw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gpaz0etTqJw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Executioner affix, meanwhile, is currently disabled entirely due to patch 2.5.2 introducing a persistent audio bug related to it. The bright side is Blizzard is taking the opportunity to rework the affix to make it less punishing, with the new and improved version of the affix set to return in a later update.</p><p dir="ltr">For the unfamiliar, Executioner is an affix enemies can have that causes swords to fall from the sky at a player's location. At endgame, many of these swords can fall all at once if players are killing large groups of foes quickly, with the hail of swords capable of obliterating a player nearly instantly.</p><p dir="ltr">In a forum <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/temporary-disabling-of-executioners-affix/240196" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, Marcoose outlined what changes Blizzard intends in order to make Executioner feel a little more forgiving. Those changes will include a one-second spawn cooldown, with only one sword spawning instead of multiple when killing groups of enemies with Executioner all at once. Blizzard will also remove the tracking period of the swords themselves, which will instead fall as soon as they reach the player. That should make them easier to predict.</p><p dir="ltr">For a full look at what all changed in Diablo 4's leaderboard update, make sure to check out the full <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24244466/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> didn't cause a commotion when it launched last year, but it quietly became a compelling alternative to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>'s offerings, which many felt were on the simpler (albeit extremely polished) side. Now, a little over a month since the native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version arrived digitally, we've got confirmation the physical release is coming in March.</p>
<p>Sega (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-physical-switch-2-release-wont-be-a-game-key-card-sega-confirms/">VGC</a>) dropped the long-awaited news on January 13, confirming the date you need to mark on the calendar is March 26. The suggested retail price is $69.99 / £64.99, same as the digital version of CrossWorlds. Perhaps more convincing is the fact the complete base game will be on a regular cartridge versus a game-key card. Mind you, patches and content updates still need to be downloaded, but we know many of you will celebrate.</p>
<p>Though some developers have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">gone on to explain</a> game-key cards enable them to do true physical releases (better than codes in boxes for sure) while avoiding the "data streaming" limitations of the Switch carts, which are slower than Switch 2's internal SSD and microSD cards, there's been a vocal crusade against third-party releases that aren't 100% physical.</p>
<p>This has reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-dev-says-nintendo-has-cheaper-cartridges-coming-as-alternative-to-game-key-cards-then-backtracks-but-either-way-its-title-will-now-be-a-proper-physical-release">pushed Nintendo to look into alternatives</a>, but for now, you can lend and sell game-key cards without issue, as they're rather similar to PlayStation and Xbox discs that only come with part of the games on them. It's more of a distant future-proofing issue.</p><p>In any case, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds' sales should see another boost with this physical release, as many fans of the off-beat racing series were waiting for a Switch 2 release they could add to their physical collection. (It's me, I'm fans.)</p>
<p>Since its September 2025 release, the game has welcomed free crossover characters like Hatsune Miku (really), Joker from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-30th-anniversary-boxing-fitness-more-announcements">Persona</a>, Ichiban Kasuga from Like a Dragon, and even NiGHTS from the underrated series of the same name. Paid content has included Pac-Man, Minecraft content, and even SpongeBob SquarePants. Up next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-mans-finally-making-a-comeback-but-his-first-big-game-in-years-is-still-a-while-away">Mega Man</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, and Avatar (the Nickelodeon one) will be making a splash too.</p>

<p>The demo will give you a small taste of what the co-op horror title will have to offer, with Tarsier Studios previously stating that solo players will have no problem experiencing the game if you can't find anyone to join you.</p>
<p>Reanimal is somewhat of a spiritual successor to <strong>Little Nightmares</strong>, which Tarsier Studios worked on before development passed over to Supermassive Games for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">third entry</a>. It looks to be an altogether more disturbing experience as the story follows two siblings to work to escape a hellish environment full of grotesque creatures.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rnjkht&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

              <p><span>Staff redundancies are anticipated at Ubisoft Stockholm and Massive Entertainment, Ubisoft has announced. 55 employees are expected to lose their jobs, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted"><span>according to a statement sent to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Massive, acquired back in 2008, is the studio behind </span><i><span>The Division 2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement, Ubisoft explained, “This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements, and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect in line with local regulations,” Ubisoft said.</span></p> <h2>Ubisoft’s slow, painful transformation</h2> <p><span>The news comes months after the French publisher began a new cost-cutting restructuring plan. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-massive-layoffs-division-3-star-wars-outlaws-2000638264"><span>Back in October 2025</span></a><span>, it asked developers at Massive to lay themselves off voluntarily.</span></p>

 <p><span>The publisher’s redundancy scheme came after a new deal with Tencent, in which the conglomerate invested over $1 billion in a smaller subsidiary, Vantage Studios. The new studio will focus on the </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Far Cry</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Rainbow Six Siege</span></i><span> franchises.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> notes that despite the new layoffs, updates for </span><i><span>Tom Clancy’s The Division 2</span></i><span> will continue, as will development for </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span> and the survival extraction mode </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>News of job cuts at Ubisoft is not new. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752"><span>Last week, Ubisoft closed its Halifax office after it unionized.</span></a><span> The shuttering of the mobile game developer resulted in the loss of 71 jobs.

            <title><![CDATA[CS2 Transfer Market ‘Out of Control’, apEX Declares]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-transfer-market-out-of-control/</link>
            <guid>1404724</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Vitality’s award-winning IGL, Dan ‘apEX’ Madesclaire, has voiced <strong>strong concerns </strong>about the state of the Counter-Strike 2 transfer market. He has argued that the current pricing climate has made roster changes (especially meaningful ones) almost <strong>impossible </strong>for most organizations in the space.</p>



<p>In the wake of the HLTV Award Show, during which apEX secured an award for IGL of the Year, he suggested that even the biggest organizations in Counter-Strike are being priced out of making key moves.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-the-counter-strike-market">What’s Wrong with the Counter-Strike Market?</h2>



<p>According to apEX, the financial expectations around player buyouts have reached a critical point. Even well-funded organizations can’t engage, and teams that want to ‘shake things up’ simply can’t. They’re backing off because quotes are ‘completely unrealistic’.</p>



<p>He also stated that the Counter-Strike esports ecosystem doesn’t generate enough revenue to justify skyrocketing buyout demands that have surged in the last year.</p>



<p>Here’s the full quote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>So many teams wanted to make a change, I guess, but they couldn’t. The transfer market is crazy. The prices are “What the f**k is going on?” In CS, we don’t make enough money to make changes, all those prizes are crazy. That’s why we hear nothing from NAVI, no MOUZ as well, who wanted to shuffle, I’m pretty sure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/75019-apex-cs2-transfer-market-is-crazy-the-prices-are-on-what-the-f-k-is-going-on-level" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escore</a> for the quote</em>)</p>



<p>ApEX explained that the quiet offseason and the lack of transfers can be attributed specifically to this issue.</p>



<p>The looming shadow over the market remains Team Falcons, the Saudi-backed organization that has the largest coffers in the esports world. In the last few years, the company has soared in the competitive gaming space, buying out killer squads in multiple games.</p>



<p>But even Team Falcons neglected to make any changes during the winter freeze. If Team Falcons is hesitating, then the pricing issue must be <strong>extreme</strong>.</p>



<p>ApEX’s comments reflect the growing concern amongst players that the CS2 transfer market is overheating. If buyout quotes continue to rise faster than team revenues do on a comparative scale, the top organizations willbe forced to delay or abandon roster plans and rebuilds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA has announced that it is delaying the start of Battlefield 6 Season 2.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s official subreddit, EA revealed that Season 2 for both Battlefield 6 and Battlefield REDSEC will now start on February 17. Originally, the next season was expected to begin on January 21.</p>







<p><strong>“During our ongoing development, we’ve continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2,” </strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1qbv6tf/battlefield_6_and_redsec_season_1_january_update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA said</a> in their statement.</p>



<p>They continued: <strong>“Season 1 will be extended past its in-game end date of January 20, and we will launch Season 2 on February 17. The Season 1 extension update to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will be released on January 20, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season 1 Battle Pass until the start date of Season 2.</strong>“</p>







<p>With this delay, EA is giving players a new “Frostfire Bonus Path” starting on January 27. This new path includes new customization rewards along with XP boosts. Free rewards from the path include Hardware XP Boost, a Vehicle Skin and player card customization items. Those with the Battle Pass can get a new weapon package and career XP boost. </p>



<p><strong>“Unlike previous Bonus Paths, all Bonus Path Points for the Frostfire Bonus Path are earned through Weekly Challenges; there are no Bonus Challenges associated with this Bonus Path.,”</strong> EA says.</p>

<p><strong>Playoffs – Round One</strong></p>



<p>The first round of the playoffs will be a behind-closed-doors event, held between <strong>February 8 </strong>and <strong>February 10</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Playoffs – Round Two</strong></p>



<p>The second round of the playoffs will run from <strong>February 13 </strong>to <strong>February 15 </strong>and will be played in front of a live audience in the Adidas Arena.</p>



<p>The playoffs will feature a double-elimination bracket with best-of-three match formats (except for the grand final, which is best-of-five).</p>

                <p>Battlefield 6's much-anticipated Season 2 update won't launch on time. Battlefield Studios has confirmed that the update will now arrive on February 17, which is later than expected.</p><p>"This extended launch has been implemented to allow extra time to further develop and refine Season 2 as a result of community feedback," the developer said (<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2011105964896711059" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Charlie Intel</a>). The update was previously expected to arrive sometime in late January.</p><p>Battlefield 6 had a strong start in October 2025 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">even outsold Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 in the US through November</a>. However, sentiment has somewhat shifted of late, with recent reviews on Steam shifting from "Mostly Positive" to "Mixed." Additionally, people have called out EA for pushing microtransactions and for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-ai-generated-art-just-like-call-of-duty-fans-believe/1100-6537131/" data-ref-id="1100-6537131">the game's apparent use of generative AI. </a></p><p>It remains to be seen what changes Battlefield Studios may make to the Season 2 content roadmap based on the community feedback mentioned in the statement. In fact, we don't yet have a rundown of what's in Season 2, but it's expected to bring more maps, guns, modes, and more.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

                <p>Developer Sandfall's RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of 2025's breakout hits, and with a budget of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-was-under-10-million-report/1100-6536874/" data-ref-id="1100-6536874">reportedly less than $10 million</a>, a relatively small development staff, and a price point below $70, some have said the game could be representative of a "AA"-style project that can break through. It may have worked for Expedition 33, and it could work for other titles, but Hazelight boss Josef Fares wants to see the AAA space continue and hopes that decision-makers in gaming don't go all-in on smaller-scale games with lower budgets.</p><p>"You do hear, after the success of things like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that the AA games are taking over. But I would not be able to live without a AAA title," he told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "I really want to play the blockbuster games. You can't do GTA for $10 million. We need both."</p><p>Fares went on to say that "it's important not to get stuck in ideas." People should not allow themselves to be convinced that "AA is a new thing" or "indie is a new thing," he said.</p><p>"We need the diversity. I hope that publishers don't just look at a game like Expedition, which has been super successful, and think, 'Oh, AA is a new thing. Let's only do that.' I don't believe in that," he said.</p><p>Fares also reminded people that while Expedition 33 was a success, many other "AA" games were not. "You had a huge amount of AA games that came [in 2025], which nobody cared about. Let's remember that," he said.</p><p>The interviewer suggested to Fares that with higher budgets comes more risk-averse decision-making, as the money people want to have a return on investment and may opt for safer bets. Fares doesn't believe this is always the case, saying Naughty Dog is known for "pushing the envelope" with massive budgets, as are companies like Rockstar and Nintendo.</p><p>"So you can do a big AAA title but also take innovative risks," he said. "But once you go over a $100 million budget, you're going to be like, 'Okay, sh**. There's a lot of money on the table.' People are more scared. It's understandable. But it's proven that you can do it."</p><p>The budgets for Hazelight's games have grown over the years. Split Fiction had <a href="https://youtu.be/QQvUgUlknis" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">almost double the budget</a> of It Takes Two, for example. Still, Hazelight's games are understood to fall within the AA category.</p><p>The creative director of Assassin's Creed Unity and Revelations, Alexadre Amancio, recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-games-future-lies-in-smaller-teams-says-ac-unity-director/1100-6537267/" data-ref-id="1100-6537267">AAA game development is broken</a> and problems cannot be solved by "throwing people at it." Instead, he said the future of AAA games might be in smaller teams.</p><p>Hazelight is working on a new game now, but it hasn't been announced as of yet. All of Hazelight's games so far have been co-op titles (Brothers was a single-player game with a unique co-op element). Fares said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fictions-josef-fares-has-already-started-next-game-clarifies-relationship-with-ea/1100-6530172/" data-ref-id="1100-6530172">co-op will always be part of Hazelight's DNA</a>, but he didn't rule out the possibility of the studio changing things up. "You never know what happens in the future. It's not impossible we look into single-player as well. But it would be done in a Hazelight way, with a Hazelight twist. It's not going to be your typical single-player game," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, Ubisoft made headlines when it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-shuts-down-recently-unionized-halifax-studio">shut down its Halifax studio</a>, which not only put 71 developers out of a job, but those developers had just <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-halifax-staff-officially-form-union">unionized two days prior</a>. Today, Ubisoft is continuing this trend by proposing to lay off even more people, this time at its subsidiaries Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted">According to a statement provided to <em>IGN</em></a>, the restructuring would impact "approximately" 55 workers at the two Swedish studios, but the timeline of this restructuring is unclear. Ubisoft also claims that "the long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged," and doesn't suggest that any ongoing projects, such as the development of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/21/ubisoft-announces-tom-clancys-the-division-3-appoints-new-series-producer">The Division 3</a>, will be impacted.</p><p>You can read the full statement provided to <em>IGN </em>below.</p><p>Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructure that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm," Ubisoft said in a statement passed to IGN today.&nbsp;</p><p>This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.</p><p>These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams.</p><p>The long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged, and we will continue to serve as the global home and lead for to The Division franchise, move forward with an unannounced innovative tech project with a refined team setup, and play a central role in the development of Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect.</p><p>The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect inline with local regulations.</p><p>As noted in the statement, this news follows a <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732?s=20">voluntary leave program at Massive that began last October</a>, allowing employees that might potentially be laid off to do so on their own terms. The announcement of further layoffs suggests Ubisoft wasn't satisfied with the number of people, if any, who took the offer.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4hSHqpDZ3g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4hSHqpDZ3g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Known for developing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in 2023 and Star Wars: Outlaws in 2024, Massive has been one of Ubisoft's most prolific subsidiaries in recent years. All of this is on top of Massive's work developing and maintaining The Division 2, which had an expansion as recently as last year. Massive is currently in the midst of developing The Division 2: Survivors (an added survival extraction mode), The Division Resurgence (a mobile entry in the series), and The Division 3.</p><p>Last year, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-redlynx-says-up-to-60-positions-could-be-cut-in-restructuring-proposal">a similar layoff proposal at its subsidiary RedLynx</a>, known for the Trials series. Last March, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-creates-new-subsidiary-for-its-biggest-franchises-with-tencent-as-minority-owner">it founded a new subsidiary in partnership with Tencent</a>, who owns a minority stake in the new company, to manage Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p><p>[<em>Source:</em> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted"><em>IGN</em></a>]</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/ubisoft-proposes-to-lay-off-55-employees-at-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-developer]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-was-abandoned-in-death-as-in-life-its-a-game-ea-and-bioware-would-rather-forget">BioWare's multiplayer shooter Anthem was terminated this week</a> because EA no longer wanted to maintain servers for people to play the game on, and without them, no one can play the game. But the former executive producer of Anthem has revealed that BioWare had technology working, close to the game's release, that would enable us to host our own servers to play the game on.</p>
<p>Mark Darrah, who left BioWare in December 2020, revealed the information at the end of a three-and-a-half hour video discussing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxwrCRdqZb8">"The Truth About What Happened on Anthem"</a>, which he posted on his YouTube channel. "Anthem actually had the code for local servers running in a dev environment right up until a few months up to launch," he said. "I don't know that they still work but the code is there to be salvaged and recovered."</p>
<p>This in theory presents a possible lifeline and future for Anthem, and local server hosting is a crucial part of Darrah's even bolder plan for what could be done with Anthem now. His idea? To re-release the game as single-player and remove the multiplayer component entirely.</p>
<p>Darrah, an experienced executive producer, outlined a plan for doing this. You'd need a budget of about $10m, he said, and step one would be to bring the game up to date. This wouldn't be hard. Shift it to current-gen consoles and enable the top-end PC game effects, and lock it at 60 frames-per-second. Step two: local servers. Get rid of EA's need to host servers for the game. Step three: "Pivot to something that's more about single-player storytelling."</p>
<blockquote><em>"Pivot to something that's more about single-player storytelling"</em></blockquote>
<p>Where players used to fill out groups in Anthem, you could instead have AI companions, as in other BioWare games. "And since this is BioWare," Darrah added, "go all the way into making them companions." You could use some existing characters for this and "promote" them, so to speak. "But I think you'll actually find there's a lower-friction route by making three-to-five new characters, with dialogue, with plot arcs, that are brand new to the series - that are people who'd go with you through the existing story of Anthem with their companion content," he said. "Writing those characters: not very difficult. Making those characters move with you: that's where a lot of the work is going to go."</p>
<p>What you'd have if you could do that is a game much more familiar to BioWare fans, Darrah said - people who potentially skipped Anthem because it was too looter-shooter for them. "What you've essentially re-engineered is a BioWare game," he said, "without romances, with a decent BioWare story, with companions, that can be played as a single-player game." You probably couldn't sell it for $70, he realises, but "for a pretty modest amount of work you could effectively create a brand new single-player game from what already exists for this game".</p>
<p>"Is EA going to do this?" he added. "Almost definitely not."</p>
<p>Darrah's full video covers a lot of ground, chronologically running through Anthem's development since conception in late 2011 or early 2012, through to release in 2019. It talks of the game's originating pitch as being a turning point in BioWare's history, and possibly the basis for all future live service problems to come. The video also highlights a project that crucially lacked a single unifying vision and identity - something ultimately born out in the finished game, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-review-shaken-apart-by-its-own-identity-crisis">Oli pointed out in our Anthem review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/gamestop-lawsuit-digital-goods-law-buy-vs-license/</link>
            <guid>1404700</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>A GameStop customer, Jake Weber, is suing GameStop for alleged violations of California's digital goods transparency law. <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB2426&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>AB 2426</u></a>, which was signed in 2024 and went into effect in 2025, requires companies to let buyers know that they're not purchasing video games and other digital stuff outright, they're merely licensing them. It's why Valve <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-tells-gamers-up-front-that-theyre-buying-a-license-not-a-game-085106522.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>changed its purchasing page</u></a> in 2024 to include a little note under the "Continue to payment" button: "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam."&nbsp;</p><p>Weber and his lawyers, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/980524033/GameStop-lawsuit-via-Aftermath?ref=aftermath.site"><u>in the proposed class action complaint filed Jan. 8 in California</u></a>, say GameStop doesn't do that. The important thing to know about this law is that it's not really changing the fact that a customer is licensing and not buying a game outright; it's just requiring that storefronts be upfront about this sort of thing, which has been an issue gamers have been rallying around for some time. As games age and player bases dwindle, game publishers may decide to stop supporting a video game. For older consoles, that's fine: The game you got on the cartridge is what the game is and always will be. But as the internet became more available, and online multiplayer and live service became a thing, there's a problem. If a publisher turns the servers off, people who purchased the game can't access it anymore.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is what happened when Ubisoft shut down <em>The Crew</em> in 2024. As an online-only game, people who purchased even the physical disc no longer had access. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/proposed-class-action-lawsuit-claims-the-crew-players-were-duped-bizarrely-comparing-the-game-shutting-down-to-ubisoft-breaking-into-your-house-and-stealing-parts-of-a-pinball-machine/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>A group of gamers sued Ubisoft in 2024 over it</u></a>—and the ensuing public outcry over the shutdown inspired the California law itself.</p><p>Weber's GameStop complaint outlines the situation with <em>The Crew</em> and the creation of California's Digital Property Rights Transparency Law. It also includes screenshots of the process of buying a digital game from GameStop, including the store page for <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>,&nbsp; the shopping cart, and checkout. Nowhere on the pages does GameStop note that players are buying a license and not the game itself, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>"At no point prior to the purchase is the consumer ever put on notice, in plain language, that the video game he is buying is just a license that can be revoked at any time," the lawyers write. "Nor is the consumer ever required to provide an affirmative acknowledgment that he or she knows the limited property rights he or she is receiving with the purchase of the digital video game."</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to GameStop for comment.</p><p>Weber and his lawyers are asking the court to grant the lawsuit class action status, so that other GameStop customers can join. It's also looking for a jury trial and damages for the impacted parties. Since the law went into effect in 2025, both <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/2428762/apple-hit-with-false-ad-suit-over-digital-content-sales?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a> and <a href="https://www.classaction.org/blog/amazon-prime-video-lawsuit-claims-customers-who-buy-content-are-misled-about-ownership-rights.?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Amazon</u></a> have been sued for alleged violations. Both those lawsuits are ongoing.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at Ubisoft's <em>The Crew</em> lawsuit for any indication of how Weber's GameStop lawsuit may play out, there's not much to glean. Though the proposed class action suit garnered a lot of attention, it didn't even reach official class action status. (These lawsuits are filed as proposed class actions; a judge must determine that it meets several requirements.) The lawsuit <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.caed.455496/gov.uscourts.caed.455496.23.0.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs</u></a> in June.</p><p>Regardless, the debacle of owning games versus licensing them will continue to be an issue as game developers and publishers stop supporting their old game servers. Electronic Arts and BioWare's online multiplayer shooter <a href="https://aftermath.site/anthem-server-shutdown-trying-for-the-first-time-bioware-ea/"><u><em>Anthem</em>, for instance, went offline on Jan. 12</u></a>. The issue is at the core of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Stop Killing Games initiative</u></a>, which self-describes as "a consumer movement started to challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers." More transparency around buying versus licensing is good, but that's not what the Stop Killing Games movement wants—it wants publishers and developers to implement "end-of-life" plans for games, so that online-only games without support can still be run offline.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/high-on-life-2-leaked-for-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Everything</a>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GGDYYH1V?tag=nlife-20" rel="sponsored noopener">full Amazon page</a> for the Switch 2 version — complete with box art, price, and a release date of 20th April 2026 — popped up earlier today. It'll be a Game-Key Card release and you can even pre-order the game right now, despite the fact the port hasn't been officially announced.</p>
<p>It looks pretty official, though, and since the game is coming to other platforms on 13th February, even the two month wait seems believable.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rnjkht&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>If this is your first time hearing about High on Life 2, then let's fill you in via its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>
You’ve done it. You’ve taken down an intergalactic cartel, brought humanity back from the brink of extinction, and hunted dangerous bounties to the far corners of the galaxy. Bounty hunting has brought you fortune, fame and love; but when a mysterious figure from your past reappears and puts a price on your sister’s head, your cushy life gets thrown into chaos.</p>
<p>Do you have what it takes to risk it all and bring down an intergalactic conspiracy that once again threatens your favorite species (humans)?</p>
<p><em><strong>High On Life</strong></em> RETURNS as you and your beloved rag-tag team of alien misfits shoot, stab, and skate your way through gorgeous, dangerous worlds all across the galaxy to blow up the EVIL pharmaceutical conglomerate hell-bent on putting price tags on HUMAN LIFE!</p>
<p><strong>FEATURES<br></strong>- BLAST your way through enemies with an arsenal of charismatic alien firepower in high-octane hyperactive combat.<br>
- Kickflip alien cops in the face and grind your way to freedom with your brand new SKATEBOARD.<br>
- Get up close and personal with an eccentric cast of bizarre and subversive lifeforms voiced by an ALL-STAR COMEDY CAST.<br>
- Wreak havoc at the galaxy’s biggest convention, an alien zoo for humans, and a luxury futuristic cruiseliner on your cosmic quest to TAKE DOWN BIG PHARMA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first game is already available on Switch 1 &amp; 2, so a Switch 2 port makes sense for the sequel. We'll keep an eye out for an official announcement.</p>
<p>The original game was conceived by Justin Roiland, co-creator of <strong>Rick &amp; Morty</strong> who also founded developer Squanch Games in 2016, so that should give you an idea of the humour in this series. Roiland is not involved in the sequel, as in 2023, he stepped down as CEO of the company following charges of domestic violence and sexual assault.</p>
<p>Our sister site Pure Xbox reviewed the original back when it released, and it's safe to say that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-for-pc/high-on-life">they didn't mince their words</a>. Let's hope the sequel is an improvement...</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hazelight-studio-josef-fares-next-game-better-than-split-fiction/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hazelight Studios</strong> has made a name for itself by creating excellent couch co-op games, with the team's latest release, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a></strong>, being one of 2025's best games, earning it several nominations at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">The Game Awards</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">DICE Awards</a>,</strong> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a></strong>. It was even one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Wccftech's picks for our Best Games of 2025</a>, and according to the studio's creative director, <strong>Josef Fares</strong>, the studio's next game will be "<em>better than Split Fiction</em>."</p>



<p>This comes from a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>, where Fares talked about a lot more than just what he expects from the studio's next game. He talked about how the team at Hazelight is consistently raising its bar, which is why he added, "<em>I feel extremely confident of everything we’re doing. I can easily say that our next game is better than Split Fiction</em>."</p>



<p>That confidence comes from the culture that has been built at the studio since its debut game, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Hazelight currently stands at a team of <strong>80 people</strong>, and keeping as much of that team together since its founding has been a key part of the studio's success, as they've all grown together with Josef Fares leading the charge with his "<em>F*** s*** up mentality, without f***ing up</em>."</p>

<iframe title="Split Fiction’s Josef Fares on Clair Obscur success, AI fears and EA’s reputation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9WyRvP53_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Hazelight's games are known for being creatively supercharged, which Fares credits to his ability to "<em>wake up the creative monster</em>" inside the developers at Hazelight. A task easier said than done, though, as we're often the ones to get in our own way.</p>



<p>"<em>People put a lot of limitations on themselves, and it’s mainly coming from their mind</em>. <em>Once you stop listening to that, shit will start happening. And how do you do it? Well, first, you practically push that person… in a nice way, obviously. You say, ‘not this’, ‘let’s do that’. ‘that’s been done before, let’s try this way’. And eventually they come into this ‘f*** s*** up’ mentality where they’re like, ‘okay, there are no limits’. And then you make that person feel confident that there really are no limits. People have so many possibilities inside them, and that’s not only for creating games, but in general. It’s just, stop listening to this [points to head] and just feel it instead.</em>"</p>



<p>Fares also discussed how the studio has had incredible commercial successes. Split Fiction <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">sold <strong>4 million copies at launch</strong></a>, and its prior release, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/">It Takes Two</a>,</strong> sold over <strong><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/it-takes-two-sold-over-20-million-copies-and-won-goty-but-hazelights-josef-fares-says-all-the-numbers-looked-really-really-bad-before-the-co-op-studio-became-this-really-big-developer/">20 million copies as of March 2025</a>.</strong> But those numbers weren't achieved with the studio following trends or trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/">put microtransactions into everything.</a> It came from the team at Hazelight keeping what's best for the game at the heart of all its decisions.</p>



<p>"<em>Every decision, every single decision, taken by Hazelight will be based on what we feel is great for the game. We’re not going through data thinking what will sell or not sell. That’s not how we do it. I’m not saying that the business is not important. It’s important to combine them together. If you lean in too much on either side, either too much on creativity or too much on business, it’s going to be bad for the game</em>."</p>



<p>On the topic of following trends, Fares also spared a few words on the hottest topic in the industry, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?wp_searchable_posts%5Bquery%5D=genAI">GenAI</a>. </strong>"<em>We have been working with AI for a long time in game development. The problem is the generative AI</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>If [an AI tool] is helpful to get your vision out there, I don’t see why we shouldn’t look into it. But… it’s the generative AI that people are a bit like…It’s really hard to answer. If you look at Midjourney, for instance, when it came out it was so impressive. And five years later… the bar hasn’t gone up much. Maybe this is the limit of it.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>You get someone generating a game concept and saying, ‘oh look what might happen in five years?’ But who knows? In five years, maybe it’s going to be like Midjourney… not much better</em>. <em>At the end of the day, you still need someone that has a vision or idea of what game it is. I don’t see AI taking over. I don’t. But it’s really hard to answer. Who knows what happens in the future?</em>"</p>

            <p>Update: Slikey has posted a <a href="https://x.com/slikey/status/2011116452321927491">fresh tweet</a> about Hypixel's efforts to tackle Hytale's teething issues. "We are already working on a patch for bugs and crashes," it reads. "That will hit the pre-release patchline once we have a good chunk of fixes. We are working on any auth issues. Please make sure your time is synced and also saw a report about Norwegian OS language causing issues."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>'s early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-release-time-and-date">went live a short time ago</a> as I write this. While plenty of folks look to have gotten in already, its devs have issued some guidance for the many others who've reported running into error messages or having their downloads stick.</p>
<p>The team lead by Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme who've swiftly resurrected the Minecraft-esque sandbox after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">buying the rights from Riot Games</a> had predicted launch day might see some teething troubles due to a bottleneck of eager Hytalers, and it certainly seems those concerns weren't misplaced.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While some of the errors folks have run into early doors trying to get into Hytale have been at the point of purchase - here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-error-a-basket-with-that-identifier-does-not-exist-fix">handy guide on how to deal with at least one of those</a> - a bunch of reported having things go pear-shaped while trying to download the game via its launcher.</p><p>Cue a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/523059903812599811/551337246364532737">Discord server</a> full of people spamming error messages. So far the Hypixel team are working on fixes, but the main bit of advice at this early stage is simple. "If you are seeing launcher downloads being stuck / error. Please restart the launcher," Hytale tech director Slikey has posted. "Global distribution is still rolling, so you may need to keep trying."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you are seeing really weird stuff, please reply to me.</p>— Slikey (@slikey) <a href="https://twitter.com/slikey/status/2011095876270203181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, folks with "really weird stuff " are being encouraged to reply to his tweet. While Hytale's Discord server doesn't appear to have a dedicated channel for those seeking help solving issues or getting advice on fixing bugs, its general game discussion channel has seen a bunch of posting to that effect in the past hour or so.</p>
<p>Honestly, if you're able, I'd give it an hour or two to settle down before trying to hop in if you're keen not to spend time having tech doors potentially slam in your face. Maybe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-doom-running-in-hytale-before-its-even-out-thanks-to-modders">watch a modder play Doom in Hytale</a> on repeat if that helps. We also have a guide to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-hytale-on-steam-deck">installing the latter on the Steam Deck</a> if you need such a thing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Game Freak’s established promotional pipeline for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games has the company using 3D renders, rather than hand-drawn art, to reveal new monsters ahead of each game’s launch. Anyone who cares about getting good assets of these new critters knows that this is the purgatory The Pokémon Company puts us through as we wait for the gorgeous illustrations we’ll get post-release, which resemble the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ken-sugimori-original-art-red-blue-gold-silver-1850352781"><span>old Ken Sugimori art</span></a><span> that you see featured on database sites like </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Raichu_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"><span>Bulbapedia</span></a><span>. Today, January 13, we finally got the art drop for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> and its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a> <span>DLC. And oh boy, there’s some beauts here.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the art is of the several dozen new Mega Evolutions added in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and its expansion, but it also includes official artwork of some of the major characters who show up later in the game and weren’t part of the initial marketing push. Notably, this includes Lysandre, Grisham, and Griselle, ex-members of the villainous Team Flare, some of the only truly “secret” characters who are crucial to some of the late game reveals. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2025-2000655443"><span>Lysandre</span></a><span> in particular was kept under wraps, given he was long presumed dead after the events of </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. I suppose The Pokémon Company is ripping that bandage off. You had three months to play the game, so the aged, immortal version of Lysandre we get in </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>might start showing up in more marketing material now that he’s being acknowledged through official channels.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But the real treat is the good art we finally have of all the Mega Evolutions, including my boy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Mega Raichu X</span></a><span>, the meme king </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-mega-starmie-friede-episode-2000654235"><span>Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, and some of the lesser-known transformations that debuted in the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-xbox-storage-expansion-card-drops-below-0-12-per-gb-at-a-new-year-record-low-as-amazon-clears-out-the-best-selling-ssd-2000656513</link>
            <guid>1404652</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="1023">Gaming has a file size problem. In recent years, we’ve seen video games reach overwhelmingly large sizes. This is particularly true for many big-budget games developed by Western AAA studios. Take <em data-start="286" data-end="308">Oblivion: Remastered</em>, for example, which has a file size of over 120GB. It’s hard to even imagine how much space <em data-start="401" data-end="422">Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will occupy when it’s eventually released. With games consuming such vast amounts of storage, it’s a challenge for players—especially since consoles like the Xbox Series X still come with only 1TB of internal storage. If you want to play more than just a few games, you’ll find yourself constantly managing space by deleting and reinstalling titles, which isn’t exactly convenient. A far better solution is to invest in a dedicated external storage drive. Seagate offers one that’s made specifically for the Xbox Series X and Series S, and it’s currently available at a significant discount for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="1025" data-end="1395"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Amazon is offering three versions of Seagate’s Xbox expansion card at reduced prices right now</a>. The 1TB model, typically priced at $160, is on sale for $149, giving you a $11 discount. The 2TB version has dropped from $260 to $230, saving you $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1397" data-end="1743">Since the Xbox Series X comes with just 1TB of storage, adding one of these Seagate drives will either double, triple, or even quintuple your available space for Xbox games—depending on which model you choose. This extra storage will make a huge difference if you want to keep a variety of games installed without constantly managing your space.</p>
<p data-start="1745" data-end="2146">Installing the Seagate expansion card is incredibly simple. Unlike the PS5, which requires users to open the console casing to install an SSD, the Seagate drive for Xbox Series X and S plugs directly into a dedicated slot at the back of the console. No tools are needed. Once it’s plugged in, you can select whether you want to save new games to the internal storage or to your Seagate expansion card.</p>


<h2 data-start="1745" data-end="2146">Swap Between Games With Ease</h2>
<p data-start="2148" data-end="2610">What’s more, games saved to the Seagate drive perform just as well as those stored on your Xbox’s internal storage. A major selling point of the current generation of Xbox consoles is Quick Resume, which allows you to suspend one game and switch to another without losing your progress. You can jump from a high-speed race in <em data-start="2495" data-end="2512">Forza Horizon 5</em> to a quick match in <em data-start="2533" data-end="2548">Rocket League</em>, then return to your original&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>race right where you left off.</p>
<p data-start="2612" data-end="2975" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Seagate’s expansion cards are officially licensed to support Xbox’s Velocity Architecture, which powers Quick Resume. This means any game you store on the Seagate drive will benefit from Quick Resume, just like games stored on the internal drive. Whether you’re downloading a new title or moving an existing one, the experience will remain seamless and efficient.</p>
<p data-start="2612" data-end="2975" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With lots of massive titles set to release this year such as <em>GTA VI</em> and <em>007 First Light</em>, now is a great time to expand your Xbox storage. Grab Seagate’s Xbox expansion card for as little as $160 for a limited time.</p>
