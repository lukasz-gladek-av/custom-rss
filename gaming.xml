                <p>Bandai Namco has announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-599972">Little Nightmares III</a> will launch on October 10, and a Switch 2 version is in the works. In addition, the publisher is giving away the remastered original game as a bonus for preordering. </p><p><span>Alongside the release date, the publisher also released a new trailer, which you can see in the embed below. The trailer shows what you can expect from the adventure game, including the characteristic tilt-shift style, dark and atmospheric environments, and cartoonishly spooky enemies.</span></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=narIoF9doAM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/narIoF9doAM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Preordering the game comes with an in-game costume set as well as Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition, a remaster of the original game. The Enhanced Edition has improved graphics and performance, allowing the game to run at 4K/60fps and boasting features like ray-tracing and volumetric lighting. The remaster is unlocked as soon as you place your preorder. If you already own the original game, you'll get a free upgrade to the Enhanced Edition on October 10. </p><p>Little Nightmares III is slated for release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, the original Nintendo Switch, and now also Switch 2. On PlayStation and Xbox, the standard edition costs $40, while the Deluxe Edition will run you $60 and comes with some additional in-game content (right now, the Steam preorder is $60 for standard and $80 for Deluxe, and it is unclear if this discrepancy is intentional or not). While it'll likely be familiar to fans of the series, Little Nightmares III makes a big change with the addition of co-op--a bold choice, and one that we thought showed promise when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-little-nightmares-3-the-addition-of-co-op-might-actually-make-the-game-scarier/1100-6526294/" data-ref-id="1100-6526294">we previewed the game last year</a>.</p>

The livestream shows various people calling out Mang0's behavior during the <em>Mario Kart </em>tournament, though it’s not clear that any of the organizers intervened at the time. </p><p>“I reached out to anyone who I thought might have felt uncomfortable and talked to them but also, and I already told Mang0 this, no longer inviting Mang0 to Mogul Moves events,” Ludwig said in a June 22 livestream, referencing his company that organized the tournament. “It’s a privilege to go to an event, the whole point of an event is it’s a fun thing to do, to have a good ass time and if somebody appearing jeopardizes somebody else having a good time that just can’t be a thing.”</p><p>On June 23, Marquez acknowledged the incident and said he had a problem with alcohol. “Sorry to everyone I’ve let down or hurt,” he wrote on X. “I know it just looks like I’m trying to save face but I genuinely feel so awful about it.. all I’ve done is reflect on my life and realized I’m a broken human   I will try and redeem myself over time as I always do  Gonna stop drinking immediately and get it together.”</p><p>Later that day, however, Cloud9, the team which Marquez has been representing in <em>Smash Bros.</em> tournaments for over a decade, announced it was parting ways with the esports player. “Following an internal evaluation, we have made the decision to release mang0 from Cloud9,” it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Cloud9/status/1937299762119868534&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Cloud9/status/1937299762119868534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in a statement</a></span>. “Regardless of tenure or accomplishments, the behavior demonstrated is entirely unacceptable and directly conflicts with our organization’s core values. We maintain a zero-tolerance stance regarding harassment or any other form of inappropriate conduct.”</p><p>It’s unclear how the Beerio Kart World Cup incident will impact Marquez’s involvement in the <em>Smash Bros.</em> competitive scene moving forward. One of the next big events, Supernova 2025, takes place in August. Currently ranked third among all <em>Melee</em> players, Marquez suggested he might be taking a break. “C9 dropping me.

            <p>
Another month, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update, again one that comes with a list of quality of life changes, but also one that comes with another surprising collaboration. Let's start with that one, which is, weirdly, a new story pack made in collaboration with Critical Role, the wildly popular actual play series. For some context, Critical Role did an official Assassin's Creed themed oneshot a little while back. In said oneshot, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>'s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLFpp3RqWBB/">Robbie Daymond played a character called Rufino</a>, who's being added into the game through this new mission in update 1.0.6.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Rufino, an old friend of Tomiko and Heiji, calls in a life debt after uncovering a deadly conspiracy," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> explains. "While working as a translator, he discovered evidence that a secretive organization has been hiring assassins to eliminate influential commoners. Now, he turns to Naoe and Yasuke for help in stopping these killers." Completing this quest nets you Rufino as a new ally, and you'll get the Critical Role logo as a banner.
</p>
<p>
Right, now the regular update stuff. A new nightmare difficult setting is now available with this update, which does a few different things. Defensive options are less effective in this mode, and you need to pull off perfect parries for them to deflect the hit fully. Enemy AI is "smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection." And combat resources are harder to find too.
</p>
<p>
For those of you oddly desperate to wear your headgear during cutscenes, that'll be an option now too, and there's toggles for specific types of VFX that you can turn off and on as well. The regional alert system available in castles has been expanded to the whole province on top of that, meaning that when you repeatedly attack "Civilians or Military units outside Castles, the alarm can be triggered, and a group of Guardians will hunt you in the world." There's also three different camera presets when on a horse, for your riding pleasure.

They can stick the camera <em>really </em>close to his face, too. And that’s allowed people to compare this new version of Sam to the one from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tips-for-playing-death-stranding-1839674810?_gl=1*yd757o*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA3OTA0MzEkbzE0OCRnMCR0MTc1MDc5MDQzMyRqNTgkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tips-for-playing-death-stranding-1839674810?_gl=1*yd757o*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA3OTA0MzEkbzE0OCRnMCR0MTc1MDc5MDQzMyRqNTgkbDAkaDA.">original game, released in 2019 on PS4</a></span>. The results are genuinely impressive. </p><figure id="" data-id="9da3d3e28a2cd3a311f88a0eddf34327" data-recommend-id="image://9da3d3e28a2cd3a311f88a0eddf34327" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="9da3d3e28a2cd3a311f88a0eddf34327" data-recommend-id="image://9da3d3e28a2cd3a311f88a0eddf34327" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sam looked fine in the first game on PS4, but compared directly side-by-side to how he looks in <em>DS2</em>, it’s very clear that a lot of technical improvements have happened in the six years since that game. His flesh looks less plastic-y and his eyes look more natural. Even his eyebags look more fleshy and real. The old Sam, in comparison, looks like a Halloween mask. </p><p>Here’s a great video comparing the two games via Nick930: </p><p>“Norman Reedus 720p vs Norman Reedus 4k,” joked one Reddit user. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1lihzuw/comparison_goes_crazy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1lihzuw/comparison_goes_crazy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another replied to an image comparison of the two</a></span> with: “My guy was legit sick in DS1, made some connections and powered up like Mario in <em>DS2.</em>” </p><p>My favorite theory as to why Sam Porter Bridges looks so much better and healthier in <em>Death Stranding 2</em> comes from Reddit user gpost86: “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1lihzuw/comment/mzcsv0d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1lihzuw/comment/mzcsv0d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First one was chugging Monster.</a></span>” Honestly, that makes sense.

                <p>Fan-made video games based on popular franchises always run the risk of having the official rights-holder step in and shut things down, but that's not happening with Spartan Survivors.</p><p>The community-developed game, which has players fighting hordes of Covenant and Flood enemies as Master Chief or the Arbiter, has been given an official blessing from Microsoft. The developers <a href="https://x.com/SpartnSurvivors/status/1937572095573283004" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> Microsoft reached out to them to say they "really love to see the passion" from the team. People at Microsoft apparently played the game as well. "It really is fun and we look forward to getting further in our playthrough and unlocking more stuff," the Halo representative said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJuvhdWvzVw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJuvhdWvzVw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft, did, however, have one specific request for the developers. Microsoft reportedly asked the team to add language to the legal disclaimer in the game's credits and on store pages to make it ultra-clear that the project is not an official Halo game or made in partnership with Halo Studios.</p><p>This language will be added in the next update to Spartan Survivors. "We want to thank Halo Studios and Microsoft for their real sympathy toward us," the studio said.</p><p>You can <a href="https://juanggz.itch.io/spartan-survivors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">download Spartan Survivors today on itch.io</a> for free. The game's store page mentions that it's also coming to Xbox and Steam in 2025, but as of yet, it's unclear when that might happen. The announcement trailer can be seen above, containing the outdated language mentioning a 2024 release.</p><p>Microsoft is moving ahead with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">its own new Halo games</a>, which are in the works at the newly rebranded Halo Studios and will run on Unreal Engine 5.

Title Update 1.0.6 is headlined by a quest developed in collaboration with Critical Role, as well as a new, more challenging difficulty setting.</p><p>The update's new questline is called A Critical Encounter, and its narrative centers around Rufino, a character first created during Critical Role's one-off Assassin's Creed-themed series. Rufino is voice-acted by Critical Role's Robbie Daymond, and completion of the quest unlocks Rufino as an Ally. In addition to this quest, Ubisoft is also adding a Critical Role-themed weapon pack that can be purchased in the in-game store.</p>

<p>The update also adds a new Nightmare difficulty setting, designed to significantly increase the challenge that players face. Nightmare increases enemy skill and decreases the effectiveness of player abilities; enemies are not only stronger, but also faster and smarter, according to the patch notes. Players will also have to be more careful about noise; on this setting, Naoe will make a sound even while crouching.</p><p>Along with these two big content additions, the update adds a bunch of changes and tweaks to improve the game. For instance, players can now opt to remove headgear during cutscenes; Ubisoft has also added a toggle for specific VFX. Title Update 1.0.6 launches tomorrow, June 25, at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET / 2 PM UTC; You can check out the whole list of changes in the patch notes below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520225" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520225"></a><figcaption>You'll be able to unlock Critical Role's Rufino as an Ally (image via Ubisoft). </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg"></figure><p>This isn't the first big collaboration that Ubisoft has done for Shadows. Back in May, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-update-adds-two-unexpected-crossovers-and-major-parkour-upgrades/1100-6531829/" data-ref-id="1100-6531829">launched collabs with Dead By Daylight and Balatro</a>.

This includes a new free quest called "A Critical Encounter," a new Ally to recruit and a new trophy/achievement to add to your collection.</p><h4>New Free Story Pack: "A Critical Encounter"</h4><p>Rufino, an old friend of Tomiko and Heiji, calls in a life debt after uncovering a deadly conspiracy. While working as a translator, he discovered evidence that a secretive organization has been hiring assassins to eliminate influential commoners.</p><p>Now, he turns to Naoe and Yasuke for help in stopping these killers.</p><p>Unlock conditions: Complete "Way of the Blacksmith" and unlock Yasuke as a playable character. This questline will start in the Hideout.</p><ul><li>Reward: New Ally based on Critical Role's Assassin's Creed Shadows One-Shot campaign character, Rufino, played by Robbie Daymond. You will also get a banner in the hideout with the Critical Role logo.</li><li>New Trophy/Achievement: "A Critical Encounter", received upon completion of the questline.</li></ul><p>With this collaboration, we will also release a Critical Role Weapon Pack inspired by the Critical Role universe, available for purchase in the game store! This pack includes 2 weapons for both characters, a Tanto and Katana for Naoe and a Kanabo and Teppo for Yasuke.</p><h4>New Nightmare Difficulty Setting</h4><p>We are adding a new Difficulty Setting (Nightmare) that will introduce additional challenges to your journey. This mode will impact both combat and stealth, requiring more tactical planning and greater attention to your surroundings. Prepare for tougher enemies and a more intense overall experience.</p><p>Here is a tease of some changes you can expect from this new difficulty:</p><ul><li>Player defensive options are less effective, and enemies deal greater damage at all levels.  <ul><li>E.g., Parries now require perfect timing to deflect the hit--imperfect parries will only partially block incoming damage.</li></ul></li><li>Enemy AI is smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection.  <ul><li>E.g., Even while crouching, Naoe now generates some sound! And even while in the shadows, she can be seen while moving!</li><li>E.g., Enemies will no longer become vulnerable from dodges or parries--only abilities can put them into a vulnerable state.</li></ul></li><li>Combat resources (like adrenaline, rations, and shinobi items) are harder to come by, making their use even more vital.</li></ul><h4>Toggle Headgear in Cutscenes</h4><p>We're excited to introduce a highly requested feature: players can now choose to show headgear, whether it's a hood, helmet, headband, or more during cutscenes. Now your style can shine through dialogue scenes too!</p><p>You will find the option available in the in-game settings.</p><ul><li>Note that headgear will not be displayed in cinematics or in some specific instances where a rule overrides this setting (romance-specific cutscenes).</li></ul><h4>VFX Toggles</h4><p>Players can now disable/enable specific VFX to further customize their experience. These include the ability to hide or show the loot on dead bodies, the last known position of the player, the special attacks indicators of the enemies, and more.</p><p>All will be accessible in the Interface option menu.</p><h4>Open World Alarm</h4><p>We have expanded the Regional Alert System available in Castles to the whole Province. Now by repetitively attacking Civilians or Military units outside Castles, the alarm can be triggered, and a group of Guardians will hunt you in the world.</p><h4>Horse Camera Presets</h4><p>You can now toggle between 3 different camera presets while riding on your mount (hold the down button on controller/'X' key on keyboard while riding) allowing for a more cinematic experience to take in the full beauty of Japan.</p><h4>Ultra Low Specs for PC</h4><p>We are adding a new visual quality level, the Ultra Low mode. This will allow PC players with a limited GPU configuration to experience the game in better framerate conditions.</p><h3>List of Bug Fixes</h3><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Onryo Mask remained visible despite selecting the option to hide gear.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to earn Mastery Points.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Mastery Points were not returned after resetting the Mastery Tree.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not switch characters anymore even without gameplay context restrictions.</li><li>Fixed an issue where allies could be trained to veteran rank without upgrading the dojo to level 3.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Gennojo did not immediately appear in the hideout after recruitment. <em>He was busy washing his hair!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes a player remains stuck in a Red Zone, without being able to fast travel anywhere, by allowing them to fast travel to the hideout.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Oni Drawing remains stuck on screen after completing the "Vision of the Realms" quest.</li><li>Fixed various localization issues.</li></ul><h4>Quests</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in the "A Chance Encounter" quest when following Fuyu.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the quest after defeating all Kabukimono.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Lady Oichi's letter became unavailable after the Fuji-maru cutscene.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to talk to Katsuhime in the crop field when she was sitting on the ground. <em>She just wanted some peace and quiet!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where tracking the "Temple Stories" quest only showed a progress bar with no text.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Genzaburo's Teppo Master was missing from the Kaya Shrine.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Yagyu Munetoshi revealed a later plot point too early in the "Nobutsuna's Students" quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not assassinate the Godai of Void because the NPC was missing. <em>He took his name too seriously.</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest after dodge rolling and dropping Katsuhime.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest when there was no immediate option to carry Katsuhime.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players glitched through an anomaly in the "Heads Will Roll" quest, making Animus activities unavailable.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in the "Lost Honor" quest because the game failed to switch to Naoe.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress through the Tournament after dying.</li></ul><h4>Visuals &amp; Graphics</h4><ul><li>Fixed some minor visual issues.</li><li>Fixed misplaced visual elements with the Dark Woods Kusarigama.</li><li>Fixed an issue where all NPC horses appeared as identical.</li><li>Fixed a clipping issue with Naoe's Sekiryu outfit.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the "Bloodshade Katana" being visible out of the sheath when transmogged.</li><li>Fixed a movement physics issue with the Dead by Daylight Oni's armor.</li></ul><h4>Audio</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where footstep audio occasionally ceased when opening the map while moving.</li></ul>

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2, with this upgraded version of the original game set to release on October 10th. However, you can play it from today but there is a catch in that you have to pre-order Little Nightmares 3 to get access to it.&nbsp; The game will feature 60fps and 4K resolution. This is not the first we have heard of this release as it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/31/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-has-been-rated-for-ps5-pc-xbox-series-xs/">rated for PS5, PC &amp; Xbox Series X|S&nbsp;</a>in 2023.</p>

<p>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition will have 4K visuals, run at 60 fps and have updated visuals. You can see how it compares to the original in the trailer above. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review/">Little Nightmares Review,</a> Tuffcub said, <em>“Little Nightmares is something of a minor classic. Gorgeously gross and surprisingly inventive, it creates a genuine feeling of terror and tension. It’s a bit odd to say a game that involves skipping over corpses is enjoyable, but it is, just don’t blame Tarsier if you have nightmares.”</em></p>
<p>This was not the final announcement from The Little Nightmares Showcase, as it as also been confirmed there is Little Nightmares VR project in development too. It is called Little Nightmares VR: Altered Echoes, though no more information has been announced for it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer SloClap makes their way back onto the pitch with the latest release, <em>Rematch</em>, which, for many, is a complete surprise given their previously released game, the critically acclaimed <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4eb09aa-4d8d-496c-940f-2c14baf34294" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sifu-review" rel="nofollow">martial arts action game <em>Sifu</em></a>, and the online <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="52c8a31d-3aae-4c41-8936-cf2702b2878d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/absolver-review-to-know-your-enemy-and-yourself" rel="nofollow">multiplayer combat game <em>Absolver</em></a>. As a keen football (soccer to my American counterparts) supporter for a specific English football club, the opportunity to review this game was right up my alley; having participated in May's Closed Beta Test, everything looked promising for <em>Rematch </em>and its developer.</p>

<p><em>Rematch </em>is premised largely inspired by a hybrid of street football and five-a-side football with no rules other than the Mercy Rule, meaning there are no yellow or red cards, no offside shenanigans, and no VAR required. But this game more than piqued my interest beyond making football games a cash cow project; it makes it fun to play and enjoy solo and with friends, as my hands-on experiences brought back childhood memories of playing <em>FIFA Street</em> with my younger brother.</p>

<h2><em>Rematch </em>Review - From The Academy To Football Stardom</h2>

<p>If you're in the loop about <em>Rematch</em>, it's an online multiplayer football game with a third-person perspective, which, for fans of <em>FIFA Street</em>, much like myself, this game feels like its spiritual successor. Unlike other prominent football games of yesteryear and the present time, players won't be going head-to-head against AI-controlled opponents, as every teammate and those on the opposing team are controlled by other players in the match.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rematch-player-kicking-ball-at-goal.jpg?itok=gHT4jLH1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rematch-player-kicking-ball-at-goal.jpg?itok=SOdiD6o2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every player on the pitch in 3v3, 4v4, 5v5, or Ranked matches is an actual person playing, no AI-controlled players. (Picture: SloClap / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>There are elements to yet another football-centric game, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0c57d97b-9c9b-4a8b-ad82-932c8cf049c0" href="https://techraptor.net/games/rocket-league" rel="nofollow"><em>Rocket League</em></a>, where players are playing not just for ball possession but to pull off incredible goal-scoring moments worthy of being replayed, much to the pain and suffering of the team that conceded the goal. Another core gameplay aspect of Rematch is that it isn't a football-simulated game where players must strategize and assign their starting lineup and substitute players to keep the pressure on or bolster their defense; instead, what matters is the precise time to attack, tackle, steal ball possession, defend and of course, GOOOOOAL as one wrong button input or missed opportunity could spell the downfall of the match.</p>

<p>It may seem and feel this straightforward, but take it from me: there's a huge learning curve before immediately jumping into any of the multiplayer modes, and players can take advantage of the Practice mode, which unlocks once the Prologue is completed. Here, players can learn and practice various skills, like movement, passing, defending, scoring, and goalkeeping, through a tutorial to master the basics, with each skill having at least two Workshops for more advanced tricks.</p>

<p>The game's controls are pretty easy to learn and understand, but if you're like me, who spent time in Practice Mode, most of the advanced skills and controls get lost the moment they enter matchmaking, so sincerest apologies to those who had to carry me in matches during the Early Access period. Outside of the Prologue and Practice Modes, its core gameplay experiences are in its multiplayer features, of which <em>Rematch </em>offers Quick (Casual) and Ranked matches; the latter becomes available once players reach Level 5 in Quick (Casual) Match and only offers a Ranked 5v5 multiplayer mode.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Quick (Casual) has three multiplayer modes: 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5, which are great options if playing solo, to help players master and fine-tune their fútbol skills and, of course, earn experience points (XP) to level up their ranking. There's a Custom Match feature, in which players can create private games and fine-tune the match parameters for their friends to join or join custom games from a generated code.</p>

(Picture: SloClap / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>Do keep in mind that experience (XP) will not be awarded to players when participating in custom games to earn XP; they can play in a Quick (Casual) or Ranked Match. Rematch also features Customization options for their in-game character, which include two Preset slots to customize their character and other customizable details, such as home and away kits, career profiles, Celebration emotes, ARs, and stadiums, among other features.</p>

<p>Some customization options, such as equipment options and kit designs, are locked behind the game's season pass, called the Captain Pass, or through microtransactions, in which they can buy more options within the Customization tab or the in-game Store. Speaking of the Captain Pass, Rematch looks to add new content every season for players to unlock on their free or premium tiers and new casual and competitive game features, the latter of which includes a tournament offering and leaderboard rankings for the professional players amongst us.</p>

<p>SloClap was initially scheduled to release crossplay support with the game at launch; however, due to ongoing technical issues, the developer has delayed its release to resolve pressing issues, including latency problems, desync, and stability issues, by releasing hotfixes and patch updates. With crossplay temporarily unavailable, players can matchmake in solo queue or create custom matches for friends on their preferred platform for the time being until the crossplay update launches soon.</p>

<h3><em>Rematch </em>Review - It Pays To Be A Football Star</h3>

<p>Rematch is similar to many live service sports games on the market, for which SloClap has developed and designed its content to appeal to all football fans. It doesn't have a central narrative that players can follow every season, although this would have been an interesting choice to pursue, further supported by the Prologue, which depicts our playable character's progression from an aspiring talent scouted to training for superstardom on the football pitch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rematch-battle-pass-screen.jpg?itok=P2yhTwCY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rematch-battle-pass-screen.jpg?itok=IRpWHyuq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players can earn various items, including cosmetics, stadiums, ARs and in-game currencies from the season pass by unlocking a tier and its corresponding slots using Tier Tokens. (Picture: SloClap / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of the live service offerings, Rematch has a season pass that has free-to-play (F2P) and paid tiers, and most of the unlocked rewards are cosmetics, but there are other cool rewards to get, such as stadiums, AR cages, Celebration and Victory emotes and more. There are three Chapters available within the pass, with the Pre-Season chapter currently available, and once completed, players can unlock the Qualifiers and the Championship chapters; however, the latter two will go live at specific dates and times during the current season.</p>

<p>Other rewards that can be unlocked from the free tiers of the season pass are the in-game currencies, Quants (the gold coins), and Blocks (blue credits). Both Quants and Blocks are used to purchase items from the in-game Store, and, in the case of the Quants, can also be used to purchase Upgrade Tickets and also purchase cosmetic items from the in-game Store.</p>

<p>Players can purchase Quants in bundles using real-world currency; however, Blocks can only be earned in-game from the pass and from completing matches. There are "technically" other currencies present in-game, the first being Tier Tokens, which are denoted with a green icon and are used to unlock season pass tiers, while the Upgrade Tickets are precisely what they're intended for: upgrading their season pass from free to premium (paid) version.</p>

<p><u><strong>I will admit</strong></u> that it took me around 15 hours to finally understand the Monetization model and the purposes of each in-game currency, which I wish the developer had added in-game pop-ups or labels to define them clearly. The <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/feature-focus-monetization" rel="nofollow">dedicated blog post on the game's Monetization model</a> adequately explains Quants and Blocks, but it doesn't do enough to explain how to earn and use Tier Tokens and Upgrade Tickets.</p>

<p>Despite the game's $30 price tag and a vast majority of the in-game content being accessible and available for free, the game has garnered some (and possibly valid) criticism aimed at its microtransactions, with <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/feature-focus-monetization" rel="nofollow">some players voicing their opinions online</a> on its cosmetic options locked behind the premium tiers. Yes, there are a few cosmetics to be unlocked on the free tiers; however, the remaining cosmetic items are paywalled, but if you want to own them, you will have to spend cold, hard cash to buy Quants before spending it, but this is an option at the end of the day.</p>

(Picture: SloClap / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>Nevertheless, players can still earn Quants and Blocks, which may be an eyebrow-raising issue; however, many players have voiced their opinions that the game's microtransactions feel fair and reasonable, with some stating that they'd rather give money to SloClap over Electronic Arts and Ubisoft (ouch)!</p>

<h3><em>Rematch </em>Review - The Glitched And The Buggy</h3>

<p>For what SloClap offers players at launch with <em>Rematch</em>, there are a few areas that are missed shots during penalty shootouts. While I experienced minimal technical and performance issues during the Closed Beta Test (CBT), this differs from my experiences during the Early Access period, launch day, and post-launch period.</p>

<p>The developer has identified a handful of performance and stability issues, bugs, and glitches that impacted the gameplay experience during the game's Early Access period, which were addressed in a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps" rel="nofollow">blog post regarding the game's launch</a> and post-launch plans. Two hotfix patches were released within this timeframe, and while they're aware that other issues are affecting players, <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-hotfixes-0-4-1-20-004" rel="nofollow">the Day 1 patch update</a> was released; however, some problems persist.</p>

<p>One of the significant issues is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2138720/discussions/0/594026463740585951/" rel="nofollow">ball desync</a>&nbsp;which has been a thorn in my side during Early Access, launch day, and post-launch, making multiple matches frustrating experiences to play at best. For those unfamiliar, this persistent issue occurs when the ball's current location, direction, or speed differs significantly for the player compared to others in the match due to desynchronization or inconsistency; which some noticeable ball desync behaviors I identified include the ball glitching and teleporting from multiple locations on the pitch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rematch-ball-glitching.jpg?itok=V0E3-Xdg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rematch-ball-glitching.jpg?itok=r_G8oHu7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What IS the ball doing??? (Picture: SloClap / Ashleigh Klein)&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Another noticeable ball desync issue occurs when attempting to score, where multiple instances have been observed of trying to score, but the ball either doesn't move from its position. This can be particularly frustrating for goalkeeping positions as players would be unable to identify when the best opportunity to tackle opposing players and block incoming goal-scoring opportunities.</p>

<p>This is more prevalent when queuing up solo than when playing with friends, as the latter can still try to coordinate a different strategy, whereas playing solo, it will be almost impossible to coordinate or implement a strategy to mitigate the ball desync issue. Even more so for players, myself included, when attempting goals, which can lead to rather unfortunate mishaps or consequences like losing matches by a large margin or players leaving games out of frustration.</p>

<p>Ball desync remains an issue for the developer to patch, but matchmaking has been an equally stressful issue despite the availability of multiple servers at launch. During Rematch's Early Access period, the developers were aware of latency and desync issues that were impacting gameplay performance and server stability, which made matchmaking quite stressful.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the developer has <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1936468880031105458" rel="nofollow">deployed multiple hotfixes and a patch update</a>, which aimed to address the aforementioned issues, especially concerning server and matchmaking issues; players, myself included, still experienced difficulties finding 4v4 and 5v5 matches across servers. As such, players have defaulted to 3v3 matches, and this has made finding these matches on the European server, from my perspective, somewhat annoying due to the long matchmaking times.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rematch-player-celebration.jpg?itok=yUXFQ9UX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rematch-player-celebration.jpg?itok=T7rr-DAx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In light of recent hotfixes and patch updates, there have been improvements made to server stability and matchmaking, allowing players to find Casual and Ranked Matches much easier. (Picture: SloClap / Ashleigh Klein)&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>But with the recent patch update adding fixes to improve server stability and matchmaking issues, I've been finding more 4v4 and 5v5 Casual matches, and the same can be said for Ranked 5v5 matches, despite being intimidated by the thought of playing in Ranked matches. Aside from the ongoing ball desync and various server and matchmaking issues, I did experience multiple game crashes, which may be related to the network and performance issues that the developer had released a fix for in a recent patch update; however, despite this, I still experienced game crashes, which were oftentimes during matches, meaning any XP accumulated and leveling progress was lost.</p>

<h2><em>Rematch </em>Review - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>SloClap's <em>Rematch </em>is the closest spiritual successor to <em>FIFA Street </em>we'll get, minus the scummy microtransactions and dubious content decisions we experienced from EA and the FIFA series. While the developer is working tirelessly to resolve the persistent technical and performance issues still plaguing the game, it delivers a fun and competitive football gaming experience that many have been seeking.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, I will continue to be a football fan, even during the worst years of my club’s performance, which has made it a lot harder to watch football. Based on my time with <em>Rematch</em>, sure, I suck rotten eggs, but I had a great time trying my best to up my in-game performance.</p>

<p>I guess I should spend my time away from the pitch in-game, at least.</p>

<p><em><strong>Rematch was reviewed on PC via Steam for 23 hours with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the course of the review.</strong></em></p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lies-of-p-overture-is-the-best-parts-of-the-game-executed-with-confidence.1227369/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As <em>Lies of P</em> progresses, it moves away from the veiled story beats of its Souls game inspirations and veers closer to a direct melodrama. In these moments you can see something beautiful happen, not just a game finding its footing but a developer establishing a house style. The DLC, <em>Lies of P: Overture </em>takes this approach and hones it further, establishing the main game’s pattern as a clear-eyed approach to telling a story that goes beyond its simple premise.</p><p>For those who did not play the original <em>Lies of P</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-is-good-overture-annoucement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you should</a>. A take on the Pinocchio<em> </em>story in the style of <em>Bloodborne </em>and <em>Sekiro</em>, <em>Lies of P </em>is one of the few titles to riff on what FromSoft established in a way that’s transformative and well-executed enough to be ranked as an equal. The main story takes place in the wake of societal collapse; the city of Krat is dominated by murderous puppets, mercenary humans known as stalkers, and people mutated into ambling creatures by a horrible petrification disease. As the game unfolds you begin to piece together how Krat fell, and who is to blame.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Overture</em> is chronologically a prequel, but mechanically one that involves P going back in time. It does not show Krat before its collapse; that part is still veiled, and I imagine would be far more complex than the scope of a DLC would allow. Rather, it shows the final days, following the events in the web of relationships that led to the creation of P. You follow the Legendary Stalker, a character whose importance is only alluded to in the main game.&nbsp;</p><p>The original <em>Lies of P </em>takes time to find its footing. <em>Overture </em>does not have that problem: those lessons have been learned already, and so when you play it you hit the ground running. This is true not just in how the narrative lays itself out, but also mechanically. <em>Overture</em> adds several new weapons, items, and legion arms, and thankfully none of them feel extraneous. The conceit of <em>Lies of P</em>’s weapon system is handles and blades that can be mixed and matched, but while the main game featured many weapons that felt like filler, <em>Overture </em>adds far fewer and makes the ones that it does include far more interesting.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The puppet has a gun. Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>Most notable here is the Royal Horn Bow, which allows P to go medium range and totally changes combat. But there’s also a gunblade, a pair of Wolverine-style talons, and a lightning blade that all radically alter the flow of combat. The added legion arms, the trick weapons attached to P’s mechanical arm, are also welcome additions, and I spent the majority of <em>Overture</em> using the Cataclysm – a big shotgun that P can charge like Mega Man and, at higher levels, Active Reload like Gears of War. That’s right, they gave Pinocchio a shotgun.</p><figure><figcaption>They added a kitty. Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>If I went out of my way to find a major flaw in <em>Overture</em>, it is that it hews closely to the established patterns and tone of the main game. While it is clear that Krat has fallen and that the world is slightly less decrepit, it doesn’t take place far enough back chronologically to feel as distinct as it could. You are still fighting a lot of grotesque humans and animals, the latter of which are some of the most disgusting monsters I have ever fought in almost any game.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>These things are nasty. Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>But practically speaking I’m not bothered. While <em>Overture </em>is more <em>Lies of P</em>, it’s more of the best part of <em>Lies of P.</em> A few of <em>Overture’s </em>locations rank among the most striking in the game, like the Zoo in the beginning, or a frozen shipwrecked area under a beautiful Aurora. There’s a side quest in it that hits harder than any in <em>Nier: Automata</em>. The bosses are tremendously challenging, and the final confrontation is both a fantastic reveal and a legendary fight. And when P finally does catch up with the Legendary Stalker, how the game chooses to fill in that backstory is a reveal that is heartbreaking and melodramatic in a way that could only come from these developers.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Neowiz</figcaption></figure><p>There’s only so much you can efficiently do with DLC, particularly when it is abundantly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-first-dlc-and-game-update-teased" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clear</a> that you are making a sequel. But <em>Overture</em> succeeds at its task of assuring the player that the success of the original game was no fluke.&nbsp; If <em>Lies of P </em>was developers Round 8 Studio and Neowiz announcing that they had arrived, <em>Overture </em>is a confirmation that they are here to stay.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game"><h3>Experience The Joy Of Rejecting Andrew Cuomo Through A Video Game</h3></a><p>Robert Yang's latest browser game lets you, too, not rank Andrew Cuomo for NYC mayor</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 makes some big improvements over the first console, especially when comparing it to the first iteration that came out in 2017. A lot of that has to do with the significantly more powerful APU, but the larger, crisper screen is certainly the upgrade you'll notice first. It could also be the area where you might notice where the Switch 2 falls short of its predecessor.</p><p>Shortly after release, some discussions regarding how blurry the on-board display seemed to be started surfacing, prompting some hardware publications to take a closer look. Hardware Unboxed, known for detailed reviews of PC hardware and monitors, conducted a few tests on the Nintendo Switch 2 display, taking a closer look at the screen's response time. Running the display through 20 gray-to-gray transitions to measure response times, Hardware Unboxed determined that the Switch 2's LCD was one of the slowest it's ever tested, coming in at 33.3ms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB67B8LCorI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AB67B8LCorI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To put that into context, Hardware Unboxed compared this to an average LCD panel you'll find in entry-level displays today. These were tested in the same manner and averaged out to a response time of 6.3ms. Perhaps the most damning was the comparison to the original Switch's LCD, a display that is more than eight years old, that presented a response time nearly twice as fast a 21.3ms. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> noted the same issues with the display in its extensive Nintendo Switch 2 review earlier this week, noting that, "The Switch 2 LCD has blurring characteristics that are easily worse than the 2017 Switch's display"</p><p>Why does a fast response time matter? With slower response times, it takes longer for the image on-screen to transition between new frames, which can lead to noticeable blurring with objects in motion. This is particularly bad when the Switch 2 is running games at 60fps, which thus far is the preferred frame rate of most first-party titles. To put it into perspective, it takes 16.67ms for a new frame to be rendered when running at 60Hz, but it takes the display twice as long to transition from one frame to the next, causing a significant bottleneck that reduces the impact of improved motion clarity that higher refresh rates provide. This would be just as bad, if not worse, in games making use of the full 120Hz the new display has to offer.</p><p>It's unclear why this is happening, but Hardware Unboxed offers a suggestion that Nintendo has decided to reduce an overdrive support for the display (which uses higher voltages to drive faster transitions) in the pursuit of better battery life. With a display that is brighter and larger, Nintendo might have potentially reduced its ability to transition faster as a tradeoff. Given that the Nintendo Switch 2 ships with a 19Wh battery, less than half of that found in Valve's Steam Deck, it's understandable why this concession might have been made. But considering how noticeable it can be once you've seen it, it could make portable play significantly less desirable until addressed, if it ever is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-qa-its-a-very-good-match-for-us-because-of-the-stories-we-want-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an exclusive interview with Alexander Mishulin and Andrey Tsvetkov from Owlcat Games about The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, which was announced earlier this month during Summer Game Fest 2025. During our conversation, we noted that this was a very different game from what Owlcat has made so far (Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, and Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, all of which are cRPGs). Interestingly, we learned that the studio has hired experts in third-person action RPG games, including some from CD Projekt RED:</p>
<p><em><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin</strong>: It was part of the process when we were in pre-production. We had to establish different processes. It's not difficult or something very special or an unusual transition; it's just a new process to make a new game. Also, we expanded our team for this project. We welcomed new team members from companies that have already done similar games, especially from CD Projekt, so we built not only upon our own expertise and knowledge but also upon our new colleagues' knowledge, which helped us quite a lot.</em></p>
<p>Speaking about the choice to go with third-person, Owlcat added:</p>
<p><em><strong>Alexander</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Mishulin: </strong>From the first pitch, it was all about making a third person game because The Expanse is about people. We want you to connect more with the characters, the protagonist and the companions, and we want you to be immersed in this very grounded, realistic, sci-fi world.</em></p>
<p><em>We wanted to show you that, and for that, we needed to change perspective and make things more realistic and cinematic. Because of that, we transitioned to the third person, and yes, we were a little bit afraid at the beginning. We started prototyping and made several combat and exploration arenas.&nbsp;We experimented with different approaches, how we wanted our cover system to work, how we wanted our enemies to work. Just for combat arenas, we had six prototypes in the beginning just to make the combat basics feel right.</em></p>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn doesn't have a release date yet, but we look forward to learning more about it in the coming months. Stay tuned for more coverage on Wccftech.</p>

First spotted by Engadget, and confirmed via the Netflix app, Supergiant’s Greek mythology inspired roguelike and 21 other games are being delisted from the service next month. Several titles like <em>Braid</em>, <em>Katana Zero</em>, and yes, <em>Hades</em>, were available exclusively on mobile via Netflix, meaning that when those games go, that’s potentially it for them on Android / iOS.</p><p>Here’s a full list of the games leaving Netflix next month. Most games depart the service July 14th, but <em>Hades </em>goes a little earlier on July 1st. (<em>Carmen Sandiego</em>, however, doesn’t have a confirmed date for delisting, only that it’s “leaving soon.”)</p><div><ul><li><span><em>Battleship </em></span></li><li><span><em>Braid, Anniversary Edition </em></span></li><li><span><em>Carmen Sandiego </em></span></li><li><span><em>CoComelon: Play with JJ</em> </span></li><li><span><em>Death’s Door</em> </span></li><li><span><em>Diner Out: Merge Cafe</em> </span></li><li><span><em>Dumb Ways to Survive</em> </span></li><li><span><em>Ghost Detective</em></span></li><li><span><em>Hades </em></span></li><li><span><em>Katana ZERO</em></span></li><li><span><em>LEGO Legacy: Heroes Unboxed</em></span></li><li><span><em>Ludo King</em></span></li><li><span><em>Monument Valley</em></span></li><li><span><em>Monument Valley 2</em></span></li><li><span><em>Monument Valley 3</em></span></li><li><span><em>Rainbow Six: Smol</em></span></li><li><span><em>Raji: An Ancient Epic</em></span></li><li><span><em>SpongeBob: Bubble Pop F.U.N.</em></span></li><li><span><em>TED Tumblewords</em></span></li><li><span><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></span></li><li><span><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em></span></li><li><span><em>Vineyard Valley</em></span></li></ul></div><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to the developers of the games that had their mobile versions available exclusively via Netflix to ask if they had plans to distribute them as premium titles. In an email, Nigel Lowrie, a spokesperson for Devolver Digital, wrote, “We are looking at bringing games that leave services like <em>Poinpy</em>, <em>Katana Zero</em>, and <em>Death’s Door</em> to mobile stores as premium titles.” </p><p>He also said that the developer for each of these games has its own timeline for when that will happen but Devolver is working to get them up on mobile storefronts “as soon as possible.” Devolver Digital has some experience with this as <em>Exit the Gungeon</em>, which had a mobile version available exclusively via Apple Arcade, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/689374/enter-the-mobile-gungeon">will become a paid game on iOS and Android</a> after it was delisted from Apple’s gaming subscription service last year.</p><p>In the Discord server for Color Gray Games, the developers of the <em>Golden Idol </em>series, Andrejs Klavins, the games’ lead designer and programmer, wrote, “This is all recent news for us and all the practical implications have yet to be worked out.” The statement suggests that some developers were only recently told their games would be leaving the platform and not something that was necessarily pre-planned.</p><div><p>This removal of third-party games, many of which had decent, mainstream success outside of Netflix, reflects the platform’s shifting games strategy. It has halted its acquisition spree and, in October of last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">Netflix closed the new studio it spun up to produce a multiplatform AAA game</a> before it could release anything. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">In an interview with <em>The Verge</em> at the Game Developers Conference in March</a>, Netflix’s new president of games Alain Tascan said, “we need to find our voice.” </p></div><p>Netflix plans on streamlining its offerings to focus more on games that are tied to Netflix-owned shows, multiplayer party games, games for kids, and “mainstream” titles that have their own large fanbases. And when you look at the numbers, that strategy makes sense.</p><p>According to data from Appfigures, a mobile analytics company, the most popular game on Netflix is – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048412/gta-is-netflixs-biggest-gaming-launch-so-far">coming at no surprise</a> – <em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em> with an estimated 37 million downloads. The next most popular, though it has less than half the downloads of <em>San Andreas</em>, is <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, a tie-in game for the Netflix-produced Korean social thriller <em>Squid Game</em>. Those two games aren’t going anywhere for now. But if you’re a fan of any of the games above, they will be leaving soon so try them while you can.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/692227/netflix-games-delisting-hades-braid-gaming-strategy]]></content:encoded>

I'm not entirely sure of the cultural relevancy of Chicken Run, even if it did get one of those trendy legacy sequels back in 2023, and yet here we are with the reveal of an entire video game. The name of said game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chicken-run-eggstraction">Chicken Run: Eggstraction</a>, and quite fittingly it is an action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game, one that might even look quite good? 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It certainly matches the look of the films for starters, though that's not much of a surprise given that Aardman themselves are making it, with Outright Games on publishing duties. It seems that Aardman have also made some new bits of stop-motion animation just for the game too, and it looks as good as it always does, to no one's surprise.

<p>
The game is also a sequel to that aforementioned legacy sequel, Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, with Frizzle taking the lead this time. Josie Sedgwick-Davies is back as Frizzle, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/game-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>' Bella Ramsey returning as Molly (the chick of the original film's protagonists Ginger and Rocky) too.
</p>
<p>
How about gameplay? Well, this time around you'll be setting out to rescue chickens from the nugget industry, so missions see you embarking with different characters from the movies all with their own abilities. Levels see you having to do classic stealth game things like avoiding security cameras by hiding in traffic cones, and solving puzzles and the like. You'll also have to guide the chickens you're rescuing Pikmin style throughout the levels, so it's just as much about infiltration as it is exfiltration (or eggsfiltration, I suppose). Oh, and you can play it in co-op too!
</p>
<p>
I quite like the idea of something vaguely like Pikmin meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> meets XCOM (specifically the squad forming bit), it just looks like a silly good time. A light bit of Untitled Goose Game energy about it too. No exact release date for it just yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419690/Chicken_Run_Eggstraction/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

As Dbrand itself has explained following all of the customer complaints, there’s a small lip on the inside edge of the Joy-Con case that’s meant to keep it from easily sliding out. But that lip also fills in an air gap engineered into the Switch 2 between the screen and the Joy-Con to help with the magnetic locking mechanism.</p><p>Dbrand sent me the Killswitch case at launch and I’ve been testing it along with a bunch of other accessories. When I started to wonder why I never encountered this issue before, I realized it’s because I didn’t have my Joy-Con fully in their cases so the lip was never filling that air gap. The result was that the Joy-Con never popped out while I was holding the console. Instead, the problem I encountered was that the Joy-Con cases easily popped off if I moved my hands laterally at all. </p><p>Dbrand actually brings up that exact problem <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a long Reddit</a></span> post on June 22 defending the Killswitch case for the Switch 2. It mentions the sliding issue with a “different brand’s NS2 case,” which in this case is Genki’s Attack Vector.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I’ve been testing that kit as well and have had that precise issue. So it’s a design challenge that’s not unique to Dbrand, but it’s also clear from the issues people are experiencing that it’s one Dbrand hasn’t adequately solved either yet.</p><p>After making sure my Joy-Con were firmly locked into my Killswitch case, I did some testing today and sure enough the Joy-Con kept popping out, leaving the rest of the console to plunge to its doom. Dbrand claims, in its defense, that this is only an issue for people holding their Switch 2 wrong. The company claims all three of the following criteria need to be met for the Killswitch case to fail:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>You are specifically holding onto the console from only the Joy-Cons, in such a way that your fingers are making no supportive contact with the main console, <strong>and</strong></li><li>you are holding the Switch 2 with only one hand, <strong>and</strong></li><li>your Switch 2 is held more parallel to the ground than not.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The notoriously irreverent and abrasive accessory maker then went on to blame customers for user error, stating “nobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this.” That set off a fresh firestorm in the subreddit of people showing that many have in fact held the Switch 2 like that, including YouTuber LinusTechTips and <em>Tonight Show</em> host Jimmy Fallon. Also my oldest kid, who walks into my home office flapping the Switch 2 by the Joy-Con with one hand  at least three times a week despite my constant threats to never let him play it again if he doesn’t stop.</p><p>Dbrand maintains that only a small number of the over 100,000 Killswitch cases it’s manufactured are exhibiting real problems. Its position is that while people who want to make their Switch 2 fall off while using the case can, most won’t experience that under normal usage. For those that do, Dbrand is changing the variance in size of the Joy-Con case lip to filter out overly big ones during the manufacturing process starting with July shipments. “For those that have received their order and are having issues that they believe fall within ‘regular use,’ we’re fucking sorry,” Dbrand wrote on Reddit. While the explanation makes sense, the tone and lack of accountability do not. <br></p><p>“People bought a case to protect damage for their expensive product but also expected to use it as the original console design intended, and there’s a point where [you] need to drop the act and start acting like adults, not children behind a keyboard,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljb61g/as_someone_who_is_disabled_telling_me_im_holding/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljb61g/as_someone_who_is_disabled_telling_me_im_holding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one person in response. “To see the company not only blame the consumer, but also refuse to retool their clearly defective product, and then have the gall to ask dissatisfied customers to not use the product and pay expensive return shipping rates to a completely different country in order to get a refund, erodes the trust Dbrand has gained from its community,” wrote another.</p><p>Implying that at least some of the people who bought the Killswitch case and then posted videos of the Joy-Con popping out on Reddit were disingenuous clout chasers was a bold strategy that doesn’t yet appear to be paying off. It’s easy to see the obstacles on Dbrand’s end. The Switch 2's magnetic connectors are a bespoke and precisely engineered solution to a design challenge by a different company. Designing around that is not easy task, especially if you’re racing to manufacture inventory for launch in the middle of a chaotic trade war without early access to the actual hardware in question. </p><p>But after testing the Killswitch off and on for a couple of weeks, I’m not convinced that it’s any more deserving of special considerations than other accessories, especially cheaper ones on offer from any number of generic copycat shops. The Killswitch doesn’t feel so good or so premium that it’s worth overlooking a key vulnerability. The rail locks for the Joy-Con on my older Switch OLED were treated so roughly over the years that one of the tiny screws fell out without me even noticing and it jiggles now. So for now I’d hold off on the Killswitch until the air-gap problem is fixed across the board. </p><p>What I can recommend is Dbrand’s screen protector. It’s hands-down the best on the market thanks to a specialty case that makes applying it perfectly with no bubbles or botched angles completely dummy proof. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-dbrand-killswitch-case-joy-con-magnets-instock-1851785019]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">Final Fantasy Universes Beyond crossover</a> is already proving to be a massive hit. After breaking preorder records, the set is now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">flying off shelves and selling out everywhere</a>, with collectors and Commander fans alike scrambling to pick up iconic characters in card form. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're opening boosters, sorting through prerelease pulls, or keeping tabs on the market for trade value, it's clear this set is drawing serious attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're curious which cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-best-cards-to-chase-and-buy-today">in highest demand right now</a>, either to cash in or just to see what the hype is all about, we've broken down the top 12 best-selling Final Fantasy cards based on data from trusted marketplace TCGPlayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve simplified the list for clarity, grouping some variants, like Borderless and Surge Foils, with their base versions, while also noting the specific card number that’s proving most popular (i.e, Aerith Gainsborough - 519). Not every slot is a Mythic Rare either. This list includes a bit of variety to reflect what’s actually trending, while still focusing on the standout cards from the set. Let’s dive in.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. Aerith Gainsborough - 519</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEggxX?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aerith Gainsborough</a> is a deceptively powerful engine for life gain and +1/+1 counter strategies. With lifelink built in, she can start growing immediately,every time you gain life, Aerith picks up a +1/+1 counter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And when she dies, she passes that strength on, putting <em>X</em> +1/+1 counters on each legendary creature you control, where <em>X</em> is the number of counters she had. In the right deck, that can be a game-ending swing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The card’s popularity is reflected in its pricing. The standard print is just $1.83, while the foil version goes for $16.81. For collectors or premium deckbuilders, the borderless version is around $39, but the rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEggxX?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>borderless surge foil</strong> sits at a much steeper $140+</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Starting Town - 289</h2><div id="223183" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Starting Town - 289</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting Town is an early-game powerhouse, especially in multicolor decks. If you can play it on turn one, two, or three, it enters untapped, giving you immediate access to mana without slowing your tempo. Beyond that, it taps for colorless, or you can pay 1 life to generate one mana of any color, making it a flexible piece in almost any deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That versatility comes at a price. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXW4VZ?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">regular version is currently going for around $14</a>, while the foil will set you back just under $17. Still, for decks that care about fast, reliable mana across multiple colors, it's proving to be well worth the cost.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Summon: Knights of Round - 359</h2><div id="223175" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Summon: Knights of Round - 359 (Borderless)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg8gV?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summon: Knights of the Round</a> is one of the hottest cards from the Final Fantasy crossover right now, and it’s not hard to see why. For just five mana, you create three 2/2 white Knight creature tokens, instantly building a board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it gets even better with its [V] ability, Ultimate End, which gives all your other creatures +2/+2 until end of turn and puts an indestructible counter on each of them. Combined with the card’s own indestructible keyword, it turns even a modest board into a nearly unstoppable force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg8gV?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless version is currently going for $35.99</a>, which marks a 25% drop in market price this month. The standard print is more budget-friendly at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeb8K1?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$21.88</a>. Either way, it’s a powerful pickup for Knight, token, or white-based Commander decks, and one that’s likely to remain popular.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Traveling Chocobo - 210</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The chase card of all chase cards, there are just 77 gold foil Traveling Chocobos out there, available. There are other versions, including <a href="https://zdcs.link/z622ER?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neon Ink versions going for well over $1000</a>, but if you manage to find the gold foil, it is <em><strong>the one</strong></em> you’ll want to find when you’re cracking open <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q477Xd?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Collector Boosters</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering how much the ink versions are <em>already</em> going for, I can't imagine how much the Gold Foil variant would actually be valued at, maybe you just win at money and never have to pay for Magic cards again, now that would be nice. But, that being said, one did recently sell for <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/golden-chocobo-40k-sale" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around $30K on eBay</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Summon: Bahamut - 1</h2><div id="223174" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Summon: Bahamut - 356 (Borderless)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I love a big ol’ dragon in my Magic collection, and Bahamut certainly fits that bill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only does this Summon create a 9/9, but it can remove permanents, trigger card draw, and use Mega Flare to essentially finish a game of Commander. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All yours for around $93 in the borderless variant, or <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJg8rq?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">around $30 for the standard print</a> right now at TCGPlayer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Lightning, Army of One - 545</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">How many card variants do you NEED? Apparently, Final Fantasy 13’s protagonist, <a href="https://zdcs.link/av48Ab?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightning</a>, needs at least five. To be fair, that makes sense considering how many spin off games she got. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Army of One is all about the Stagger mechanic, teeing your foes up for double damage while also offering lifelink, first strike, and trample in a three-cost card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Market price is already up to around $256.50 for the most popular <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xx6W?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Borderless Surge Foil</a> version, while my personal favorite is seemingly the cheapest (but still just as popular), <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7B4g?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">normal print for $20.58</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Yuna, Hope of Spira - 549</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yuna's an interesting one, as it's just her <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OOo8?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">549 Borderless Surge Foil</a> that have drawn the <em>most </em>interest from eager buyers in the secondary market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet, her <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVX5wN?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">standard variant</a> is also going through much more of geniune surge in value over the past couple of weeks, rising +143.65% in value, jumping from a low of $5.68 to around $20.15 most recently. It's a big jump in such a short space of time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Tifa Lockhart - 536</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg8ob?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tifa Lockhart</a> continues to be a main stay of the best selling Final Fantasy cards, and even featured as one of the most popular during the presale period just before the Universes Beyond set launched. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tifa has a Landfall trigger that doubles her power alongside her existing Trample keyword. As TCGPlayer points out, you can grow her attack power with something like Titanic Growth and then use Fabled Passage to double it again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She’ll set you back between <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4755k?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$9.10 for the standard version</a>, and all the way up to <a href="https://zdcs.link/91j30q?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$187.60 for the Borderless Surge Foil</a> variant. Otherwise, and quite surprisingly, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObjjO?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">non-foil Borderless version</a> is pretty good value for money at around $25.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Buster Sword - 255</h2><div id="223171" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buster Sword - 351 (Borderless)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s Cloud without the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1A1P?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buster Sword</a>? Thankfully, this iconic weapon gets the treatment it deserves in Magic’s Final Fantasy set, with a stunning borderless version illustrated by Karuta Shiki. It’s more than just a collector’s piece too, it’s a powerful piece of equipment in its own right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buster Sword gives the equipped creature +3/+2, making it a serious threat in combat. But the real payoff comes when that creature connects with a player. Not only do you draw a card, but you can immediately cast a spell from your hand with mana value equal to or less than the damage dealt, without paying its cost. </p><div id="223177" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buster Sword - 255</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, a card this flashy doesn’t come cheap. While current listings on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwJw6?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer hover around $66</a> for the standard issue, it has already sold for as much as <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1A1P?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$208.30 this month for its fantastic borderless version</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a fan of Cloud or just love flashy, high-impact equipment, this is one to watch, and anything under triple digits is looking like a bargain right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Vivi Ornitier - 248</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 9 spellcaster <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXW44O?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi Ornitier</a>, by Toshiyuki Itahana (character designer on the game), might just be one of the best cards in the game right now. So, it's hardly surprising that it's standard card is up there as the third most popular in the set currently. Market price isn't too bad either (at least compared to the rest of this list), if you're looking to buy one standalone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Borderless version is also the absolute definition of a collector’s item if I've ever seen one, and proving to have plenty of interest as well. Both of these can also be considered a top 10 card for collectors, also demanding a rather mighty price at around <a href="https://zdcs.link/av484E?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$72.13 for the former</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ3J2?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$232.71 for the later</a> in the market right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Cloud, Midgar Mercenary - 520</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ342?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</a> is, unsurprisingly, by far one of the most popular cards from the Final Fantasy x MTG Universes Beyond set. Low mana cost and double equipment triggers make Cloud very close to Stoneforge Mystic, but with some striking new anime art from Kazto Furuya.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ342?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Borderless Surge Foil</a> variant one of the priciest cards from the new set (sitting at around $466 market), the Borderless, Extended Art, and Normal print all also fetch a pretty penny right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of popularity, the Borderless Surge Foil is shoulders above the rest, but the Normal print is also exceedingly popular right now according to TCGPlayer, and still one of the top 20 cards players have been chasing since the new set released. Finding any of these, or deciding to buy them out right standalone, are good reasons to get excited. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Sephiroth, Fabled Soldier - 527</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAg8bw?object_uuid=0621f3de-3084-4c97-85b0-358229155561&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sephiroth, Fabled Soldier - 0527 (Borderless) (Surge Foil)</a> is the most popular card in the game right now, and has surged to a market price of $701.55 this week, up +74.09% just this month. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's not the only version that's proving popular either, with the 382 and 317 Borderless, alongside the 115 Normal print also proving to increasingly sought after right now, which is unsurprisingly reflected in the market prices right now as well. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy Cards</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/19/where-to-buy-mtg-final-fantasy-ign-new-update-1750332391774.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm going to give it to you straight right from the off.

                <p>One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>'s main endgame activities, Nightmare dungeons, will be permanently changed come Season 9, as Blizzard looks to make them both more challenging and surprising going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in a new <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215863/purge-the-sins-of-the-horadrim" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, when Season 9 launches July 1, Nightmare dungeons will receive some major updates. Most notably, there will be a new activity within them called Horadric Strongrooms. Described as a "potent micro-dungeon," strongrooms will be found more frequently on higher Torment difficulties and can also be reliably found by using a Nightmare dungeon sigil that guarantees the appearance of a strongroom.</p><p dir="ltr">Once players are inside the dungeon, players can discover a portal that will take them to the strongroom. In a system somewhat similar to Diablo 4's Infernal Hordes activity, players will be able to select from a number of statues that add modifiers to the strongroom, increasing the challenge but also the rewards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W5UkhQVtMQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6W5UkhQVtMQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Players will then need to attune themselves with the strongroom by slaying enemies within the vicinity of Horadric Pillars within a time limit. Those who complete the attunement process will be transported to the micro-dungeon's final boss that when defeated will reward a Grand Horadric cache that scales its rewards based on the amount of attunement players earned. These caches will include Obducite as a reward, an endgame material needed to Masterwork weapons and armor. Completing the strongroom will also grant a buff that lasts for the remainder of the Nightmare dungeon, which a chance to receive more XP from monsters, increased reputation gains, increased Obducite drops, 25% more gold, or Horadric Phial drops (a seasonal item that is used to make Horadric Jewels).</p><p dir="ltr">There will, however, be another new way to experience Nightmare dungeons--Escalating Nightmares. This new endgame activity is a sequence of three Nightmare dungeons that see dungeon affixes stack from one to the next, with monster difficulty additionally increasing for each subsequent dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">To access an Escalating Nightmare, players will need to find Escalation Sigils from completing Horadric Strongrooms. In pre-Torment difficulties, completing all three dungeons will finish the Escalating Nightmare. However, those playing on Torment difficulties will instead be transported to a boss fight, where players will take on a new version of Astaroth from the Diablo 4 main campaign. Players will need to defeat both Astaroth and his steed, which will become separate bosses over the course of the fight. Defeating Astaroth's mount first will see it go into a resurrection state, after which it will rejoin the fight if players can't defeat Astaroth in time. Astaroth can also be modified by Nightmare dungeon affixes, making the boss fight even more challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520164" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520164"></a><figcaption>A look at everything coming as part of Diablo 4 Season 9.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, Nightmare dungeons will receive new affixes. Each Nightmare sigil will sport both a positive and negative affix. New positive affixes include the guaranteed appearance of specific shrines, increased XP gains, the appearance of Treasure Goblins, a guaranteed strongroom, equipment rewards, and currency drops.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Nightmare dungeon changes will be permanent additions to Diablo 4, Season 9 will additionally introduce new seasonal mechanics for a limited-time. Players will be able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">create and modify Horadric Spells</a> to compliment their builds, and can further augment them using new Horadric Jewels that can be slotted into amulets and rings.

                <p>A decade after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light/" data-ref-id="5000-182057">Dying Light</a> came out in 2015, developer Techland is revisiting the zombie game with a major new update to refresh the game's visuals and other elements--just don't call it a remaster.</p><p><a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The "Retouched" update</a>, as it's called, launches on June 26. This update is focused on "squeezing out even more" from Dying Light, the studio said. "It's not a complete overhaul or remaster," the developer clarified, adding that the team has found new ways to "squeeze more from the tech we already have."</p><p>"One day, someone just started applying those learnings to some old assets--and it just clicked that we could do that across the whole game," technical game director Grzegorz Świstowski said.</p><p>In the Retouched update, players can expect increased texture quality and upscaling for textures to help them look "sharper" and better overall.</p><p>Additionally, the "maximum level of detail range" in Dying Light has been increased from 260% to 340% in the view distance menu from the game's settings. The studio is also adding new "8K Ultra shadow quality" and improved lighting for many surfaces. Surfaces that might have previously looked "flat" should not "really pop out and get depth."</p><p>Check out some of the images in the gallery below to see the improvements.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520148" data-ratio="0.55555555555556" data-width="738" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520148"></a><figcaption>The wood now looks more like wood.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520149,1300-4520150" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png"></figure><p>Beyond visuals, Techland said composer Paweł Blaszczak came back to "give the soundtrack a complete remaster" with a unique twist.</p><p>"He even recreated that retro-tape sound by actually recording on tape! Talk about dedication. It’s authentic, nostalgic, and absolutely fantastic," Techland said, adding that the Retouched update will have new tracks and ambient sounds. Audio in combat has been "juiced up," too.</p><p>"Every swing, every crunch, every zombie takedown will sound more satisfying, more impactful. You'll feel those hits," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abQYwONaKgk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/abQYwONaKgk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This Retouched update was first hinted at in January, and Techland said it took so long to realize because of the manual effort required.</p><p>"I basically walked through the entire map, looking for assets to be improved. And all of those had to be changed manually by our artists," lead 3D artist Krzysztof Knefel said.</p><p>The Retouched update doesn't require players to invest in new PC hardware, however, as Techland said it was important to keep the system requirements the same. The Retouched update is also available on PS4 and Xbox One, requiring Techland to test the game "endlessly" to ensure "we didn't run out of memory" for those older consoles.</p><p>The Retouched patch launches June 26 and it's free for everyone across PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. While the Retouched update promises improvements on all systems, Techland said, "the level of changes may vary by platform," but it didn't dig into specifics.</p><p>June 26 is also the date that CD Projekt Red planned to release Cyberpunk 2077's big new 2.3 update, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-big-new-update-delayed/1100-6532620/" data-ref-id="1100-6532620">it's been delayed</a>. Techland and CD Projekt are two of Poland's biggest developers, and fans of their games no longer have to decide what to play first on June 26.</p><p>Dying Light was followed up by 2022's Dying Light 2. The next entry in the series is Dying Light: The Beast, which launches in August for console and PC.</p>
