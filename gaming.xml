<p>PC gaming has become increasingly popular over the years. With the ability to upgrade your equipment at any time, many gamers have begun to prefer gaming with a PC. </p>



<p>But to build a good PC, you need to have a decent graphics card, and in 2024, many cards are incredibly expensive. So, which graphics cards are the best for PC gaming in 2024?</p>



<p><strong>Here is a list of the best cheap graphics cards:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super ($240.00 USD)</li>



<li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 ($289.00 USD)</li>



<li>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 ($194.00 USD)</li>



<li>AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT ($199.99 USD)</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="h-the-best-low-budget-graphics-card-in-2024">The Best Low-Budget Graphics Card In 2024</h2>



<p>Only one card from our list of the best cheap graphics cards can stand out as the best low-budget card for gamers to buy. That card is the <strong>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060</strong>. This card is a huge upgrade from the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070, which can handle pretty much any video game. </p>

			<p>Starfield: Shattered Space, the first expansion for the single player sci-fi RPG released last year by Bethesda Game Studios, is now just about a month away from <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching</a>.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, the developer opened up slightly on what will be featured in the premium DLC. In an <a href="https://gamingboulevard.com/2024/08/interview-starfield-shattered-space-with-tim-lamb-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Gaming Boulevard, Lead Creative Producer Tim Lamb said:</p>
<p><em>We've added a few new mechanics that we're really excited about. For example, there are new zero-gravity combat scenarios that really change the dynamics of how you approach fights. It adds a layer of strategy that wasn't there before. We've also introduced new ship customization options, which allow players to really tailor their vessels to their play style. And on the exploration front, there are new tools and gadgets that will help players interact with the environment in deeper, more meaningful ways.</em></p>
<p><em>The new sector we've created is pretty substantial. It's not as large as the entire galaxy, obviously, but it's densely packed with content. We focused on making sure that every corner of this new area feels alive and has something for players to discover. Whether it's hidden side quests, unique encounters, or just the sheer beauty of the landscapes, there's a lot to keep players engaged. It's less about sheer size and more about the depth of the experience.</em></p>
<p>Lamb also said that the expansion content is integrated seamlessly into the game, so the content will seem like a natural fit for players in the middle of a playthrough. Artistically, Starfield: Shattered Space will offer vibrant colors and more diverse landscapes, and the story will feature several twists and turns that should surprise players.</p>
<p>Starfield: Shattered Space is out on September 30 for PC and Xbox Series S|X. However, with Microsoft porting more Bethesda games to PS5 (such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming</a> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle), it may be only a matter of time before PlayStation players get to fly the stars as well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-state-of-play-is-likely-coming-in-late-september-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.963837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb has claimed that a PlayStation State of Play will likely be released by the end of September.</p>



<p>The rumor came during today’s Game Mess Mornings, when after speaking on the PlayStation 5 Pro, Grubb said, “There is probably going to be a PlayStation State of Play by the end of September.” Unfortunately, Grubb didn’t dive into what could be announced during the event. Still, both he and his co-host guest theorized that it could be something akin to a PS5 Pro announcement followed by a miniature games showcase on the new console.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro was reportedly heavily talked about at Gamescom this year, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wccftech</a> and the Italian website <a href="https://multiplayer.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Multiplayer</a>&nbsp;both hearing from developers that the console is on its way. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen when the PlayStation 5 Pro will be announced. Unfortunately, such information is hard to pin down due to how PlayStation segregates its departments from one another in an effort to stop leaks. However, logically, it makes sense to announce the console ahead of the Tokyo Game Show, which starts on September 26, 2024. </p>



<p>According to our developer and manufacturer sources, the PlayStation 5 Pro is still on track to release around mid-November. </p>



<p>Will you be buying the PlaySation 5 Pro on release? And are you looking forward to another PlayStation State of Play? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

That direction helped establish the visual language of the game, but developer Massive Entertainment wanted to take things a step further by making Star Wars Outlaws look like it had been shot with the same film lenses as the classic movies.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzR8Rg-4840" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lzR8Rg-4840" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To achieve this technical feat, the studio developed its own digital "camera lens" in the Snowdrop Engine, which was used to give Star Wars Outlaws a more cinematic presentation. While this is an optional mode, players can enable a widescreen presentation in the game that adds black bars to the bottom of the screen, a period-accurate film grain, and other small cinematic touches.</p><p>"We developed a lens, a camera lens within Snowdrop, our game engine, that allows us to replicate the sort of, lenses of the '70s and 80s," creative director Julian Gerighty explained in a new GameSpot Insider documentary. "So you have barrel distortion, chromatic aberration, film grain, and vignetting all wrapped up in an ultra-widescreen presentation. All of these things you can turn on and off individually, but the whole impact is that it really pulls you into a cinematic presentation."</p><p>According to technical art director Stephen Hawes, the lens project was challenging but worth pursuing as it harkened back to how the original films were shot and helped create a cinematic experience for Star Wars Outlaws. Massive Entertainment was able to render technical effects like lens breathing and film grain that ran at 24fps independent of the game's chosen frame rate, and other small touches like CRT screens, a slight barrel distortion, and a soft focus helped create a "grounded, cinematic" atmosphere, Hawes explained.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-preorder-guide/1100-6522523/" data-ref-id="1100-6522523">but if you're looking to play a few days early</a>, you'll be able to do so if you have a Ubisoft Premium+ subscription. <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-outlaws/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On GameSpot's sister site Metacritic</a>, Star Wars Outlaws currently has a "generally favorable" metascore of 77 from 59 reviews.</p>

            <p>
A new Nintendo Direct broadcast will air tomorrow, Tuesday 27th August, at 3pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
For those across the pond, that's 7am Pacific, or 10am Eastern.
</p>
<p>
Lasting roughly 40 minutes, the show will feature upcoming games and announcements for Nintendo Switch, from both major third-party developers as well as indie studios. Just don't expect any news on Nintendo's own games - such as the upcoming Zelda: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> - or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow's broadcast is a combined Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, which focuses on big games from non-Nintendo developers, and an Indie World Showcase, which spotlights projects from smaller creative teams. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">post</a> on X this afternoon, Nintendo also gave it's now-familiar statement that it would not be revealing any new information on Switch 2 tomorrow. (The company is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">detail its upcoming new hardware at some point before March 31st 2025</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">launch it later next year</a>.)

			<p>Despite the system having yet to be announced, the PlayStation 5 Pro is apparently still coming this year, according to a report from a reliable insider.</p>
<p>During the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8TqCntkFPg&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Mess Mornings</a>, Jeff Grubb discussed Sony's yet-to-be-revealed system, saying that, last he heard, the console is still coming out this year. In addition, the insider heard that there will probably be a State of Play presentation by the end of September. The insider doesn't know if the PlayStation 5 Pro will be at the State of Play, but there's a good chance it will be.</p>
<p><iframe title="Game Mess Mornings 08/26/24" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o8TqCntkFPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At this point, the PlayStation 5 Pro has become an open secret, and almost everyone in the video games industry seems to know about it. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/">During this year's Gamescom</a>, Alessio was told by a developer that they have been informed about the system specifications and are sure Unreal Engine 5 games will run better on the system. Given that it wasn't a big developer, it definitely seems like Sony shared the system specifications with a wide range of developers to gear up for the system's announcement and release.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

Vyse joins the roster as part of <em>Valorant </em>Episode 9, Act 2, which releases on August 28 at 9:00 a.m. EST. That means you only have a couple of days before you’ll be able to test out the latest agent for yourself. </p><h2 id="h12651"><a id=""></a><strong>What is Vyse’s backstory?</strong></h2><p>As part of her reveal, Riot dropped a cinematic titled “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btpWg1gDXIE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btpWg1gDXIE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All Paths End Here</a></span>” that gives us some insight into who exactly Vyse is. In the short video we see a team of current agents led by Jett embark on a mission in South Korea to take down a mysterious new combatant. That combatant is, of course, Vyse, who manages to hold her own against the strike team thanks to a series of abilities like laying traps and summoning metal thorns out of nowhere. Before the battle gets out of hand, Omen suggests they talk, hinting that Vyse will join the <em>Valorant </em>protocol. </p><p>The cinematic doesn’t reveal too much about the mysterious masked agent. We do hear her talk and she sounds American, so maybe she has some history with Viper, but only time will tell. The cinematic does make the new agent out to be a cold and calculating force of nature, one that <em>Valorant </em>is lucky to have on its side.</p><h2 id="h12652"><a id=""></a><strong>What are Vyse’s abilities?</strong></h2><p>Vyse takes on the sentinel role in <em>Valorant</em>. Agents in the sentinel role typically have a toolset that focuses on defensive play and supporting the rest of the team. Vyse will become the sixth sentinel in <em>Valorant</em>, joining Killjoy, Cypher, Sage, Chamber, and Deadlock. Vyse’s skills center around manipulating metal, sort of like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-unlock-magneto-1851585011&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-unlock-magneto-1851585011">Magneto</a></span> from the <em>X-Men</em>. Here is the full list of Vyse’s abilities.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Arc Rose</strong>: Equip an Arc Rose. Target a surface and fire to place a stealthed Arc Rose, or alt fire to place the Arc Rose through it. reuse to blind all players looking at it. This ability can be picked up to be redeployed.</li><li><strong>Shear</strong>: Equip filaments of liquid metal. Fire to place a hidden wall trap. When an enemy crosses, an indestructible wall bursts from the ground behind them. The wall lasts for a brief time before dissipating.</li><li><strong>Razorvine</strong>: Equip a nest of liquid metal. Fire to launch. Upon landing, the nest becomes invisible. When activated, it sprawls out into a large razorvine nest which slows and damages all players who move through it.</li><li><strong>Steel Garden</strong> (ULT): Equip a bramble of liquid metal. Fire to send the metal erupting from you as a torrent of metal thorns, jamming enemy primary weapons after a brief windup.</li></ul><p>Vyse’s toolset positions her as a great agent for zone control and laying traps for opponents seeking to flank you and your team. With abilities that blind enemies or activity on command it really seems like Vyse will thrive on letting your opponents walk into traps that turn them into fish in a barrel for your teammates.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a new video in GameSpot's Insider series, the developers at Massive Entertainment revealed just how they managed to strike that balance between authenticity and originality for their open-world adventure game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzR8Rg-4840" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lzR8Rg-4840" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Thanks to all the reference material provided to the developer--like concept art and sketches--the studio felt inspired to create a world for Kay Vess to inhabit that's inspired by the original films and the time period they took place in. Massive Entertainment aimed to use those assets to create worlds, cities, and vehicles that could feasibly exist in the original trilogy of Star Wars films, like Kay Vess' ship, the Trailblazer.</p><p>Inspired by the technology, vehicles, and even the kitchen utensils of the '60s and '70s, Massive Entertainment followed the same artistic path as the artists who worked on the Star Wars films to create an authentic layer of detail for Star Wars Outlaws. "For us it was really important to bring new things, but in the same methodology," associate art director Marthe Jonkers explained about the studio's artistic approach to the design of Star Wars Outlaws.</p><p>Massive Entertainment knew it was headed in the right direction when it had discussions with LucasFilm and the company struggled to tell if the developer had created an original asset for the game or replicated one from the Star Wars movies. "We definitely had situations where people weren't sure if this was something we had created or if it's something that we took from existing stuff," associate narrative director John Bjorling said. "And I think that's like the highest grade of accomplishment that you could probably have. It's so authentic that we don't even know."</p><p>The end result is a Star Wars game that looks like it could fit very easily in the classic Star Wars universe, thanks to Massive Entertainment's eye for detail and authenticity. The various locations visited by Kay Vess and Nix feel lived in, the technology looks like it was pulled from a funkier decade of sci-fi design, and even the NPCs sport fashion that looks like it was based on the wardrobe of extras in the old movies.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws releases on August 30 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but if you're a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fubisoft.pxf.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F864200%2F12050%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhow-star-wars-outlaws-looked-to-the-past-to-create-an-authentic-galaxy-far-far-away%2F1100-6526112%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft+ Premium subscriber</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-preorder-guide/1100-6522523/" data-ref-id="1100-6522523">you can start playing three days early</a> while getting all of the bonus content from the Ultimate Edition of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gdq-flame-fatales-118k-malala<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GDQ's women-focused Flame Fatales event has concluded, and it's raised a pretty impressive amount of money for a charity that benefits women and girls around the world.</p>
<p>Flame Fatales ran between August 18th and yesterday, concluding with over $118,000 raised for the <a href="https://malala.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Malala Fund charity</a>. As you've probably guessed, the charity was founded by Malala Yousafzai and advocates for girls' education globally.</p>
<p>As a press release points out, Flame Fatales saw speedrunning attempts being made across a number of games this year, including classics like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario 64 DS&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>, as well as newer games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/bayonetta-3"><em>Bayonetta 3</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bayonetta-3-gdq-flame-fatales.jpg?itok=tdZHRCrG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bayonetta-3-gdq-flame-fatales.jpg?itok=CDphiYBi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Flame Fatales saw speedrunning efforts being made in games like&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, it was during a&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3&nbsp;</em>speedrun that Flame Fatales reached a new lifetime milestone of $1 million donations. That's a heck of a lot of money given to charity over the years.</p>
<p>Other speedruns during Flame Fatales this year included Jerikandra's "intense"&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger&nbsp;</em>Vortex Save Any% final boss attempt, as well as SnowballSMB achieving a new world record in New Game+ for&nbsp;<em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em>.</p>
<p>If you're still jonesing for your speedrunning fix, then you'll be pleased to know that AGDQ (that's Awesome Games Done Quick) is just around the corner; next year's AGDQ event runs between January 5th and 12th.</p>
<p>Games Done Quick has generally been a force to be reckoned with when it comes to raising money for charity; this year's Summer Games Done Quick event <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2024">racked up $2.5 million</a> for Doctors Without Borders, and last year's AGDQ <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-raises-26-million-for-prevent-cancer-foundation">raised $2.6 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chrono-trigger-flame-fatales-2024.jpg?itok=lXDx2LIZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chrono-trigger-flame-fatales-2024.jpg?itok=yvM_ZKBI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This year's Flame Fatales played host to a rather tense&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger&nbsp;</em>speedrun.</figcaption></figure><p>At a time when women, non-binary folks, and those presenting female are struggling to make their voices heard in the gaming industry, it's great to see Flame Fatales raising some serious cash for the Malala Fund.</p>
<p>The jury's out on how much progress the industry is making when it comes to women in gaming, especially when the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-37m-user-milestone-wukong">phenomenally popular&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-37m-user-milestone-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>&nbsp;</em>can tell players streaming the game <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/black-myth-wukong-streamers-feminist-propaganda" rel="noopener" target="_blank">not to include "feminist propaganda"</a> in their streams, whatever that means.</p>
<p>At any rate, stay tuned for more on this, as well as all other things GDQ-related. Here's hoping for a real stunner for January's AGDQ.</p>

Yesterday, August 25, was <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em>’s 15th anniversary. That’s right. What is arguably the most well-regarded game starring Bruce Wayne ever made is old enough for a learner’s permit. The <em>Arkham </em>series has seen better days, as the most recent entry in Rocksteady’s DC universe, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a></span>, is rightfully divisive. But looking back at where it all began, <em>Arkham Asylum </em>was a truly remarkable experience that set a new bar for what we expect out of a superhero game. If you’ve never played it, the original game and its sequels are bundled on sale on both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/batman-return-to-arkham/brw49cbs558d/0001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/batman-return-to-arkham/brw49cbs558d/0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1018-CUSA00133_00-ARKHAMBUNDLE0000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1018-CUSA00133_00-ARKHAMBUNDLE0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation</a></span> for less than $10.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,195719,196191" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Arkham Asylum </em>opens with a grimy intro sequence during a rainy Gotham City night, and that vibe doesn’t let up. The caped crusader is delivering his archnemesis, the Joker, to the titular facility. As he and the guards bring in the clown, Batman sees a few of the people he’s put away over the years, such as Killer Croc, and they’re not thrilled to see the hero. It quickly becomes clear that a whole pantheon of <em>Batman </em>villains is being kept here. It’s not surprising that the Joker springs a trap and takes over the facility, and you’re quickly hit with the realization that Bruce, in addition to tackling a number of colorful characters in his rogue’s gallery, is also going to have to face a few of his demons in Arkham before he can go home to Alfred.</p><p>The rest of the <em>Arkham</em> games were good in their own right, but none of them quite captured the same feeling of entrapment and dread you feel in <em>Asylum</em>. This was before the series made a pivot to open-world, so its Metroidvania structure feels more focused, with Bruce gaining new tools that let him explore new areas of the asylum and face new foes. There was a real sense of discovery and progression to <em>Asylum </em>that you lose in the larger scale of the later games. One of his most memorable tools is explosive gel, which he uses to blow up weak walls and access new areas and which, despite his grim, Kevin Conroy-voiced seriousness, he sprays in the shape of a bat, suggesting a bit of playful whimsy lurks under the cowl. Flying around Gotham is one way to feel like Batman, but having to make the most of a situation with tools and tech is the heart of who Bruce Wayne is.</p><p>But the utility belt is only one part of being Batman. The world’s greatest detective also gets to investigate crime scenes with the Detective Vision mechanic. The tools Rocksteady gave you to track down evidence and recreate visualizations of crimes captured this part of Batman’s character better than probably any other video game adaptation at the time. It’s something that games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> are still emulating to this day, and it was a welcome bit of thoughtful character-building and attentiveness to environmental detail between traversing the asylum and beating up baddies.</p><p>And god, the <em>Arkham </em>games have such a snappy, fluid combat system, one that makes you feel both acrobatic and powerful, a force to be reckoned with. The hand-to-hand combat is so slick people joke it’s a rhythm game, allowing you to bounce between goons with a fluidity that practically had Bruce dancing on the battlefield. But it wouldn’t be Batman if he just came in fists swinging as a rule. <em>Arkham Asylum</em>’s stealth mechanics were pretty forgiving, but let you perch above unsuspecting baddies and pick them off one by one. <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-batman-arkham-museum-scene-hunting-1851216708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-batman-arkham-museum-scene-hunting-1851216708">has a whole level that’s an homage</a></span> to the terrifying feeling bad guys must have felt knowing Batman was waiting to descend upon them like prey.</p><p>And then there are the boss battles, each spotlighting an iconic Batman villain with a sequence that is unlike anything else you play in the game. Scarecrow’s hallucinogenics put you through a nightmare that only a utility belt can wake you up from. Poison Ivy uses her thorny plant friends to trap Batman in her tangled vines. The Joker fight is notoriously derided for feeling silly and anticlimactic, but overall, the boss fights are some of the most memorable and rewarding parts of making your way through <em>Arkham Asylum</em>.</p><p>The future of the <em>Arkham </em>series feels uncertain these days, as <em>Suicide Squad </em>has failed to meet Warner Bros. expectations. Does Rocksteady get to go back to basics with its next game? I’d hope so, but I also wouldn’t be mad if the studio got to make something new. <em>Arkham Asylum</em> still stands out as one of the most well-designed superhero games of the era, and in pursuit of an open world, it feels like we lost some of the clever restrictions Batman had in that first outing. I’d love to see that team get a chance to work within those constraints again, even if it’s not returning to the caped crusader.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There is also an embed for the presentation below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh7o96_yIWw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bh7o96_yIWw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">What to expect</p><p dir="ltr">For starters, Nintendo has made it perfectly clear there will be nothing about Switch 2. The company even shared a follow-up post <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1828070150127456613" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> to confirm this point and keep people's expectations in check.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1828070150127456613" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Please note, there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during either of these presentations.</p>  — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1828070150127456613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">With that out of the way, the Indie Showcase portion will of course have people hoping for an update on Hollow Knight: Silksong. At one point, Silksong was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed/1100-6513963/" data-ref-id="1100-6513963">planned to launch in the first half of 2023 before Team Cherry delayed the game</a>. Earlier this month, Geoff Keighley revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-not-be-shown-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/1100-6525900/" data-ref-id="1100-6525900">Silksong wouldn't be shown at Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the Partner Showcase portion of the presentation, there are a handful of games releasing on Switch before the end of the year that would make sense to appear. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-mickey-rebrushed-paints-the-town-red-blue-and-every-other-color-in-new-trailer/1100-6525493/" data-ref-id="1100-6525493">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a> might get spotlighted, since it's a remake of a Wii exclusive and comes out September 23. It also wouldn't be surprising for Level 5 to make its presence known with upcoming titles like Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam-gets-2025-release-window-and-new-trailer/1100-6519543/" data-ref-id="1100-6519543">Professor Layton and the New World of Steam, which is arriving in 2025</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Direct will have an overall runtime of around 40 minutes.</p>

			<p>The release of Terry Bogard in Street Fighter 6 next month is going to be an important event not only for the game but for the franchise as well since the character who starred in the Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters franchises will be the first guest character to appear in any entry in the series by CAPCOM. As such, it was not surprising to learn last week that he is likely going to make a big splash, having the potential of being among the best characters in the game.</p>
<p>During Gamescom, I had the chance to try out Terry before release, using him in a few matches against CPU-controlled opponents and fighting against him using other characters (mainly my mains Blanka and M.Bison). While the testing environment wasn't the best, as I really felt the input delay on the PlayStation 5 version as opposed to the PC version I have played since the game was released, and the available time wasn't long (around 30 minutes), I feel Terry won't take long to shoot high on the tier list of most players due to a few reasons.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Street-Fighter-6-Terry-Gamescom-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even without being able to explore the nuances of the character due to the lack of training mode and its ever-useful frame data meter, it's clear how Terry is a very strong character. He has every tool that a Street Fighter 6 character needs to be top tier: cancelable crouching medium kick, overhead, invincible OD reversal, some long-reaching normals, including some that make the character advance forward, and explosive damage, although not on par with that of M.Bison, the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-year-2-dlc-characters-include-some-unexpected-guests/">Season 2 character</a>. Like a few other characters already in the game, some of Terry's special moves change depending on the strength of the button, which makes the character a little more complex than others but potentially more deadly. One of these special moves, Crack Shoot, reminiscent of G's wheel kick special move, felt plus on block, something that could grant the character the oppressive pressure most of the game's top tiers can dish out without spending meter. Even some of his supers are pretty unique, as his Level 2, Power Geyser, has multiple follow ups, including one that uses Drive to increase its power.</p>
<p>What truly stood out, besides his potential, is how great of a recreation of the original character Terry in Street Fighter 6 is. One of his target combos, Passing Sway, allows him to jump into the background ala Fatal Fury and then return to the front with two different attacks. I couldn't test how much mix-up potential this has, but I'm sure it will be a pretty disorienting technique in the first few days of the character's availability.</p>
<p>Without more time with the character, it is difficult to say if Terry will be able to hold his own against the likes of Ken, Cammy, and Akuma, but there's no doubt that the potential is definitely there. While he's definitely another shoto type of character, his unique fighting style and mechanics will make his addition to Street Fighter 6 a worthy one on September 24th. The Pao Pao Cafè stage will also be released on the same day.</p>

			<p><a href="https://newzoo.com/games-market-reports-forecasts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newzoo</a> has released its latest report on the games industry, this time focusing on PC and console MAU (Monthly Active Users) and Revenue Rankings. Some results come as a bit of a surprise, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-july-are-up-in-europe-despite-no-major-releases/">multiplayer games</a> outperforming most single-player games across the board. One of the most prominent games to be released this year was EA Sports College Football 25.</p>
<p>While sports games tend to get overlooked in the mix of other releases, EA Sports College Football 25 immediately jumped to #1. Specifically, it was #1 on both PlayStation and Xbox when the game was released in July and became the best-selling sports game in July.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, realistic sports games were the ones that dominated some of the top slots in gaming revenue across the board, regardless of platform. We've already established that EA Sports Football 25 jumped to #1, but EA Sports FC 24 came in at #3, and NBA 2K24 came in at #9, dropping three positions since the month prior.</p>
<p>Despite receiving mixed reviews, The First Descendant also did surprisingly well in July. It was #5 overall and on Xbox, #6 on PC, and #7 on PlayStation, respectively. It received a whopping 10 million player count across the board in the first week of its release, which is pretty significant for a free-to-play game.</p>
<p>Although miHoYo typically has taken the gacha world by storm, Zenless Zone Zero didn't mainly hold up on other consoles than the PlayStation. The game was released on PlayStation 5, Android, iOS, and PC but only managed to enter the PlayStation rankings at #11.</p>
<p>Once looking at the report in detail, it makes a lot of sense that multiplayer games have gone on to outperform singleplayer games, especially since this year hasn't particularly seen a huge influx of AAA games, with most of the potential big-hitters being slated to release much later in Q4 of 2024. It's possible that when games such as Silent Hill 2, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom are all released respectively, the charts will shift in favor of single-player games, with them bringing in more revenue and active players.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising results is that the single Nintendo Switch game will make it into the top 20 revenue ranking overall. That game is Nintendo World Champions: NES Edition. While it immediately jumped up the charts and made it to #1 on Nintendo Switch, it didn't experience such luck in the general charts. Instead, it sat at #17 as the only Nintendo-developed title out of the hard hitters.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-view-count</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamescom-onl-2024-doubled-last-years-view-count-to-40m.963726/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-view-count<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamescom Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley has revealed how many views this year's presentation racked up, and if his count is to be believed, then this year's show was much more popular than last year's.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1827724818416087329" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Keighley's X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, Gamescom ONL 2024 managed to amass "more than 40 million video views", which amounts to "double that of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-opening-night-live-here-are-all-trailers-news-reveals">2023</a>". That's not bad at all.</p>
<p>Naturally, Keighley's numbers must be coming from multiple platforms, because the Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024 show only has 1.2 million views on YouTube. Keighley doesn't break down viewership by platform, though, so we're left guessing on that one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-warcraft.jpg?itok=DSn5-t2i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-warcraft.jpg?itok=bH9MWfkF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024 featured around two and a half hours of announcements and reveals.</figcaption></figure><p>Keighley also says in his post that the in-person Gamescom event welcomed around 335,000 visitors this year, which is an increase on 2023's total of 320,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, it sounds like Gamescom 2024 was a much more popular event all around than last year's, so we can reasonably expect next year's showcase to increase its viewership and attendance even further, right?</p>
<p>If you missed out on Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024, it aired last Tuesday and featured around two and a half hours of reveals and announcements for both new and existing games.</p>
<p>We got to see reveals for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>, a new&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>game, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tarsier-studios-reanimal-introduces-tense-and-terrifying-journey">Tarsier Studios' spooky&nbsp;<em>Reanimal</em></a>, which looks strongly reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>(which makes sense given that Tarsier worked on the first two installments of that series).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tarsier-studios-reanimal-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024.jpg?itok=nl-tj9e7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tarsier-studios-reanimal-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024.jpg?itok=xKrcElId 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tarsier Studios'&nbsp;<em>Reanimal&nbsp;</em>was just one of the many games shown during Gamescom ONL 2024.</figcaption></figure><p>Remarkably, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch">just six</a> of the announcements made during Gamescom ONL 2024 are confirmed to be coming to Nintendo Switch right now, so it looks like that Switch 2 announcement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">Nintendo promised us</a> can't come soon enough.</p>
<p>If you missed Gamescom ONL 2024 and you want to catch up with the show, you can do so right here. Be warned, though: it's long. Grab yourself a cup of coffee or something.</p>
