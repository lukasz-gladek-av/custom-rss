		<p>It might have more than double the storage of the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, but even with a 2TB SSD now built into the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, it’s pretty much inevitable that gamers are going to start to feel the pinch of having too many games installed. Thankfully, you still have the NVMe SSD slot to enable you to upgrade the console with some off-the-shelf PC parts.</p>
<p>Sony has the exact same recommendations and requirements for a third party NVMe drive, but there’s an added wrinkle for the PS5 Pro, if you consider that a lot of buyers will be upgrading from the base PS5. That’s the situation that we found ourselves in and how to handle it.</p>
<p><iframe title="How to upgrade PS5 Pro SSD, and&nbsp;transfer SSD from original PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pZ1y-l9ja2k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>What SSD expansion drives are compatible with PS5 Pro?</h2>
<p>Just as with the base PS5, Sony states that any PS5 Pro SSD needs to be PCIe Gen 4 with a target sequential read speed of 5,500MB/s or faster and with a heatsink recommended. In practice, you can actually make do with less SSD speed, though compatible drives are now plentiful, and there’s plenty of options that are marketed as being PS5 compatible.</p>
<p>Head here for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/29/ps5-m2-ssd-expansion-what-drives-are-compatible-heatsink-guide/">more details on PS5 compatible SSDs</a>.</p>

<h2>Will you lose data if you transfer an SSD to a PS5 Pro?</h2>
<p>No. You will not lose data if you move an SSD between PS5 consoles. Similar to an external USB HDD for PS4 games and storage, an NVMe SSD that has games installed from one PS5 will almost seamlessly let you play all of those games on another PS5 console – though obviously, it’s a bit more complicated and technical to do the actual swap!</p>
<h2>How to install a PS5 Pro NVMe SSD</h2>
<p>The process to install an SSD in the PS5 Pro is very similar to that of the original PS5 and pretty much identical to the PS5 Slim.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A steady, clear, well-lit workspace</li>
<li>A #1 Phillips cross-head screwdriver (a magnetic screwdriver is very useful)</li>
<li>Your NVMe SSD</li>
</ul>
<p>Now just follow these steps, or watch the embedded video above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the console upside down, from the perspective of using it horizontally. The bottom of the PS5 has the face plate with the four PlayStation button symbols on it – not the PS logo. Have the front of the console (with the two USB-C ports and power button) facing you.</li>
<li>Remove the smaller of the two face plates on this side, lifting from the front and bending the plastic until you hear a click. Do NOT lift from the rear, as there are three retaining clips that are designed to hinge out of position.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>This will reveal the main air intake for the cooling fan and the grey metal plate covering the NVMe drive slot.<br>
We recommend turning the console around so that you are not reaching across the fan as you remove screws.</li>
<li>Remove the screw from the expansion slot cover and lift the cover out of place.<br>
This reveals five screw holes for each possible size of NVMe drive, each with a length number etched beneath, and with a screw and spacer by default in the 22110 position. The most common NVMe drive is 2280, so remove the screw and shift the metal spacer to the corresponding indent.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
<li>Take your NVMe drive and align with the expansion connector, with the notch lining up if you have the correct orientation (heatsink up). Angle the SSD in slightly, with the slot slightly raised from the base of the drive bay, and push firmly into place before laying the NVMe drive down flat onto the spacer.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li>Fasten the drive in place with the screw.</li>
<li>Replace the slot cover and secure with its screw.</li>
<li>Reattach the face plate, angling in the three retaining clips at the rear of the consoleand then firmly pressing in the other clip points until they click.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the SSD installed, you can now hook it back up to power and a screen and turn it on. If it’s a brand new SSD, the console will prompt you to format the drive, but if transferring from another PS5 console, it will instead automatically rebuild the SSD database and process all of the installed games to be playable.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you now have *even more* storage in your PS5 Pro!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/konami-snake-eater-remake-reaso/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is an ambitious remake of the legendary stealth action title released on PlayStation 2 in 2004. It has been in development at Konami for some time, and amidst ongoing content drops including screenshots and teaser trailers, it was revealed that it’ll be released in full in 2025.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, MGS’ series producer, Noriaki Okamura, revealed one of the driving reasons why Konami resolved to remake one of the most iconic games in the series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-basically-our-duty">‘It Was Basically Our Duty’</h2>



<p>In the most recent iteration of Play magazine (and circulated <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-exists-because-konami-was-starting-to-get-worried-that-the-younger-generation-of-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-metal-gear-series-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by GamesRadar</a>), Noriaki Okamura sat down to talk about all things Metal Gear Solid. He revealed one of the core reasons why Konami decided to remake Metal Gear Solid 3 more than 20 years after it was first released:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the things that really sparked us to do the remake in general is because we realised that a lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren’t familiar with the Metal Gear series anymore.</p>



<p>It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations. After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say—but again, who is Solid Snake?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the 2000s, Metal Gear Solid 3 became one of my most beloved games, and I looped the story time and again. It felt so ahead of its time, boasting an immersive, lengthy story, an open-ended operating system, and unique camouflage, healing, and survival mechanics.</p>



<p>All that will be present in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but everything has been improved upon immensely for this ambitious remake.</p>



<p>Okamura raises a good point, though. The first Metal Gear game was in 1987, and the <strong>last </strong>major release in the series was in 2015 with Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. That’s about the time that Konami and Hideo Kojima, the creator of the series, fell out of one another’s good graces.</p>



<p>The team at Konami tried to release a survival horror MGS game called MG Survive in 2018, but it was am monumental flop.</p>



<p>It has been <strong>ten years </strong>since the last Metal Gear Solid game, and there being so much that came before means it’s daunting to a newcomer who just wants to get involved and see what the fuss is all about. Where do you even begin with a franchise this expansive? There are almost 40 years of history wrapped up in Metal Gear Solid.</p>



<p>Let’s hope that the Snake Eater remake isn’t the end of it.</p>

            <p>A number of NetEase Games employees have reportedly been arrested on charges of bribery and money laundering.</p>
<p>As picked up by Chinese site <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/category/industrynews/D1r2qIXu83HaLD5q.html">Leifeng.com</a> and reported by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/netease-says-police-detained-executives-for-alleged-bribery">Bloomberg Law</a>, NetEase Games' general manager, Xiang Lang, was detained along with NetEase's esports lead, Jin Yuchen, and several other staff on anti-corruption charges.</p>

<p>In an internal memo to staff, NetEase Games - which develops Marvel Rivals and Destiny: Rising - announced it has since dismissed a total of nine staff for alleged bribery. It's thought the case impacts 28 suppliers to the Chinese megacorp in a case worth roughly one billion yuan - that's £107.5 million / $139.3 million.</p>
<p>The names of those implicated have seemingly been removed from NetEase's internal systems and shortly after the arrests, staff still employed at the studio reported that their usual computer screensavers had been replaced by reminders of NetEase's compliance protocols.</p>
<p>This is reportedly the second internal anti-corruption investigation NetEase has organised since September 2023.</p>
<p>A NetEase spokesperson said police were now investigating alleged corruption charges but would not disclose more details at this time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We expect to see steep discounts on a number of gaming goods when many of the early sales <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569881/black-friday-deals-start-time-hours-cyber-monday-stores">kick off next week</a>, but if you want to shop ahead of time, <strong>Seagate’s 2TB Storage Expansion Card for the Xbox Series X / S<em> </em></strong>is already matching its all-time low of $199.99 ($160 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJYXMDW/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/7x46p0sfha73r">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/xbox-gaming/storage-expansion-for-xbox-series-x/">Seagate’s online storefront</a>.</p><p>While pricey, Seagate’s proprietary expansion cards are a great way to expand the storage capacity of your Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S. The NVMe-based, Microsoft-licensed cards — of which there are currently two — are incredibly easy to install, fast, and allow you to run games as if they were loaded on your console’s internal memory. That means they support Microsoft’s Quick Resume function and prevent you from having to shuffle downloads around, which you’d have to do if you were to purchase a USB-based external hard drive (those are limited to playing backward-compatible games).</p><p>Understandably, Sony’s approach to expandable storage, which lets PlayStation 5 owners upgrade their console with any PS5-compatible M.2 SSD, is still far more inviting. But Seagate’s proprietary option has been coming down in price since the introduction of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/2/23666795/western-digital-xbox-storage-expansion-card">Western Digital’s WD_Black C50</a>, and Seagate’s 2TB model is far easier to stomach now than with its original starting price of $399.99. Here’s hoping the current price drop is a sign of steeper cuts to come.</p><div><p>Proprietary SSD expansion for the Xbox Series X / S consoles.

They’re a pretty notable step up from the prior model — particularly if you use a Pixel phone — with a smaller build, an excellent transparency mode, and some of the best battery life you can get in a pair of noise-canceling earbuds. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24254109/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li><strong>Nomad</strong> is running an <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/">early Black Friday sale</a> through the end of today, November 9th, allowing you to save 20 percent on a variety of accessories when you use coupon code <strong>EARLY20</strong>.

            <p>As people continue to get stuck into Dragon Age: The Veilguard this weekend, developer BioWare has shared a number of interesting statistics about its playerbase, including confirmation that High Dragon Corius The Icetalon is the game's "deadliest" enemy.</p>
<p>So far, it looks pretty evenly split across classes - 40 percent of us are playing as Mages, whereas the other 60 percent is spread evenly across Rogues and Warriors. However, the lineage delineations are interesting with 43 percent of us choosing to be human and 40 percent as elf.</p>
<p>The final 17 percent splits across Dwarf and Qunari, at 6 percent and 11 percent, respectively.</p>

<p>Factions are also a little uneven: 24 percent of players opt to play as both Grey Wardens and Shadow Dragons, whilst 16 percent are Antivan Crows. 15 percent of us joined the Veil Jumpers, 11 percent the Lords of Fortune, leaving just one in 10 of us opting to become a Mournwatch.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, more of us have died during the Sea of Blood mission than anywhere else.</p> <div>

<p>Eurogamer's Robert Purchese had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">lot of good things to say about BioWare's latest Dragon Age in his five star review</a>. "From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling," he wrote. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>GSC Game World has <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1854993555745362400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-awaited-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> has officially gone gold. This means the game is done, and a master copy has been sent for mass production (the game will be released on physical discs for Xbox, in addition to digital).</p>
<p>In theory, this means no more delays are in order, although there's a famous precedent: CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-officially-gold-night-city-opens-november-19th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to have gone gold on October 5, 2020, ahead of its planned November 19, 2020 launch date. However, on October 27, the Polish developer was forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-to-december-10th-cdpr-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> a short delay to December 10. The reasons would later become obvious, as even the delay was not enough to prevent a rough launch, especially on consoles.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 fans certainly hope this won't be the case, both regarding the delay and the rough debut. After all, this game already had to suffer through a long and tough road to get here. It's been over fifteen years since the last franchise entry, 2009's S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat. The first attempt at a proper STALKER 2 project was immediately started by GSC Game World, which <a href="http://wccftech.com/stalker-2-set-release-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the game in August 2010 for a tentative 2012 release window.</p>
<p>However, the Ukrainian studio was dissolved in December 2011, inevitably leading to the cancellation of that project. Luckily, that wasn't the end of the story. Evgeniy Grygorovych, brother of GSC Game World's original founder Sergiy Grygorovych, successfully resurrected the studio in late 2014. After making the real-time strategy game Cossacks 3, GSC Game World returned to what it really wanted to do: make STALKER 2. The new announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-in-development-targeting-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came</a> in May 2018 with a targeted release window of 2021.</p>
<p>As time passed, the release was <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-debut-gameplay-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved</a> to April 2022 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-delayed-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again</a> to December 2022. But the disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine forced work on the game to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-development-sidelined-ukranian-russia-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop</a> altogether for some time. GSC Game World subsequently went silent for a long while, and fans couldn't help but wonder whether their long-awaited sequel would ever materialize.</p>
<p>Finally, a playable demo was brought to Gamescom 2023, and the developers used it to gather feedback and further improve STALKER 2. In early 2024, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-delay-final-release-date-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the game would launch on September 9, though we later discovered one final delay to the current date: November 20, when the game will be available on PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

My team of D&amp;D archetype oddballs may collectively be known as such in all the marketing, online articles, and the physical box itself, but within the world of Thedas they’re none the wiser. Imagine Tony Stark and Steve Rogers having no idea the world called them Avengers… that’s how odd it is.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A name that Rook, Varric, Harding, and the rest of the gang definitely do know, though, is Dread Wolf – the mythical moniker of former Dragon Age companion, Solas, as well as the original subtitle for this fourth entry in BioWare’s fantasy series. While ultimately it really doesn’t matter what this game is called, the more I play The Veilguard, the more it feels like it’s awkwardly in conflict with itself, torn into pieces that reflect two very different intentions – one a sequel to a decade-old RPG, the other a fresh beginning with no ties to what came before.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/dragon-age-the-veilguard-solas-1731076298077.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Dread Wolf is less dreadful than Inquisition's DLC promised.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Many aspects of The Veilguard point to it being something of a soft reset or even spin-off from the main Dragon Age series. Set in the northern Tevinter region, it leaves behind the saga’s original southern home of Ferelden, along with all its characters and politics. Dragon Age has always started afresh with each new game as, unlike Mass Effect, there’s no persistent protagonist across the series as each instalment tells a brand new story. The shift to Tevinter is perfectly in keeping with Dragon Age’s history, then, but The Veilguard isn’t a typical Dragon Age game. It is its first direct sequel – a continuation of Dragon Age: Inquisition, which dedicated its post-credits and Trespasser DLC to setting up Solas as the villainous Dread Wolf. And this is where it all starts to feel a little messy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of The Veilguard is dedicated to Solas. Its opening sees him performing a dangerous god-unleashing ritual, and the world is littered with quests that explore his history and relationship with those dark deities. There may be no mention of the word “Veilguard” anywhere, but everyone is talking about the Dread Wolf. Why isn’t that the name of the game again? </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rather than take his place as the villain Trespasser promised, Solas is usurped by a much more newcomer-friendly option</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Solas may take up considerable space, the Dread Wolf has weirdly been relegated to the position of fantasy Hannibal Lecter, trapped in dreams where he appears only to offer advice. Rather than take his place as the villain Trespasser promised, he’s usurped by other dark elven gods who don’t demand any significant prior knowledge – a much more newcomer-friendly option. I’m left with the impression of an antagonist who was robbed of his big bad status somewhere along The Veilguard’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">infamously rocky development journey</a>. As our review says, you can “practically smell the rewrites.” But despite his shift from villain to condescending informant, the story is still dedicated to him in a manner that never feels like a true fit for a game that elsewhere is so clearly attempting to be a fresh start rather than a direct sequel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’d rather we got a more clear-cut successor to Inquisition, I think the game we’ve ended up with would be better for cutting Solas loose entirely. Sure, the lack of answers to one of the greatest twists in RPG history would be frustrating, but Solas’ fate feels divorced from the story that established him. That’s because none of the world-altering choices you made across the Dragon Age series are reflected in The Veilguard. Unlike its predecessors, there’s no way to import or recreate your save games and world state aside from three basic and largely interchangeable decisions made in Inquisition’s Trespasser DLC. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/dragon-age-the-veilguard-rook-davrin-1731076322739.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Veilguard are unaffected by the many decisions you made across the Dragon Age series.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it">Speaking to IGN earlier this year</a>, creative director John Epler told us “among many reasons why we moved to Northern Thedas is it becomes a little bit more of a clean slate for us. There's not as many decisions you have made up to this point that have an impact on what's happening in Northern Thedas. And we don't have to speak directly to things like who is the Divine? Because again, that's happening in the South.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the South is where we made our home and our ties to this world, and so this move means that the Thedas that we helped influence and shape across dozens of hours is not the same Thedas that’s currently at stake. With The Veilguard’s elven gods representing not just the greatest apocalyptic threat Thedas has ever faced, but also the culmination of the Inquisition storyline, then surely it's more important than ever that the stakes are our own, personal version of this world? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do sympathise with BioWare – Dragon Age wasn’t developed as a trilogy in the same way as Mass Effect, and so the choices have been on very different scales that must be incredibly difficult to implement into successive games. But those choices being wiped entirely results in something that feels like an opening trying to be a finale. It’s a situation only further strained by the fact that The Veilguard’s version of Thedas is so tonally different from the one established in the previous Dragon Age games. Its grand Necropolis and floating Minrathous fortress feel divorced from the earthier lands of Inquisition and a far cry from the darker regions in which this saga began. Veilguard is a whole new world untouched by players and that clashes with its insistence on continuing Solas’ story in a roundabout way. If BioWare really needed to leave our choices behind, or if it really needed to start afresh for a new era, then going the Mass Effect: Andromeda route of an entirely new story, characters, and setting would have been the cleaner choice. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Veilguard crew all appear to be likeable people, but it feels as if I’m being blocked from forging true bonds with them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And so we come back to that history-avoiding title. When Dragon Age: Dreadwolf became Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare’s general manager Gary McKay explained <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">the new name was chosen to reflect the “really deep and compelling group of companions.”</a> It’s an unsurprising shift, moving away from Solas’ decade-old story that perhaps too few players will actually care about in favour of a direction clearly inspired by the phenomenon that is Baldur’s Gate 3’s beloved party. But, frustratingly, I don’t think The Veilguard does the intention of its new title justice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the first 15 or so hours, during which you put together a god-killing team Mass Effect 2-style, there’s rarely the option to have a proper back-and-forth conversation. There’s a tendency to favour cutscenes or pre-scripted chat over traditional RPG dialogue choices, resulting in the feeling that characters are talking <em>at</em> you rather than <em>with </em>you. Very few party members can be spoken to at length following their initial recruitment, and this lack of introductory getting-to-know-you feels antithetical to a design that expects you to quickly forge bonds and trust with your team. As time goes by there are more opportunities to direct the flow of conversation yourself, but they frequently lack the multi-tier dialogue trees that really allow you to delve deep. It was only after unlocking the dragon-hunting Taash that I was presented with a conversation in which I was able to cycle through multiple tiers of responses at every stage of the dialogue. It was the first satisfying conversation I’d had in 17 hours of play, and I’m baffled as to why I hadn’t had the same experience with every other character I’d met. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Veilguard crew all appear to be likeable people, but it feels as if I’m being blocked from forging true bonds with them. That especially goes for Varric. What is arguably Dragon Age’s best-ever character has been imprisoned in his bedroom, consigned to spouting incidental dialogue that you can’t engage with. His sidelining is yet another example of The Veilguard’s uneasy relationship with its predecessor, but unfortunately the frustrating treatment of its new cast means it’s also difficult to fully embrace the story’s fresh faces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I enter The Veilguard’s second half I have begun to appreciate its unique approaches. The knotty, secrets-filled Crossroads region is fun to explore. The action combat is really robust, particularly when enhanced by the well-considered skill tree. But at every turn you can feel the toll of that long, rocky development timeline. There’s a solid God of War-style action game in here, but its sharp battles, linear-ish level design, and explosive cutscenes clash with the more traditional RPG that’s also fighting for air. Those level layouts throttle the quest design, action always takes precedence over conversation, stealth, or diplomacy, and the companions are more like NPCs than party members – Atreus over Astarion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The overall result is that Dragon Age: The Veilguard isn’t <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-doesnt-need-to-be-baldurs-gate-3-it-needs-to-be-golden-era-bioware">the golden era BioWare game that I had hoped it would be</a>. Torn between continuing its traditional role-playing legacy and starting afresh as a modern action RPG, the end result is an awkward sequel trapped in a cage made of reboot ideas. After years and years of faltered steps I understand why BioWare landed on this particular, very mainstream AAA formula, but I wish it had been inspired by the undying mass popularity of The Witcher 3 – a full-on nerdy RPG – rather than veer closer to Sony’s palatable RPG-ish approach for modern God of War. But that ill-defined shape is often what uneasy development cycles get you. Thankfully The Veilguard’s launch has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam">seemingly gone well for EA and BioWare</a>, which hopefully means Dragon Age will continue. Let’s just hope next time it’s not just the name that’s got a bit of Baldur’s Gate in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

As Moon Knight, he doles out righteous vengeance, locked in a never-ending battle with both the criminals on the streets and the voices in his head. In Marvel Rivals, Moon Knight wields supernatural powers bestowed by Khonshu to vanquish his foes. </p><p>When crafting Moon Knight’s in-game persona, the development team incorporated a color scheme of white and black, drawing from the rich tapestry of ancient Egyptian mythology linked with Khonshu, and added “Egyptian Faience” material to his costume design, infusing Moon Knight’s appearance with a mystical and exotic allure. Departing from the traditional form-fitting suit seen in the comics, the team integrated technological components and rugged armor motifs into the character’s design. This enhances the visual impact while aligning with the game’s aesthetic, allowing Moon Knight’s aggressive combat style to seamlessly intertwine with the gameplay. Moon Knight can summon a portal above the battlefield, connecting him to the cosmos and summoning the formidable and enigmatic arms of Khonshu, rendering his enemies defenseless.</p></blockquote><p>NetEase also officially announced Shota Nakama as the music producer and arranger for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and Masahiro Aoki as the music composer.

<p>More often than not, the management and simulation genre proves massive and complex. On PC, there are countless hotkeys to consider, and to the everyday player, it can feel overwhelming to remember every key combination necessary to quick-build or remove pathing sections. Hopefully, we can help. Here are a few of the most important hotkeys in Planet Coaster 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-important-planet-coaster-2-hotkeys-to-remember">Important Planet Coaster 2 Hotkeys To Remember</h2>



<p>I spent too long ignoring hotkeys and shortcuts in games in favor of simply clicking, and the day I started using hotkeys, I never returned. They make life easier. You can access nearly any menu or mechanic in the game without moving your hand from the keyboard. Of course, remembering every hotkey and shortcut command is initially challenging, but there’s no shame in keeping a guide like this one up on your phone or a second screen. </p>



<p>Here are a few Planet Coaster 2 hotkeys worth remembering:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>CTRL + Z</strong> — Undo</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + Y</strong> — Redo</li>



<li><strong>L</strong> — Light</li>



<li><strong>ALT</strong> — Radial Menu</li>



<li><strong>Right CTRL + Right SHIFT + G</strong> — Hide UI</li>



<li><strong>Z</strong> — Rotate 90 Degrees</li>



<li><strong>Hold Z</strong> — Rotate</li>



<li><strong>X</strong> — Advanced Move</li>



<li><strong>M</strong> — Move</li>



<li><strong>F</strong> — Snap Object to Wall Center</li>



<li><strong>P</strong> — Toggle Angle Snap</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + D</strong> — Duplicate Object</li>



<li><strong>R</strong> — Edit Building</li>



<li><strong>I</strong> — Multi Select</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are many more hotkeys and shortcuts in Planet Coaster 2, and you can find all of them within the settings menu, but I find you’ll use these more frequently than any other. It’s worth keeping this guide open for quick reference.</p>
