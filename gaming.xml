<p>After announcing an artbook earlier this year, Lost In Cult has lifted the lid on two lovely little physicals on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/toadsanime.lostincult.co.uk/post/3lv4lutgv3f2y">social media</a> — one standard edition, and one exclusive edition designed by <strong>UFO 50</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spelunky">Spelunky</a> creator Derek Yu. Both versions cost <strong>£29.99</strong> and will be shipping in Q4 2025.</p>
<p>The physical version will come with all recent patches on the cartridge, including the brand new Switch 2 compatibility update.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4aGvRTLyifg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aGvRTLyifg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f17ajoywsr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aGvRTLyifg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>We love the art for <em>both</em> versions, to be honest — the clay animal statues on the general release are adorable and creepy, while Derek Yu's artwork is charming and manages to capture the limited neon colourscape of the game.</p>
<p>This is the second physical release for Shared Memory's acclaimed game following <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/animal-well?srsltid=AfmBOop1jpU2PyPb2WWhCsw4kkSVya_J3Ij0rW6udD1NkJFrbsyRXAL6">Limited Run Games' release last year</a>. So, if you missed out on that one, well, this one looks a little more unique!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grounded-2-is-out-now-in-early-access-on-steam-and-xbox-game-preview-on-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc.1256496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grounded 2 was officially announced and revealed last month as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Xbox's Summer Game Fest 2025</a> showcase, and a little more than a month later as of the time of this writing, it is out on Xbox Series X/S consoles as a Game Preview title and on PC on Steam as an Early Access game.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment's sequel to its 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'-esque survival game changes a great deal from the first game, including some significant changes to inventory management simply by removing the need for players to carry multiple key tools like a shovel, axe, and hammer in their backpack at all times, since all three have been replaced by the multi-facted omni-tool.</p>



<p>Inventory management has also improved by the simple fact that you can now raise an ant or spider from birth to be your mount and companion, allowing you to travel with more on you and travel across the map far faster than you ever could in the first game.</p>



<p>Currently, only two mounts are available, though since Grounded 2 is launching as an early access title, there's plenty of time for more mounts to be added and improvements to be made to the game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Grounded 2 - Early Access Story Trailer AVAILABLE NOW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RcUeK3xv17k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As part of Xbox celebrating Grounded 2's launch, Xbox and Microsoft are also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/24/grounded-2-red-ant-plush-giant-sweepstakes/">giving away a not-so-ant-sized Red Ant plush</a> that players can sit on as if they're riding it while they ride a Red Ant in the game. </p>



<p>When Grounded finally launched out of early access two years after its initial early access launch in 2020, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grounded-honey-conquered-genre/">Wccftech's Chris Wray said in his review</a> that "<em>Grounded is undoubtedly one of the best survival games around. While it falls into some of the same traps, getting very grindy and gatekeeping progression while not signposting as well as it should do, there's little doubt that it's a very engaging game. Where many games will give you a world to play around in, Grounded places you in a living, breathing world and has you engage with every element in interesting ways."</em></p>



<p>While Grounded 2's early access launch is unlikely to hit those same heights, it'll be interesting to see how it develops between community feedback and Obsidian, and if it can surpass the standards set by its predecessor.</p>

So I decided to check out what is easily one of the biggest games around in 2025 and try to find out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/616251/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-explainer-what-is&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/616251/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-explainer-what-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why it’s leading to kids crying on TikTok. </a></span>What I experienced was both awful and fascinating, and while I’m not sure I ever want to play <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> again, I think I get why it’s hooked so many kids and teens. </p><h2 id="h328670"><a id=""></a>What is <em>Steal A Brainrot?</em></h2><p>The gameplay loop in <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> seems remarkably simple...at first. However, there’s more going on than you might initially expect. When you begin, you spawn in with a small amount of money and a large storage area. Around you are other storage areas owned by other players. And in the middle is a conveyor belt constantly offering up new “Brainrot Meme” characters to buy. (This is a very popular series of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">AI-generated creatures with fake Italian names that are hot online right now</a></span>. Don’t worry about it.) </p><p>These characters come in different rarities and have varying prices. Some are very cheap and affordable for new players, while others take millions of in-game dollars to buy. You buy some and they waddle over to your storage area where, every few seconds or so, they earn you money, with rarer ones earning a lot more per second. As you earn more money, you buy more and better characters. </p><figure id="" data-id="33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-recommend-id="image://33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Roblox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-recommend-id="image://33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.roblox.com/games/109983668079237/Steal-a-Brainrot&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/109983668079237/Steal-a-Brainrot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">If that was all <em>Steal A Brainrot</em></a></span><em> </em>was, I doubt it would have become popular enough to attract my attention. The real fun of the game lies in how you can steal from and screw over other players. For example, when you buy a character, someone else can run up and buy it before it gets to your storage area, effectively stealing it from you. You can then buy it back again, assuming you have the money, but back-and-forths like this can quickly leave you drained. You can also just run into someone’s storage area and steal one of their characters and bring it back to your place. And at any point, you can lock down your storage area for 60 seconds, keeping out thieves or trapping intruders. And then you can just walk out of your locked storage facility and go ransack their characters as they helplessly watch from afar. Complicating all this, you can pay real money via Robux to escape sooner, which feels like the cruelest way to squeeze money out of kids.</p><p>I have to admit, there is something very satisfying about running into an open storage room and stealing a high-priced character before the owner can come back and slap you with a baseball bat. This is why <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> has hooked so many people. </p><p>That was also one of the first things I did. </p><h2 id="h328671"><a id=""></a>The rise and fall of my meme empire</h2><p>Someone with a solid collection of brainrot characters went AFK for a bit, leaving their storage area unguarded and open. A few other players and I swarmed like locusts and robbed the poor person of everything. I snagged some alligator airplane hybrid thing that started earning me a thousand dollars a second. Soon, I had a sizeable fortune. I used it to buy a few more rare characters, and soon I had an empire.</p><p>However, this became a problem. It didn’t take long for other players to start hovering around my storage area. They were waiting for me to slip up. To leave without locking up or to stay out too long and leave my trophies for the taking. I’d smack them away, like swatting flies away from your food. But they would return.</p><p>Eventually, as my empire grew larger, I had to regularly deal with thieves. One entered and begged me for one of my rarest characters. They claimed they needed it for a special achievement and promised to give it back. I simply told them, “One does not keep an empire if they give it away.” They replied, “Bro, come on, be cool.” I would not be cool. I was building my future, one dumb meme character at a time. And I wasn’t going to give it up. </p><figure id="" data-id="308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-recommend-id="image://308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-format="png" data-width="1321" data-height="644" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Roblox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-recommend-id="image://308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-format="png" data-width="1321" data-height="644" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After about 40 minutes of saving carefully, buying only the rarest characters, and keeping my storage area locked down tight, I had become extremely rich. I could buy practically any meme I wanted. I was a king, and my storage room showed it. </p><p>Then came the fall. That person who tried to talk me into giving them a rare character snuck in while I got greedy. I spotted a very rare dog-banana-thing and went after it, forgetting to lock up. When I returned, the locusts were swarming my empire. My riches were gone. I tried to stop them. I failed. </p><p>And so ended my short-lived but grand empire in <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>. For a moment I thought about rebuilding, but then I realized that in that 40-minute span, I had done everything the game offered. </p><p>I’d stolen a few characters, racked up riches, got into a few fights, and found a couple of super rare memes. I had no reason to keep playing <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>, a very ugly and boring-looking game. I can imagine a younger kid developing favorite memes and holding onto them tightly. And I’ll admit that when that bastard stole one of my rarest brainrots, I felt a flash of anger. I see why some children are crying and throwing tantrums after losing beloved memes. I’m not excited to play more of it, but yeah, I get why this thing has over 1 million players and a ton of clones. </p><p>I’m not a fan of one of the most popular games among kids being all about grinding forever to make more money and betraying people to win big, but who can deny the allure of building up something bigger than yourself? Even if it’s just a collection of Italian brainrot memes.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s that time of the month again where we get to look ahead to another batch of bundled games with PlayStation Plus. Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for August 2025, with the letters of the month being P and Z.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus August 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>There’s a solid trio of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 5th August:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lies of P</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>DayZ</strong> | PS4</li>
<li><strong>My Hero One’s Justice 2</strong> | PS4</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/13/lies-of-p-review/"><strong>Lies of P</strong></a> is a standout soulslike, taking inspiration from the classic puppet turned real boy tale of Pinocchio. We gave it a glowing review back in 2023, saying “Smooth combat, seamless exploration and a set of well-executed mechanics makes Lies of P an excellent Soulslike. When you add in the gorgeous visuals, desolate world design, stark sound design and engrossing story, it raises the experience above a lot of its contemporaries. All in all, although Lies of P is essentially Bloodborne featuring Timothée Chalamet, it does more than enough to mark itself out as a unique title worth your time – and I’m not lying.”</p>
<p>Oh, and there’s also the recently released Overture DLC to sink into if you enjoy this freebie enough.</p>


<p>That might be a hard act to follow, but the online survival action of DayZ provides a major change of pace. The game has grown and improved a lot since its original release in 2018, with last year seeing the release of a third major map with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/dayz-update-1-25-live-as-major-dlc-goes-free/">the DayZ Frostline expansion</a>, putting more emphasis on world temperature, clothing, food, and even letting you catch a cold. At the same time, the previous Livonia DLC was bundled into the game, and we now have the Badlands DLC to look forward to in 2026.</p>

<p>And finally, My Hero One’s Justice is a 3D brawler based on the hit anime superhero show. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/04/my-hero-ones-justice-2-review/">our review</a>, we said “It carries on the fine work put in on the first game, wraps the more recent story beats into a playable form, and buffs the already excellent visuals up to a new Shonen shine. It’s not a great jumping on point for newcomers, at least story-wise, but it remains a fun, approachable fighter based on one of the best anime shows of recent years.”</p>
<h2>Can you still get the July 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 4th August to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diablo IV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>King of Fighters XV</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>Jusant</strong> | PS5</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/25/the-july-2025s-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-diablo-4-celebrates-15th-anniversary/">Head here for the full skinny</a> on that.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-release-date-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slime-rancher-2-1-0-release-date-set-for-september.1256454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Monomi Park has announced that its cozy critter-rearing sim&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>is leaving Early Access this September, gaining new story content, new gameplay features, and more in the process.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>&nbsp;will be exiting Early Access and hitting its 1.0 release on September 23rd. By the time it launches in full, it will have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">been in Early Access for three years</a>.</p>

<p>When the 1.0 version arrives, Monomi Park says you can expect plenty of extras for the cute farming sim, first among them being new Labyrinth sections that you can explore in order to "solve the [game's] ongoing mysteries and save the Far, Far Range".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slime-rancher-2-1.0-release-date-slimes_0.jpg?itok=D81n1cqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slime-rancher-2-1.0-release-date-slimes_0.jpg?itok=Cmk__xk7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>is finally exiting Early Access in September.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also be able to enjoy the new Quantum Drones, which can both "help automate your ranch" and "roam the island to find resources", as well as more blueprints featuring "decor variants, gadgets, and upgrades".</p>

<p>All in all, Monomi Park is calling 1.0 "the best and most complete version of the&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>experience to date", so if you've been holding off until the game is done, September is the date you're going to want to aim for.</p>

<p>As well as announcing the 1.0 release, Monomi Park has also revealed physical versions of&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>&nbsp;for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, which will launch in January. They'll sport artwork from&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>artist Yusuke Naora, as well as a fold-out poster.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as a sneak preview of the artwork created by Naora for the physical releases of the game, right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>, it is, as you've probably guessed, the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher</em>, which left its Early Access period <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-leaving-early-access-this-august" rel="nofollow">all the way back in August 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Less than a week after its Early Access launch,&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-sales-cross-300k-in-first-week-with-zero-crunch" rel="nofollow">managed to pick up over 300,000 sales</a>, and Monomi Park proudly says it did so with "zero crunch", so hey, there's another reason to grab the game if you haven't already.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1657630/Slime_Rancher_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009803" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/slime-rancher-2/9phfj0n31nv1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The full version launches on September 23rd, and the special physical versions for console launch on January 14th.</p>

As such, any UK-based player who indicates their account age as 18 and over will begin seeing notifications encouraging them to verify their age.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Age verification will be required to retain full access to social features on Xbox, including voice and text chat, as well as game invites. That being said, the restrictions won't take effect until early 2026, so people won't be mandated to go through the verification until then.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This one-time process for players in the UK ensures we can continue to provide all players on our platform with age-appropriate experiences," Kunes wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for methods for online verification, these include proof of government-issued ID, age estimation, or either a mobile provider or credit card check. "The information players provide during the age verification process is protected with industry-standard encryption and is not stored or used for any other purpose," the statement reads.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, Kunes said that Microsoft expects to "roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future," clarifying that there is "no one-size-fits-all solution to player safety," so these methods may look different across regions and experiences. "We'll work with local communities, publishing partners and regulators to determine the right approach that both respects player privacy and doesn’t take away from the Xbox gameplay experience."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-igda-calls-wave-of-adult-game-delistings-a-form-of-creative-suppression-" target="_self" data-discover="true">The IGDA calls wave of adult game delistings a form of 'creative suppression'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eligible players who don't verify their age will only be able to use social features on Xbox with friends only until they do so.

<p><strong>Play! Pokémon Access</strong> is out now in parts of Europe and is coming to the US on 4th August (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1950220130535035189">Serebii</a>!) and allows fans to access news about events from the <a href="https://play.pokemon.com/en-us/">Play! Pokémon</a> website from their phone.</p>
<p>Not <em>only</em> that, but the app becomes a one-stop tracker for players who are taking part in these events. You can check into competitive events using a QR code, keep track of your record in-game, look for car images, and register your current TCG deck.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fsprvmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>You can also use it to search for events and earn badges in the app for competing.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the app from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/play-pok%C3%A9mon-access/id6738208583?platform=iphone">iOS</a>/<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pokemon.play.access&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a> store:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Play! Pokémon program brings Trainers of all skill levels together at their local Play! Pokémon Stores, where battles are fought, friendships are forged, prizes are won, and—most importantly—fun is had by all. Play! Pokémon Access makes it easier than ever for Trainers to stay connected.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a player, Professor, or parent, Play! Pokémon Access puts you on the path to discovering new events happening in your area. Plus, it provides tools to make starting your Pokémon journey a breeze—you can search for tournaments for the Pokémon video games, Pokémon Trading Card Game, and Pokémon GO."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Admittedly, we're a bit surprised this wasn't teased or announced during last week's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-july-2025-every-announcement-full-livestream">Pokémon Presents</a>, same with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">TCG Pocket</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-much-needed-trading-update-and-a-new-expansion-next-week">expansion</a>; but hey, what do we know?</p>
<p><em>Will you be checking out the new app? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

            <p>There are at least two ways to write about parrying mechanics. On the one hand, you have people like me who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/va-proxy-is-a-nier-automata-like-thats-on-a-mission-to-parry-everything-and-now-it-has-a-demo">compose farking ridiculous intros</a> such as "a good parry mechanic is a kind of redemption", then spend hundreds of words overegging the pudding. On the other, you have Nic, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/parry-like-youre-sekiro-with-this-one-weird-trick-that-shadow-of-the-erdtree-bosses-hate">sums parrying up far more elegantly</a> as "a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly". I hope that both Nic and I will be at home in Memoria Wake, a new isometric action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in which you can parry giant black cats with an umbrella. There's now a demo on Steam.</p><!--more-->

<p>If you're partial to Soulslikes, Memoria Wake's setting might bewilder you. There are no ghastly cloven dragons or cathedrals full of maggots, or not so far, anyway. Instead, the game's smashed dreamworld is full of talking rubber ducks, wind-up toy monkeys, jack-in-the-boxes, and jigsaw pieces. It's sinister, yet soothing.</p>
<p>"Traverse hand-crafted dreamscapes where beauty and horror intertwine," the official site comments. "Uncover long buried truths, face twisted memories, and piece together the fragments of a broken past." Whose past? Presumably that of your character, Nilo - a titchy feline adventurer with huge eyes and a cute raincoat. </p>
<p>There's a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tunic">Tunic</a> to those musty, sun-pierced dollhouse environments, but the handling reminds me much more of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deaths-door">Death's Door</a>. There is certainly a bunch of parrying. Catch the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240610/Memoria_Wake/">Steam</a>. Release date? Let me dextrously deflect your wildest hopes with a scornful "coming soon".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/parrying-has-never-seemed-more-whimsical-than-in-dollhouse-soulslike-memoria-wake]]></content:encoded>

He said the studio wants to "take the philosophy we had during The Witcher 3--how to make a game, how to really care about these things, how to tell stories--and keep that philosophy."</p><p>The Witcher 4 is a "true sequel," so CD Projekt Red will also trying to answer "new questions." Otherwise, The Witcher 4 runs the risk of "just redoing what we did before," Weber said.</p><p>"I think it's really trying to have that healthy mix of really moving forward and also trying out some new things, but doing justice to what was there, not trying to beat it," he said.</p><p>Before this, Weber said when the team was making The Witcher 3, there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-wants-studio-to-harness-the-scrappy-energy-that-made-witcher-3-so-successful/1100-6532438/" data-ref-id="1100-6532438">"good creative chaos"</a> going on at the studio.

Do it dirty. Do it the way we used to do it!'" Weber said.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't have a release date yet, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">not expected to launch until 2027 at the soonest.</a> It's one of multiple games in development now at CD Projekt.

<p>Launching as a Switch 2 exclusive in the West</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After revealing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">Disgaea 7 Complete</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/disgaea-7-complete-is-launching-exclusively-on-switch-2-in-the-west">Western Switch 2 exclusivity</a> last month, NIS America has today lifted the lid on the release date for the upcoming definitive edition: <strong>10th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This 'complete' package arrived in Japan last year on PS5, PS4 and Switch, but only Nintendo's latest will be treated to the Western release (albeit as a Game-Key Card if you opt for the physical version).</p>
<p>For those who have missed it up until now, Disgaea 7 Complete bundles up the 2023 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disgaea_7_vows_of_the_virtueless">Vows of the Virtueless</a> strategy RPG base game and all of its DLC packs, gameplay tweaks like a new Hell Mode, max stats and more, <em>and</em> new characters and storylines. You can see it all for yourself in the above release date trailer.</p>
<p>We had a great time with Vows of the Virtueless when it arrived on Switch 1 a couple of years ago, calling it "another enjoyable entry in the long-running series, offering up a more refined take on the famously in-depth gameplay systems" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/disgaea-7-vows-of-the-virtueless">our review</a>. The complete edition certainly seems like it'll be <em>the</em> way to play this one, and fortunately, we don't have too long to wait.</p>

            <p>
Itch.io have announced that they are seeking out new payment processing partners who are more willing to handle the purchase of NSFW games, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">delisting or removing a vast swathe of games</a> in accordance with the content restrictions of companies such as Paypal and Stripe. They've also offered an explanation for why they've recently delisted so many more "infringing" games than Steam, which has carried out its own cull of sexually explicit games under pressure from finance firms. Finally, Itch have acknowledged that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">recently posted list of newly prohibited adult material</a> is far too vague to be useful.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
To catch you up, all this began earlier this summer, when Valve quietly updated Steam's terms and conditions to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">give banks, payment processors and internet service providers control over the platform's definition of "adult" content</a>. Following this change of policy, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">delisted a number of projects</a>, including a bunch of incest-themed sex games.</p>
<p>In the wake of Valve's policy change, Itch also began removing thousands of games from search results in the course of a catalogue-wide audit. Itch.io have been asking developers to comply with payment processor regulations for a while, but they have not hitherto tried to enforce this systematically.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq">an addendum to Itch.io's latest statement about NSFW content</a>, the difference in scale between each platform's banwave is the result of, firstly, Valve being a much larger corporation with greater capacity to challenge the payment firms, and secondly, Valve exerting tighter control over adult game developers to begin with. On Steam, product pages have to be approved before they will appear on the store. "Because they were generally aware of the content they host, they could identify and act on specific pages," Itch conclude.
</p>
<p>
By contrast, Itch.io is an open-ended platform where "anyone can publish content at any time with minimal barriers". It's possible to tag Itch.io game pages as having adult material, but Itch comment that "we could not rely on user-provided tagging to be accurate enough for a targeted approach, so a broader review was necessary to be thorough."
</p>
<p>
There's no timeline for when Itch.io's audit will be complete, not least because they're waiting on "final determinations from our current payment processors, Stripe and PayPal". They are, however, now getting in touch with alternative payment processors who are more willing to handle the kind of material Stripe and Paypal consider objectionable. They're also looking at stricter age-gating for Itch.io and better content classification.
</p>
<p>Not coincidentally, the International Game Developer Association have <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-igda-calls-wave-of-adult-game-delistings-a-form-of-creative-suppression-">just put out a statement</a> in which they appease all sides by "calling for greater transparency and fairness in how adult games are moderated and actioned across major platforms". The statement lists a couple of "adult-industry-compliant processors" you might want to partner with, if you're platforming a game the likes of Paypal won't touch: Verotel and CCBill. I have minimal familiarity with either, but I'll look into them.</p>
<p>
In their latest missive, Itch also tackle some user complaints about the delistings. They note that even if game pages are removed from search, you can still visit them and download the game if you already own it, even if it has been slapped with a "content notice". Itch are not, they insist, removing previously bought games from player libraries as part of the audit: people who can no longer access their games should get in touch with Itch support. The blog post also encourages players to "download and backup your games and don't let any corporation dictate what you can own".
</p>
<p>
As for complaints that Itch are already withholding payments from developers who infringe their new, albeit rather makeshift rules and regs, the platform holders comment that this reflects an older practice of blocking transactions in the case of an account breaking their content policies, "to address bad-actor situations where a user joins the site and blatantly violates our terms to make sales before being banned".
</p>
<p>
As for yesterday's list of prohibited themes and topics, which ranges from "animal-related" NSFW material to "real or implied" non-consensual sex, Itch concede that the list is very WIP, and that "we understand the problems that come with a list like this, as it's easy to argue the semantics". 
</p>
<p>
"We decided it was better to give you more information to work with instead of less, even if many of the items on the list can be argued either way," the post continues. "We intend to refine this part of the site with more care, but since there are still unknowns, this is the information we can provide for now."
</p>
<p>
Why have Itch and Steam's payment processing partners suddenly decided to push for a crackdown on games that infringe their policies? It's apparently the result of an open letter to the payment companies from Australian activist group Collective Shout, who campaign against the sexualisation of women and depictions of sexual violence.</p>
<p>Collective Shout have called for games featuring incest and rape to be delisted, but haven't shared specifics of the individual games they find objectionable, and seem pretty suspect in their motivations. They've mischaracterised certain games they want banned in the past, and have connections to rightwing Christian organisations with queerphobic leaders who want to criminalise all sex work. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">You can read up on a little of the backstory here.</a> Whatever you may think of Collective Shout, or of Valve and Itch.io's previous moderation of NSFW games, the overarching point is that vast finance firms shouldn't get to police the definition of acceptable sexual material.

It costs nothing—no materials needed!</p><p>Here’s how to transmog your gear in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>.</p><h2 id="h456377"><a id=""></a>How to transmog your gear in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></h2><p>To transmog your gear in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, you first need to open your menu and navigate to the equipment tab. You have four types of armor here: Head, Chest, Bracers, and Legs. As long as you have a piece of gear equipped here, you’ll see an option on the bottom of the screen that says “Alter Equipment”. Press the corresponding button to bring up a list of all of your available armor, then press “Confirm” on the option you’d like to apply as a transmog to your equipped piece of gear.</p><figure id="" data-id="07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-recommend-id="image://07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a helmet in an item screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a helmet in an item screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-recommend-id="image://07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a helmet in an item screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Alternatively, if you’d like to remove any transmog applied to a piece of gear, simply go back into the alteration menu and look for an option at the bottom of the screen that says “Remove Alteration,” then click the corresponding button.

This game has some of the coolest armor I’ve seen in a soulslike in quite a while, and it’s well worth trying different pieces together to get the ultimate fit. </p><p>More importantly, transmog is especially useful because you’ll probably want to swap around equipment regularly in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, as many areas are home to dangerous status effects. If you need Corruption protection but don’t like the look of that armor, just transmog it to look exactly like your favorite armor set.</p><figure id="" data-id="3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-recommend-id="image://3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Wuchang shows off a new fit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Wuchang shows off a new fit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-recommend-id="image://3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Wuchang shows off a new fit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For instance, I’m wearing some armor with fantastic Corruption protection in the photo above, but you’d never know it. Instead, I’m slayin’ it with the Pirate Set I was recently given by an NPC. I look rad while still getting all the protections I need for the area of the game I’m working through at the moment. Cool.</p><p>So, just play around with <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>’ transmog until you get something that really suits your vibe. And since you can change it on the fly, you’re not tied down here. If you get tired of a look, switch things up again. You’re the master of your aesthetic now. Go forth and fashion.</p><hr><p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-transmog-alter-equipment-option-change-default-1851787261]]></content:encoded>

                <p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> OG has had a consistently solid player population for months, the mode has been overshadowed by both Reload and Blitz--and so it's only to be expected that Epic would try some new stuff to shake things up. This past weekend's live rocket event has seemingly ushered in the first of these changes, which could be taking the island in a new direction with the mysterious red rifts. And with this latest patch, OG got a retro matchmaking mode with no skill-based matchmaking and no bots.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1950174438562922752" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">OG Duos just went Expert mode!<br>Wanna put your skills to the test? Expert mode has old school matchmaking rules where anyone and everyone could be in your lobby! Good luck ;)</p>  — Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1950174438562922752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>To try out this new version of OG, just select the standard OG mode (<em>not</em> Zero build), and click the group-size dropdown menu, where you'll find a new option at the bottom for Duo (Expert). And don't worry: the regular Duo mode is still available for folks who don't want to wade into this sweatfest.</p><p>While the removal of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) will be celebrated by some, the net effect of its removal is that people who just started playing Fortnite could be matched against pro gamers--which is the reason pro gamers often clamor to get rid of SBMM. This dynamic tends to be less thrilling for normal players, though, who have a better time when they're <em>not</em> constantly being matched with players who have a much higher skill level than they do.</p><p>In this case, however, the removal of SBMM and bots is actually more of a nostalgia play, because Fortnite didn't have either of those things during Chapter 1. So this sort of matchmaking change brings OG more in line mechanically with what it really was back in the day.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is easily one of the best-looking games of the year, and it looks like it's convincing enough to fool Reddit and Discord's age-checking programs. Over in the UK, new online safety rules went live and now require several platforms to verify the age of its various users there. Brits have been getting around that system using a variety of tricks, and as one Dany Sterkhov noted, pretending to be Sam Porter Bridges is a reliable way to trick the system.</p><p>Like other PlayStation first-party games, Death Stranding 2 has a robust photo mode that allows you to easily and quickly strike a pose with the game's protagonist, who is played by actor Norman Reedus. Game director Hideo Kojima used a sophisticated photography rig made up of dozens of cameras to capture every minute detail of the real-life people who provided their likeness for the game's characters, and with photo mode open in Death Stranding 2, simply pointing your smartphone at your display is enough to bypass the security systems.</p><p>What makes this even more impressive is that even if you're asked to make certain facial expressions, you can do that in Death Stranding 2's photo mode easily. As noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Discord and Reddit use their own separate age verification systems, and fooling both of them was remarkably easy. Meanwhile, the UK Government is facing quite a bit of criticism over the introduction of these measures, and it refuses to repeal the Online Safety Act even in the face of petitions that have almost 400,00 people calling for it to be rolled back (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/the-uk-government-say-it-has-no-plans-to-repeal-the-online-safety-act-in-response-to-380-000-strong-and-counting-petition/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p>In other Death Stranding 2 news, more interesting details were revealed about the game and player behavior. Kojima tweeted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/80-of-death-stranding-2-players-who-finished-it-kept-playing-after-the-credits/1100-6533497/" data-ref-id="1100-6533497">almost 80% of the players who finished it kept playing</a>--got to get those five-star SSS connections!--and that people really loved to rescue kangaroos in the post-apocalyptic outback.</p>

Slated to launch later this year, players can try the newly revealed game now via a demo.</p><p>Godbreakers sees players control vessels of humanity summoned by celestial beings to destroy a dangerous AI called the Monad. Accomplishing this involves defeating enemies and absorbing their powers (i.e., jumping inside their bodies, then exploding out of them), and up to four players can battle alongside each other (online only) in fluid, fast-paced hack ‘n’ slash action.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qF4thNOpgSI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qF4thNOpgSI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Each player controls an Archetype, a class of character defined by a unique weapon, traits, and playstyle, such as dual swords, a naginata-like polearm, or a laser cannon. The game includes six different Archetypes for players to experiment with, each with a passive trait tied to their weapon and three unlockable cooldown-based abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>The run-based roguelike features six biomes filled with unique enemies, hazards, and large-scale, multi-phase boss battles. While the game primarily emphasizes mowing down enemies in combat arenas, biomes also feature traversal challenges, and players wield a grappling hook used to pull themselves forward.</p><p>Godbreakers is slated to launch sometime this year for PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam and Epic.&nbsp;The game's demo is now live on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2687400/GODBREAKERS/">Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/29/steal-your-enemys-powers-in-godbreakers-a-new-co-op-action-game-coming-this-year]]></content:encoded>
