			<p>The Bloodborne PC Remaster project received a new update this week, further refining the visual overhaul project with new fixes and improvements.</p>



<p>The 0.89.6 version of the project introduces fixes for objects being in the wrong color or having the wrong lighting, makes some additions to parallax and fixes some remaining bugs found in previous versions. The new version of the project was released alongside a new Reshade Preset, which includes a different type of temporal anti-aliasing that the project creator, fromsoftserve, finds works better in the game. Both the new version of the project and the Reshade preset can be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files">downloaded from Nexus mods</a>.</p>



<p>Together with the launch of the new version of the Bloodborne PC Remaster Project, developer fromsoftserve shared a new video detailing the improvements introduced by the mod, which can be found below. The most notable of them continue to be dynamic shadows, which required the removal of the game's baked lighting and quite a lot of work to get right. The modder's hard work was completely worth it, as the game looks closer to later games developed by FromSoftware with this crucial change.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As the beloved PS4 exclusive developed by FromSoftware has never received an official PC port, the Bloodborne PC Remaster mod is only compatible with the emulated version of the game played via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-0-11-0-unreal-engine-games/">ShadPS4 emulator</a>. You can learn more about the emulator that made the wish of many come true on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

              <p>The latest set of <em>Pokémon TCG&nbsp;</em>cards, Mega Evolution, contains possibly the hardest to pull cards in the card game’s history. While <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-pull-rates-2000629165">our review praised the new era</a> following the end of <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> for a new-found generosity of pull-rates, with a greater chance of getting a gorgeous full-art card, what we couldn’t know at the time was just how close to impossible to was to receive one of the two new gold cards in the set. Now, <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Mega-Evolution-Pull-Rates/40cbeedc-21ce-473b-aef1-74e3969d9f91/">thanks to the fine folks at <em>TCG Player</em></a>, those odds have been revealed. They’re astonishing.</p> <p>As I said in the review, given my dataset was so tiny—50 packs in total, kindly supplied to us by The Pokémon Company—it wasn’t really possible to draw any meaningful conclusions on pull-rates. However, my personal experience saw the chances of getting something beyond a holo were far higher than I’ve seen in years. If you include the Mega Evolved ex cards, it was better than one-in-three. For an Ultra Rare or higher, I was hitting somewhere around one-in-four. It seems I could have been <em>somewhat</em> lucky, given&nbsp;<em>TCG Player</em>‘s final figures based on tearing open an enormous 5,000 booster packs saw that Ultra Rare or higher figure at 19 percent, but the site draws the same conclusion that this is a more generous set than we’ve seen in a good while.</p>

 <p>Unless you’re talking Mega Hyper Rare. That’s the completely daft rarity title given to the set’s brand new type of gold cards, which according to&nbsp;<em>TCGP</em> only appear <strong>once in every 1,260 packs.</strong> That is&nbsp;<em>mindblowing</em>. As the site points out, that means you’d need to open something like 35 booster boxes of packs before you’d likely find only one of either the Mega Lucario or Mega Gardevoir etched foil cards. Given the massively inflated prices for booster boxes of $339, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">thanks to the still-ongoing lack of product being provided by The Pokémon Company</a>, to ensure your odds would cost you $11,865. Oh, and that’s for pulling one of the two. If you’re after a specific one of them, those odds leap to one in 2,520 (or $23,730 worth of packs).</p>

 <p>Obviously, those two gold cards are already fetching high prices in the first week of the set’s launch (in the U.S. only—Mega Evolution has had even worse production issues than other recent sets and is still not available in Europe and other parts of the world). Mega Lucario has a market price at the time of writing of at least $561, while Mega Gardevoir goes for over $480, unsurprisingly making them the two most expensive cards in the set.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630567" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630567"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630567">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Before the set went on sale, it had seemed doubtful that any card could beat the Special Illustration Rare version of the Mega Gardevoir ex for the top spot, least of all a gold card. While gold cards were treasured during the early <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> era of the&nbsp;<em>PTCG</em>, by the end of that run the sheen had very much worn off. The lackluster line art saw interest rapidly drop once they were less of a novelty, and despite their often being more difficult to pull than SIR full-art cards, prices and desire plummeted until TPCi eventually gave up on them entirely at some point during the three years of <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet.&nbsp;</em>A quickly abandoned effort to reboot them as green-and-gold cards went nowhere, and that seemed to be that.</p>

 <p>However, the gold card’s return in Mega Evolution has come with a significant upgrade in quality. Both cards are far more elaborately designed than previous versions, with a much better foil effect, making them aesthetically more appealing. But it’s the recently discovered rarity that’s really driving their prices so wildly high.</p> <p>That’s&nbsp;<em>not</em> a good thing. Sure, if you’re the person who hits that 1 in 1,260 luck with a purchased pack you’re going to be very happy. But any time a particular card starts fetching crazy money causes the issues for the TCG to only get worse. Scalpers swoop down in ever-greater numbers to hold product hostage for ludicrous prices, and any product that <em>does</em> make it to shelves is instantly scooped up by adults investing in the gamble. It’s been near-impossible to buy new packs of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards in stores for coming up on a year now, and a new gold rush will only make this worse. For a hobby that’s meant to be about kids building decks and battling each other in live games, it’s a hell of a bummer.</p>

                <p>With so many studios under one umbrella, Microsoft has one of the biggest back catalogs of game franchises in the industry, if not the biggest. And yet, certain titles stand out among the countless many. In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p6NtohaoBBo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN Japan</a>, Xbox boss Phil Spencer talked about some of the most-requested revivals, among a variety of other topics.</p><p>Spencer noted in the interview that the most highly requested titles from the Microsoft back-catalog are Japanese RPGs <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-dragon/" data-ref-id="5000-24199">Blue Dragon</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lost-odyssey/" data-ref-id="5000-24409">Lost Odyssey</a>, and Western titles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crimson-skies/" data-ref-id="5000-2603">Crimson Skies</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mechassault/" data-ref-id="5000-4349">MechAssault</a>.</p><p>Both Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey are RPGs originally developed by Mistwalker, the studio started by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy/" data-ref-id="5000-3726">Final Fantasy</a> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, formerly of Square Enix. Blue Dragon was Mistwalker's very first project, and featured character designs by Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball, Dragon Quest. Lost Odyssey, meanwhile, featured character designs by Takehiko Inoue (Slam Dunk, Vagabond). Inoue isn't as well known in the West as Toriyama, but both are equally big names in Japan, making these both standout series for Japanese fans.</p><p>Crimson Skies and MechAssault, meanwhile, both originated in the early days of the original Xbox, when Microsoft partnered with FASA, the then-publisher of BattleTech, Shadowrun, and others. Crimson Skies was an action-flight game set in an alternate history version of 1930s America, in which flight is a primary method of transportation and combat. MechAssault is an action-shooter featuring the mechs from BattleTech, and was one of the very first games with Xbox Live functionality.</p><p>As to whether we could see these titles come back, the JRPGs are far more feasible, as Mistwalker is still an active studio and owns both franchises. Regarding the Western titles, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-lead-phil-spencer-reveals-the-4-most-requested-franchise-revivals" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central notes</a> that Microsoft added Crimson Skies to its backwards-compatibility program some years ago, but did not add MechAssault. So while both games seem tied up in rights issues--Topps now owns the rights to FASA's properties--Crimson Skies is the greater possibility. </p><p>In addition to discussing these most-requested franchises, Spencer also talked about the choice to set Forza Horizon 6 in Japan, the most requested setting in the series' 13-year history, which he attributed to the nation's "fantastic" topography. He also spoke briefly about the partnerships Xbox has with Japanese studios for games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/beast-of-reincarnation/" data-ref-id="5000-681579">Beast of Reincarnation</a>, but said that he'd let those teams speak about their projects.</p>

<p>According to director Koshi Nakanishi, who also helmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, he thought that the seventh entry <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/resident-evil/resident-evil-7-was-possibly-too-scary-and-some-people-couldnt-handle-it-says-director-koshi-nakanishi-and-thats-why-resident-evil-9-has-a-third-person-mode-to-make-it-slightly-easier-to-deal-with/">might have been a bit too scary for some</a>. As such, he decided to implement a third-person perspective into Requiem to potentially dial down some of the terror.</p>
<p>In an interesting new development, however, it seems that recent experiences demoing the game at both Gamescom and TGS reveal that Japanese players and Western players have different preferences.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kzhruw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250929d" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denfaminicogamer</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiem-devs-notice-japanese-players-are-more-likely-to-play-in-third-person-westerners-in-first-person/">Automaton</a>), Nakanishi speculates that Western games have a tendency to prefer the first-person perspective due to growing up with FPS games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/doom">DOOM</a>. Japanese gamers, on the other hand, will have spent more time with third-person games like <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn't an exact science, of course, and Nakanishi also thinks that because younger gamers in Japan are playing more first-person games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, the general trend may start to shift. As for us, we're of the mind that third-person Resident Evil games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">RE2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">RE4</a> are generally more enjoyable than the first-person outings.</p>
<p>But what about you? Do you have a preference? Or will you try both and see which one resonates more? Let us know by voting in the below poll and leaving a comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Big changes are rumored to be on the horizon for Xbox Game Pass, including changes to PC Game Pass, a price increase for the Ultimate subscription and cheaper, ad-supported tiers.</p>



<p>The rumors originated on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-big-changes-to-gamepass-including-a-free-cheaper-tier-with-ads.1313263/">ResetERA forums</a> from moderator Slayven, who claimed to have information from an unspecified source that has proved reliable in the past. The timing for all these changes is unclear, although some are reportedly coming next year.</p>



<p>The first big change will be the sunsetting of PC Game Pass, presumably leaving the Ultimate tier as the only way to access the Game Pass library on PC. The price of the Ultimate tier is reportedly increasing to $25 in the United States, although the timing is uncertain, as this price increase could be delayed to 2026.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Pass Core and Standard subscription tiers are reportedly not getting any major change. The two subscription tiers are rumored to be renamed to Game Pass Essential and Game Pass Premium, mirroring the naming for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-plus-to-launch-this-june-premium-subscription-to-give-access-to-classic-ps3-ps2-ps1-and-psp-games/">PlayStation Plus subscription tiers</a>, which sounds like a good marketing move.</p>



<p>The biggest change to Xbox Game Pass, reportedly coming in 2026, however, is the addition of an ad-supported subscription tier. This tier, which could also be offered for free, will be time-based with forced ads.</p>



<p>As there's no way to verify the information revealed in today's report, we have to take these Xbox Game Pass changes with a massive grain of salt. Considering how the gaming market continues to change, however, and how Microsoft has been making changes to the service in recent times, there's a solid chance that something may indeed be brewing as today's rumors suggest.</p>



<p>Discussion regarding Xbox Game Pass has always been heated since the service's launch in 2017, as if these changes are indeed coming, it will only get more heated. Although Microsoft has never disclosed the performance of the service, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-factor-first-party/">it reportedly seems to have been doing well</a>. As such, it's no surprise the company will continue to focus on it for the foreseeable future, as head of Xbox's ID@Xbox program, Chris Charla, confirmed not only that the service is popular among partners, but also that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-making-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-xbox-game-pass/">2025 has marked the company's largest investment in Game Pass to date.</a></p>



<p>More information on Xbox Game Pass, its subscription tiers and the current game library can be found on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games">service's official website.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> arrives on October 10th, but the recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">purchased by new owners</a> EA and DICE have decided not to bother waiting until it's launched to detail their plans for its first few seasonal updates. Two new game modes will be rocking up, followed by a romantic winter getaway in New York.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-preview">first season</a> of free updates to the shooter begins on October 28 with the arrival of the first add-on, Rogue Ops. That'll bring with it Strikepoint, a new four versus four mode about capturing an objective in a fight which only offers you one life per round. There's a fresh map called Blackwell Fields, which is big enough to offer "support for all combat sizes" as well as land and air vehicles, amid the sea of oil derricks in its recently recommissioned California air base. On top of those are a new Armored Personnel Carrier and three new weapons.</p>
<p>Next up's a November 18th update dubbed California Resistance, which brings Sabotage - a new eight versus eight mode. Destroying as many "sites" as possible before the round expires is the goal, with teams swapping between offense and defense. There'll be another new map dubbed Eastwood, which is a "a sleepy, affluent suburb connected to a golf course" into which evil mercenaries Pax Armata have inserted some sleeper agents they've since woken. So, just agents then.</p>
<p>Battle pickups offering the usual powerful weapons that use up quicker than you can say 'bang bang' will also arrive, alongside two more new guns.</p>
<p>Finally, a Winter Offensive will be launched on December 9th, headlined by the Ice Lock limited time event, which is all about freezing your foes. The Empire State map'll get a snowy makeover in lieu of any fresh locations to shoot a virtual person, and you'll be handed an ice axe melee weapon to probably not use for its intended climbing purpose. There's no evidence of any Santa outfit skins so far, lest you think Battlefield's anything other than a serious, grounded shooter with serious, grounded soldiers fighting over serious ground.</p><p>Not 128 serious grounded soldiers at a time though, as was the case in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, with Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-128-players-too-much-for-a-multiplayer-fps-yes-says-battlefield-6">having recently chatted a bit</a> about the call to go back to 64 as the max per-match.</p>

            <p>The Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski has discussed a key plot point in the video game series that was actually a mistake in his novels, but "video game people have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity".</p>
<p>Sapkowski took part in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nuhirk/asynchronous_ama_andrzej_sapkowski_answers/">reddit AMA</a> yesterday, where one user asked for his thoughts on the additional Witcher schools added to the games.</p>
<p>"The issue of 'witcher schools' requires - I apologise - a longer explanation," Sapkowski began. "A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish. I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never.</p>

<p>"However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these 'witcher schools'. Completely unnecessary."</p>
<p>Sapkowski added he was "uncertain about what to do with this situation", and provided a couple of suggestions without confirming which route he'll take.</p>
<p>The path of least resistance, he said, would be to remove the sentence in future editions of The Last Wish, but he may also "expand and clarify the matter somehow in subsequent books". He continued: "Perhaps I'll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals? There are many possibilities, and the sky is the limit."</p><p>The idea of Witcher schools certainly appears core to CD Projekt Red's forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. The game was first teased with an image of a medallion, which the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-confirms-new-witcher-medallion-is-a-lynx">studio later confirmed was shaped after a lynx</a>. This led fans to believe the game would focus on Ciri and a new Witcher school of the Lynx.</p>
<p>Sapkowski was also asked for his thoughts more broadly on adaptations of his work (like the games and Netflix's TV series), which he believes are inherently inferior.</p>
<p>"I'll put it this way: there's the original and then there are adaptations," he said. "Regardless of the quality of these adaptations, there are no dependencies or points of convergence between the literary original and its adaptation. The original stands alone, and every adaptation stands alone; you can't translate words into images without losing something, and there can't be any connections here.</p>
<p>"Moreover, adaptations are mostly visualisations, which means transforming written words into images, and there is no need to prove the superiority of the written word over images, it is obvious. The written word always and decidedly triumphs over images, and no picture - animated or otherwise - can match the power of the written word."</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Sapkowski doesn't listen to the "Toss a Coin to Your Witcher" song very often as he's "not particularly susceptible to songs". And his favourite dinosaur is a Pterodactyl.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">tech demo for The Witcher 4 was shown earlier this year at the State of Unreal stream</a>, though CDPR later confirmed this was simply a tech demo and wouldn't necessarily be indicative of the final game.</p>

<p>Currently slated for release on February 31st 2026 in Japan (cheers to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tokyogamelife.bsky.social">@TokyoGameLife</a> for the heads-up), the dinky box set recreates Link's Hylian Shield, Master Sword, bow, and a bunch of other iconic weapons from the most recent games in the series, in cute, palm-sized, miniature fashion. Heck, each one even comes with its own little stand and everything.</p>

<p>We've had a little browse around this morning, and the collection is out of stock on most hobby shops that ship worldwide already, so you may need to have a proper search if you are interested, and the price has been varying thanks to pre-order offers, between around $30 - $40 (before taxes and delivery costs) or whatever that translates to where you are.</p>
<p>Here's some more details and pics from Bandai (via <a href="https://hobby-genki.com/en/candy-toy-bandai-shokugan-bandai/63956-the-legend-of-zelda-weapon-collection-10pack-box.html">Hobby-Genki</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>・1 Pre-painted Miniature Figure (9 possible types)<br>
・1 Dedicated Display Base (engraved with title logo)<br>
・(Master Sword only) Additional support stand for pairing with Master Sword (Sheathed Ver.)<br>
・(Sheathed Master Sword only) Additional display base<br>
・1 Soda-flavored gum</p>
<p>Lineup (9 Types)<br>
1. Master Sword<br>
2. Hylian Shield<br>
3. Royal Claymore<br>
4. Zora Longsword<br>
5. Seven Jewels Dagger<br>
6. Great Eagle Bow<br>
7. Stonecrusher<br>
8. Lightscale Trident<br>
9. Rare: Master Sword (Sheathed Ver)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>Now, to think of a target small enough to neutralise with a pocket Great Eagle Bow.</p>

            <p>An early copy of this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> patch notes has been accidentally leaked on the official French Borderlands 4 website, giving us a peek at a massive buff for the game's most underwhelming vault hunter.</p>
<p>The leak, <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/fr-FR/borderlands-4/update-notes/">which can be viewed here</a>, remains labelled as the 25th September's patch notes. However, scrolling down provides a substantial list of changes to each of the four playable vault hunters that'll be added to the game later this week. While we don't know when this week we can expect this patch, this leak makes clear that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-best-amon-build">Amon</a> is getting a staggering 66 buffs across all three of his skill trees.</p>
<p>These include bug fixes, so his Primal Surge passive now properly restores shields and ammo, as well as a fix for his Crucible Axes which should now properly detect nearby enemies when used. In addition, Wall of Flame has been changed so Vengeance cannot be triggered by it prior to the activation of Scourge. If this all sounds like a bunch of gibberish, in short this means Amon's kit now works like it's meant to.</p>

<p>Then comes a wave of numerical buffs to various abilities across each of Amon's skill trees. There are too many to dive into them all, but highlights include Scourge's maximum Vengeance being increased by 50 percent allowing Amon to absorb and deal more damage with the whip. The whip got a flat 27 percent damage increase too, which is chunky.</p><p>The Onslaughter action skill has earned itself a 78 percent damage boost which is massive, and it now also can hit enemies equipped with shields more consistently which is a nice bug fix. Also on the same skill tree as the Onslaughter action skill, we've seen both Fellfrost and Fulminating Fist get a 71 percent and 69 percent damage boost respectively. So in short, a good time to be an Amon player.</p>
<p>These buffs and more are expected to drop later this week, and a substantial number of the changes seem to be focused on balancing things out for endgame players. It's worth noting a lot of these changes are giant buffs and bug fixes, while the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-best-vex-build"> popular Vex knife crit build</a> currently melting bosses remains untouched.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is getting a steady stream of patches and updates aimed at polishing the experience post-launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-patch-adds-fov-sliders-somehow-both-improves-and-worsens-stability-at-the-same-time">with prior patches focused largely on improving performance across all platforms</a>.

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new UK game studio has been launched by Tom Stone, former managing director of TT Games - the studio behind the Lego Star Wars, Batman, and Harry Potter games - to create a game based on Peter Pan.</p>
<p>Second Star Games, based in Manchester, comprises industry veterans (including developers from the Lego games) and is in collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity.</p>
<p>And as you may have guessed from the studio name, it's working on a fantasy-adventure game called Neverland: A Peter Pan Adventure, with details expected soon.</p>
<p>The Neverland game is where GOSH comes in - the hospital charity owns the rights to Peter Pan, which were donated by author J.M. Barrie back in 1929.</p>
<p>As such, royalties from all sales of the game will go to GOSH Charity, raising funds to help treat seriously ill children across the UK.</p>
<p>While details of the game are yet to be revealed, some concept art has been shared.</p>

<p>"We are delighted to be working with expert partners Second Star Games to bring the magical world of Neverland to life for a generation of young gamers," said GOSH Charity's senior brand licensing manager Jenny Martin.</p>
<p>"Neverland, a place of adventure and imagination, provides an amazing backdrop to what we know will be a first-class game. What's more, every game sold will help raise funds to support seriously ill children at Great Ormond Street Hospital. We can't wait for this next chapter in our Neverland journey."</p>
<p>Grahame 'Chily' Chilton will be the lead investor in Second Star, following his investment into the first Lego Star Wars game and his previous role on the GOSH Charity fundraising board.</p>

<p>Before this one can blast onto Switch 2 on <strong>20th November</strong>, Nintendo has served up the game's pre-order goodies on <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fkirby-air-riders" rel="sponsored noopener">My Nintendo Store UK</a>. As standard, the listings include a small bonus for <em>all</em> pre-orders and the option to upgrade to a 'bundle' for more merch.</p>
<p>We'll start with the standard option. All My Nintendo Store Air Riders pre-orders (<strong>£58.99</strong> for digital, <strong>£66.99</strong> for physical) will come the <em>exclusive</em> Kirby Air Riders Reusable Cup. That's right, <em>it's a cup</em>. It's adorned with pictures of Kirby, Dedede, Chef Kawasaki et al, and it can hold a whopping 350ml of your hot beverage of choice.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Is it the most mind-blowing addition out there? Absolutely not, but we suppose it's roughly on par with the usual keychains and microfibre cloths included in these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the bundles are a good bit cuter. Upping the price to <strong>£70.99</strong> for a digital copy and <strong>£78.99</strong> for physical, these also throw in a Kirby plushie to sweeten the deal. There are three different plushies to choose between — Warp Star Kirby, Sleepy Kirby and Ultra Sword Kirby — and all are available for the same bundle price on the MNS website.</p>

<p>Both the bonus cup and plushie bundles can now be pre-ordered from the My Nintendo Store UK website, though the extras will only be sticking around "while stocks last", so make sure to get in there quickly if you have a particular purchase in mind.</p>

            <p>Activision have just shown off a bunch of new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>-related stuff as part of a COD Next showcase, and naturally one of the biggest talking points is a simp shooting people through walls. Well, to be more accurate, a clip of a pro player called Simp using the new Gravemaker killstreak reward, which resembles the sorts of wallhacking cheats the publishers have been trying their best to give the secure boot.</p>
<!--more--> <div>

</p></div>
<p>As you can see in the couple of clips I've scattergunned into the walls of this article, Gravemaker grants those who earn it the ability to see the thermal stick figures of other players through whatever layers of brick or concrete might be in the way, before gently popping these targets out of existence with a sniper rifle. I assume you can add a 360 spin into the process too, if you fancy going full 'mother, retrieve the photographic device'. </p>
<p>Gravemaker's immediately proven as controversial as you might expect, with professional codders wondering whether they'll decide on a gentleperson's agreement not to use it in their high-stakes matches. It's also sticking in the craw of some non-pro players, who've recently been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">ordered by Activision to make sure secure boot's enabled on their PC</a> if they want to be able to play Blops 7. The reason the publishers have given for that requirement is an effort to get rid of cheating, which can see offenders gain an unfair advantage by enabling the likes of aimbots or, er, the ability to see and shoot foes through walls.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, Gravemaker isn't a permanent effect someone will have enabled every moment of a match, even if the best of the best may be able to queue a number of short nine shot-long bursts of it up to deploy in quick succession. Since it's part of the game, there's also the opportunity for the perks like cold-blooded or gear to offer built-in countermeasures that'll render you not so much of a sitting duck.</p><div>

</p></div>
<p>There's also the matter of it not being realistic, but given the unlikeliness of tactical nuclear bombs being regularly lobbed at tiny squares in which two little teams are having a timed scrap, that horse arguably bolted from the killstreak stable a while ago.</p>
<p>I think my main issue is that if you're going to offer wonderfully ludicrous killstreaks, you should go all-in and own it. One of the other things shown off during COD Next was a special pickup truck in Blops 7's Zombies mode. It's dubbed Ol’ Tessie, and serves as a shuffling corpse-proof method of transport "through the malevolent fog coating the Dark Aether".</p>
<p>I know you're now deeply ashamed of being known as the Beavis and Butthead shooter, Call of Duty, but stick those two annoying goofs in a similar pickup and have them rage around the map as a killstreak, with anyone who wanders into auditory range of their sniggers starting to lose health. Have Stan from American Dad transform into a dragon and hand the enemy team bows and Dragonshouts so they're forced to go full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> for a minute. Have a horde of Squid Game characters roam around with instakill baseball bats, and if they get five kills during one streak, the rest of the match features the audio backdrop of a helium-huffing Morgan Freeman reading the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau backwards.</p>
<p>Embrace your calling as not-quite-Fortnite. That's all I, someone who has a comically little amount of skin in the game, ask. Anyway, here's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/30/call-of-duty-next-2025-recap/">a full recap</a> of Cod Next's other major announcements. Blops 7's open beta kicks off this weekend, with pre-orderers and certain Game Pass subscribers able to hop in from October 2nd, while everyone else has to wait until October 5th.</p>

            <p>A stealth patch to Prototype has stoked the fires of hope surrounding a remaster of the beloved third-person gory super hero action game, thanks to some mysterious additions to the games' credits. It also broke a bunch of mods in the process, unfortunately.</p>
<p>The patch, which was introduced on the 29th September, came without prior warning nor any fanfare, with the game receiving no Steam news post to coincide with the update. Instead, Prototype's loyal community had to dig in and figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>These players discovered a real surprise when they hit the game's credits, as several new companies' now appear. This includes staff at Iron Galaxy, the Activision-owned developer that previously worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, as well as the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. There's also a mention of a Ubisoft Connect Version, which does not exist.</p>

<p>Further digging was done by some of the game's better known modders and dataminers, who delved into the game post-update for further discoveries. User Nixson discovered locomotion and parkour tests previously absent from the game, which indicate some degree of fresh testing being done in-game. These findings were then<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/"> posted on the Prototype Reddit</a>, where remaining fans gathered in excitement.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jxhctt/upcoming_call_of_duty_black_ops_7_leaks_and/">Rumours surrounding a Prototype remaster have been circulating since earlier this year</a>, though further breadcrumbs have been absent ever since. So while this patch has reignited hype around a potential Prototype remaster, a sad side effect is that mods for the game appear to have been broken by this update. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/prototype/mods/52">crucial mods like PrototypeFix</a>, which resolves crashing issues on modern hardware, have been updated and now work without issue.</p>
<p>If you've not played Prototype, why not check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prototype-review">Eurogamer's old Prototype review</a>. In it, Tom Bramwell wrote: "Prototype is a game of riotous, gore-splattering ultraviolence. That's all it wants to be, and in many respects it does a solid, and often spectacular job. The victims may be plot, atmosphere and the difficulty curve, but then great power always comes at a cost."</p>

Shortly after updating their ocean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> story <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soma-devs-frictional-release-video-of-something-new-aka-their-nice-hotel-game-in-which-nothing-awful-will-happen">Soma</a> with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amnesia-creators-frictional-are-teasing-what-could-be-soma-2-through-a-sinister-luxury-hotel-website">an in-game teaser</a> - an old-school marketing ARG! By gar, it's been a while - Amnesia developers Frictional have put out a brief untitled video of "something new". It's a series of perspectives of what I assume is their new game's science fiction setting. To adopt the appropriate Jungian terminology, it looks creepy as balls. I am looking forward to this soma-ch. Without further ado, that trailer.

<p>
You might recognise the setting from the <a href="https://www.hotelsamsara.com/">weirdo luxury hotel website</a> featured in the previous teaser. The website's About section describes the hotel as follows: "Since time immemorial mankind has dreamt of the stars and what lies beyond. Now LuxuryNext is prepared to deliver on that promise. Introducing, Hotel Samsara. A place like no other. A promise like no other. Exclusive. Luxurious. In Samsara, wishes will come true. Interested in investing?" 
</p>
<p>
A slapdash inventory of things seen and heard in the teaser: floating flecks, fidgeting shadows, artful flourescent ceiling lights and corner moulding, cables, barcodes, cushioned walls, folding metal shutters, biohazard symbols, blood. Also an echoing, ethereal voice that sounds like it's coming from a speaker. I can't quite make out what the voice is saying, but it sounds like the closing words are "no sense". Yes, more of this please. Sense is overrated.
