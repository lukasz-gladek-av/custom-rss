			<p>While the rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster has finally been proven to be real, it will take some time to learn more about the Fallout 3 remaster that was revealed at the same time as the soon-to-be-released remaster.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remaster of the third entry in the series, which was revealed via an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing</a> besides the Oblivion remaster, saying that it will be a while before we see it, without providing any additional information. If Microsoft and Bethesda stick to the timeframes detailed back in 2023, we should be seeing more of the Fallout 3 remaster in around two years or so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It'll be a while before we see it.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1912227284511273452?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As already mentioned, the existence of a Fallout 3 remaster is essentially a given at this point, with the confirmation that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is real and possibly coming very soon. Following weeks of rumors and speculation, the first few screenshots of the remaster leaked online <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">yesterday</a> via the official website of the developer who was long rumored to be working on it, Virtuos. Unfortunately, we still don't know if the remaster will sport gameplay improvements besides the visual upgrade powered by Unreal Engine 5, but thankfully it won't be long to see if and how the experience will have been improved, as the remaster is said to be released next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Later this year, we'll also get the fan-made Oblivion-to-Skyrim port called Skyblivion, and the team lead has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the official remaster.</p>

            <p>Developers InnerSloth and Schell Games have announced the release date of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> 3D on PC.</p>
<p>The upcoming 3D release of the space-set social deduction game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-3d-announced-demo-out-next-week">first announced in February of this year</a>, but with that all important release date missing. That has changed now, however, with confirmation Among Us 3D launches on PC via Steam on 6th May.</p>
<p>"MARK IT IN YOUR CALENDARS," the Among Us team proclaimed on social media, with a confident use of caps lock. "3D BEANS COMING TO UR SCREENS SOON AAAAAA."</p>

<p>As to what players can expect on Among Us 3D's release, well, it'll be pretty much just like the Among Us that blew up in popularity during 2020, but with an extra dimension.</p>
<p>"In this party game, Crewmates work together to complete tasks before one or more Impostors kill everyone aboard. Experience all of the same deception and deceit as the original Among Us in all three dimensions," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">reads the game's Steam page description</a>.</p>

<p>Away from games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-sci-fi-social-deduction-is-getting-the-animated-adaptation-treatment">Among Us is being turned into an animated series</a>. On its announcement, we were given a general overview that read: "Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone. Root out the 'Impostor' or fall victim to its murderous designs."</p>
<p>Since then, famous faces such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-animation-cast-rounded-out-with-jurassic-park-ratatouille-talent">Elijah Wood, Wayne Knight and Ashley Johnson have been announced as voicing various crewmembers</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Niantic has made 68 employees redundant as part of its company restructuring process <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">following the sale of its gaming portfolio to Monopoly Go maker Scopely - a deal worth $3.5bn</a>.
</p>
<p>
The deal has seen Scopely become owner of Niantic games <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-now">Monster Hunter Now</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a>, and the new employer of the teams that work on those titles. 
</p>
<p>
These layoffs, meanwhile, come from the remaining staff at Niantic working on other projects, as the organisation slims down and effectively rebrands as a startup, named Niantic Spatial.
</p>
<p>
Niantic had previously warned of job losses among its remaining team as part of this process. Now, as detailed in a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/niantic-is-laying-off-68-employees-after-selling-its-game-business-for-3-5-billion">Game Developer</a>, we know how many.
</p>
<p>
The company has declined to comment further about the job losses.
</p>
<p>
Niantic Spatial will focus on a refreshed version of Niantic's original core interest - creating a digital map of the planet, now using geospatial AI. The newly-rebranded company has secured $250m of capital investment, $50m from Scopely and $200m from Niantic's own balance sheet in order to move forward.
</p>
<p>
"We're in the midst of seismic changes in technology, with AI evolving rapidly," Niantic founder John Hanke wrote recently on Niantic Spatial's focus. "Existing maps were built for people to read and navigate but now there is a need for a new kind of map that makes the world intelligible for machines, for everything from smart glasses to humanoid robots, so they can understand and navigate the physical world.
</p>
<p>
"Today's LLMs represent the first step towards a future where a variety of expert models collaborate to reason and understand complex problems, and many of those problems will require deep and accurate knowledge of the physical world. Niantic is building the models that will help AI move beyond the screen and into the real world."
</p>
<p>Eurogamer recently travelled to a major Pokémon Go fan event in Italy, held shortly after the sale was announced, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amidst-pokemon-gos-35bn-sale-fans-flock-to-italys-first-major-meetup-with-mix-of-emotions-over-games-future">heard of players' mixed emotions regarding Scopely now being in charge</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Here at Wccftech, we have followed the long development of the Skyblivion project for <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over eight years</a>. For nearly a decade, an ambitious team of modders has strived to recreate The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Ever since early 2023, we have known that the team was <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting 2025</a> as their tentative release window for the total conversion mod. Later that year, though, the infamous FTC vs. Microsoft trial leak <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Bethesda had plans to make an official Oblivion remaster (as well as a Fallout 3 one, interestingly).</p>
<p>I was already in touch with Skyblivion project lead Rebelzize, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-remix-qa-with-skyblivion-lead-dev-hopes-dreams-and-worries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having interviewed him</a> in late 2022 about the modding and remastering potential of NVIDIA's RTX Remix platform. Needless to say, I immediately reached out again to gauge his reaction to that leak. Back then, though, he didn't really buy that it was true. I pointed out those were official documents, so the project might have been canceled or delayed, but it was surely in existence at some point.</p>
<p>For a while, it&nbsp;<span>seemed like the Oblivion remaster might have been canceled. Throughout 2024, there were no further leaks or rumors. Everything changed in 2025, though, as the first concrete leaks appeared,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a>&nbsp;that Virtuos had worked on it using Unreal Engine 5. Over the last few weeks, insiders have begun&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a> that Microsoft could be planning a shadow drop—a game announcement and release at the same time—</span>at some point in April.</p>
<p>At last, visual evidence of Oblivion Remastered <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">materialized yesterday</a> when fellow Internet sleuths found the game's first screenshots on the developer's website. Just a couple of hours later, Skyblivion lead Rebelzize <a href="https://x.com/rebelzize/status/1912175393148199140?s=46&amp;t=iYm9jOtB1G3D9hHCMqQ8dw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared a brief comment on X</a>, having dealt with the fact that it was all real:</p>
<p><em>The real remake is the friends we made along the way.</em></p>
<p><em><span>To be clear, this changes nothing for me. This always was a passion project and still is until the end. For the community, it is a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year.</span><span> All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster.</span></em></p>
<p><iframe title="SKYBLIVION Live Development Stream[LIKING THE STREAM IS APPRECIATED]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-ZsA-zHUJk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Later yesterday, I spoke briefly with him to get an expanded reaction:</p>
<p><em>It looks like a cool take on it and totally different than what my vision was. Looking forward to trying it myself. Luckily, this thing was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all. Gonna focus on the release of our own version and stay positive.</em></p>
<p>For what it's worth, I think there's definitely space for both Skyblivion and Oblivion Remastered. The former might not be as visually impressive (although I'm sure at least some of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-with-community-shaders-add-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Skyrim graphics features</a> can be ported to it), but it will feature both cut content and new content, as well as other gameplay changes. From what we know of the official remaster based on the leaks, there should be some gameplay changes to make it more modern, but no restored or new content. As Rebelzize put it, users can choose between two versions of Oblivion, and that can only be a good thing. By the way, I've also asked him whether the plan is still to launch in 2025, and the answer was yes.</p>

Better take the new weapon the developers are also adding in this update: the Inferno pistol.

<p>You're off to this dusty ruin to pick up a reluctant Tech-Priest who has refused to evacuate. But of course the spiky-limbed Trygon is going to make that difficult. "It bursts from the ground to unleash devastating assaults with its scything claws and bio-electric attacks," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500569576639038653">an update post</a> from developers Saber Interactive.</p>
<p>They've also added that new handgun, the Inferno pistol, to both PvE and PvP modes, a "close-range thermal weapon" that can be used by four of the game's marine classes: Assault, Vanguard, Sniper and Heavy. And to make multiplayer PvP a little spicier, they've also opened up other weapons to classes who previously couldn't use them. The Sniper class can now use the Heavy Bolt Pistol and Instigator Bolt Carbine, for example. </p>
<p>There's a small cloister of other stuff. You can now host private multiplayer lobbies, there are some new wolfish skins to buy, alogside new shades of blue and pink to spraypaint onto your little space fascists. You can read <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/191-7-0-patch-notes">the full patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p>Before you go bug hunting, let me do a little lore research. Ah, yes, here we go. "The Trygon is a colossal serpentine creature whose iron-hard carapace is proof against all but the heaviest of weapons and whose giant talons can scythe through even the most formidable battle-tank," reads a description of the creature on <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/Tyranid-Trygon">Warhammer's website</a>. Good to clear things up. For me, a "Trygon" sounds like a shape you've never heard of but are asked to draw on graph paper in a high school entrance exam.  </p>
<p>As you can probably tell, I'm not a big Warhammer dude. Although I did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">review Space Marine 2</a> and found it to be a pretty decent third-person insect repellant, with some well-crafted environments and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-bloody-battles-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-make-for-a-great-photo-mode">great photo mode</a>. Edwin had some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">more nuanced thoughts</a> on its depiction of goosestepping masculinity, worth a read even if, like me, you approach your blockbuster games with bubblegum-chewing aloofness, always ready to spit it out the moment all the flavour is gone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last month, "Mark Corrigan's Oblivion" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> got a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-getting-a-barber-mode-and-by-golly-i-hope-i-can-actually-be-a-barber">free barber mode update</a>, and now with yesterday's release of <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2-4">Patch 1.2.4</a>, you can finally have those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>barbers shave Henry of Skalitz boiled butter bean bald. Did baldness signify nail-hard bastardry in medieval times, or simply some kind of maledicted scalp leprosy? Hopefully it's the former. Henry'll need to look tough to survive the new Hardcore mode.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first casualty of this set of difficulty modifiers is Henry's sense of direction. You'll no longer know exactly where you are on the map, and your compass won't show cardinal directions either. Instead, you'll have to ask NPCs where you are to get your bearings, and look to the heavens to guide your way. No fast travel, either.</p>
<p>There's a selection of 10 negative perks to choose before you start the game, of which you'll have to pick three. For example, you can give Henry a chance to throw his back out while picking herbs, a personal favourite for how mundane and insulting it is. The underground herb economy isn't what it used to be either - the patch also promises a rebalance so "they never sell for a higher price than their buying price". Tracking down a full list of the perks has been a little tricky, but here's an <a href="https://imgur.com/a/kcd2-hardcore-mode-perks-tXGwZsn">Imgur gallery with just that</a>.</p>
<p>There's also no combat UI, enemies are more aggressive, and if you get branded for going on a crime spree, there's a perk that makes the brand permanent. I like the sound of it overall. There's a few instances of flat number tweaking, but I can see things having to ask NPCs for directions make the world feel absorbingly textured. I've actually been waiting for this patch to have a proper playthrough. If you don't fancy any of this, the hardcore medieval roleplayers over at Nexusmods are <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/kingdomcomedeliverance2">already cooking up fixes</a> for basically everything interesting about the new mode. What are they like, eh!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>FromSoftware has revealed another new playable character in its forthcoming co-op spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>.</p>
<p>Raider is a powerful barbarian warrior in typical style, wearing a fur cloak and horned helmet while wielding a gigantic axe for slow but mighty attacks.</p>
<p>He looks to be a strength build, then, in contrast to the more nimble previously revealed characters. Yet he has a fierce ultimate ability that benefits all players.</p>

<p>The trailer for Raider shows him screaming with rage to summon a pillar of rock from the ground. This can then be clambered up by all characters.</p>
<p>From there we see the archer Ironeye sniping at a boss from above, while Raider himself leaps off for a plunging axe swipe.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is yet to reveal all of Raider's abilities, but it's easy to see how he'll fit neatly into the roster of playable characters.</p>
<p>The final game will include eight Nightfarers to choose from and so far six have been revealed.</p>
<p>The network test included the all-rounder Wylder, the tanky Guardian, the magic-wielding Recluse, and the rogue-like Duchess. Then, earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-elden-ring-nightreign-playable-character-revealed">sniping Ironeye was revealed</a>.</p>
<p>Still, eagle-eyed fans spotted both Raider and Ironeye in the game's initial trailer, though their names and abilities were unknown.</p>
<p>One other yet-to-be-revealed character can be seen too: she's in gold armour and wields a katana with golden magic. Perhaps that hints at a Faith build?</p>
<p>That leaves one unknown character left. What kind of build are you hoping for?</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign will be released on 30th May across PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One.</p>

			<p>A couple of weeks ago, Jagex <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-is-a-co-op-open-world-survival-crafting-game-due-soon-in-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> RuneScape: Dragonwilds, an open world survival crafting game set in its beloved fantasy universe. The UK developer said back then that the Steam Early Access launch would launch sometime in Spring but did not provide a specific date. It was, therefore, surprising to see the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become available without any further announcements on Valve's store</a> a few hours ago, priced at £24.99 GBP / $29.99 / €29.99.</p>
<p>Jesse America, Executive Producer of this game, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We’re so excited to surprise players with our Early Access launch today and invite them to discover the magical world of RuneScape: Dragonwilds right now. We’ve been working hard to develop an entirely new type of RuneScape experience that ignites fans’ passion, creativity and love for questing, and provide them with an all-new RuneScape adventure to discover. And this is just the start of our development journey. Throughout Early Access, we’ll be updating the game regularly with new content and features, while listening closely to the community to deliver an iconic open world survival crafting game that is loved equally by our biggest RuneScape fans and new players alike. Our community is at the heart of everything we do at Jagex and we look forward to seeing how they shape RuneScape: Dragonwilds throughout our Early Access journey.</em></p>

<p>So far, early user reception seems quite positive. The average user review score is 79% for the time being. Jagex also outlined the Early Access roadmap. There will be constant improvements to the following areas: combat, performance, multiplayer, difficulty, lighting, weather, messaging, and tutorials. New magic, ranged, and farming skills will be introduced, as well as new quests, gear, lore, music, animals, and a new enemy type, the lesser dragons. Moreover, the base building mechanics will be expanded, and the Hardcore and Creative modes will be added. Last but not least, a whole new region called Fellhollow will be introduced.</p>
<p>This zone is said to be suspended between life and death. A twisted dragon called Imaru is its overlord, and various undead enemies will populate Fellhollow. Players will be guided here by Death, a well-known character to RuneScape fans.</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida is being immortalised in pixel form thanks to Bionic Bay.</p>
<p>Bionic Bay is an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-day-of-the-devs-2024-indie-games-showcase">upcoming "precision-puzzle platformer" that casts players as a scientist</a>. It's coming from developers Mureena Oy and Psychoflow Studio, and is all set in an "ancient bio-mechanical world" which has been "hand-crafted pixel by pixel to create a high-fidelity, atmospheric environment". The game is set to release across both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida may have now left PlayStation</a>, his legacy will certainly live on, and the former exec has now been announced as an unlockable character skin. Not only that, he even has his own "special" level.</p>

<p>Writing on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/14/the-making-of-hand-crafted-pixel-art-platformer-bionic-bay-out-april-17-on-ps5/">PlayStation blog</a>, Bionic Bay creative director Juhana Myllys said the team was "ecstatic" to reveal its collaboration with Yoshida.</p>
<p>Yoshida's level will be available via the upcoming game's online challenge mode. "If you take part and beat Shu's score, you can even unlock our Shu skin," the developer wrote.</p>
<p>This skin, once unlocked, will allow players to customise the look of their scientist for Bionic Bay's online leaderboards. You can see how it looks via the image below.</p>
<p>Following a slight delay, Bionic Bay will release tomorrow, 17th April.</p>

			<p>Surprisingly, Rusty Rabbit isn’t a game about a malfunctioning toy for adults. Instead, it’s the tale of Rusty Stamp, a loveable, Wolverine-voiced, floppy eared scamp, who pilots his mech to dig through ancient tunnels on a mission to uncover valuable scrap.</p>
<p>Best described as a 2D Metroidvania, Rusty Rabbit has the labyrinthine maps to explore most associated with the genre. However, each map is divided into numerous dungeons, with plenty of teleporters to return Rusty to his garage. Here Rusty can tinker with his mech, turning all that loot he’s been gathering into new upgrades; bigger guns, rocket boosters, better drills, you get the idea. Due to the segmented structure of its dungeons, along with ample save points, Rusty Rabbit is nice and accessible, making it an ideal for Metroidvania newcomers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rusty Rabbit | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5mMlvJmu0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Rusty spends most of his time drilling through blocks to progress through a level. Initially this is rather dull, our hero forced to demolish blocks one at a time in a dreary fashion. To be honest, this state of affairs goes on rather too long, and the pacing of the game suffers as a result. However, stick with it and the game will open up, allowing Rusty to set off chain reactions to satisfyingly destroy vast swathes of blocks, or boost himself like a rocket through walls of scrap, the controller vibrating as the player steers Rusty like a guided missile. This makes for some enjoyable puzzles that tickle the brain pleasantly, even if all too often your objective is little more than ‘find the key card to open the door’.</p>
<p>Story-wise this is charming stuff, Rusty is an engaging lead, chatting away to the player like a classic film noir Private Investigator. Sometimes he can be too verbose, taking an age to explain even the simplest situations, particularly when recounting his unlockable series of backstory monologues. Still, hammering the skip button will soon see you through the most wearisome moments. Where the script and story glows are in the character interactions between Rusty and the loveable band of treasure-hunting bunnies he meets on his expeditions. An eccentric yet endearing gang of misfits, the way they melt Rusty’s stone-cold heart over the course of the game is surprisingly moving.</p>


<p>Combat is Rusty Rabbit’s weak point. Fighting Rust Bots mostly amounts to little more than Rusty standing in front of his foe, the player holding down the button until their death occurs. It’s very difficult to discern if Rusty has been hit or not, the only visual reaction being the slow depletion of his health bar. All of the dynamic movement and momentum of the exploration is lost, resulting in static and tedious fisticuffs.</p>
<p>Matters are made worse by how much combat Rusty Rabbit forces upon you, demanding you clear an area of enemies before being allowed to finally leave. You’d think gunplay would improve matters, but most of the cannons are so ineffectual that they go unused, resulting in all-too-frequent combat that is a trudge to get through. Thankfully, combat is easy, so you won’t get stuck, you just won’t have much fun getting through it.</p>
<p>Overall though, there’s plenty here to keep you playing, with dashings of charm, some great exploration, engaging puzzle solving, and a welcome gentle difficulty to see you hopping though to the game’s conclusion.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Rusty Rabbit is good, simple, rather old-school, fun. Sure, the flat and uninspired combat means this Bunny lacks a bit of hop, but it still bounds along at a gentle pace, providing a satisfying Metroidvania without the insurmountable difficulty of others in the genre.	</p></div>

			<p>As we get closer to the game's launch date, publisher 505 Games and developer MercurySteam are posting regular new Blades of Fire trailers focused on different areas of the single player action/adventure title. The latest one dives into combat, which is a major part of the game.</p>
<p><em>Weapons are split into three categories: slashing, piercing, and blunt types, with some weapons having the option of swapping between both slashing and piercing. To ensure you're using the</em><br>
<em>right weapon for the job, check the enemy's outline for their weak points and cycle through your equipped weapons. Fighting with the right weapon and targeting an enemy's weak points ensures that you'll make quick work of all those you come up against.</em></p>
<p><em>Make use of the terrain by sticking to the higher ground to gain the advantage in battle. Adso is also here to assist. He will analyze and document every enemy you encounter, recording all the details in his chronicle. The more you face each enemy type, the more detailed Adso's notes will become, revealing their lore and better strategies to defeat them. Defeating a certain number of enemies wielding the same weapon will unlock that weapon's forging scroll. Once the scroll is collected, the new weapon will be ready for you to forge, thus further improving your arsenal.</em></p>

<p>At GDC 2025, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-a-pleasant-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went hands-on with Blades of Fire</a> and came away with a positive first impression of the game:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn’t on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It’s just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven’t seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I’d still be on board for crafting a massive war hammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies.</em></p>
<p>Blades of Fire will be available on PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X starting May 22. You can read the full system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <p>It seems some retailers in the US will open up <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> pre-orders as soon as next week.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Nintendo made the unprecedented decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">delay its Switch 2 pre-orders</a> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">both the US and Canada</a>, stating this was "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions". Pre-orders in both countries were initially planned to go live on 9th April.</p>

<p>Nintendo did not give details as to when it expected to open pre-orders following this decision, merely stating it would update timings "at a later date". However, the ever-reliable Billbill-kun of Dealabs has now said Switch 2 pre-orders in the US will begin soon, with some retailers starting next week.</p>
<p>According to Billbill-kun, pre-orders for Switch 2 consoles will go live on either 21st April or 30th April, "depending on retailer". They did not specifically mention any outlet by name. Additionally, Billbill-kun reports pre-orders for Switch 2 accessories such as the Pro controller will kick off on 30th April.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has messaged Nintendo for further information. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Billbill-kun reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-delayed-canadian-preorders-reportedly-beginning-next-week">Canadian Switch 2 pre-orders could start from 23rd April</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss Doug Bowser said the US administration's trade tariffs - which had heavily impacted some of the company's key manufacturing locations around the world - had posed a "challenge" for the company, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">was something Nintendo was "going to have to address"</a>.</p>
<p>Despite a temporary pause on some tariffs since then, the situation has remained uncertain amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-appears-to-backtrack-on-us-electronics-tariff-exceptions-but-no-one-seems-to-know-exactly-whats-going-on">confusing messaging around potential electronics exceptions</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/15/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-gets-graphical-updates-versus-modes-multiple<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Though most Capcom fighting fans are looking ahead to next month's arrival of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="254c61b7-b9ae-4243-b832-89ef551d2039" href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/15/revisiting-forgotten-friends">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>, the publisher is showing that it will continue to support its existing compilations. Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics arrived last September on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC before arriving on Xbox One in February, but that isn't stopping Capcom from improving the library of included games months later.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, players will be able to download a free title update for Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics. The update will improve specific elements of select games and deliver several overall tweaks and bonuses to the bundle. Most notably, the free title update adds Versus mode to all six of the fighting titles. Additionally, Capcom has provided updated options for how you access the menu to avoid accidentally triggering it mid-match. You'll also be able to reset your current game straight from the pause menu. All of these updates mentioned so far will also be added to Capcom Fighting Collection and Capcom Fighting Collection 2.</p>

<p>This update also adds new artwork from Capcom artist Shinkiro, plus new Cap-Jam remixed songs. Meanwhile, X-Men vs. Street Fighter now allows players to select from multiple versions to experiment with different balancing and gameplay. Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes receives graphical and resolution enhancements via this free title update. Check out the specifics through the trailer below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4zTTwFVmrLk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics gathers seven of Capcom's collaborations with Marvel, including six fighting games and one beat 'em up. The full list includes X-Men Children of the Atom, Marvel Superheroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Superheroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, and The Punisher.</p>

<p>This update to Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will be available tomorrow, April 16, across all platforms. For more on Capcom's recent fighting-game collections, check out our hands-on preview of the upcoming Capcom Fighting Collection 2 <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="254c61b7-b9ae-4243-b832-89ef551d2039" href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/15/revisiting-forgotten-friends">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/report/2025/04/15/screenshots-of-the-rumored-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-have-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Screenshots from the unannounced but heavily rumored remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion have leaked online. Apparently, fans unearthed the images by digging through the website of the game’s reported developer, Virtuos Games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The images, which have now been circulated on social media by popular accounts such as <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1912121397867872406">Wario64</a>, various forums like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/?rdt=35724">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/">ResetEra</a>, and have been uploaded to image galleries like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">Imgur</a>, depict several before/after screenshots comparing the original game to its updated visuals. Various pieces of key art, including an image of the game’s Deluxe Edition and its contents, have also surfaced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-images-leak-from-developer-website">IGN</a> </em>noted, Virtuos’ website is currently down at the time of publishing. It’s been heavily reported that the studio is developing the remaster alongside Bethesda’s Dallas and Rockville studios, per <em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-screens-and-details-have-leaked/">Video Games Chronicle</a></em>. The game will reportedly feature both visual and gameplay enhancements/changes to the 2006 open-world RPG. Virtuos has generally served as a support studio for numerous titles, having previously worked with Obsidian on The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition and other remasters such as Batman: Return to Arkham.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A remaster of Oblivion has been rumored for some time, dating back to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/19/leaked-microsoft-doc-indicates-xbox-is-working-on-oblivion-remaster-fallout-3">leaked Microsoft documents</a> that surfaced during the company’s 2023 FTC trial (itself three years old when it was leaked), stating the project was in the works. Speculation has ramped up in recent weeks, with reports from various journalists and <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1900277200592548120">online leakers</a> claiming inside sources pointed at an April launch for the game and that it will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC alongside Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was already quite a bit of smoke to this fire, and today’s leaks would all but confirm the Oblivion remaster’s existence. Bethesda and Virtuos have not responded to the situation at the time of publishing. We’ve contacted Bethesda and Xbox for comment and will update this story with a response should we receive one.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/15/dune-awakening-delayed-to-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dune: Awakening has been delayed. The upcoming MMO based on the popular sci-fi universe was originally scheduled to arrive on May 20.</p>

<p>Developer Funcom explains the delay will allow the team to address feedback provided by players following the Persistent Closed Beta. As such, the game will now launch on June 10, with a head start beginning on June 5.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Dune: Awakening is a beast of a game,” says Funcom in a statement. “This is multiplayer survival on a massive scale, and we’re making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before. We want to make sure we stick the landing.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Funcom also explains that the delay allows them to host a large-scale beta weekend next month that will host even more players. The team plans to share more information about this beta soon.</p>

<p>You can read Funcom’s complete statement&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/DuneAwakening/status/1912144059843379626">posted to X</a> below (click the image to enlarge).&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Dune: Awakening was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamescom-2022/2022/08/23/dune-is-getting-an-open-world-mmo">first revealed</a> during Gamescom 2022 and is an open-world survival-focused MMO. The game takes place in an alternate timeline to the recent films as players must work together to survive Arrakis by crafting resources, architecture, and locating water. Despite its multiplayer nature, Funcom promises to deliver a cinematic storyline with Dune’s lore permeating the experience through server-wide politics and intrigue. The game allows for multiple approaches to getting ahead, whether amassing political power, controlling the Spice trade, or simply acting as a scouter to map out the world and sell that information to players. You can learn more by reading our extended preview from last year <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/03/04/spicing-things-up">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dune: Awakening will be available for PC via Steam on June 10, with PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions planned to launch sometime afterward.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>More than 100 notes to collect and read in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> are scattered throughout its 14 chapters. That might seem like a lot, but if you follow this and every other chapter guide I've posted so far, you'll see how it's straightforward to pick each one up along the way as you play through the game.</p>
<p>And you'll want to grab them all because South of Midnight's storytelling, including these written notes, is by far the strongest part of the game.</p>
<p>There are another 10 notes to collect in Chapter 6. Here's where to find them all.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Chapter 6 doesn't give you much of a break compared to Chapter 5, as this chapter has 10, instead of 11, notes to pick up. As you'll see below, at least a few of them are clumped together.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Keep Out Sign Materials</strong> - A little ways into the chapter, after using an echo of a crashed boat to jump across a river; you'll find the first note of the chapter on a box to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Abernathy's Lament</strong> - You'll find this note on the second level of the barn you go through to find the hole for Crouton to enter and get rid of the Stigma Knot blocking your path. To get there, you'll need to enter through the roof, which you can do by heading back the way you came through the barn, where an echo of a wagon is sitting and waiting to your left, behind a couple of trees trapped together with vines. Use the wagon to jump onto the roof of the barn, and through a hole in the roof you'll reach the second level which contains a health filament and the note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burn After Reading</strong> - Once you see Bunny's cottage, before you walk through the gates you'll see a path to your left that leads to a combat encounter. Once you've cleared it, as you head back to Bunny's cottage you'll find this note resting on a box between two rocks to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Correction Requested</strong> - After walking through the gates to Bunny's cottage, walk around to the back of the cottage to find a large tree in her backyard and a small cabin to the right of the tree. Walk past the cabin and you'll see some sunflowers next to crates of honey, with the note resting on a honey crate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Notes on the Rogarou</strong> - You won't find this note, or the next three, until after completing the three combat encounters to get into Bunny's cottage. Thankfully, this note and the next three are all inside the cottage, so you're clearing through a bunch quickly. This first one is on a table in the room to your right once you walk in the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Bunny's Journal - On Weavers</strong> - This note is in Bunny's bedroom on the second floor, on Bunny's left bedside table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Notes on Dreams and Fog</strong> - This note is also in Bunny's bedroom on the second floor, on Bunny's right bedside table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Missing Children List</strong> - You'll find this note in the secret room behind the bookshelf in Bunny's bedroom, on a desk towards the back of the secret room, to the left of where you'll see Huggin' Molly's red yarn.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrowers Hate a Liar</strong> - After the cutscene with Bunny, and once you're in your new duds, follow the path away from the cottage and beyond a few exploding mushrooms. You'll find this note in a dead tree on the right side of the path.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Huggin' Molly Sightings</strong> - After speaking to Catfish, follow the path beyond some more exploding mushrooms to the point where you'll see two paths. One that leads you to the tree Catfish was talking about by using your grapple, and the other to your left with the echo of a bridge. Take the left path to find another combat encounter, and once you've cleared it, you'll find this note on a box to your right as you exit the combat arena.</p>
<p>And that's all the notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 6. You should have 38 out of 103 by now. Only 65 more to go.</p>

I feel like all I've been seeing the past few days is people asking if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will be the game that finally brings extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> into the mainstream. No one seems to be quite sure, mostly because it isn't done or out yet. The thing is, it's not the only extraction shooter due out this year that'll put that question to the test, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is one the way still too. It comes from former Battlefield devs after all, who have found success with their other shooter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>. And earlier today, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/embark-studios">Embark Studios</a> announced that another playtest for Arc Raiders is on the way this month.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Signing up for the playtest is pretty simple on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Steam</a>, you just have to head to the game's page and request access to the beta. The test itself is running from April 30 to May 4. Not everyone will be able to try it out, I should note, it's luck of the draw, but if you're feeling lucky and you're curious as to whether extraction shooters can make it mainstream, it's worth a shot.

In a press release Embark shared that they've taken on a bunch of feedback from the last test, implementing a bunch of "tweaks and improvements." They've also added in more Arc enemies (evil robots that have taken over most of the world), as well as weapons and gear. Player progression and crafting systems are apparently "deeper" now too, and there'll be a preview of what the game's battle pass will be like.
</p>
<p>
I like the vibes of Arc Raiders a lot. Bit of a stereotypical "humans are in hiding in tiny settlements because robots have wrecked the planet" kind of premise, though it looks good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCooWm-PDs&amp;ab_channel=ARCRaiders">in motion</a>, and I'm digging its particular flavour of a post-apocalypse setting.
</p>
<p>
That's the thing though, Marathon looks good in motion too, and based on most previews, plays good too. There's some specific complaints people are having about Marathon (namely a worrying lack of content at launch) which raises further questions as to whether it'll be the one to make a notoriously tough genre like extraction shooters popular.
</p>
<p>
I honestly can't say how things will shake out. Games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> are still trudging along quite well, maybe it doesn't need to be a massively popular genre. Guess we'll have an idea by the end of the year!

Think about his defining features,” Coogler explained. Both the animated Wolf and <em>Sinners’</em> villain Remmick (Jack O’Connell) have ominous red eyes.
