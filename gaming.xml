			<p>A first in-engine look at the highly anticipated The Witcher IV could be coming during tomorrow's State of Unreal 2025 presentation.</p>
<p>Today, CD Projekt Red confirmed on <a href="https://x.com/thewitcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> that the studio will showcase some of the innovative technology and features that will power the next entry in the series and beyond during tomorrow's State of Unreal 2025 presentation. As images, or footage, in this case, speak louder than words, there's a very good chance we will get a first in-engine look at the game to showcase some of these features better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We'll be coming together with <a href="https://twitter.com/UnrealEngine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UnrealEngine</a> to present during the State of Unreal.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to showcasing some of the innovative technology &amp; features that will power The Witcher 4, and beyond.</p>
<p>Join us at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnrealFest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UnrealFest</a> — 9:30 AM ET | 3:30 PM CEST on June 3:… <a href="https://t.co/IfrdVM539I">pic.twitter.com/IfrdVM539I</a></p>
<p>— The Witcher (@thewitcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/thewitcher/status/1929538495355494826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As most PC players are painfully aware, the vast majority of games powered by Unreal Engine 5 are plagued by stuttering issues, which newer versions of the engine are attempting to mitigate but seem far from completely solving. CD Projekt Red is well aware of these issues as well, as detailed in a presentation from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-fix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a>, so there's the possibility that some of the innovative technology to be showcased tomorrow could have something to do with addressing what has become the biggest issue in PC gaming in the past few years.</p>
<p>Though the first in-engine look at The Witcher IV may not be too far off, it will be a while until we will be able to play the game. Earlier this year, CD Projekt Red confirmed it won't launch until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">at least 2027</a>, so it will take a few years to see how the developer will manage to convince players that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-challenge-ciri-important-geralt/">Ciri is as important as Geralt</a> in the series' universe, something that those who read the novels by Andrzej Sapkowski already know well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/io-interactive-officially-reveals-007-first-light-more-info-this-week.1204707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>IO Interactive has finally revealed its upcoming&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game, which will officially be titled&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em>,&nbsp;and more information is coming later this week.</p>

<p>The game's name and artwork were revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1929553749963350144" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a> earlier today, and although there's not much to go on, it's nice to know that IO is still working on the game, given how long it's been since the initial announcement.</p>

<p><em>First Light&nbsp;</em>will be an origin story for Bond, detailing how he earned his 007 designation. In case you need a reminder, in the world of Bond, the 007 classification grants whichever agent carries it a license to kill in the field.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/io-interactive-007-first-light-gun-barrel.jpg?itok=JyHh6QI5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/io-interactive-007-first-light-gun-barrel.jpg?itok=oHPpSbUs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's been around four and a half years since&nbsp;<em>007 First Light&nbsp;</em>was first teased.</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed on the official&nbsp;<em>007 First Light&nbsp;</em><a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the game will be a "wholly original" story, so it won't be based on any of Ian Fleming's original novels or stories, nor will it be based on any of the movies.</p>

<p>We don't yet know where&nbsp;<em>First Light&nbsp;</em>will be set, nor do we know much about the gameplay, although given that it's IO Interactive on development duties, we can assume it'll at least be a little similar to the&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>It's been quite some time since&nbsp;<em>007 First Light&nbsp;</em>was first teased. We first got wind of IO's intent to make a&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/developers-of-hitman-franchise-are-making-james-bond-game" rel="nofollow">all the way back in late 2020</a>, and with not much info coming between then and now, you'd have been forgiven for thinking the game had been quietly canned.</p>

<p>That is, until July 2023, when IO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-new-studio" rel="nofollow">opened up a new studio in the UK</a>. At that point, it was also confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Project 007</em>, as it was then known, was still in development, along with something known as&nbsp;<em>Project Fantasy</em>&nbsp;(which still hasn't officially been revealed).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/io-interactive-007-first-light-hitman.jpg?itok=8M3pOnZV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/io-interactive-007-first-light-hitman.jpg?itok=SvYMG9Hk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>IO Interactive is probably best known for the&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as development, IO Interactive is also moving more into publishing. In October last year, it was revealed that the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-publishing-ex-rockstar-thriller" rel="nofollow">would be publishing&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em></a>, the upcoming action-adventure game from ex-Rockstar head Leslie Benzies.</p>

<p>More info on&nbsp;<em>007 First Light&nbsp;</em>is coming later this week, so stay tuned for that as soon as we get it.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian now off doing their own thing and making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-larian-discuss-making-two-new-games-at-once-in-practice-we-will-probably-be-miserable">multiple games that aren't Baldur's Gate 4</a>, BG IP owners Wizards of the Coast have just revealed something that might help fill that void. They've agreed to a publishing deal that'll see relatively new studio Giant Skull create a new game set in the D&amp;D universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/respawn-veteran-stig-asmussen-forms-giant-skull-to-build-aaa-single-player-games">Giant Skull</a> were founded by Stig Asmussen, director of stuff like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and God of War 3, back in March 2024, and said way back then that it'd be aiming to make "gameplay-driven, story-immersed action-adventure games".</p>
<p>Well, they get points for sticking to that goal thus far. This WotC-published game they're working on (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/wizards-of-the-coast-and-giant-skull-announce-original-dungeons-dragons-action-adventure-game-for-consoles-pc">Gematsu</a>) is an "all-new, single-player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> title set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons" that'll be coming to console and PC at some point between now and the end of time.</p>
<p>"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity," Asmussen said in a press release, "Our goal is to craft a rich new Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace.”</p>
<p>"In our time working together on God of War I got to see firsthand Stig’s artistry and expertise, and he and the Giant Skull team are the perfect fit for our new game," added Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro digital gaming president John Hight, "Worldbuilding and storytelling is in our DNA, and this collaboration reflects our evolution and commitment to our Playing to Win Strategy, building a stronger presence in digital play. We look forward to revealing more about this brand-new Dungeons &amp; Dragons game in the future."</p>
<p>So, concrete details about the game and what it'll end up looking like are pretty scarce right now - as you'd expect for a thing that's only just tied the publishing knot. There's no indication of how it may or may not be tied to the BG games we've already gotten, or whether any of the characters BG3 famously inspired War and Peace-length fanfictions about will star in it.</p>
<p>Given the fact it hasn't been declared <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">an RPG</a>, it could well turn out to have very little in common with BG3, aside from the obvious D&amp;D connection. We'll just have to wait, ponder our orbs like those coastal wizards, and see.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, we learned the game's proper name and that a full reveal will drop this week, presumably during one of the summer's major showcases.</p><div><p>https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1929553749963350144</p></div><p>The title is 007 First Light, and while details are scarce, a description of the game has appeared on IO Interactive's official site. "007 First Light is a brand new James Bond video game developed and published by IO Interactive," the description reads. "Featuring a wholly original Bond origin story, players will step into the shoes of the world's favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status." The second sentence gives context to the hashtag "EarnTheNumber," which appeared today in social media posts about the game. This description also <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/04/05/io-interactive-sheds-more-light-on-its-approach-to-creating-its-own-james-bond">confirms what we learned in 2021</a> – that the story would be a completely original take on the character.</p><p>A press release states that the trailer will include "never-before-seen footage," though it's unclear if this means gameplay, cutscenes, or some other CG-based teaser.</p><p>To catch the reveal live, be sure to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/26/the-2025-summer-showcase-schedule">bookmark our list of the summer's biggest showcases</a>. For more IO Interactive, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/hitman-3/hitman-3-review-a-killer-conclusion">read our Hitman 3 review</a>, though the game has much more content now, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/01/03/hitman-3-becomes-hitman-world-of-assassination-includes-access-to-1-and-2">thanks to the additions it gained when it rebranded as Hitman: World of Assassination</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-name-officially-announced-ahead-of-full-reveal-this-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>IOI's upcoming James Bond game has finally got itself an actual name, after years of it being known as Project 007.</p>
<p>IOI first announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">James Bond game back in 2021</a>, and since then details on the project have been few and far between. However, that is set to change soon, with the developer today announcing the upcoming release will officially be called 007: First Light, with a full reveal promised for later this week.</p>
<p>This reveal will feature "never-before-seen footage", the developer has teased, calling this the start of a "new era for James Bond in video games".</p>
<p>Along with this announcement, the studio also shared a teaser image, showing a male character - call me Miss Marple, but I am going to say this is none other than James Bond himself - bathed in shadow. You can see the image in the header above.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, IOI said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>, adding the release will not be a "gamification of a movie".</p>
<p>"It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond," IOI boss Hakan Abrak said in October.</p>
<p>"It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is... to work on this together with the family [and create] a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p>
<p>Meanwhile back in April, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-confirmed-for-switch-2">IOI's James Bond game was additionally confirmed for Switch 2</a>, although no release date was teased along with this announcement.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will learn more later this week. While the developer hasn't yet said when its 007: First Light reveal will be, I am going to make a guess it will crop up at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest's opening night this Friday</a>. Stay tuned!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>IO Interactive’s James Bond game, Project 007 has a teaser image and a new name, 007 First Light.</p>



<p>The full official reveal of the game will take place later this week, exactly when has not been specified, but as it’s Summer Games Fest tomorrow, that’s probably a good bet.&nbsp; It is rumoured that the game will show us the origin story of James Bond, and the First Light title would fit that rumour.</p>
<p>No platforms have been confirmed by name, but it will be made “for modern systems and platforms,” and is using IOI’s in house Glacier engine. In other words, we can expect it for PS5, <a title="Xbox Series X|S" href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, and depending on how deep into development the company are, possibly PS4 and Xbox One as well. We’ll just have to wait and see, but the game is already in active development at IOI’s offices in Copenhagen and Malmö.</p>

<p>“It’s true that once in a while, the stars do align in our industry,” said Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO Interactive, “Creating an original Bond game is a monumental undertaking and I truly believe that IO Interactive, working closely with our creative partners at EON and MGM, can deliver something extremely special for our players and communities. Our passionate team is excited to unleash their creativity into the iconic James Bond universe and craft the most ambitious game in the history of our studio.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-announces-project-007-officially-called-007-first-light-full-game-reveal-coming-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>IO Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1929553749963350144">officially announced</a> that its James Bond-based game, Project 007, is officially titled 007 First Light and that a full game reveal will be coming later this week.</p>
<p>Project 007 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-007-announced/">first announced back in 2020</a>, and since then, we've all been eagerly waiting to hear more about the game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/james-bond-and-io-interactive-are-a-match-made-in-heaven-says-mgm-itll-be-special/">everyone seems to agree will be something special,</a> considering that IO Interactive is the perfect studio to make a James Bond game.</p>
<p>IO Interactive is one of the studios listed as a partner for <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, so it's easy to guess that the reveal due to come this week will be during SGF's big kick-off event this coming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hr6Q2hln_M">Friday, June 6, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame">new page on IO Interactive's website</a> for 007 First Light describes the game as "<em>a wholly original Bond origin story,</em>" and that&nbsp;<em>"players will step into the shoes of the world's favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status</em>."</p>
<p>Summer Game Fest will have plenty of big announcements and reveals during its big kick-off event this Friday, but it's fair to say that the reveal of 007 First Light will likely be one of the biggest announcements across the whole week.</p>
<p>Having IO Interactive make a James Bond game is like the video game equivalent of putting peanut butter and chocolate together in the eyes of many players, and has remained one of the industry's most anticipated projects since it was revealed almost five years ago now. It'll be interesting to see what IO Interactive has been cooking with this project.</p>

I mean, I’ve not double-checked my electric toothbrush, but I wouldn’t be surprised.</p><figure id="" data-id="0922938f522683ab3dca38c24864f9f3" data-recommend-id="image://0922938f522683ab3dca38c24864f9f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Switch 2 with a red circle showing where there's room for a camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 with a red circle showing where there's room for a camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0922938f522683ab3dca38c24864f9f3" data-recommend-id="image://0922938f522683ab3dca38c24864f9f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Switch 2 with a red circle showing where there's room for a camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>OK, I’m not entirely naive to the annoyance front-facing cameras can be to device manufacturers. The feature has become vital in cell phones, but often at a significant cost to the form factor—that’s how we ended up with those god-awful chunks taken out of the top of iPhones, and the weird-ass punch-holes in Androids, as bezels shrank and screen size could no longer be sacrificed for the sake of the camera’s presence. But, if you look at a Switch 2, there’s still a decent amount of bezel present, despite the larger screen. Especially if it were mounted to the left or right. It might have been uglier, perhaps undesirable, but it was surely possible.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.samsung.com/latin_en/support/mobile-devices/a-look-at-the-under-display-camera-udc-on-the-galaxy-z-fold4-and-fold5/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20UDC%20(Under,recognition%20for%20unlocking%20your%20device.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.samsung.com/latin_en/support/mobile-devices/a-look-at-the-under-display-camera-udc-on-the-galaxy-z-fold4-and-fold5/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20UDC%20(Under,recognition%20for%20unlocking%20your%20device." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Under display cameras</a></span> (UDCs) have existed for a few years now, but they’re super-expensive and only feature in the most high-end phones, and they come at the cost of visible cross-hatching on the portion of the screen behind which they’re hiding. Even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-losing-under-display-camera/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-losing-under-display-camera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung may be backing away from them now</a></span>. You have to assume Nintendo at least looked into the tech, but realized it’s both far too costly and too many years away from good enough. (An inclusion for the Switch 3, perhaps?)</p><p>But given just how much of a fuss is being made of GameChat, isn’t it just a bit weird that the sacrifices weren’t made? Given that games are going to have ways of integrating players’ faces into characters, of letting you see your friends’ live reactions as you crushingly defeat them in <em>Mario Kart</em> or delivering their celebratory dances to you in <em>Mario Party</em>, it feels like such a missed opportunity to make this exclusive to playing at home on TV, and even then, only if the player has bought a camera peripheral.</p><figure id="" data-id="0caf5cc2a0b21b67b4929e4a645bc0da" data-recommend-id="image://0caf5cc2a0b21b67b4929e4a645bc0da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Piranha Plant camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Piranha Plant camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0caf5cc2a0b21b67b4929e4a645bc0da" data-recommend-id="image://0caf5cc2a0b21b67b4929e4a645bc0da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Piranha Plant camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You might wonder if it could be a quality issue. That tech that’s going to allow the Switch 2 to detect your face, cut it out, and apply it to your avatar, perhaps that needs too many pixels for an affordable teeny pinhole camera? Except, well, those cameras Nintendo are selling aren’t exactly top-of-the-range. Hori’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/piranha-plant-camera-for-nintendo-switch-2-000000000010016155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/piranha-plant-camera-for-nintendo-switch-2-000000000010016155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Piranha Plant Camera</a></span> (which appears to have disappeared from the U.S. Nintendo store) has an incredibly low resolution: 640 x 480. And that will apparently still work.</p><p>The Pixel 9a phone, which will cost you much the same as a Switch 2 with a camera, has a selfie camera that can film in 4K at 30FPS. The $55 official Switch 2 Camera by Nintendo can only capture at 1080p, although that’s still a mighty step up from the Piranha’s 480p! The point is, if the tech can work on a 480p camera, then quality is clearly not an issue, and something that cheap would barely touch the device’s price.</p><p>And let’s not forget Nintendo is hardly averse to sticking a camera in things. The DSi had a camera mounted in the clamshell’s bevel in 2009, and even more relevantly, the bonkers Wii U handheld screen thingamajig had a camera in 2012, thus allowing video chat with other players!</p><figure id="" data-id="d396740ba1492e9005d5fffa4048d5e2" data-recommend-id="image://d396740ba1492e9005d5fffa4048d5e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 with a camera plugged in." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 with a camera plugged in." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d396740ba1492e9005d5fffa4048d5e2" data-recommend-id="image://d396740ba1492e9005d5fffa4048d5e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 with a camera plugged in." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m sure Nintendo has its reasons. It could be cost, it could be a complete lack of a desire to give up valuable screen size to a camera, perhaps it couldn’t be done in a way that didn’t just look plain ugly. UDC’s aren’t viable, and pop-up cameras introduce a whole new fail-point to a device (but still seems like it could have been a viable solution here). But it remains significant that it hasn’t happened.</p><p>If GameChat’s camera-based abilities really were an integral part of the Switch 2's ethos, the handheld device <em>would</em> feature a camera. It’s daft that this tech is not only reserved for the way in which a person is least likely to play some <em>Mario Kart</em>, but is also exclusive to those who fork out an extra fifty bucks for the camera peripheral to boot. It makes clear live video in GameChat is never going to be anything more than a bonus gimmick.</p><p>And honestly, I find that a shame. On the tech’s announcement, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-camera-direct-screen-sharing-1851774311&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-camera-direct-screen-sharing-1851774311">I was super-excited for the possibilities it could offer</a></span>, that special touch of weirdness only Nintendo offers. But—and yes, it <em>has</em> taken me two months to realize this—it’s clearly not a priority for the new console. If it were, the Switch 2 would have a little mounted 480p camera, and developers would be encouraged to go wild with the tech.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A release date was not announced. <span id="more-968876"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Unbound Creations:</p><blockquote><p><em>Table Tactics</em> is a unique blend of strategy and physics, played with little miniature figurines. Imagine you are staring at your kitchen table where you laid out a little fantasy diorama and carefully placed miniatures to defend your castle. Alas, enemy units are coming from all directions! But instead of decreasing their health or worrying about armor, you must physically knock them over by shooting various projectiles (like arrows or marbles), using traps, or pushing them off the table. You’ll need to take the shape and weight of each figurine into consideration.</p><p>The archers are your basic unit—they shoot an arrow which, when aimed well, can topple almost any figurine. The Catapult flings heavy marbles that roll around—great for big groups of enemies! And the Mage can cast an explosive fireball, knocking everything in its blast radius. There are many more units to collect and alter your playstyle.</p><p>As you complete levels and challenges, you will earn gold coins to buy and trade new miniatures. Build a custom roster, experiment with synergies, and create the most powerful tabletop physics army!</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>With Summer Game Fest coming at the end of the week, the deluge of video game news that accompanies the annual event is set to begin soon. IO Interactive has kicked things off with the news that Project 007--the studio's new adventure starring famous spy James Bond--will officially be known as <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1929553749963350144" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">007: First Light</a>, and the game is set to be revealed later this week.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a> is a "wholly original Bond origin story" according to the game's official website, that will let players "step into the shoes of the world's favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status." No other new information about First Light was shared, including which platforms it will appear on--the only known platform so far is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, after a brief teaser appeared during the Switch 2 Direct in April.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4505013-007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505013" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4505013-007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505013"></a><figcaption>007: First Light teaser image</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4505013-007.jpg"></figure><p>Previously, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak mentioned that First Light will be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">the start of a new trilogy</a>" focused on James Bond, and that IO's version of Bond will not be based on any other version of the character. "What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," Abrak said, "so it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future."</p><p>007: First Light was one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">many third-party games confirmed</a> for Nintendo Switch 2 during the Switch 2 Direct, along with From Software's next project The Duskbloods, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Yakuza 0: Director's Cut, and Street Fighter 6. First-party Nintendo titles announced during the event include Donkey Kong Bananza, Mario Kart World, and Kirby Air Riders.</p><p>Summer Game Fest Live kicks off at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET on Friday, June 6.

                <p>The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red has discussed what it's learned throughout decades of development, and one of the key takeaways is that the studio should focus on what it's best at instead of trying too many different things.</p><p>"We've learned that we have to be razor-sharp focused," chairman Marcin Iwinski said on the AnsweRed podcast, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-developer-cd-projekt-plans-to-stick-to-its-niche-and-thats-aaa-rpg-open-world-narrative-driven-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported by IGN</a>. "We cannot do so many things we would love to do--we are <em>tempted</em> to do. We tried and it didn't work out. We have to focus on what we are good at, and really put 100% into it."</p><p>Joint-CEO Adam Badowski added, "We're gonna develop AAA RPG, open-world narrative-driven games and this is our, let's say, niche. So the focus is there."</p><p>Iwinski said this sounds simple, but there were temptations to try new things outside of the company's core focus. "And you think, 'OK, no, let's take a deep breath and come back to what we're doing. Because if we spread ourselves too thin, we'll not deliver," Iwinski said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sYilj_DIGc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6sYilj_DIGc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not immediately clear what Iwinski meant when he said, "We tried and it didn't work out."

<p>"Just checked because I [saw] a post on X from Wario64 and it was about [making] sure payment is and all is good to go for when they are ready to ship.. I [checked] and my order got cancelled two days ago," reads one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1kylszy/target_canceled_my_order/">reddit post titled Target cancelled my order</a>. According to replies, the original poster is not the only one this has happened to.</p>
<p>Another post - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1kzkboe/did_anyone_elses_switch_2_preorder_get_cancelled/">Did anyone else's Switch 2 preorder get cancelled out of nowhere?</a> - shared on the Walmart subreddit said the same thing. "I just got an email saying it was canceled due to a payment error even though it was the same card I preordered it with," it reads.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://x.com/MechaPaddington/status/1928635220070150169">more examples of these Switch 2 cancellations</a> can be found on X. "Walmart you have failed me for cancelling my switch 2 preorder when my payment method is valid and has funds available, give it back," <a href="https://x.com/Bumbles1593/status/1928607013644165162">one poster wrote over the weekend</a>.</p>
<p>While Walmart and Target seem to be the main retailers in the US to have cancelled Switch 2 orders, <a href="https://x.com/noggin_chomper/status/1929273279459594600">GameStop has also been namechecked online</a>, although the problem doesn't appear to be as widespread.</p> <div>

<p>These reports follow last week's news here in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-cancels-some-switch-2-online-pre-orders-a-week-before-launch">which saw retailer GAME admit it had cancelled a number of Switch 2 online pre-orders</a>, with just days to go before the highly anticipated console's release. At this time, GAME said it was aiming to "reinstate as many affected pre-orders as possible".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is set to release later this week, on 5th of June. Eurogamer's former EIC Tom Phillips has already been hands-on with Nintendo's upcoming console.

			<p>The upcoming PC release of Stellar Blade is going to be accompanied by all sorts of mods, and the game's developer seems to have already embraced them fully, offering praise for a mod now available for the recently released playable demo.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1929193800133742858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1929193800133742858%7Ctwgr%5Ebf7019ef9ac22b6b565cee10c60ca44810a6777a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespark.jp%2Farticle%2F2025%2F06%2F02%2F153330.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, the game's official profile recently shared a short clip showcasing a modded VR mode now available for the demo via <a href="https://github.com/praydog/UEVR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UEVR</a>, praising it without reservations, leading some users to ask about the future addition of a PSVR 2 mode on PlayStation 5. Sadly, the developer has not clarified if this could be a possibility, so for the time being, the only way to play the game with a VR headset will be with the PC version launching next week. In case you do not own a VR headset, but still want to check out how Stellar Blade plays in VR mode, you can check out the video below by Paradise Decay.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Stellar Blade playable demo launched on Steam<a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-demo/"> last week</a>. The demo allows players to try out the first hour of the game as well as fight against a boss found later in the story to let players try out some of Eve's advanced abilities. Save data from the demo can also be imported into the full release, which will launch on June 12th. You can learn more about what to expect from the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizards-of-the-coast-to-publish-star-wars-jedi-directors-d-d-video-game.1204578/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast-dungeons-and-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced that it will publish a&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game currently in the works at&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&nbsp;</em>director Stig Asmussen's studio Giant Skull.</p>

<p>Per a VentureBeat <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-publishing-agreement-with-giant-skull/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the game is a "single-player action-adventure game with an immersive story set in the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>universe". Asmussen and Giant Skull haven't revealed more details about the project yet.</p>

<p>In a statement to VentureBeat, Asmussen says the goal with the studio's&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D&nbsp;</em>game is to "craft a rich new&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat, and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-jedi-survivor-giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast.jpg?itok=msBqu285 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-jedi-survivor-giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast.jpg?itok=uYnA61gM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Stig Asmussen's previous works include&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>For his part, Wizards of the Coast president John Hight says Giant Skull is full of "exceptionally talented creators", and that the collaboration between the two companies represents a new development in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-unveils-new-playing-to-win-strategy-expanding-their-reach-to-more-players" rel="nofollow">"Playing to Win strategy"</a>.</p>

<p>The description of the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game in the works at Giant Skull isn't particularly specific, but it does rather sound like Asmussen's M.O.; he's previously served as the director on games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;God of War III</i>.</p>

<p>Asmussen first announced the founding of Giant Skull <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stig-asmussen-giant-skull-star-wars-jedi" rel="nofollow">in March last year</a>, following his departure from Respawn and its parent company EA in late 2023. At the time of Giant Skull's founding, Asmussen said his philosophy was simple: the world "need[s] video games, and [it needs] people to make them".</p>

<p>At the time, Giant Skull simply said that development on its first project was underway, but now, it looks like we know what that project is going to be (unless there's a second game in development at Giant Skull, which is perhaps unlikely).</p>

There's also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gameloft-dungeons-dragons-game" rel="nofollow">life sim-survival hybrid</a> in the works at&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>studio Gameloft, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live-service multiplayer game</a> from&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze.</p>

<p>If you want solo thrills, though, it sounds like Giant Skull's game will be your jam. Stay tuned for more info on this one as and when we get it.</p>

In December, <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/pcf-organizational-update/">a notice from the company</a> stated it would suspend production on a project codenamed Victoria and reduce the team working on Bifrost. In today’s announcement, Wojciechowski wrote that cancellations were due to an unspecified publisher’s failure to present necessary publishing agreements, and a “lack of communication” regarding whether or not the publisher wants to continue with development. </p><p>The statement also attributed the cancellations to issues with the publisher’s cash flow stating it, “showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue the production.” And the name of the publisher? It isn’t exactly a mystery. In the developer’s statement from December, People Can Fly named its collaborator on Project Gemini as Square Enix.People Can Fly — which was acquired by Epic Games in 2012 before going independent again in 2015 — will continue development on Xbox’s next <em>Gears of War</em> title, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em></a>, as a partner studio working with The Coalition.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
