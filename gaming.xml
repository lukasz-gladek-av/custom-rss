<p>Awards for individual genres are amazing, and recognition for one game conquering a whole field of gameplay. However, this is the big one. There have been so many elite contenders for the 2025 Game of the Year accolades, and Insider Gaming has selected the one deemed the best.</p>



<p>12 months of video game releases have led to this big moment. Top-level developers have worked hard, and publishers have put their faith in games in the hope of being acknowledged as the best. 2025 has emptied wallets and consumed hours with amazing Roguelikes, RPGs, Action-Adventure games, and more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> has crowned a winner.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-game-of-2025-winner-hollow-knight-silksong">Best Game Of 2025 Winner—Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a testament to numerous games that a few releases could be in this spot. If you can overlook the dastardly difficulty of Hollow Knight: Silksong and ignore the elitist conversation of a AAA game needing to be GOTY, then Silksong is a worthy winner, and the Insider Gaming team has spoken!</p>



<p>This year has seen Silksong go from being barely a figure in the shadows to receiving a launch date soon after it reemerged at Gamescom 2025 in August. It’s rare for an indie game to have the levels of hype it did, but that’s exactly what happened. It single-handedly took the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-xbox-eshop-offline-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam, Xbox, and eShop stores offline once downloads went live</a>, due to demand, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-beat-hollow-knight-all-time-peak-player-count-in-15-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decimated the original’s all-time peak player count in minutes</a>.</p>



<p>It’s one of the highest-rated games of 2025, and it’s a breathtaking adventure from start to finish. You’ll struggle to find indie games this beautiful and carefully manicured—there are no ugly edges to be found. The gameplay and depth of quests and things to do have been greatly expanded, and every locale feels unique. Combat is a steep learning curve, but there’s nothing wrong with that, and owners will receive the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Sorrow DLC</a> for free.</p>



<p>Silksong suddenly ended up being one of the year’s most anticipated games, and in Insider Gaming’s opinion, the best, without question.</p>



<h2 id="h-insider-gaming-game-of-the-year-2025-runner-up-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Insider Gaming Game of the Year 2025 Runner-Up—Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another accolade. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>So many turn-based RPGs successfully execute one or more aspects of a game: Gameplay, Story, Performances, Music, and Art. Very few dare to tackle them all head-on and nail it! Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 wasn’t as hyped as Silksong was, but it emerged as one of the most must-play RPGs of the modern era.</p>



<p>Yes, Sandfall Interactive’s first game was created by world-class developers with years of AAA experience. It didn’t mean Clair Obscur would work by any means. The odd design choice here and there could maybe have used some more work, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI controversy</a> does leave the slightest of sour tastes in the mouth.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is an easy runner-up. With other games like Hades 2, Blue Prince, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 all delivering their own serving of excellence, respect needs to be put on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s name.</p>



<p>This is one of the best games in years.</p>



<p>It’s likely many of you would swap our winner and runner-up around—or omit Hollow Knight: Silksong altogether! If you have thoughts or your own winner, head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to discuss them.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/need-for-speed-unbound-ps-plus-essential-january-2026/">Shortly after the headlining game for January's PS Plus Essential titles leaked</a>, PlayStation has come out and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/31/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-january-need-for-speed-unbound-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-core-keeper/">announced the full PS Plus Essential lineup</a> for the first month of 2026. Not only does it include Need for Speed Unbound, but all PS Plus subscribers will be able to enjoy Epic Mickey Rebrushed and Core Keeper.</p>



<p>It's back to the three-game norm, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-five-games-december-2025-lego-horizon-adventures-neon-white/">December 2025's lineup of Essential titles</a> included five games total. While Need for Speed is the headliner, it's arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disneys-epic-mickey-rebrushed-what-could-have-been/">Epic Mickey Rebrushed</a> that's the most exciting title of the bunch. Core Keeper isn't a slouch either, as the 1-8 player co-op game is a good option to cozy up with as we get into the cold of January.</p>



<p>All three titles will be available for players to redeem as of January 6, 2026, which means that you'll have until January 5, 2026, to redeem the five games that were made available to players in December 2025.</p>

Strangely, despite its impressive performance in the sales stakes, <em>PUBG </em>isn't the most-played game of the year; that honor goes to <em>Grand Theft Auto V </em>(and, by extension, <em>GTA Online</em>).</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>GTA V</em>, and thus presumably <em>GTA Online</em>, has made it onto Steam's Best of 2025 list.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's a real live-service jamboree in the top sellers list; other titles include <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which also managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08dd5792-c4a8-4824-90f6-27b50a7dc7fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit a pretty impressive sales milestone</a> in its first couple of weeks, as well as <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p><p>The first non-multiplayer title on the list after <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II </em>is the drug-dealing simulator <em>Schedule I</em>, followed by <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which is arguably on the borderline given its cycle of frequent updates (although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">certainly is a big seller</a>).</p><p>When it comes to the Steam Deck, the most-played games of the year skew much more towards time sink-style single-player adventures, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-over-195-million-units-red-dead-redemption-2-at-61-million" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="79f14bf8-3a01-4742-90f0-f879fca71b70" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6faddb2-01d3-46aa-a769-c7be021e6a4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, and <em>Hollow Knight </em>(although two of those do indeed support multiplayer).</p><p>The list even tracks the games most often played with a controller, and it won't shock you to learn that the likes of <em>Split Fiction</em>, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, and, yes, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>figure heavily on that particular list.</p><figure role="group">

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> was Steam's biggest-selling game over the holiday period.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4777282/view/502844844914248084">SteamDB</a>, which revealed that the biggest-selling games by revenue on the digital platform from 23rd-30th December were Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you look at all <em>products</em> sold on Steam, not just games, Steam Deck takes the runner-up spot, but given this chart organises top-selling games by revenue, not unit sales, that shouldn't be a complete surprise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-is-offloading-14%e2%80%b3-laptop-bundle-to-its-lowest-price-now-cheaper-than-an-entry-level-ipad-2000654516</link>
            <guid>1395025</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t have to spend thousands on a new laptop, especially if you’re just after an everyday machine for casual work and home use. If you’re shopping for one today, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/">Amazon, very generously, has dropped the price of the 14-inch HP computer in Silver to just $300, after taking a massive 35% off its usual price.</a> Your purchase will come with a free 8-in-1 hub, as well as a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365; both of which add even more value to the current offer. It’s one of the lowest we have seen this model drop to, but as you’d expect, the discount ends soon. Be sure to snap it up fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Decent Performance for Regular Tasks</h2>
<p>We won’t sugarcoat it; this laptop is not a powerhouse. It’s appropriate for home use like simple browsing, streaming, video calling, and some basic work tasks. We won’t exactly recommend it to work professionals, but it’s a good pick for seniors who want their own device or kids who are just getting started. You’re getting a modest 14-inch HD display that delivers decent visuals for all your needs. The anti-glare coating makes it easy on the eyes and keeps the picture quality consistent across all lighting conditions. You can view the screen comfortably in daylight (while soaking up some sun), as well as in dim settings after the shadows fall.</p>
<p>The 4GB DDR4 RAM isn’t made for heavy-duty multitasking, but it does a good job of keeping everything running smoothly, as long as you’re not trying to push some creative boundaries. There’s 128GB flash storage, which is nicely paired with a 128GB Micro SD to give you a total of 256GB space to save all your files, content, and programs. It’s more than enough to house hundreds of photos, a ton of videos, a few movies to stay entertained on the go, all your favorite songs downloaded, and more. Power comes from the 4-core Intel N150 processor, which hits up to 3.6 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology.</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity comes from Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4, while ports like USB Type-C (10Gbps), two USB Type-A, HDMI 1.4b, and an SD card reader make it easy to connect other peripherals without feeling limited. Windows 11 S also comes pre-installed, so the laptop will be ready to go right out of the box. The highlight here, however, is the one-year subscription to Microsoft 365 Office. This gives you access to premium apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, Teams, and more. You can use these to create documents, be creative with presentations, work on large spreadsheets, and communicate with teams around the world remotely. The subscription typically costs around $100 a year, but you’re getting it here for absolutely free!</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to grab a new everyday laptop for regular use, this Amazon deal lets you pick one for basically nothing.

Street racing is a key part of the experience, but so is outrunning the cops.

The visuals and gameplay have been noticeably improved as Mickey Mouse is sucked into the Wasteland where forgotten characters and concepts have languished for decades. This game is one of the reasons why Disney made a deal to gain the rights to Walt Disney's previous creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. And for the first time, Mickey has to come face-to-face with his brother, Oswald, and reconcile with him if he wants any chance of escaping the Wasteland.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628405-corekeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4628405" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628405-corekeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4628405"></a><figcaption>Promo art for Core Keeper.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628405-corekeeper.jpg"></figure><p>Core Keeper is kind of a blend of cozy and survival games that allows players to explore a vast cavern that has hidden treasures and "untold secrets."

            <p>Nier producer Yosuke Saito has teased that there's "just a little something" on the way for fans in 2026.</p>

<p>However, he did temper the tease by adding "please don't get too excited with anticipation!"</p>

<p>“Next year marks the 40th anniversary of Dragon Quest! I’d be extremely happy if everyone could join in on a grand celebration," Saito said.</p>
<p>"And for Nier: Automata's ninth anniversary, we're also preparing 'just a little something…' so please don't get too excited with anticipation! With that, I wish you all a happy New Year."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Nier: Automata producer Saito and director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-creators-deny-characters-were-problematic-overseas-and-blame-mistranslated-subtitle-for-censorship-rumours">denied any of their character designs were restricted for Western audiences</a>.  After the developers were reportedly mistranslated in Japanese-to-English subtitling, Taro said: "I've never heard of such a thing happening".</p>

            <guid>1394989</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hideo Kojima has delivered his Happy New Year message to the world, as it's already 2026 in his home of Japan. Along with well-wishes for the new year, he's provided an update on what 2026 will mean for Kojima Productions, and according to Kojima, it means he's getting his head down and rooting himself in his home and his work.</p>



<p>Now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has been out the door for months, the studio can look ahead at its next major projects, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/">OD and Physint</a>. According to Kojima, this is part of Kojima Productions moving forward with the "<em>Second Phase that leads into Kojima Productions 'Third Phase.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Happy New Year,</em>" Kojima began in his post on his <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2006387335114670562?s=20">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>In 2026, we will move forward with the 'Second Phase' that leads into KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS’ 'Third Phase'.”</em></p>



<p>"<em>Unlike last year, I was traveling all over the world, this year will be about staying grounded and laying solid foundations. We will continue development on the horror game 'OD' and move forward with preparations for the espionage action title 'PHYSINT.' This includes casting actors, scanning, and performance capture shoots.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy New Year.<br>In 2026, we will move forward with the “Second Phase” that leads into KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS’ “Third Phase.”<br>Unlike last year, like I was traveling all over the world, this year will be about staying grounded and laying solid foundations. We will continue development… <a href="https://t.co/yje0zAY1md">pic.twitter.com/yje0zAY1md</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2006387335114670562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It sounds like Kojima sees the year ahead as a time to really dig into Physint and OD, and while Death Stranding 2 being out of the way means he and the rest of the studio can focus on both games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-productions-10th-anniversary-future-projects/">both titles are seemingly still early in development.</a> In other words, barring some incredible surprise, we won't be seeing a new game from Kojima Productions in 2026.</p>



<p>Beyond the studio's upcoming game projects, Hideo Kojima also <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-death-stranding-animated-movie-is-in-the-works-with-raised-by-wolves-creator-aaron-guzikowski-writing-the-script/">shared an update on the multiple adaptations in the works based on Death Stranding</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Also, be pushing forward with the live-action film of DEATH STRANDING, as well as its animation projects, both the movie and series. In addition, we’re preparing several 'events' this year. Once things are finalized, I’ll be able to share more.</em>"</p>



<p>So while 2026 likely won't be marked by a new game under Kojima's and the studios' belt, it will still be a significant one for Hideo Kojima as he enters the year of his 40th anniversary in game development. "This year also marks my 40th anniversary in the game industry, from 1986, and began my journey in game creation.<em> Thank you, as always, for your continued support and supporting Kojima Productions. I look forward to another great year</em>."</p>

  </picture><h2>Consequences Cycle Deck</h2><p>Cycle Decks in <em>Bushido</em> are a way for GCT to easily incorporate new cards, rather than packaging them with specific miniature releases. When constructing your warband, you can only use cards from 1 Cycle pack (Risen Sun, Weeping Sky, or Consequences). The Concequences Cycle Deck, like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-weeping-sky-cycle-deck-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Weeping Sky Cycle Deck</a> before it, contains 54 cards for a mixture of factions and card types, including:</p><ul><li>Events, usually actions that can be played during the game</li><li>Terrain, which can be deployed onto the battlefield for specific effects</li><li>Enhancements, that are attached to units to offer effects and abilities</li><li>Themes, offering new abilities if the warband construction restrictions are followed</li></ul><p>We recently previewed several cards from the Consequences Cycle Deck, which you can see <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-exclusive-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>The Consequences Cycle Deck contains cards for all factions, except the Awoken and Imperial March, the 2 newest factions that will receive cards in future Cycle decks. The faction breakdown for the deck is:</p><ul><li>Cult of Yurei - 4 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 2 events)</li><li>Ito Clan - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>Jung Pirates - 4 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 2 events)</li><li>Minimoto Clan - 4 cards (2 enhancement, 1 event, 1 terrain)</li><li>Prefecture of Ryu - 4 cards (4 enhancement equipment)</li><li>Savage Wave - 4 cards (1 theme, 1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Shadow Wind Clan - 3 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Shiho Clan - 4 cards (1 theme, 1 enhancement, 2 events)</li><li>Silvermoon Trade Syndicate - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Temple of Ro-Kan - 4 cards (3 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment)</li><li>The Descension - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>The Kinshi Temple - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>Ronin - 7 cards (3 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment, 3 events)</li></ul><p>Apart from those we previewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-exclusive-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">previously</a> (I'm a huge fan of Consequences of Kiyohara and New Eagle Army), my favorite card from the set is the Shadow Wind Clan's Opposition Preparation, which stops enemy fighters from using a whole host of abilities when targeted by North Star fighters for the first time. I love the thematic pre-battle reconnaissance that the ninjas would have done to preempt and disrupt enemy abilities before even going into combat with them.</p><p>As with previous cycle decks, the more factions you play, the more you will get out of this deck, but even players with a single faction (as long as it's not Awoken or Imperial March) will get their faction's cards and the Ronin cards to use. It will also give you an idea of what your opponent might be taking (as you can see the cards in the app for list building purposes, but not the details), and who knows when you'll pick up a new faction in the future. I've been strictly Shadow Wind and Shiho Clan for a while, but with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-wretched-review-living-nightmare" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Wretched</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-passing-night-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Passing the Night</a> themed warband releases (both of which are incredible), I've found myself suddenly playing 2 new factions this year.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Somabo the Blue Crane</h2><p>Somabo is a Ronin fighter that can only be recruited into The Descension warbands, or those that include Hiroto (either the Ronin Drunken Master or Shiho Black Eagle versions). &nbsp;Somabo is fast, with movement 5 (with +1 move if running and doesn't suffer melee penalties for running), 4 dice in attack, and armed with a +1 damage katana or claws (depending on whether you want the katana's critical attack/sidestep defence or claws' pierce, bleed, or combo attack).</p><p>Somabo's Squall Strike ki feat lets them move 1 inch after an attack if they make a damage roll, along with up to 2 other friendly Tengu models within 4 inches. Finally, their Umbrella Block ki feat gives them parry until the end of the melee exchange.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Vekye</h2><p>Vekye is a Cult of Yurei fighter with a move of 5 and 2 types of attacks. Vekye can either go for standard damage, with +1 damage claws with pierce, bleed, and combo attack, or the +0 damage tainted hands with grapple attack. If Veyke manages to hold their opponent with grapple, at the end of the round, the held model (as long as it's not soulless) takes an additional 2 wounds and gains a spirit block marker that stops them from generating ki tokens next round.</p><p>Veyke has a Mutation ki feat that gives them either +1 melee weapon strength, regenerate 2, or armor 1 for the turn, depending on what they need, and a Fight or Flight ki feat, which grants them Banzai, allowing them to charge as a simple action, or Clowdwalk, which lets them ignore terrain and zones of control for movement. They also have Indomitable 1, which means they ignore the first enemy penalty for assisting in combat, along with coordinated attack Tengu, to benefit them when they gang up on an opponent.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Yoshiko</h2><p>Yoshiko is the latest Rose for the Silvermoon Trade Syndicate. I picked up Yoshiko to add to my plan to make an entirely Rose warband because despite being part of the Silvermoon, their theme is very ninja-ish in their disguises, concealed weapons, and seduction techniques. Yoshiko is no different in that respect, but is a little more overt in her combat prowess. Yoshiko has move 5, as is standard with the Roses (except the veteran rose Misao), and jump up, evasive and lightfooted to keep them mobile, and disguise 5 to keep them protected. In attack, they roll 3 dice with their +0 damage Tachi that has push and stun attack, and sidestep defence.</p><p>For ki feats, Yoshiko has the powerful Contingency Plan, which can actually stop them from being removed and instead are placed out of the enemy's line of sight with all wounds healed by using the ki feat and passing an opposed ki test. She can also put scheme markers on nearby enemies at the end of her activations, and then remove them with the scheme ki feat that lets her recruit a permitted event card with a cost equal to the number of scheme tokens removed.</p><p>Yoshiko also has a 0-cost, once per turn, The Crowds Part ki feat that lets them move 2 inches. Enemies in base-to-base contact can spend 2 ki to stop it, but even that is very handy, either getting Yoshiko out of combat or burning 2 enemy ki. Finally, Yoshiko also lets you change the scenario target of a friendly VIM (Very Important Model) from the one selected to any with disguise. The model loses disguise, but it gives you control over the scenario target.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Shiho Kizo</h2><p>Kizo is my favorite release of this wave, a Ronin who plays into both my beloved Shiho Clan and Shadow Wind Clan. Kizo is not only a ninja, but also a samurai. Kizo's sculpt is covered in baby Karapan, and he comes with a 10-inch Karapling ranged attack with lightweight, so he doesn't suffer any modifications for moving and attacking with it. The attack doesn't need line of sight and ignores cover, can only be used once per turn, and instead of damage, gives a Bleed 2 marker to the target.</p><p>At the start of Kizo's activation, he can either heal 2 wounds on an animal in base-to-base contact or gain sixth sense until the end phase. When Kizo is recruited, it means that Shiho warbands can also recruit Karapan, and Shadow Wind warbands can recruit Ronin birds, both of which normally wouldn't be able to do so.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Bushido Wave 25 Releases?</h2><p>There's a lot to love in Wave 25 of <em>Bushido</em> releases, and we've only covered 4 of the 13 miniatures that were released as part of it. The Temple of Ro-Kan did well with 3 releases in the wave, but there's a lot for most factions (with the Savage Wave and Awoken getting releases in the next wave, which is available to <a href="https://gctstudios.com/catalog/new-specials" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">preorder now</a>). I'm a fan of the Consequences Cycle Deck, mainly because it gave me a new theme for the Shiho clan, but there are some great cards for all factions here, and it will be interesting to see how the meta reacts in the next few months with this cycle deck and recent releases, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-bai-qian-themed-warband-review-for-emperor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Imperials</a> and aggressive <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-ring-of-fire-review-to-battle" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Savage Wave</a>.</p><hr><p>The copies of&nbsp;<strong>Bushido Products from Wave 25</strong>&nbsp;<em>used to produce this review were provided by GCT Studios and bought by the Author.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>The one thing I wouldn't hold your breath for when it comes to this website is an announcement for <em>Persona 6</em>.

If <em>Persona 6 </em>was to be announced, then the 30th anniversary celebrations for the franchise as a whole would seem an ideal time to do so.</p><p>In the meantime, while you wait for a <em>Persona 6 </em>announcement (or whatever Atlus has in store for the anniversary), you can celebrate the franchise's music thanks to the <em>Persona </em>concert tour <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-concert-us-january-date-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d8554b0-8365-410f-a8ba-d0bee07489a8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">making its way to the US in January</a>.</p><p>Back in September, the franchise also received <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-music-video" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dee0e73a-8716-4317-9058-a4d024355fa1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">its first official music video</a> in the form of a clip for "It's Going Down Now", the iconic battle theme from 2024's <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Atlus plans to reveal as part of the <em>Persona </em>30th anniversary celebrations. Make sure to keep an eye on the website if you want to be the first to see it!</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Pokémon mania continues to spread around the world, and 2026 is set to be a huge year for the franchise, which celebrates 30 years since the release of the first games in Japan.</p>



<p>In the three decades since, Pokémon has introduced over 1,000 creatures to catch and collect in video games, alongside thousands of anime episodes, full-length films, an extremely successful TCG, and countless spin-off titles.</p>



<p>With next year being such a landmark occasion for the Pokémon franchise, Insider Gaming has taken a look at what to expect from the company in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-pokemon-in-2026">What to Expect From Pokémon in 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New World Order. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-launches-a-new-series-of-games">Pokopia Launches a New Series of Games</h3>



<p>Due to launch on March 5, Pokopia is set to be the first Pokémon title to release in 2026, and the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive for the franchise—although there is a way to play on the original Switch.</p>



<p>The concept of a Pokémon version of an Animal Crossing-like game seems like a perfect match and if the title is as successful as it looks likely to be, it will likely spark the start of a new series of games.</p>



<p>Pokopia may feature Pokémon from a variety of generations, but it appears to be set in Kanto, with a post-apocalyptic theme leaked, which leaves the door open to adventures across even more regions in the future.</p>



<h3 id="h-30th-anniversary-tcg-set">30th Anniversary TCG Set</h3>



<p>A 30th anniversary TCG set for Pokémon is a surefire guarantee, with trademarks already registered in Japan. It doesn’t take a genius to predict them, as previous anniversaries saw the Celebrations set release in 2021, and Generations in 2016.</p>



<p>Exactly what Pokémon has up their sleeve remains to be seen, though they could opt to reprint classic cards once again. There are countless possibilities, however, and plenty of debate around what would be the best move for Pokémon<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Either way, it’s a guaranteed money-spinner for the Pokémon franchise, particularly given the craziness in the market currently, which, sadly, doesn’t look likely to stop for a while.</p>



<h3 id="h-gen-10-releases-on-nintendo-switch-2">Gen 10 Releases on Nintendo Switch 2</h3>



<p>2026 will mark four years since the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, making it the longest gap between generation releases since Black and White were released in 2010, and the next generation of Pokémon<strong> </strong>is almost certain to arrive next year.</p>



<p>Pokémon Day 2026 would be the perfect time for the first reveal, and it seems likely to be when the first teaser will be shown, with a full release coming at the back-end of 2026 in a similar spot to where Legends: Z-A released this year.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for original Switch players, Gen 10 is likely to be the first main title released as a Switch 2 exclusive, setting a precedent for future releases to follow.</p>



<figure><figcaption>New generation. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-black-amp-white-remakes">Pokémon Black &amp; White Remakes</h3>



<p>Black and White are the next games in line for a remake, and were widely expected to be released this year, but Pokémon went quiet and, following on from the rather disappointing Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl in 2021, it could be that the entire approach has shifted.</p>



<p>Remakes of Gen 5 are inevitable at some point, however, and they’d be the perfect signing-off game for the Switch era, releasing on both the original console and Switch 2. </p>



<p>Black and White remakes in 2026 are far from a guarantee, however, as the aforementioned Gen 4 remake titles seem to have left a lasting impact, and not in a good way. That’s all for the best, though, as it’s better for time to be taken to hit the remakes in the way that Heart Gold and Soul Silver did, for example.</p>



<h3 id="h-more-pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansions">More Pokémon TCG Pocket Expansions</h3>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has achieved vast success in its first year since its initial release, and it’s only going to get bigger from here, which makes more expansions in the game in 2026 one of the easiest predictions to make.</p>



<p>TCG Pocket has moved into the Mega Evolution scene with the start of the ‘B’ sets, a trend likely to remain for the foreseeable future, but it’s already exciting to consider what could be on the horizon, considering the game has almost 30 years of TCG history to reflect back on for inspiration.</p>



<p>A 30th anniversary set in TCG Pocket seems to be a solid bet for sure, and there are plenty of options when Gen 10 comes around, too. </p>



<h3 id="h-another-pokemon-mobile-title">Another Pokémon Mobile Title</h3>



<p>A flurry of Pokémon titles have been released on mobile devices in recent years, including big hits like Pokémon Go, TCG Pocket, Cafe Remix, and more, so it isn’t hard to see another Pokémon title launch onto mobile in 2026.</p>



<p>It’s already been confirmed that Pokémon Champions will be released on mobile, but an entirely new game is possible. There are endless possibilities, with the ability to tie into existing games or offer something different entirely.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-lego-sets-make-a-wave">Pokémon LEGO Sets Make a Wave</h3>



<p>After an eternity of waiting, Pokémon and LEGO have finally partnered together, and the first sets from the huge collab will be released in 2026, but expect there to be a fight to secure them.</p>



<p>LEGO and Pokémon are both extremely popular hobbies, with both fanbases often having a fight to get the products they want, so don’t be surprised if you struggle to find any LEGO Pokémon products in your local store.</p>



<p>The good news is, LEGO is a lot better at making sure products are available long-term and in greater quantity than Pokémon’s TCG side, so it shouldn’t lead to a scalper frenzy.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/12/mcdonalds-pokemon-tcg-promotion-coming-to-the-u-s-for-franchises-30th-anniversary">a report from PokéBeach</a>, it will run from February into March, with exact dates depending on the country, but that's all the details known right now.</p>
<p>Past events — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/02/scalpers_and_collectors_buy_up_mcdonalds_pokemon_happy_meals">for the 25th anniversary, for example</a> — have seen scalpers rocking up to stores and buying <em>dozens</em> of Happy Meals to get the cards. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/mcdonalds_uk_plans_to_restrict_pokemon_happy_meal_toy_purchases">McDonald's in the UK</a> put a restriction on buying more than one extra card with your meal following the frenzy in the US, but that feels like trying to stop a geyser with a bathplug.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fjkismv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The Pokémon Company and Ronald have persevered, though - there was a Dragon-type collab <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-cards-soar-back-into-mcdonalds-uk-happy-meals">earlier in 2025</a>. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mcdonalds-japan-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-early-and-fans-blame-scalpers">back in August</a>, a three-day Pikachu event in Japan was stopped after 24 hours when demand for the card exceeded supply, with boxes of unopened cards turning up for sale online. <em>Shifty.</em> That one was particularly sought after, though, as the card featured exclusive artwork.</p>
<p>It's a shame that Pokémon cards just seem to attract a manic mix of the FOMO crowd (ask the folks at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/van-gogh-museum-fires-four-employees-following-pokemon-collaboration">Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum</a>) and straight-up scalpers, bringing out the worst in people who <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-scalpers-are-ignoring-tornado-warnings-just-to-nab-latest-card-collection">ignore tornado warnings</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/random-try-not-to-cringe-watching-this-video-of-a-pokemon-tcg-scalper">behave atrociously</a> to get their hands on fresh packs.</p>
<p>We'll see in February if TPC and McDonald's have any clever plans to combat the problem.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A PEGI rating has appeared for <em>Splatoon 3 </em>on Nintendo Switch 2, suggesting that a full Switch 2 Edition version of the game could be on the way soon.</p><p>The <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Splatoon+3" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">rating</a> (which was first spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/splatoon-3-rated-for-switch-2-in-europe" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gematsu</a>) lists the release date as December 31st, although that's almost certainly a placeholder, unless Nintendo intends to release the game in the next few hours. It's unlikely, but it's not impossible!</p><p>If a Switch 2 Edition of <em>Splatoon 3 </em>is planned, it'll be a different prospect to the free update released for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="838585b0-e552-447b-bbf4-87e2329e177e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a few months ago</a>, which was announced alongside a brand new <em>Splatoon </em>spinoff game. Nintendo hasn't revealed any new info about that project yet, but we'll probably learn more about <em>Splatoon Raiders </em>in the new year.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Splatoon 3 </em>could be getting a Switch 2 Edition version soon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Naturally, the game bears the same PEGI rating as its Switch version, which is to say a PEGI 7. The rating warns those buying <em>Splatoon 3 </em>about its "violence" and "in-game purchases", so if you're planning to pick it up on Switch 2, you have been warned.</p><p>The <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Switch 2 listing follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="606f040c-e9d7-4046-8557-17a8d3ce9a10" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">cessation of updates for the game</a> back in 2024, but don't worry if you haven't played for a while; the servers are very much still operational, so you can still enjoy games of <em>Splatoon 3 </em>whenever you like.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Splatoon 3</em>, it is, as you might expect, the third installment of the <em>Splatoon </em>series, and like its predecessors, the game revolves around quick shootouts in which the goal is to ink the most territory for your team (although other modes are available as well).</p><p>The game also features a single-player campaign that's a little more fleshed out than those of its predecessors, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-fresh-season-2024-side-order-gameplay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c071dd8-431c-4f24-a396-4cd2494ff2fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">roguelike-focused DLC</a> expansion that was released back in 2024.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Splatoon 3 </em>right now on Switch, and if this listing is to be believed, it'll be launching on Switch 2 soon as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the latest edition of the so-called '<strong><a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/state-of-the-sanderson-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of the Sanderson</a></strong>', the yearly recap that the popular fantasy author writes to let his fans know what he's worked on and what's next, <strong>Brandon Sanderson</strong> revealed that he's been talking to triple-A game companies to make a <strong>Mistborn game</strong> happen. Here's the relevant quote from the blog post:</p>



<p><em>I’ve started to get some real interest on the video game front, and I feel I’m finally getting established enough that we can make a Mistborn game happen. To that end, I’ve started talking to some AAA developers. This is at Step One only, but it’s an encouraging one. These rights were tied up with the film rights for the last… oh, six~seven years, so I didn’t get to test the market on them until recently.</em></p>



<p><em>I’m trying to do things differently this time in an effort to retain control of my video game rights. I already have interest from some major players in the Video Game industry (who I like a lot). So if you are a decision maker at a AAA studio, or a major independent, and you’ve always wanted to make a Mistborn or Stormlight game… well, you would want to contact my reps now.</em></p>



<p>The key change is that Sanderson had unwisely decided to license the film and game rights together, and ultimately, neither thing happened. In October 2016, the author selected DMG Entertainment as the licensee of not just Mistborn but the entire <strong>Cosmere</strong> (Sanderson's fantasy universe, where most of his books are set), and an adaptation of Mistborn: The Final Empire was planned, but the project stalled.</p>



<p>Presumably, the gaming rights have now reverted to the author, who is now free to seek a new partner for the game adaptation. There once was a project called Mistborn: Birthright, announced in 2012 and developed by Little Orbit (which would later be infamously known for the failure of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029260/Unsung_Story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsung Story</a>), but it was canceled.</p>



<p>Sanderson himself is a massive gamer. In early 2022, he made headlines when he jokingly <a href="https://wccftech.com/brandon-sanderson-complains-about-fromsoftwares-choice-of-george-r-r-martin-for-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complained</a> that<strong> FromSoftware</strong> had picked <strong>A Song of Ice and Fire</strong> author <strong>G.R.R. Martin</strong> to help them create the mythos of <strong>Elden Ring</strong>. He did contribute to a game shortly afterward, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-series-developer-announces-turn-based-tactical-game-moonbreaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working with <strong>Unknown Worlds</strong> on the turn-based strategy game <strong>Moonbreaker</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Still, there's no question that he's very excited about the prospect of a triple-A game set on <strong>Scadrial</strong> (the world where Mistborn takes place). As a massive fan of all things Sanderson, Mistborn very much included, I am equally intrigued. There's a lot of potential for an action RPG here, especially with the incredibly deep mythology already established by Sanderson and the cool allomancy and feruchemy magic systems.</p>



<p>Who would you pick as the ideal developer of a Mistborn game? Let us know in the comments!</p>

			<p>It's almost 2026, and while a new year is always exciting, a new month means another batch of PS Plus games is headed towards PS Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium tier subscribers. In what has practically become a monthly tradition, a new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-vous-revele-le-premier-jeu-du-mois-de-lannee-2026-60812">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> has revealed one of the games that kicks off the year for PS Plus Essential subscribers: Need for Speed Unbound.</p>



<p>The latest Need for Speed game in the franchise, Unbound arrived on current-gen consoles on December 2, 2022. It was a more-than-solid racer at the time of its launch, though it wasn't able to reach the highs that made the series so iconic. Though it <a href="https://wccftech.com/need-for-speed-unbound-charging-5-dollars-to-unlock-map-markers-new-races-challenges/">decidedly fell off the radar of players not too long after its debut,</a> developer Criterion Games and Codemasters have done a good job of updating it with multiple drops of new cars, tracks, challenge modes, etc. </p>



<p>As Wccftech's Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/need-for-speed-unbound/">put it in his review of the game at launch</a>, "<em>Need for Speed Unbound is the franchise’s best entry in a decade, although the competition for that title wasn't particularly stiff. The game offers polished tech, good (if slightly dated) open-world design, and a varied array of events and challenges, but still lags behind the current open-world racer pack leaders. The fantasy of becoming an underground racing champ is also hampered by a restrictive, ill-considered progression system. Nostalgic fans will find plenty to like here, and more general players might want to consider a test drive once the game is marked down, but “need” may be a strong word to attach to Criterion’s latest.</em>"</p>



<p>The game's last major update, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-unbound/news/end-of-kaizen-review">Volume 9, arrived earlier in 2025,</a> though Criterion has had its focus shift away from Need for Speed while it worked on delivering Battlefield 6 this past October. Its arrival as a PS Plus Essential game will technically be the second time it has been added to PlayStation's subscription service, as it was made a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-february-2024-assassins-creed-valhalla-nfs-unbound-tales/">PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalog title back in February 2024</a>.</p>



<p>So, unfortunately for those subscribers, you're technically getting one game less than you otherwise would if Unbound weren't already available to subscribers on the Extra or above tiers. Though there's always the chance that an added game coming to Extra and Premium subscribers only will make up for it.</p>



<p>It should also be mentioned that, while Billbil-kun has an immaculate record at this point when it comes to announcing PS Plus titles early (they've almost never been wrong), it is still an unofficial report at the time of this writing. So take it for what it's worth. </p>



<p>If you don't believe it'll be one of the three free games for Essential subscribers, and you wouldn't mind starting your 2026 by checking it out, then you can always grab it on the PS Store with the Ultimate Collection edition, currently at 85% off for PlayStation's Holiday Sale.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker’s HDMI Switch Crashes Below $10 With Final Discount, Compatible With TV, Laptop, PC, Xbox, Playstation, Projector, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-hdmi-switch-crashes-below-10-with-final-discount-compatible-with-tv-laptop-pc-xbox-playstation-projector-and-more-2000656187</link>
            <guid>1394902</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Don’t look now, but Amazon has this Anker HDMI switch on sale for 38% off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6623/">That shaves the price down by six whole dollars, bringing the price down from $16 to an even $10.</a></p>
<p>Old hats me remember the dark ages of television inputs. Between my cousins and I, we had an original NES that we kept at our grandmas house. This way we would always have something to do while over. This was when the SNES and even N64 had been out already, so we were retro gamers early on. Anyway, the TV in the backroom with the NES only had one coaxial hookup, which would always be set up to the cable box. It was at the back of the TV which was too heavy for any of us to move, so every visit started with one of us reaching our arm back there blindly to unscrew the cable box cable and then screw in the NES cable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6623/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Since those “switch the input to channel 3,” days, things have gotten much easier, with TVs offering multiple inputs which you can swap between. Though not every modern TV is equipped with enough ports. Maybe you’ve got a cable box, your Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X. If your TV isn’t packing at least four inputs, then you too will be living in the old days of reaching behind the TV to unplug one console to plug in another.</p>
<h2>HDMI Switching Simplified</h2>
<p>You don’t have to live like this. This is the exact scenario that the Anker HDMI switch was designed for. It has two inputs and one output. Just plug two of your consoles into the front end and out the back plug it into your TV. With just the click of a button, you can swap between either of the two inputs. It’s all hassle-free and you can say goodbye to reaching behind your TV to the jungle of tangled cables ever again.</p>



<p>The Anker HDMI switch has a wide range of compatibility. Set it up with a laptop, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, or even a streaming stick like a Fire TV or Roku. And then the other end can hook up to your TV, a monitor, a projector, or even an HDMI compatible VR headset.</p>
<p>It supports resolutions of up to 4K and refresh rates of up to 60Hz, so choose wisely which consoles you choose to go through this instead of your TV’s native HDMI inputs. You won’t be able to make use of the PlayStation 5 Pro’s high-frame rates of 120fps. Also, the switch does not support HDMI CEC. This is the tech that will turn your TV on the same time you turn on your Nintendo Switch or something like that.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6623/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Solving Mysteries In A World Without Answers]]></title>

            <guid>1394896</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Sometimes, on my better days, I think I know the answer to what keeps me up at night. Or that I have it in me to figure it out. I like those days because even though they start with a problem, I know where to go, what to do, or who to ask to solve it. That's a pretty good day. Not too many of those lately.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps this is why, when considering the year that was, mysteries – particularly video game mysteries – come to mind. Of all the entertainment released in 2025, I was drawn to these the most: I know the dirty secret of the Roottree family. I know why Evelyn Deane disappeared from Blake Manor. I know the truth about Mt. Holly Estate. Some questions wormed into my head, and I answered them. I had problems, and I solved them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When executed well, sleuthing suits video games even more naturally than violence, a contest between the programming logic of video games and the human ability to think laterally. One of the first things you learn about coding is that computers are literal to a degree that is, frankly, madness-inducing. The genius of any particular application, including video games, lies in how elegantly it hides the fact that it is reducing your every input into a cascade of simple binary decisions. However, even with a program designed to do all of the heavy lifting for you, even with all the cumulative experience of the internet at your disposal, sometimes the thing that lies between you and your goal is the wildly frustrating task of figuring out how to ask the right question.&nbsp;</p><p>This also happens to be the engine that drives a good mystery.&nbsp;</p><p>On a basic level, a video game mystery narrativizes one of the most fundamental computational functions: Querying a database. (The narrative designer <a href="https://brunodias.itch.io/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bruno Dias</u></a> has called games expressly built around that function "database thrillers" for this reason, going so far as to jam out his own – quite good! –&nbsp; text parser version of one, <a href="https://brunodias.itch.io/kinophobia?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Kinophobia</u></em></a>.) Defining the right parameters that will separate the endless sea of useless data from the precious and narrow set of information you can actually use, perhaps to form another query in turn, rendering previously useless data into something vital. Once again: Asking the right questions.&nbsp;</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The Roottrees Are Dead (Evil Trout)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2754380/The_Roottrees_are_Dead/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Roottrees Are Dead</u></em></a>, Jeremy Johnston and Robin Ward's 2025 remake of Johnston's browser game of the same name, operates on this fundamental level. It casts the player as an amateur genealogist, asked by a mysterious client to trace the family tree of the Roottree sisters. Recently deceased in a private plane crash just before the start of the game, the sisters are heirs to a massive family fortune, and their untimely demise means a significant windfall for the extended family.&nbsp;</p><p>The pleasures of <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em> lie in doing the task it sets out for you in its simulated tactility. The game is set in 1998, and in researching the Roottree family, the player bounces between a table with relevant documents and photographs to examine, a corkboard where they lay out the family tree, and a desktop computer with a blistering 56k modem for surfing the information superhighway. A notebook, available at the push of a button, allows you to type notes or collect highlighted passages from your research materials. Using all these tools, a family's history becomes a giant jigsaw puzzle, a deductive riddle that feels impossible until you just buckle down and do the work. One good lead yields another, and then another, and finally you have names and faces and the puzzle begins to take shape. </p><p>But these aren't just puzzle pieces: They're people. The connections and if/then questions that determine where they fit in the Roottree pedigree are just part of the story. What makes <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em> such an exceptional game is in the way it tells you from the start that one branch of the family tree is off-limits until the end, an optional question where the answer isn't so much there to be found as it is inferred. In laying out the endgame this way, Johnston and Ward provoke the player: Were you merely solving the puzzle? Or were you paying attention to the story it told? You know the what – how about why? Can you see the people hidden between the data points?&nbsp;</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The Seance Of Blake Manor (Spooky Doorway)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the twilight of the 19th century, the massive disruption of the industrial revolution left European high society in a state of unease, as the edges of a carefully-constructed social order began to crumble. Literacy spread among the middle class, the world shrank as steamships sent people all over the globe, new customs and experiences shook the once–strong foundations of Christian institutions. For many people of means and those who aspired to such status, the church was insufficient at addressing their moment of malcontent. The occult took root.&nbsp;</p><p>Set in the final three days of October 1897, <a href="https://aftermath.site/seance-of-blake-manor/"><em><u>The Seance of Blake Manor</u></em></a> follows Declan Ward, a detective from Dublin, after he receives a mysterious commission to investigate the disappearance of Evelyn Deane. Deane was one of a number of mystics and magic-curious from all over the world invited to Blake Manor, a hotel in Western Ireland, for a Grand Seance to take place on Samhain, the day when the veil between the mortal world and the spirit realm is thinnest. Assuming the role of Ward, the player wanders the eponymous manor, snooping through rooms and asking guests questions, each exchange or observation deepening the mystery of Ms. Deane's disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em> is a work of folk horror, which means that history has something to say here, whether the story's characters are able to hear it or not. (They will pay if they don't.) While a far more traditional narrative than <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em>, <em>Blake Manor </em>is similarly powerful in its subtext. Every character is haunted by some private thing that has brought them to the seance; each is fleeing something or in denial or mourning or desperation. It causes them to be cruel, selfish, reckless. You can piece these backstories together for as many characters as you wish – the game encourages you to solve them all – but what lingers for me is the weight of all that history.&nbsp;</p><p>In the search for Evelyn Deane, Declan Ward must repeatedly contend with the beliefs of others. He learns much about Irish folklore, of the fae and the Other World and the Tuatha Dé Danann, the pagan deities worshipped in Gaelic Ireland before Christianity arrived in the country. He sees evidence of the ways both Catholics and Protestants have incorporated those pagan traditions, turning them into saints or holy days. He meets people from around the world who have their own version of those same saints and gods.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Blake Manor </em>requires you to note all this, and think about it some. Learning the faith of each character you meet is integral to solving its mystery. But in this story, Christ and Allah are both just characters in books. The pagan deities, however, are very much real.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't believe this is the game choosing a side, asserting that the pagans had it right and everything else is just a fairytale. Rather, I think <em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em>'s choice to slowly, deliberately communicate that, in its fiction, the folkloric deities are real is meant to underline the ways in which the indigenous beliefs and cultures of a place are never really gone, even after waves of colonization, industry, and plunder. The spirits are real in <em>Blake Manor</em> because we have fooled ourselves into thinking that wealthy men who build monuments to their fortunes and family name are the only ones who get to write their stories upon the land, forgetting that the land might have stories of its own. Will you seek them out, even if you don't have to? Will you carry that history within you, and keep it alive just a little while longer?&nbsp;</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Blue Prince (Dogubomb)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like many others this year, I have lost <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review/" rel="noreferrer">countless nights</a> in search of the secret 46th room in the Mt. Holly Estate, and for the bewildering number of mysteries Room 46 is but a mere prelude to. I have many of the answers I set out to find, but I still have further questions beyond them. I also know that the point here may very well be learning to quit.&nbsp;</p><p>It's remarkable that Tonda Ros' <em>Blue Prince</em> is structured as a roguelike, a genre defined by its endlessness and infinite possibility. This brings the game in conflict with its narrative setup, which casts the player as Simon P. Jones, a young boy who has learned his wealthy uncle has willed his entire estate to him – provided he can find the hidden 46th room in the logic-defying 45-room mansion that changes its layout every day. Such an explicit goal implies an ending, and upon achieving it, credits do roll. But as anyone who has played <em>Blue Prince </em>knows, that ending is merely <em>an</em> ending. It is also not a solution. Simon's strange quest, the magical nature of the house – which, after enough excursions, is clearly diegetic and not just an allowance for gameplay – are the first of many <em>whys</em> that are left unsaid by that initial ending.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus the real mystery of <em>Blue Prince </em>begins, but what that mystery is largely depends on the player. What about this house and the family who built it did you notice, or care about? What in its many possible configurations, its hidden foundations, its many scrawled notes that double back and recontextualize previous findings, bedevils you? Is the game truly endless, like its genre structure implies? <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending/"><u>Can you be at peace with that</u></a>? Or do you refuse to accept it?&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Consider again how well-suited games are for mystery, how they can present players with impossible enigmas but also guide and nudge them towards asking the right questions. Games can assure players that the world is knowable. We talk about power fantasies, and perhaps this is the most seductive one, even more so than those that give us guns or impossible abilities or great destinies. The fantasy of a world that fits together.&nbsp;</p><p>I find that fantasy alluring. Justice has been lacking in my lifetime, and it may not be my lot to see it win the day. I like the idea that asking the right question is the first step to making sense of the world. And if I ask the right question and then answer it skillfully, I can find some kind of peace. Or at least, know what it is that will give me a direction to walk until I find it.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a delusion, but a useful one. Answers aren't what make questions worth asking, but go long enough without finding your way to one and, well. That's a lot of sleepless nights. Sometimes you need a ballast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If there is a reason these games are the mysteries that have resonated with me most strongly this year, this is why: because while they provide all the pleasures of a solvable problem, of crimes answered for, they <em>also</em> present me with so much I cannot know. Of how much escapes the record of material evidence in the gaps of a family tree or a nigh-forgotten folkloric tradition or the inscrutable patterns of an ever-shifting mansion. There is tragedy in this, but also grace, and humility. In grappling with them, solving a mystery takes on another, more durable purpose: making peace with what I don't know, so I can be brave with what I do know. Every day I'm able to do that would make for a good day. Every year I strive for that goal would be a good year.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>2025 was practically defined by Indie Games, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> running away with (<a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stripped-of-indie-game-awards-goty-win-over-genai-use/">almost</a>) every Game of the Year win, Hollow Knight Silksong and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">Hades 2</a> finally landing and consuming the entire industry for at least a month. While other titles like Peak, Blue Prince, The Seance of Blake Manor, Dispatch, Ball x Pit, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eternal-strands-the-world-is-your-playground/">Eternal Strands</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/routine-review-lunar-software-raw-fury/">Routine</a>, and Megabonk, to name a few, stole attention away from big-name releases across the whole year.</p>



<p>So, will 2026 be any different? We can probably bet on at least one unsuspecting indie game taking the spotlight that no one sees coming, but it's more of a gamble to say 2026 will be as defined by indies as 2025 was.</p>



<p>That said, there are a few indie games that we know are coming up that could absolutely dominate the conversation, even be Game of the Year contenders. These are Wccftech's most anticipated indie games for 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-ii-march-2026-pc">Slay the Spire II (March 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Slay-the-Spire-2-Key-Art-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Slay the Spire 2 key art. Image credit: Mega Crit</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>A game that made our list for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">2025's Most Anticipated Indie Games</a>, Slay the Spire II returns to the 2026 list after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-delayed-march-2026-mega-crit/">was delayed "<em>to a secret Thursday in March 2026</em>" back in September 2025</a>. Mega Crit may not have put a specific release date on it, but specifying that it will arrive on one of four possible Thursdays feels like the studio is confident it won't have to delay the early access release again - at least not so far that it won't arrive in 2026.</p>



<p>Slay the Spire II is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most popular deckbuilding roguelike games of all time, and Mega Crit is one of the biggest success stories to come from the indie world. It's early access arrival will be one of the bigger events of 2026 for indie games, and even in its early access form, it could be a potential contender for Game of the Year 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-mina-the-hollower-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2">Mina the Hollower (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mina-the-Hollower-Delayed.png"></a><figcaption><em>Mina the Hollower. Image credit: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another game that was supposed to arrive in 2025 but got pushed into 2026, Mina the Hollower is the long-awaited return of Yacht Club Games, the studio behind the critically acclaimed platformer Shovel Knight. What <a href="https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-delayed-yacht-club-games/">was not intended to be "<em>a major delay</em>"</a> ended up becoming one, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDY4MDU4MywiZXhwIjoxNzY1Mjg1MzgzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNk41RDBLR0NURlkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.tTCDzLvXeRacM9mzJfRv3juJV7WGiMAKvYS8DWRQBFs">a report from Bloomberg</a> revealed deeper issues within the studio as to why the game was taking so long.</p>



<p>That said, Yacht Club is an incredibly talented team, and this old-school Legend of Zelda-style adventure game with an energetic mouse and the same incredible pixel-art the studio is known for behind it all means that you cannot count Mina the Hollower out.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch">The Eternal Life of Goldman (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman_KEYART-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman. Image credit: Weappy Studio</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Weappy Studio's upcoming 2D platformer, The Eternal Life of Goldman, is arguably one of the most visually stunning upcoming games. Its art will remind you of Cuphead almost immediately, and if the platforming gameplay can match how good it looks, then this could be one of the surprising hits of 2026.</p>



<p>If it arrives in 2026, that is. There's currently no release window for it, but it appeared at multiple showcases in 2025. If it wasn't going to be ready to release soon, or at least if Weappy Studios didn't think it would be ready, we probably would have seen less of it. Hopefully, once 2026 begins, we'll start to see more of the game and get a proper release date. For now, we'll wait with baited breath.</p>



<h2 id="h-replaced-march-12-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Replaced (March 12, 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Replaced-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Official key art for Replaced. Image credit: Sad Cat Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Sad Cat Studios has had a long road to the release of Replaced. When it was first showcased in 2021, it was one of the highlights of that year's Xbox show, and it immediately shot up to being one of the most highly anticipated indie games. At least, that was until <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">Russia's invasion of Ukraine interrupted its development</a>, and the game had to be delayed.</p>



<p>Now, it's due out on March 12, 2026, and it hasn't lost any of the lustre it had when it was shown in 2021. It still looks like it will be this incredible, cyberpunk adventure that leans on some gorgeous-looking pixel art and a deep narrative. Who knows if it will live up to those expectations, of course, but it's exciting to know that Sad Cat Studios is getting the chance to try.</p>



<h2 id="h-mouse-p-i-for-hire-march-19-2026-pc-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-xbox-one-nintendo-switch">MOUSE: P.I. For Hire (March 19, 2026 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mouse-P.I.-For-Hire.png"></a><figcaption><em>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire. Image credit: Fumi Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Once the original likeness of Mickey Mouse was old enough to be in the public domain, everyone knew that we had an onslaught of Mouse-adjacent projects coming our way. One of them, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3094480/Bad_Cheese/">Bad Cheese</a>, was a first-person horror game that arrived in September 2025. Another, MOUSE: P.I. For Hire, is a first-person shooter where you play as private investigator Jack Pepper in what looks like an eccentric and bombastic adventure.</p>



<p>It's another game on this list that has been a long time coming, since it was first revealed back in 2023. It even stars Troy Baker as the lead character. All together with its art, animation, gameplay, and narrative, MOUSE: P.I. For Hire could be one of 2026's top indie games when it arrives on March 19, 2026. </p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>2XKO</em>, it's a <em>League of Legends</em>-themed fighting game that includes characters from the celebrated MOBA.</p><p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f3ec28b2-9e16-4ae6-a24a-11a8af39db67" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in 2024</a> (well, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-project-l-gameplay-details-revealed-by-riot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6b4d1a85-12a2-46e6-82af-d985715a9e5d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">officially, at any rate</a>), the game features characters like Illaoi, Yasuo, and Teemo, and new characters are being added over time, so if your favorite isn't in the game yet, they may well be introduced soon.</p><p>After being in development for some years, <em>2XKO </em>launched in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-early-access-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f9a82e6e-d1fa-4755-bf89-d3f786e17e74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in October last year</a>.

              <p>ChatGPT reportedly wants to put sponsored ads in your AI psychosis sessions. The <em>League of Legends</em> fighting game is almost out. And <em>Pluribus</em>‘ Rhea Seehorn once <a href="https://x.com/rheangelseehorn/status/2006038032537805032">starred in a<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> tutorial CD-ROM</a> from Best Buy. It’s the last Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture, for 2025. We’ll see you on the other side where more great gaming debates await, like whether the myth of the “solo dev” should be retired for good or is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3mbbvyts6l72g">still a useful descriptor</a>. 2026 feels like the year we’ll finally get to the bottom of this, and so much more!</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rhea Seehorn on her early role in the Magic the Gathering video game 🧙‍♀️ <a href="https://t.co/0knL13ppkc">pic.twitter.com/0knL13ppkc</a></p> <p>— 𝙧𝙝𝙚𝙖 𝙨𝙚𝙚𝙝𝙤𝙧𝙣 𝙛𝙖𝙣 (@rheangelseehorn) <a href="https://twitter.com/rheangelseehorn/status/2006038032537805032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>ChatGPT results could soon be manipulated by “sponsored” bots</h2> <p>That’s according to a new report <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-ads-push-starts-taking-shape">from <em>The Information</em></a> which points to conversations among some employees at OpenAI about how to inject ads into the popular bot-querying platform. A hypothetical example includes asking for recommended ibuprofen dosages for headaches and being recommended an Advil instead. Basically, the shitty version of Google, except you have to pay a subscription to access it.</p>

 <p>“As ChatGPT becomes more capable and widely used, we’re looking at ways to continue offering more intelligence to everyone,” a spokesperson for OpenAI told <em>The Information</em> this month. “As part of this, we’re exploring what ads in our product could look like. People have a trusted relationship with ChatGPT, and any approach would be designed to respect that trust.”</p>

 <h2>The <em>League of Legends</em> fighting game arrives next month</h2> <p>A console release date of January 20 for <em>2XKO</em> was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/2xko-launches-january-20-2026">briefly leaked after a new trailer for the game went up on YouTube early</a>. Launched in early access on PC back in October, the full launch will see Riot Games’ free-to-play fighter arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as well.</p>

 <h2><em>River City Ransom: Underground</em> is about to disappear</h2> <p>The 2017 beat ’em up is set to be delisted from Steam at any moment now. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/422810">store page</a> has already lost all of its images and gameplay footage. “Due to the expiration of a licensing agreement, this game will be removed from sale on Steam,” the developer shared in a new update. “The delisting process is currently underway. <wbr>If you already own the game, nothing changes — it will remain available in your Steam Library, and you can continue to download and play as usual.”</p>

 <p>The <i>Kunio-kun</i> franchise is currently owned and overseen by Arc Systems.</p> <h2>Atlus isn’t rushing the next <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em></h2> <p>“When we initially set out to create this game, we had the ambitions of hoping to cultivate this game into one of our brands within Atlus, like a pillar,” director Katsura Hashino recently <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/refantazio-director-katsura-hashino">told <em>Game Informer</em></a>. “With that being said, just because we had a certain level of success, we don’t want to just jump on that and quickly put out something as a sequel.”</p>

 <p>He went on, “We want to really give it some thought and make sure that if we are able to continue on in this series, we’re putting together something that is building on the values that we were able to infuse into this game, and something that would be worthwhile for the fans that would be waiting for it.”</p>

 <h2>Geoff Keighley shares how the <em>Mega Man</em> reveal at The Game Awards 2025 came together</h2>   <p>“A few weeks later, I was at Capcom HQ in Osaka,” he wrote <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS5WvBMD8DA/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1">on Instagram</a>. “The lights dimmed, the Mega Man theme played, and through the door walked Minamitani-san in a full Mega Man outfit, alongside Izumi-san, dressed as Dr. Wily. It was classic Capcom.</p> <p>Keighley continued, “We talked about their vision for the next Mega Man, and then they handed me a controller to play a very early ROM and give feedback.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="ee3534a19a81f"><a title="Switch 2 eShop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ee3534a19a81f/switch-2-eshop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I love browsing the eShop, and the clicky sounds as you scroll across it.</p>
<p>The pleasing crispness of the <em>chick</em>! sound goes so well with the Joy-Con button feel. There’s that camera shutter <em>snap!</em> if you scroll across a game’s gallery in quick succession, and on Switch 2 there’s a thumb-cheek <em>pop!</em> when you hover over a 2-wide box. Genuinely, big fan.</p>
<p>It’s partly why I even liked OG eShop — or at least found it absorbing — with its weird Y2K modem lag every time you moved and that old-school anticipation of waiting for things to load or change, wondering <em>did I even press the button?</em> but not daring to re-press in case I did. You might overshoot!</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> like the new one better, obviously. Now nicely responsive as I scroll down the Coming Soon section with OCD completionism - <em>middle down, left right right left</em> (and the reverse obviously for the next line down, I don’t want to unbalance the universe) - <em>click click click</em>, and everything is tactile like digi-brail, everything touched like I'm thumbing across book spines. I think this is fun?</p>
<p>But even more fun (!) than all this is then adding things to my wishlist.</p>
<p>I don’t just add games I recognise and would like to buy or play, but — I’ve now realised — use it as a sort of scrapbook; of thumbnails I liked, weirdness I was intrigued by, a repository of ideas, nostalgia triggers, or more. The wishlist heart is my eShop ‘like’ button, and I try to not self-censor if something catches my eye (barring blatant anime boobs, etc).</p>
<figure data-uuid="d4f579bdc640c"><a title="Switch eShop Wishlisting Games 29" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d4f579bdc640c/switch-eshop-wishlisting-games-29.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Redblack Spade</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>What can we learn from this silly habit, from the patterns and trends?</p>
<p>For one thing, I seem to really, <em>really</em> like hand-illustrated fantasy art overlain by serif font and a vaguely wistful title.</p>
<p>Why else would <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvestella">Harvestella</a> (bucolic name, tree in thumbnail), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trinity_trigger">Trinity Trigger</a> (illustrated artstyle, tree-adjacent thing in thumbnail) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/various_daylife">Various Daylife</a> (nonsensical/wholesome name, treeless thumbnail but appealing screenshot of characters walking through gamecube era grass-textures in gallery) be in my wishlist?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/star_ocean_the_second_story_r">Star Ocean R Hyper Turbo</a> (or something) has a gallery image of characters traipsing through a golden hour wheat field in pixel-grained glory, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/egglia_rebirth">Egglia</a> looks like an homage to the <strong>Legend of Mana</strong> style, the original website of which I used to hang out in just for its gorgeous pastel tones and Victorian-storybook style of fantasy illustration (<em>and trees</em>). I will not play any of these games.</p>
<p>In general, there’s lots of open-air adventure suggested by JRPG thumbnails. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_yumia_the_alchemist_of_memories_and_the_envisioned_land">Atelier Yumia</a> (which I think is set in a kingdom of genetically thick-thighed females?) has been there for ages even though I played the demo and it was very not for me. But the image has a lovely pea-green sunset behind Yumia (?) in the classic rule of thirds and it doth please my eyes to roam across it.</p>

<p>Beyond fantasy, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/milkmaid_of_the_milky_way">Milkmaid of the Milky Way</a> has a lyrical title and evokes an old book cover, with its strangely proportioned golden ship and enough sky to suggest sci-fi scope. But I've now actually read the description for the first time ever and apparently it's about some Norwegian lass and rhyming couplets? Whatever, the cover is evocative enough to keep.</p>
<p>To be honest, I may actually play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/a_space_for_the_unbound">A Space for the Unbound</a>. But what about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_from_toyotoki_arrival_of_the_witch">Tales from Toyotoki: Arrival of the Witch</a>, with its bifurcated thumbnail that looks like a PowerPoint slide? Looking at the screenshots I can confirm I will not - it looks like a visual novel and so I worry it won’t have a jump button. But both give vaguely (or in the case of ASFTU, explicitly) Shinkai vibes of hanging out with cleanly drawn anime teens and spiritual themes in pristine urban evocations, and both use a blue-purple in their art and character outlines which looks lovely. (Also, ASFTU’s title writing is nicely aligned.)</p>

<p>Scrolling through my wishlist I also see unintended rhymes, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bahnsen_knights">Bahnsen Knights</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tenement">Tenement</a>, and now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bermuda_survivor">Bermuda Survivor</a> forming a trio of black backgrounds burst through with '80s-neon pop.</p>
<p>But let's go further, to things wishlisted <em>mainly</em> for their titles or phrases.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/qualia_the_path_of_promise">Qualia</a> looks like a hentai game? There are certainly girls with improbable-looking breasts. But it's called 'Qualia', which an English professor once told me means the <em>whatness</em> of something (or something?) and transports me in time and space and perspective enough to add to the list. See also: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/room_of_depression">Room of Depression</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/looking_up_i_see_only_a_ceiling">Looking Up I See Only A Ceiling</a> (which is practically a poem in itself and actually looks pretty interesting).</p>
<p>Less lyrical are the ‘games’ I add because of their pleasing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7dx2Z9G7Mk">Ronseal-like directness</a>, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/easy_dice_for_rpgtabletop">Easy Dice for RPG/Tabletop - GOLD EDITION</a> (what makes it Gold-er though?!).</p>

<p>Others have legitimately good thumbnails a YouTuber would be proud of, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/car_parking_madness_school_drive_mechanic_car_games_simulator_2023">Car Parking Madness School Drive Mechanic Car Simulator 2023</a> - with its strange Pro/Noob arrows in the thumbnail for two different cars, both of which frankly look perfectly well parked. But there’s almost a question in the image, the tension of <em>wait, what?</em> The game has already started!</p>
<p>Some games I wishlist to preserve my baffled curiosity. Who exactly made <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/america_wild_hunting">America Wild Hunting</a>, with its overexposed photo backgrounds and stock military <strong>MASH</strong>-style font and thumbnail of an eagle in crosshairs? Where do they live? What do they love (except hunting)?</p>
<p>And what exactly <em>is</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/about_an_elf">About An Elf</a> (which has been in my wishlist for ages as a sort of fringe outpost that broadens my impression of the gaming landscape), and why is the thigh-high riding face-painted woman riding an animal that looks like a polar bear shagged a ferret? Why are there gnomes? Did someone make this out of passion? Art? These are questions that provoke the soul, so I guess just the <em>page</em> is art. Get on the wishlist.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gorsd">GORSD</a> might be one of my favourite thumbnails, of a disconcerting goat-head smiling a human-teethed grimace no one could love.</p>
<p>Nicely, the game’s vibe actually lived up to this strangeness — I do actually <em>buy</em> games, too — though I could never get the hang of the play proper. The surrealism was worth the coffee price, enough to keep it on the list even though I’ve bought the game, though the wish has been granted.</p>
<p>Indeed, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/beyond_good_and_evil_20th_anniversary_edition">Beyond Good &amp; Evil Anniversary Edition</a> I’ll wishlist partly with some vague intention to one day replay it, but mainly because I already know it and love it and enjoy the shorthand associations of seeing the cover thumbnail.</p>
<p>Whereas I've never got round to looking up what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/what-is-eggconsole-full-game-list-pc-88-msx2-on-nintendo-switch-best-games-to-start">EGGCONSOLE games</a> <em>are</em>, and don’t really want to just yet. Instead, I get to enjoy the uncollapsed Schrödinger potential energy, the ongoing mystery.</p>
<p>Also, did you know there's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chubby_cat_2">Chubby Cat</a> <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chubby_cat_2">2</a></em>?</p>
<figure data-uuid="5951a3ddf07d4"><a title="Switch eShop Wishlisting Games 17" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5951a3ddf07d4/switch-eshop-wishlisting-games-17.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Springloaded</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The point is, I love all this, my own skewed-kaleidoscope of gaming paraphernalia, of images and words and those big background-colour changes on pages with galleries I can scroll through with face buttons and 'R'/'L' clicks.</p>
<p>It reminds me a little of a mispent youth poring over video game magazines and experiencing most games as things described, screenshotted, mysterious allusions instead of things I actually played. An ecosystem of enthusiasm built as much from the discourse and the depiction as the game itself, and a hobby that was also a portal into different worlds and art styles and ideas.</p>
<p>Would it be a stretch to call eShop browsing a 'game', this engaging thing done with pad in hand?</p>




<p>Maybe I should just get Instagram.</p>
