<p>In 1994, Hewlett-Packard released a miracle machine: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_200LX">HP 200LX</a> pocket-size PC. In the depths of the device, among the MS-DOS productivity apps built into its fixed memory, there lurked a first-person maze game called <em>Lair of Squid</em>. Intrigued by the game, we tracked down its author, Andy Gryc, and probed into the title's mysterious undersea origins.</p>

<p>"If you ask my family, they’ll confirm that I’ve been obsessed with squid for a long time," Gryc told Ars Technica. "It’s admittedly very goofy—and that’s my fault—although I was inspired by <i data-stringify-type="italic">Doom</i>, which had come out relatively recently."</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Lair of Squid</i>, you're trapped in an underwater labyrinth, seeking a way out while avoiding squid roaming the corridors. A collision with any cephalopod results in death. To progress through each stage and ascend to the surface, you locate the exit and provide a hidden, scrambled code word. The password is initially displayed as asterisks, with letters revealed as you encounter them within the maze.</p>

<p>Buckle up for a tale of rogue coding, cephalopod obsession, and the most unexpected Easter egg in palmtop history. This is no fish story—it's the saga of <em>Lair of Squid</em>.</p>
<h2>A computer in the palm of your hand</h2>
<p>Introduced in 1994, the HP 200LX palmtop PC put desktop functionality in a pocket-size package. With a small QWERTY keyboard, MS-DOS compatibility, and a suite of productivity apps, the clamshell 200LX offered a vision of one potential future of mobile computing. It featured a 7.91 MHz 80186 CPU, a monochrome 640x200 CGA display, and 1–4 megabytes of RAM.</p>

<p>I've <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/gear-envy-my-collection-of-500-plus-pieces-of-computer-and-gaming-hardware">collected</a> vintage computers since 1993, and people frequently offer to send me old devices they'd rather not throw away. Recently, a former HP engineer sent me his small but nice collection of '90s <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-golden-age-of-hp-palmtop-pcs">HP handheld palmtop computers</a>, including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_95LX">95LX</a> (1991), <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=198">100LX</a> (1993), and 200LX.</p>
<p>HP designed its portable LX series to run many MS-DOS programs that feature text mode or CGA graphics, and each includes built-in versions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3">Lotus 1-2-3</a> spreadsheet, a word processor, terminal program, calculator, and more.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/3010/hp-95lx-games-from-compuserve-in-the-1990s">owned a 95LX</a> as a kid (a hand-me-down from my dad's friend), which came with a simplistic overhead maze game called <a href="https://archive.org/details/TigerFoxV2.11990EverettKaserAction"><em>TigerFox</em></a>. So imagine my surprise in 2024, when trawling through the productivity and personal organization apps on that 200LX, to find a richly detailed first-person maze game based around cephalopods, of all things.</p>
<p>(I was less surprised to find an excellent built-in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/"><em>Minesweeper</em></a> clone, <em>Hearts and Bones</em>, which is definitely a more natural fit for the power and form of the 200LX itself.)</p>
<p><em>Lair of Squid</em> isn't a true <em>Doom</em> clone since it's not a first-person shooter (in some ways, it's more like a first-person <em>Pac-Man</em> without pellets), but its mere existence—on a black-and-white device best suited for storing phone numbers and text notes—deserves note as one of the weirdest and most interesting pack-in games to ever exist.</p>
<p>Just after discovering <em>Lair of Squid</em> on my device earlier this year, I <a href="https://x.com/benjedwards/status/1786944643701125358">tweeted</a> about it, and I extracted the file for the game (called "maze.exe") from the internal ROM drive and sent it to DOS gaming historian <a href="https://ko-fi.com/dosnostalgic">Anatoly Shashkin</a>, who put the game <a href="https://archive.org/details/LairOfSquidHP200lx">on The Internet Archive</a> so anyone can play it in their browser.</p>
<p>After that, I realized that I wanted to figure out who wrote this quirky game, and thanks to a post on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.classicdosgames.com/interviews/everettkaser.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.classicdosgames.com/interviews/everettkaser.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">RGB Classic Games</a>, I found a name: Andy Gryc. With some luck in cold-emailing, I found him.</p>

You can get the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review"><strong>DualSense Edge</strong></a> for $174.99 (about $24 off) via <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PS5-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller%2F1707140316%2F">Walmart’s</a> online-only deal, dropping the specialized gamepad down to its lowest price to date.</p><p>The highlight of the DualSense Edge is its impeccable software integration with the PS5. You can fine-tune up to four profiles that each have your own personal tweaks for things like stick sensitivity and custom rear button controls, and it’s easy to swap between profiles on the fly. The Edge also has all the haptics and features of the standard DualSense, along with extras like hair trigger lockouts, interchangeable stick toppers, and two styles of rear paddles / buttons.</p><p>Now, the DualSense Edge does have some noteworthy faults for such a pricey controller, like slightly anemic battery life and sticks as prone to drift as its cheaper counterpart packed with every PS5. However, Sony at least baked in some features that somewhat stymie these shortcomings — like a lengthy USB charging cable that has a nifty locking mechanism and user-replaceable stick modules that you can purchase later for $20 if yours ever catch some drift (if <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/stick-module-for-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller">you ever find them in stock</a>, of course).</p><div><p>Sony’s pro-style controller, the DualSense Edge, might suffer from shorter battery life than the standard DualSense model, but it features great software integration with the PlayStation 5 and plenty of customizable components. </p></div><p>This sale on the Edge is part of Walmart’s greater sales event running counter to Amazon’s upcoming Prime Day, which is scheduled for July 16th and 17th. The imaginatively named “Walmart Deals” event runs through July 11th, and in addition to the DualSense Edge, there are notable sales like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/8/24194403/apple-macbook-air-m1-laptop-walmart-early-access-deal-sale">M1 MacBook Air for $649</a>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
If the absence of any positive Dead Space 2 remake news has been getting you down, there's at least one new way to get a bit of Necromorph in your life right now, even if it's probably not quite what fans were hoping for. EA's sci-fi horror series is the focus of a new Battlefield 2024 limited-time PvE mode, Outbreak, which is available to play now.
</p>
<p>
Outbreak, described as a "high-intensity survival mode", pits up to four players against hordes of Augmented Targets (which regrettably look more like slightly fleshy crash test dummies than Necromorphs) as they travel across the Redacted map toward their extraction point.
</p>
<p>
Starting at the western end, the goal is to pass through eight sectors while facing off against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. Players get one life per wave (downed players respawn on the next wave provided at least one squad mate survives) and Ascension points earned from defeating enemies can used at armoury stations to purchase weapons along the way.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
By playing Outbreak, participants can unlock the Future Imperfect epic weapon charm, Genesis/Necrosis epic player card, Unifier rare player tag, and Made Anew epic MP28 skin.
</p>
<p>
Outbreak mode is available from today, 9th July, and runs until next Tuesday, 16th July. It arrives as part of Battlefield 2024's 7.40 update, which also brings a number of quality of life improvements, as per developer DICE's <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-7-4-0">latest patch notes</a>. 7.40 is the latest release for Battlefield 2024's seventh season, which will also <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/whats-ahead-2042">be its last</a>.

<p>
As for Dead Space, its status as a series remains unclear. EA Motive's remake of the original Dead Space launched to significant acclaimed last year, but a subsequent report <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-2-remake-was-reportedly-in-development-but-not-any-more">claimed</a> its sales were "lacklustre" and that a planned Dead Space 2 remake has since been canned. There's some small sliver of hope for Dead Space fans, hoewver, in that EA took the unusual step of commenting on the report, insisting, "There is no validity to this story".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/concord-sonys-upcoming-hero-shooter-gets-pc-specs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Concord was announced during a PlayStation Showcase in 2023, and the time has come for the game to be released. The release is just around the corner, with its official release date dropping on August 23rd. Since <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-pre-orders-beta-price-post-launch-updates-free/">the game's release</a> is soon, the developers have <a href="https://x.com/PlayConcord/status/1810392214888952262" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the PC system requirements you will need to play Concord.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the specs needed at a minimum level and a recommended level aren't as hefty as people may have expected. While the game is also available on PlayStation 5, many players will want to play it on PC to try and get a better visual experience.</p>
<p>Regardless of what settings you are trying to run the game on, it's necessary to have the game installed on an SSD and have at least an Intel i-7 or AMD Ryzen 7 processor. You can run the game at the absolute minimum settings with an Intel Core i7-8700k or AMD Ryzen 7 2700x. As you scale up the settings, you will want a more powerful CPU, such as the Intel Core i7-10700k or AMD Ryzen 7 3700x.</p>
<p>When it comes to GPUs, there is a lot of wiggle room as there are plenty of graphics cards capable of running this game regardless of settings. At a minimum, you'll want an NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT. As you scale up towards ultra settings, you can see a significant rise in graphics card quality. Instead, you'll want an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070Ti or AMD Radeon 7900 XT.</p>
<p>Regarding memory, 8GB DDR4 is fine if you are okay with playing the game on minimum settings, but you'll want 16 GB DDR4 RAM for higher settings. The game also isn't too bad regarding the size of the installation. Many modern games have quite hefty download sizes, but Concord will only occupy 30GB of your drive. Overall, it's fair to say that Concord's requirements are quite decent and aren't as taxing on the wallet as some other games have been of late.</p>

And it’s an absolute joy. Even when a story falls flat, <em>Night Springs</em> is a great argument for studios to make shorter, but still high-quality, experiences at the AAA level.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195922" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="390" data-playlist="195922,195928,196086" data-current="195922"><div><p>Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21438.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I wasn’t thrilled about the prospect of <em>Night Springs</em> when it was first announced. The three anthology episodes the DLC contains are essentially non-canon to the rest of the Remedy Connected Universe (which includes both<em> Alan Wake</em> games and 2019’s <em>Control</em>), and even though it stars familiar characters from the base game it doesn’t really continue or elaborate on their stories. After the tour de force that was <em>Alan Wake 2</em> (my favorite game of 2023) I wasn’t thrilled at the idea of diving back into something that doesn’t advance that story. And I wasn’t entirely wrong. By and large <em>Night Springs </em>doesn’t build on the base game’s narrative threads (with one major exception that I’ll get to) but I was wrong in assuming that such an approach would be boring.<em> Night Springs</em> is a much-needed breather from the weighty base game, a perfect palette cleanser. </p><figure id="" data-id="e44ed4123e681edcd1f695791e404ecb" data-recommend-id="image://e44ed4123e681edcd1f695791e404ecb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1272" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pink-clad waitress walks through a street under a banner that reads &quot;1 Waitress + 1 Writer = 4Ever&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pink-clad waitress walks through a street under a banner that reads &quot;1 Waitress + 1 Writer = 4Ever&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e44ed4123e681edcd1f695791e404ecb" data-recommend-id="image://e44ed4123e681edcd1f695791e404ecb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1272" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pink-clad waitress walks through a street under a banner that reads &quot;1 Waitress + 1 Writer = 4Ever&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That is best exemplified by the DLC’s first chapter “Number One Fan,” which follows the Oh Deer Diner’s waitress Rose. Of course, in the context of the in-game show <em>Night Springs</em>, this isn’t exactly Rose, rather she is just The Waitress. After doing the rounds at her diner, during which she pours coffee, serves her award-winning pie, and offers tough but fair life advice to strangers, she makes contact with The Writer, with whom she is romantically involved. She needs to save him from his evil twin, The Writer informs her via talking fish wall decoration, so she picks up an automatic shotgun and sets out. The Waitresses’ attitude is filled with outlandish pep that you can’t help but laugh at, and this absurdity extends to all corners of the DLC—even its loading screens, which will change based on what episode you are playing. In “Number One Fan,” the loading screens promise you that with the power of love, anything is possible! That, mixed with the literal rose-tinted hue of the world around you are a stark contrast to the dark and gritty base game. The fully automatic shotgun only adds to the absurdist vibes, as it makes all combat so trivial but also laughably gory. Remedy is telling you that this shouldn’t be as hard or stressful as the base game. Have fun! Fight the guy who turns into a wolf and rides a motorcycle (that also turns into a wolf). Before you know it the 30-45 minute experience is over.</p><p>All of<em> Night Springs</em> episodes have a similarly short runtime—the entire thing can be beaten in one brisk evening if you want. They all still have the same high-production value as the base game but take a fraction of the time. It’s another signal from Remedy that these are just supposed to be small, fun adventures to tackle at your leisure. It makes me wish more AAA games would make smaller experiences that looked and played this good.</p><figure id="" data-id="b0bffc180ee176de7c73bbd1015cf147" data-recommend-id="image://b0bffc180ee176de7c73bbd1015cf147" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jesse Faden walks towards a coffee warehouse and looks at a sign that reads &quot;join us, make the world coffee&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jesse Faden walks towards a coffee warehouse and looks at a sign that reads &quot;join us, make the world coffee&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0bffc180ee176de7c73bbd1015cf147" data-recommend-id="image://b0bffc180ee176de7c73bbd1015cf147" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jesse Faden walks towards a coffee warehouse and looks at a sign that reads &quot;join us, make the world coffee&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While “Number One Fan” swings far away from <em>Alan Wake 2</em> in its tone, the second episode hews closer to the base game, to its detriment. “North Star” puts players in the shoes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523"><em>Control</em></a></span>’s Jesse Faden, or rather a character called The Sibling who looks like her. She’s hunting down a coffee cult in the base game’s Coffee World map. The Sibling lacks any of the powers her <em>Control </em>look-alike wields and instead uses an automatic pistol and a flashlight. The gameplay loop here is fairly similar to the base game, as is the horror-tinged tone. Because of this, “North Star ‘’ is pretty forgettable, but mercifully short—I only had to play for about half an hour before credits rolled and the DLC’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-times-and-galaxy-theme-songs-1851564121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-times-and-galaxy-theme-songs-1851564121">sick theme song</a></span> played. </p><p>The final episode of <em>Night Springs</em> is called “Time Breaker” and it is some of Remedy’s best work. It follows the base game’s Sheriff Tim Breaker, but as you might suspect by now it isn’t really Tim Breaker. Though Time Breaker is even more complex than the first two episodes of <em>Night Springs</em>. This isn’t a version of Tim Breaker, rather this is a version of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/quantum-break-the-kotaku-review-1768387991&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quantum-break-the-kotaku-review-1768387991">Shawn Ashmore</a></span>, the actor who portrays the character, aptly called The Actor in the episode’s credits. The episode begins on a film set with The Actor discussing the concept of the multiverse with The Director (Remedy’s creative director Sam Lake hamming it up as a cartoonish version of himself).

While <em>Alan Wake 2</em> isn’t afraid to shift mediums and bend genres, it mostly played with the uncanny valley between reality and fiction by swapping between gameplay and live-action sequences. In “Time Breaker” Remedy explores the multitude of forms games have taken over the years, turning the AAA third-person game into, at times, a retro 2D side-scroller, an interactive comic book, and even a text adventure. The best compliment I can give “Time Breaker” is that it reminded me of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839">Yoko Taro’s games</a></span> (I say this as a massive Yoko Taro sicko, I played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><em>NieR: Reincarnation</em></a></span>). But more than just a chance for Remedy to try something fresh, “Time Breaker” gives lore hounds something to chew on. The entirety of <em>Night Springs</em> is hosted by the base game’s mysterious <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2023-1851085884/slides/2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2023-1851085884/slides/2">Mr. Door</a></span>, and the final episode digs deep into the character. While we can’t quite tell what is or isn’t true about what the episode reveals about him, it plays within the bigger RCU in ways the rest of the expansion doesn’t to great success. “Time Breaker” only leaves the audience wanting more.<br></p><p>Thankfully more is coming. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/alan-wake-ii-the-lake-house&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/alan-wake-ii-the-lake-house"><em>Lake House</em></a></span> will be the second piece of DLC coming to the game this October and looks to pick up the threads of <em>Alan Wake 2</em> more directly while also likely leading into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/29/remedy-shares-development-updates-for-control-2-max-payne-1-2-remake-and-codename-condor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/29/remedy-shares-development-updates-for-control-2-max-payne-1-2-remake-and-codename-condor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Control 2</em></a></span>. <em>Lake House</em>’s more serious tone furthers the notion that <em>Night Springs </em>is meant to act as a break for the player, a chance to do something different and fun before getting back into the main event.

Most of the trophies in <em>SWtD</em> aren’t that big of a deal. If you know exactly what to do and when, you could unlock all 37 trophies/achievements in <em>SWtD</em> in about three and-a-half hours. It’s theoretically possible to do in a single run, but you’d need a guide, and you’d end up spoiling most of the game’s twists for yourself. And, given one of the game’s more quirky achievements that asks you to switch up the language settings, you’d also be playing on your first run in a language that you (probably) don’t know how to read.</p><p>The best way to unlock all of <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>’s unlockables is to plan on two playthroughs. Go in blind for your first one, enjoy the horrors, then clean up everything you missed the second time around.</p><p>Naturally, this guide necessarily contains <strong>heavy spoilers</strong> for the entirety of <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h349"><a id="list"></a>All of <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>’s trophies/achievements</h2><figure id="" data-id="917c7ab2ce92661cb4e68028c12664d0" data-recommend-id="image://917c7ab2ce92661cb4e68028c12664d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player looks up a lift being carried on chains while monstrous flesh circles around everything." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player looks up a lift being carried on chains while monstrous flesh circles around everything." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="917c7ab2ce92661cb4e68028c12664d0" data-recommend-id="image://917c7ab2ce92661cb4e68028c12664d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player looks up a lift being carried on chains while monstrous flesh circles around everything." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For completing the game, you’ll earn the following story-related trophies/achievements:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>All Beans and Forgiveness</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>The Sickening of the Calm</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>Breathe In, Breathe Out, Repeat</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>Home by Christmas</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>Eye of the Needle</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Everything Breaks</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>I Am The King</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Compression Ignition</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>Into the Belly of the Beast</strong> (Bronze/10G)</li><li><strong>Surfacing</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Beacon in the Dark </strong>(Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Treading Water </strong>(Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Beaufort Eleven</strong> (Bronze/15G)</li><li><strong>Leviathan</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>The Drowning of Davey Rennick</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>The Horror Sings</strong> (Bronze/25G)</li><li><strong>Still Wakes the Deep</strong> (Gold/100G)</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="8d2a30e4805568e5231b86780e34a820" data-recommend-id="image://8d2a30e4805568e5231b86780e34a820" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player extinguishes flames with a fire extinguisher." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player extinguishes flames with a fire extinguisher." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d2a30e4805568e5231b86780e34a820" data-recommend-id="image://8d2a30e4805568e5231b86780e34a820" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player extinguishes flames with a fire extinguisher." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are also a couple of points in the game where you’ll have to find and use a fire extinguisher to progress forward.

These include finding dead crew members, answering all the emergency phone calls that come in over the course of the game, and, uh, dying a lot. If you want that platinum trophy and/or 1,000 gamerscore, then you’re going to need to deliberately murder Caz around 2 dozen times.</p><p>It’s worth noting here that <em>SWtD </em>handles its “collectibles” a little differently from most other games. Progress on each trophy/achievement is saved directly to your profile, much as in the <em>Resident Evil </em>remakes. So you don’t have to get everything on a single run through the game for it to count. This can come in handy, as several trophies/achievements are linked to unlabeled tasks that you can do in the first 10 minutes.</p><hr><h3 id="h351"><a id=""></a>Full Fathom Five (Bronze/10G)</h3><figure id="" data-id="265c3568706601ffba43777fd2dd3855" data-recommend-id="image://265c3568706601ffba43777fd2dd3855" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player looks down at the ocean from a broken bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player looks down at the ocean from a broken bridge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="265c3568706601ffba43777fd2dd3855" data-recommend-id="image://265c3568706601ffba43777fd2dd3855" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player looks down at the ocean from a broken bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For this achievement, you’ll have to die by falling into the sea in five different areas on the rig’s exterior.</p><p>This is harder than it sounds as you’ll spend roughly two-thirds of <em>SWtD</em> deep in the rig’s guts. When you <em>are</em> outside, you aren’t always at imminent risk of falling overboard. You have to actively look for opportunities to jump over a railing to Caz’s watery demise.</p><p>On a typical blind run through the game, you’re most at risk of falling into the sea on the Under Rig right after the initial outbreak and on Starboard, when you’re using the helicopter as a makeshift ladder. Those both have a couple of sudden surprises that can take you off-guard.</p><figure id="" data-id="ec481cf27e18f3cafdbf7c5185065a57" data-recommend-id="image://ec481cf27e18f3cafdbf7c5185065a57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds on to a helicopter hanging off a ledge by cables." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player holds on to a helicopter hanging off a ledge by cables." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ec481cf27e18f3cafdbf7c5185065a57" data-recommend-id="image://ec481cf27e18f3cafdbf7c5185065a57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player holds on to a helicopter hanging off a ledge by cables." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can also deliberately find places to leap into the sea right when you reach Lifeboats Access; on your second visit to the Deck, as you’re using the fallen shipping containers to evade Muir; and on the stack on the Processing Quad. For extra black comedy points, follow up your victory over Addair by quietly dropping through one of the holes in the stack’s walkway.</p><p>There’s a final opportunity for Full Fathom Five if you need it right at the end of the game when you revisit the Crew Lounge in Accommodation. At this point, a big hole’s been torn in the wall and it overlooks the sea. It’s morbid, but it offers one last chance to throw Caz overboard.</p><hr><h3 id="h352"><a id=""></a>Clear Down (Sliver/25G)</h3><p>For this achievement, you’ll need to answer all the emergency phone calls over the course of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/cartoon-network-hashtag-highlights-how-busted-twitter-is<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitter’s trending sidebar is no longer–if it ever was–a good metric of a day’s conversation; today, for instance, I’ve got a promotion I can’t be rid of for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/06/prageru-climate-change-denier-republican-donors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted right-wing pseudo-school</a> PragerU. But beneath that, I’ve also got the hashtag “RIP Cartoon Network,” which is full of panic that the beloved animation channel has officially shut down. It hasn’t, though, or not any more than it had already.</p><p>The hashtag is an invention of <a href="https://x.com/AWorkersIgnited" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animation Workers Ignited</a>, which has been raising awareness of labor issues in the animation industry. As part of that, they’ve put out a couple very good and informative <a href="https://x.com/AWorkersIgnited/status/1805299856635772999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a>. The <a href="https://x.com/AWorkersIgnited/status/1810440310838968397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest</a> is about how animation carried the entertainment industry during the pandemic thanks to its ability to be done remotely, only for animation workers to face layoffs and cuts afterwards at the altar of making lines go up.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Cartoon Network is dead?!?!</p><p>Spread the word about what’s at stake for animation!!!

While some people, particularly those in the know, fulfilled the assignment by telling <a href="https://x.com/MatthewB64/status/1810525874158260259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moving</a> <a href="https://x.com/lindsaykatai/status/1810543303525601617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and</a> <a href="https://x.com/MagusSerling/status/1810442757221257307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anger-inducing</a> stories about corporate greed upending their lives, following the <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/RIPCartoonNetwork?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hashtag</a> took me to tons of regular animation fans freaking out that something new had happened to the network, or that it had been officially closed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of these tweets include Community Notes, maybe the only good feature Twitter owner Elon Musk can take vague credit for, that Cartoon Network has <em>not</em> shut down and citing the Animation Workers Ignited video or <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/tv/ripcartoonnetwork-trends-as-animation-industry-concerns-grow-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news articles</a> about the hashtag. The Ignited account later <a href="https://x.com/AWorkersIgnited/status/1810505074189455758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>, “For clarity, the original Cartoon Network Studios is gone.

And also, while nothing new has happened to Cartoon Network, I wouldn’t call it alive: it’s owned by Warner Bros, who hate <a href="https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything</a> they <a href="https://aftermath.site/rooster-teeth-shut-down-warner-brothers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own</a>. In 2022, Cartoon Network Studios <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/warner-bros-tv-group-layoffs-82-staffers-channing-dungey-1235400286/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">merged</a> with Warner Bros Animation and saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/12/23400943/warner-bros-cartoon-network-layoffs-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs and show cutbacks</a>. It vacated its building in <a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/studios/rip-cartoon-network-studios-burbank-building-2000-2023-230408.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a>. It’s not dramatic to call it a shadow of its former self, the way so many things we once enjoyed are. The Ignited video is very correct that Cartoon Network, along with animation more broadly, is in a bad place and that people should be pissed off about it.</p><figure></figure><p>Was “RIP Cartoon Network” a good hashtag to pick? It’s dramatic and prone to virality, so in one way yes. But in another way it highlights one of Twitter’s ever-more-dire flaws, which is how swiftly and widely misinformation spreads on the platform these days. This was <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">always the case</a>, of course, but it feels much worse in the platform’s current landscape of <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/elons-gordian-knot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desperation for advertizers</a>, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/07/26/elon-musks-absurd-twitter-rebrand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edgelordification</a>, whatever-the-fuck <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/it-sure-looks-like-x-twitter-has-a-verified-bot-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">verification</a> signifies now, and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/who-is-behind-all-the-pussy-in-bio-porn-spam-on-x.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pussy in bio</a>. It’s easy for things to spin out of hand, especially when there’s some emotion behind it, with posters responding to other posters in a sprawling game of Telephone. And even with Community Notes, there are less checks to bring things back to Earth than ever, as <a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2023/news-media-quit-twitter-npr-pbs-new-york-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reputable news outlets</a> flee the platform and paid verification makes it hard to tell who can be trusted. (Remember how long it took us to figure out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181373/noam-chomsky-not-dead-yet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Noam Chomsky wasn’t dead</a>?)</p><p>The hashtag has had the knock-on effect of throwing chum in the water of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=2f3821052c9136cf&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWILYEELdF0y3yed43kR9yGI_9sS1pQ:1720538793868&amp;q=rip+cartoon+network&amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=univ&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjhzYW9opqHAxU_D1kFHQaVBssQt8YBKAF6BAgTEAQ&amp;biw=1431&amp;bih=660&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEO machine</a>, as outlets raced to debunk the rumor and get those sweet clicks. (Lest you think this article is part of that: while Aftermath is aware that SEO exists, the odds of Google picking this up are <a href="https://aftermath.site/google-seo-results-broken-media-private-equity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vanishingly low</a>. If you got here from Google, though, <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please subscribe</a>!) And the hashtag itself is full of hangers-on using it to get eyeballs on whatever their cause or self-promotion grift is.</p><p>I’m fascinated by how this little dust-up presents a snapshot in miniature of our current online landscape, though in this case it’s raising awareness of labor conditions and not <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/elon-musk-promoted-matt-walsh-213619740.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hate speech</a>. But “good” misinformation is still misinformation. Ignited’s follow-up tweet leads me to believe it was an accident, that the group didn’t think hard enough about how the hashtag could be misread, which is a good lesson in messaging for all of us. But watching it happen reminds me how much less I trust Twitter as a source of information these days, a habit I’m finding hard to break, and a reminder that you probably shouldn’t trust it either.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-zenless-zone-zero-character-seth-lowell-announced/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-reaches-50-million-global-downloads-hoyoverses-latest-success/">Zenless Zone Zero </a>has only been available for a public audience for several days, but the players love it. The game was released with various characters you could unlock and try and pull using standard banners. Since its release, miHoYo has announced the newest character, Seth Lowell, to join the roster and the first to join the game.</p>
<p>Seth is a brand new character who joins the squad of playable characters in Zenless Zone Zero. He is an adorable cat cop in the Criminal Investigation Special Response Team. As of yet, we don't know his capabilities or his role in the game.</p>
<p>The official social media accounts for Zenless Zone Zero began posting pictures of this white-haired cat boy and attaching some quotes that he uses within the game. <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/124698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Lowell</a> is being voiced by the highly talented Nazeeh Tarsha, who has voice-acted in games such as Genshin Impact, Street Fighter 6, and many more.</p>
<p>Seth Lowell is the second playable character from the Criminal Investigation Special Response Team to be available in the game. Zhu Yuan is the first playable character from that faction. We also already know we will get a third character from this faction named Qingyi.</p>
<p>While not much is known about either character's arrival in Zenless Zone Zero, it is heavily hinted that Seth Lowell has big connections to New Eridu, especially as he says to contact New Eridu's Public Security, the section he works in.</p>
<p>We are currently unsure of what weaponry Seth Lowell will be equipped with and what elemental attribute he'll be carrying. Based solely on the quotes that have been released, he may be a melee fighter who uses fists or fist weapons.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there is currently no set release date or time for Seth or Qingyi's release. There is also no information on their rarity, but we expect that miHoYo will begin drip-feed details over the coming days before their release. Once both Seth and Qinyi are released, there will be three playable characters from the Criminal Investigation Special Response Team faction, compared to the stark Obol faction, which only has one playable character.</p>
<p>Will you be rolling for Seth or Qinyi?</p>

While all of the above has told us which of Blizzard’s heroes would be donning looks based on Hasbro’s robots in disguise, we hadn’t seen the skins in-game yet. Now Blizzard has released some in-game screenshots of each of the skins, as well as concept art for the Ramattra and Reinhardt skins that will be available in the <em>Overwatch 2 </em>store today.</p><p>Blizzard artist Bobby Kim talked about how the team integrated the mechanical elements that make <em>Transformers</em>’ visual identity distinct while also preserving <em>Overwatch 2</em> heroes’ silhouettes that have become recognizable over the years. Reinhardt’s skin, for instance, resembles Autobot leader Optimus Prime, complete with the iconic red truck-like torso.</p><p>“When developing the skin, I tried to integrate the sturdy, truck-like design that Optimus Prime is known for, such as the front windshield and the exhaust on the skin’s shoulders, to make him look more like a speeding truck when he charges,” Kim said in a Q&amp;A press release. “I also tried using sharper, angular parts throughout the skin, which I think captured the iconic look of Optimus Prime.”</p><p>Ramattra, meanwhile, has a skin based on Megatron, the antagonist of the <em>Transformers</em> franchise. The tie-in comic Blizzard released showed Ramattra and Megatron joining forces, claiming they both wanted peace for the Omnics, the oppressed synthetics of the <em>Overwatch </em>universe. While I’m not thrilled with Blizzard doing an actual in-universe crossover while its own story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720">is once again on ice</a></span>, I can see how Ramattra, a radical fighting for Omnic freedom, finds Megatron’s offer tantalizing.</p><p>Bastion and Illari round out the <em>Transformers </em>skins as Bumblebee and Arcee. Each skin will be available in the <em>Overwatch 2 </em>store alongside unlockable <em>Transformers</em>-themed player icons, name cards, and titles.

<p>New images from the production of the second season of The Last of Us have emerged online, showcasing Ellie (Bellay Ramsay) and Dina (Isabela Merced) walking around the post-apocalyptic setting, tooled up and ready for action. There are clear indicators to The Last of Us Part II, with Ellie sporting her iconic tattoo, and both characters wielding the same weapons carried by their digital counterparts in the game.</p>

<h2 id="h-developing">Developing</h2>



<p>The images released online recently show Ellie and Dina exploring the post-apocalyptic wastes in the second season of the award-winning show, which is set to drop in 2025. Some fans have criticised various elements of the images, from the length of Bella Ramsay’s hair to the cleanliness of the clothes that the young actors are wearing:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Eagle-eyed fans also took a few shots of sets around Vancouver, revealing a few details – including a group of actors portraying Seraphites (‘Scars’) from the second game, which was released in 2020. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Four new shots on-location from season two of The Last of Us in Vancouver. Three photos are of a street in Chinatown and the other includes actors playing seraphites/scars + crew relaxing during non-filming under a wall with the words “feel her love”.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheLastofUs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheLastofUs</a>… <a href="https://t.co/sVxlHt6yry">pic.twitter.com/sVxlHt6yry</a></p>— Naughty Dog World (@NaughtyDogWorld) <a href="https://twitter.com/NaughtyDogWorld/status/1810577756721205525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>The storyline for the second season hasn’t been confirmed yet, but there are expectations that it’ll deviate a little from what was shown during the 2020 game. It’s widely believed that The Last of Us Part II will unfold over two seasons, with the next batch of episodes laying the groundwork for the road ahead. Given recent casting choices, we know that we’ll get as far as to see Abby and Ellie clash, but to what extent, nobody knows.</p>

Making open-world games is really, really tough. And making Star Wars open-world games is the next level of difficulty.”</p><p>Julian Gerighty, creative director at Massive Entertainment, is up for a challenge. For the first time ever, we’re getting a fully open-world Star Wars video game. It’s been a long time coming, but after back-to-back successes with both The Division and The Division 2, Gerighty was in the mood to take a risk.</p><p>“I think this is maybe just my approach, but even if it's scary, you've got to do it,” he says. “You've got to lean into it.

[...] If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but you still have that experience.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/toshara-shipwreckvista-concept-1720441006689.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art of Kay Vess and her companion Nix looking out at a High Republic shipwreck. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Fast forward several years after that meeting and Massive Entertainment is less than two months away from releasing Star Wars Outlaws, a fully realised version of the original pitch described in that office: an open world of dual ambitions – maintain the cinematic legacy of the films, and create immersive scoundrel gameplay that grants you the freedom of the galaxy.</p><p>“I think it's taken this long to get an open-world Star Wars game because of how, excuse the pun, massive it is to build a game like this. There are only so many studios in the world who build games of this scale,” says Steve Blank, director of franchise content and strategy at Lucasfilm. “The door is then open for Massive to come to us and say, this is what we're interested in doing, this is the type of game design and gameplay we want. This is what we're thinking about in terms of an archetype.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are only so many studios in the world who build games of this scale.</p></div><p>“It's the outlaw player fantasy and it's open world, those were the two main pillars that we pitched,” explains Gerighty. “Why open world? Because the outlaw fantasy really needs that to live and breathe.”</p><p>“It's a combination of our DNA as a studio, our background, when we think, ‘Okay, what do we have a lot of experience doing? What do we think we're good at?’ And this fantasy, this scoundrel in Star Wars begs for freedom,” adds game director Mathias Karlson.</p><p>Massive was fully confident in its abilities to create engaging open worlds – The Division offered a bullet-filled action playground, while last year’s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora displayed an ability to work well within a Disney license by building a near-unmatched visual paradise. But Star Wars was the new challenge that this team yearned for. Of course, locking down what kind of experience would live inside a Star Wars open world was the first thing that had to be decided.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“We took a step back of course and thought, ‘Okay, Star Wars open world. What an opportunity. What does that naturally want to be?’” Karlson says. “It wants to be the full scale, from the very small to the very big, meaning sitting inside a cantina, playing Sabacc, being able to walk through the street, jump on your speeder or drive across the planet surface, literally park your bike in your own ship, take off into space seamlessly, and explore that region.”</p><p>That vision of “full scale” helped secure a green light from Star Wars’ custodians. But getting LucasFilm’s blessing was just the key in the ignition. Translating the cinematic spectacle of the original Star Wars movie trilogy into an open-world game – set between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, two of the most iconic films of all-time – was the actual challenge. One that Massive set out to address in every aspect of Outlaws, from the way it looks and sounds, to the type of action-adventure gameplay it supplies. </p><h2>Making an Open World Cinematic</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/sarlaccpit-1720441163877.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kay and Nix venturing into a Sarlacc Pit. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>“For us, the sort of cinematic ambition that we had was in presentation,” explains Gerighty. For that, he went straight to the source. “What we did was take a lot of inspiration from the original trilogy, but with today's technology, so very similar to what Rogue One did with its references to the production design of the original trilogy. [Its aim] was to replicate a lot of the filmic effects of those lenses in the 1970s. So you'll see barrel distortion on the sides, vignetting, film grain, chromatic aberration, and of course all wrapped up in an ultra-widescreen presentation.”</p><p>You can expect that level of detail in Outlaws’ cutscenes. But Gerighty notes that making a game cinematic “doesn't mean cinematics necessarily. What I care the most about is the interactive part.”</p><p>“I think it's a key point for open-world games at large, scaling does not always need to be grand, but it needs to be conscious,” Karlson theorises. “The scale of Tatooine needs, should, and does in our game feels very different. It breathes, it’s open sand dunes and long sightlines. It's easy to pick up any little anomaly on the horizon and there might be an opportunity for you, compared to the dense streets of Kijimi, which is a city in perpetual winter where people are trying to stay warm.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Scaling does not always need to be grand, but it needs to be conscious.</p></div><p>Scale is something written into the very DNA of Star Wars, whether seen on the big or small screen. Greig Fraser, Rogue One’s director of photography, recently told IGN that “If you watch any Star Wars film, that's what it's all about. It's knowing how big a human is going into this massive Millennium Falcon, how big the Millennium Falcon is going to this massive Death Star. It's scale upon scale upon scale.” It’s a philosophy Gerighty and the team at Massive took into Outlaws when crafting the introduction to its open world.</p><p>“One of our intentions for the beginning of the game was to make it feel very small and then [get] bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger,” explains Gerighty. “So [at the] beginning of the game, you start off in one room and it's claustrophobic and it's meant to make you feel a little bit trapped. You open up and it's city streets, but it's contained. And then you get into some narrative stuff and you steal a ship and you explode into the galaxy and all of a sudden you crash land on this planet, which is a wide open world.” </p><p>The aim here is to create a “sense of everything growing for you and not just the scale of the galaxy, but the scale of the possibilities for you as a character.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Outlaws’ campaign tells the tale of Kay Vess, a young scoundrel looking to build a team from across the stars in order to pull off one big space heist and remove the “death mark” placed on her by the Zerek Besh crime syndicate. It’s the basis of a story that evokes many other adventures from across both games and film. </p><p>“I love Mass Effect 2. It’s one of my favourite games,” states Navid Khavari, Outlaws’ narrative director. “There were so many influences. I think you look at everything from Ocean’s 11 and Ocean’s 8 to Star Wars itself. The previous films and that heist feeling was always kind of in the fabric.” He also namechecks Kurosawa, the Japanese director whose samurai stories were so influential on George Lucas’ original trilogy.</p><p>Knowing what sort of story you want to tell is one thing. Telling an engaging story in an open-world setting is another task altogether, and one that Khavari is well aware of, having written for Far Cry 4, 5, and 6, as well as The Division.</p><p>“It's one of the things you always have to keep in mind,” he says. “How are we going to weave a narrative and an open world together, so that we're telling the story, but also giving you the freedom to go wherever you'd like?” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We knew early on that if you got distracted by curiosity, the world had to react to that.</p></div><p>“We had a really clear approach on Outlaws,” he explains. ”There was Kay's journey[...] There were key points that we knew we wanted her to hit, and then that makes her story part of the wider Star Wars narrative. But between those moments, we knew early on that if you got distracted by curiosity, the world had to react to that. It had to expect that the player's going to go off the beaten path.”</p><p>The things that lie off the beaten path are built in accordance to something Massive refers to as “the three-second rule,” where within a few blinks of an eye you can instantly understand the nature of a location or character and the story behind them.</p><p>“Before you even put life in them, they need to visually tell a story about what kind of place it is, what's happened in the past, what type of life and events have taken place in them so that they get that lived-in feeling,” Karlson explains. “That lived-in, relatable, substantial feel, I think is a hallmark of any good open world, but also very Star Wars when you think about it.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/jawasandcrawler-1720441370568.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kay approaches a Jawa on Tatooine. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Star Wars’ aesthetic has always been rooted in the idea of the “used future”, where everything from the largest spaceships to the tiniest droids have that instantly recognisable layer of grime. Those small details build up into authentic, cool, and bespoke spaces –  something Massive has always managed to build into its own open worlds. The Division and its sequel are packed full of memorable levels ranging from New York landmarks to Washington DC museums, and that philosophy is being transferred to Outlaws’ many planets. Its main missions promise to take us to iconic locations such as Imperial bases and Jabba’s Palace.</p><p>“We can lean into the virtual tourism aspect of, ‘Hey, what is the distance between the moisture farms and Mos Eisley and the cantina?” says Gerighty. “There is a linear roller coaster story, a golden path, if you will. And around that, of course, there's the open world.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That sort of connective tissue of planet or moon to space was crucial to our whole approach.</p></div><p>“That's the dream I know I had as a kid,” Khavari adds. “That is what I've always wanted from a Star Wars game. That when I'm on a journey, when I'm entering into a quest, it might start on foot, it might start with me navigating a High Republic cruiser that's crashed, but I want to be able to jump into my speeder and blast off, [...], take off into space, maybe land in a space station and meet some characters that factor into my quest or journey along the way. And so that sort of connective tissue of planet or moon to space was crucial to our whole approach, right? Because that's kind of the fantasy that I think players are hoping for.”</p><p>That fantasy and freedom is evidently at the core of Outlaws, and while all five planets and moons (Toshara, Tatooine, Akiva, Kijimi, and Cantonica) won’t be instantly available to hyperdrive between, Gerighty claims it won’t be long into Kay’s journey until the galaxy opens up.</p><p>“There's a very structured intro that leads you to crash land on Toshara, which is a moon that we created with LucasFilm Games,” he says. “And once you finish the sort of linear narrative on Toshara, the other planets open up and it becomes completely non-linear and you can choose to tackle those [worlds] in any order you want.”</p><h2>A Galaxy of Exploration</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/kijimi-vista-1720441454367.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art of Kay looking out over Kijimi City. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Exploration of these worlds is highly encouraged, with maps that are not (at least initially) flooded with icons and points of interest because you’re seeing these places from a fresh perspective.</p><p>“Kay hasn't seen the galaxy, she doesn't know everything,” Karlson explains. “The first time you come to Toshara you'll have a map where you can see mountains over there and stuff, but discovery is what gives you more information.” </p><p>“You're going to have to take some risks,” says Gerighty. “You're going to have to go to a cantina [...] and you can eavesdrop and pick up on some conversations that will lead you to another location that reveals a location within the open world that you have to get on your speeder to go and find. And there will be a fog of war that you'll be able to clear up and that's really where your curiosity will open things up even more.”</p><p>Each of Outlaws’ worlds vary in size. Toshara, Massive’s newly created moon, is around the same size as the jungle planet of Akiva, but a little smaller than the vast desert of Tatooine.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Assassin's Creed Odyssey has different zones on the map. Toshara is two or three of those put together.</p></div><p>“It was less about how big, but more about how long in terms of traversal with the speeder it would be,” Gerighty reveals. “[Toshara takes] four or five minutes nonstop, which doesn't sound like a lot, but once you're committed it's a fairly large amount and you are always going to be distracted. Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which was one of the games that we were looking at while creating this, you have different zones on the map [...][Toshara is] two or three of those put together.”</p><p>And that doesn’t even take into account the vast areas of space that surround each planet and serve as entirely different areas of orbital exploration and opportunity. We’ll cover that, as well as the starship side of the game, in greater depth later on in this month’s IGN First.</p><h2>Experts, Reputation, and the Wanted System</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/imperiallocationillusiveexpert-1720441614582.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kay encounters a mysterious Imperial expert. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>In terms of mission design, we’ve seen action ranging from stealth infiltrations, frantic dogfights, high-speed chases, and intense blaster battles, with some quests even evolving to include all of these elements at different stages. Star Wars Outlaws is thus perhaps better thought of as a single-player narrative action adventure in the wrappings of an open world – something more akin to Marvel’s Spider-Man than dense RPGs like The Witcher or Ubisoft’s recent Assassin’s Creed games. Its mixture of popcorn action and blockbuster narrative ambition is a departure from Massive’s gear-based experience on The Division. It is a new chapter in the continued evolution of a studio that started life as a real-time strategy developer.</p><p>“I think if you look at the evolution of the open world, there's a life, a dynamism, a systemic quality to The Division 2 that we didn't have in The Division 1,” states Gerighty. “I'm not talking about the presentation, the soft values at all. I'm talking about pure gameplay experience, single-player or cooperative. That was very, very important to us to have as a living, breathing element that engages players while they're playing Outlaws.” </p><p>It’s an evolution of what Massive has been doing in their games for years now – keeping worlds feeling bustling and alive, even when set against post-apocalyptic backdrops or in the midst of galactic wars.</p><p>“We in both Division games, but especially in the second one, developed what we call ‘living world systems’,” explains Karlson. “So same thing here. We have systems that make sure that the world is always alive with movement, traffic, speeders, zipping around the Empire, patrolling  syndicates have footholds out there, and these can cross paths. Also sometimes more substantial events happen and it's really up to you if you want to engage or not.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Star Wars Game Review</h3></div></output><p>Perhaps Outlaws’ most interesting method of breathing life into its open world is its approach to character progression. There’s no levelling up or incremental stat boosts to drop experience points into. Instead, Kay’s abilities and equipment are linked to experts – people you’ll meet across the galaxy who’ll grant you upgrades in exchange for work.</p><p>“They are full-on characters,” Karlson explains. “So they're spread out in the world and you don't know exactly who they are, what exactly they have to offer you and how to reach them from the very beginning. So there's this journey of discovery here as well. And once you reach them, there's a character there to interact with and an adventure to go on because they won’t instantly just, oh, here you go. And then they essentially open up a little regional progression for you where the nature of those things is also very tangible.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>An upgrade definitely ties into Kay pulling off the heist, but it's also very much its own journey, which is in the Star Wars tradition as well.</p></div><p>For example, after finding a Jawa by sourcing their location from overheard intel at a cantina, you can complete a mission for them in order to gain a new skill. In this case, it’s to venture into a dead Sarlacc to find a pristine tooth from its second mouth, which you can then exchange for a laser turret for the Trailblazer, Kay’s starship.</p><p>It’s a smart way of blending gameplay progression with a narrative befitting of the Star Wars criminal underbelly. “You can go on a journey with a character such as an expert who is going to teach Kay a new skill and give her a new upgrade to her blaster,” says Khavari. “Now, that skill, that upgrade definitely ties into Kay pulling off the heist, but it's also very much its own journey, which is in the Star Wars tradition as well.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/trailblazerturret-1720441749777.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kay's ship, the Trailerblazer, equipped with a laser turret - an upgrade given to her as an expert mission reward. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Another system aiming to marry gameplay with narrative is how Outlaws’ tracks Kay’s reputation with each of the criminal syndicates. Her bond with each of the Hutts, Pykes, Crimson Dawn, and Ashiga Clan will strengthen or weaken depending on your choices in dialogue and mission objectives.</p><p>“Your reputation moving in the positive direction unlocks a lot of things for you,” says Karlson. “Everything from actual access to territory that they control where you might have [only] been able to sneak in otherwise, to landing pads in the open world, to discounts with traders affiliated with the syndicate and unique really exotic rewards. But if you really get on their bad side, that's another thing that you'll feel dynamically in the game because they actually send hit squads out for you in the open world to try and take you out.”</p><p>The reputation system doesn’t just sit inside of missions, though. Smaller opportunities regularly present themselves to boost your relationships among the syndicates. These might be smaller skirmishes where choosing to get involved can benefit you and the organisation you side with. A strong bond with one may even help you out with the bigger threat looming over the galaxy…</p><p>“If you've for whatever reason ended up wanted and you're being chased by the Empire, and you cross paths with a syndicate that you have a really good reputation with at the moment, they might join in and help you out,” Karlson reveals. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/imperialcheckpoint-concept-1720441872113.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art of Kay arriving at an Imperial checkpoint. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Outlaws directly follows the events of The Empire Strikes Back, and sees the Imperial forces at the peak of their powers. In gameplay terms, the Stormtroopers are basically like GTA’s police, and adopt a similar wanted system. Find yourself in a restricted area or accidentally fire a stray laser blast at a Stormtrooper and you’ll quickly find yourself in hot water. It’s by no means a revolutionary system when it comes to open-world design, but one that is made all the more exciting thanks to a lick of Imperial black and white paint. </p><p>“It has a good range of escalation and de-escalation,” Karlson states. “It's really up to you if you want to try and hide or maybe bribe an Imperial officer that's a bit corrupt in a city somewhere, or try to hyper jump to a different space region. But you will feel it. </p><p>“And let's just say there are Death Troopers for a reason,” he teasingly adds.</p><h2>Balancing Quality with Quantity</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/trailblazer-back-1720442036547.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art of the Trailblazer blasting into space. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Beyond the main missions, expert side missions, and the reputation system at the core of it all, many other snackable activities exist in Outlaws’ open world. These range from quick contracts such as smuggling and stealing, gambling in Sabacc (Star Wars poker), to playing asteroid field arcade shooter games and betting on Canto Bight’s Fathier Racing. All of these activities bolster your ever-growing supply of credits which can be used to purchase new customisation and gear options for Kay, her pet-like alien companion Nix, and the Trailblazer.</p><p>And yet, there’s more. Emergent events frequently take place throughout the open world, whether on land or in space. “Every two, three minutes there'll be something that's happening, whether it's an ambush or the empire arresting some civilians or getting into combat with some criminal syndicates. And it's up to you whether you want to engage or not,” Gerighty reveals.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We don't want things to be just big for big sake.</p></div><p>With so much to do in Star Wars Outlaws, how does Massive go about avoiding open-world “bloat”? With a near-endless galaxy of opportunity, there’s the worry that things may spiral, feature creep sets in, and everything just gets “too big”. The studio had a clear plan from the start, though, leading with variety over size – quality over quantity, if you will. “So we don't want things to be just big for big sake. We need it to be contained, always fun, always proposing different activities,” Gerighty confirms.</p><p>“It's about calibrating size to substance,” adds Karlson. “When you see something that breaks pattern, that stands out for whatever reason, and you go there and look, there's something there to do, and that repeats frequently enough. [We also make sure] the quests, the bespoke content of the game, makes use of it so that it doesn't feel like a separate experience, but it's all one.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/toshara-kaynix-speeder-concept-1720442104911.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art of Kay speeding toward the Toshara capital of Mirogana. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Of course, no matter how much there will be to do in Outlaws, one thing that can be expected is a healthy helping of nods to the larger Star Wars galaxy. Lando is set to make an appearance, and we’ve already seen a glimpse of Han Solo in carbonite, but it sounds like they might just be the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>“What I would say is there are Easter eggs,” Khavari reveals. “There's characters that you'll meet along the way across the main quests and whether it's the experts or the wider stories you're going to stumble across. August 30th is a really great date. I recommend bookmarking it in your calendar.”</p><p>August 30 is right around the corner, a short wait for many players for whom an open-world game set in a galaxy far, far away has been a long-held dream. I could feel a similar passion for Star Wars coming out of each person I spoke to at Massive, and for them, I can’t help but get the sense that the dream is a shared one. Making open world games is tough. And bringing open world to Star Wars may well bring an extra level of difficulty, but for Gerighty and the team it’s been a challenge worth taking on.</p><p>“I'm getting to that point where I think I can count the number of games I can do until I'm put out to pasture on one hand,” Gerighty says. “And it becomes more and more important to me to choose what I do because it's really important for me to do quality work with people that I love working with. And Star Wars is definitely on the bucket list.” </p><p><em>Simon Cardy once got kicked out of a school assembly for calling somebody Salacious Crumb.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-new-ceo-wants-to-keep-the-games-best-bug-yet<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> players have discovered a quite fantastic bug that prevents them from taking fall damage — and the new CEO of developer Arrowhead wants it to stay.</p><p>As surfaced by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dy2sup/to_whoever_said_emoting_reduces_fall_damage_thanks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor Chunke-Funke-Monke</a>, Helldivers 2 emoting actually reduces fall damage. It’s true: perform an emote while you’re falling from a height you'd typically die from and you'll reduce the damage you’d normally take and survive.</p><p>Why does this happen? The theory is that Helldivers 2 applies its physics model to fall damage as it does across the game. That is, the game works out which part of your body you’ve landed on and determines damage accordingly. It makes sense! A bang on the head is probably going to be fatal, but you might survive a bang on your butt… just.</p><p>Helldivers 2 doesn’t let you change your orientation as you fall through the air, but if you emote while doing so you force your character model to reposition into the emote pose, thus changing the part of you that hits the ground first. Genius!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/09/screenshot-2024-07-09-162144-1720538641799.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: reddit / Chunke-Funke-Monke.</figcaption></figure></output><p>This is genuinly useful in a game packed with explosions that often send your Helldiver hurtling across the map. And so, Helldivers 2 has a new meta: using emotes to prevent fall damage. Now that’s a twist Super Earth didn’t see coming.</p><p>You’d think Arrowhead would want to patch this one out (I doubt it’s intended gameplay), but new CEO Shams Jorjani, who recently replaced previous Arrowhead CEO and current chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt, tweeted to call for it to stay.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">can we please, please keep this? <a href="https://twitter.com/ArrowheadGS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ArrowheadGS</a> <a href="https://t.co/a57PMZ4JtT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/a57PMZ4JtT</a></p>— Shams Jorjani (@ShamsJorjani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1810303338660983259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>While emote free-falling is meme worthy now, what might be better for Helldivers 2 long-term is a more realistic mechanic that lets players reduce fall damage in-universe. Perhaps there’s certain armor that would help, or gear that gives you a parachute or something similar. Yet another mechanic to potentially add to Arrowhead’s long list of upcoming Helldivers 2 content.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we'll add inflatable bouncy bags that deploy from under your arm pits or some shit if we have to. c'mon! we have the technology - where there's a will there's a way!</p>— Shams Jorjani (@ShamsJorjani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1810326466262966483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>This isn't the first time Helldivers 2 players have discovered unintended emote gameplay. Soon after the PC and PlayStation 5 co-op shooter came out earlier this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-hugging-strategy-is-the-most-wholesome-yet">players discovered that if one Helldiver used the shield generator pack to protect from sustaining damage from explosives, they could hug emote another player to share the shield</a>. Wholesome!</p><p>Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks. Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><p>Arrowhead recently revealed it was in the process of setting the studio up so it could “make more and better stuff” in the long-term. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d2pozq/hello_fellow_helldivers_greetings_from_the_newly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an introductory post on reddit</u></a>, Jorjani said the studio has had to adjust to the enormous success Helldivers 2 has brought to the company.</p><p><em>Image credit: reddit / Chunke-Funke-Monke.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
