Treyarch confirmed the game won't include futuristic movement abilities like wall-running or jetpacks, as have occasionally appeared in past Call of Duty games.</p><p>Details about the movement system and Black Ops 7's campaign settings were confirmed during the latest episode of the <a href="https://youtu.be/F7NvcBZJzbQ?si=bVB3tpPRBo34-BbH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Call of Duty podcast</a>. Podcast host Stephanie Snowden shut down rumors of potential wall-running and jetpacks in Black Ops 7. When co-host Miles Ross asked about Black Ops 7's movement, Snowden replied, "I can confirm no wall-running, no jetpacks, but it will feature an evolution of omnimovement."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>While some fans may be disappointed in another year of boots-on-the-ground Call of Duty, leaks suggest Black Ops 7 could feature some form of a "wall-jump" or double jump with this evolution of omnimovement.</p><p>The episode also included an interview with Treyarch's associate creative director, Miles Leslie. Leslie discussed Activision's reveal trailer it showed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">June's Xbox Games Showcase</a>, as well as some of the Easter eggs hidden within. The developer also confirmed part of the campaign shown in the trailer takes place in Japan. </p><p dir="ltr">"We're super excited about this because Black Ops has never gone really deep into Japan," Leslie said.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Japan, it's also confirmed that part of the campaign takes place on the long-rumored Avalon map. It was originally rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-think-theyve-discovered-the-next-warzone-map/1100-6527488/">Avalon would be the next Warzone map</a>, but recent leaks suggested it was scrapped for battle royale and would instead be used for campaign and Zombies content. The speculation of an Avalon battle royale map returned after Black Ops 7's trailer included a scene with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-new-call-of-duty-warzone-map-teased-in-black-ops-7-trailer/1100-6532265/">squad flying down onto Avalon with wingsuits</a>, with fans hoping it was teasing a Warzone or Blackout-style battle royale map.</p><p>According to Snowden, the scene in question is part of Black Ops 7's co-op campaign set on Avalon, which will support up to four players. Snowden didn't outright say the content isn't also made for battle royale, however, so there is still hope for fans wanting battle royale on Avalon. Call of Duty's battle royale maps are often made with parts of campaign settings.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the hosts acknowledged the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-season-4-update-broke-multiplayer-lobbies-in-this-one-way-activision-investigating/1100-6531959/">buggy launch of Season 4</a> for Black Ops 6 and Warzone. "When there are bugs or issues present in the game we know that that is frustrating," Snowden said. "Since then, we've been focused on patching and updating a number of those issues."</p><p dir="ltr">The podcast hosts also confirmed the final Zombies map for Black Ops 6 will arrive with the launch of Season 5. Call of Duty still has plenty of content to arrive before then, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-start-date-and-details/1100-6531690/">Season 4 Reloaded</a> set to bring more multiplayer maps, events, and game modes.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.

<p>The news follows the release last week of Stellar Blade on PC, which has already proven a huge success for the studio - it managed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">record numbers for a PlayStation-published single player game</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-proves-theres-appetite-for-playstation-5-games-on-pc-as-it-blasts-past-one-million-sales-in-three-days">sold over a million copies within three days</a> of its release.</p>

<p>According to PlayForum (via machine translation), Shift Up is working on platform-specific optimisation to reflect the Switch 2's lower power compared to Sony's console (and PC).</p>
<p>Indeed, Stellar Blade was one of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stellar-blade-on-ps5-pro-a-simple-but-hugely-effective-upgrade">first games optimised for Sony's more powerful PS5 Pro console</a> and has been praised for its performance.</p>
<p>PlayForum also stated the Switch 2 version plays into Shift Up's multiplatform strategy, expanding beyond a single-platform hit.</p>
<p>Beyond Stellar Blade, the studio has its Goddess of Victory: Nikke game, plus its newly announced flagship Project Spirits.</p>
<p>A sequel to Stellar Blade is also in development and has been set to a 2027 release in a recent investor presentation from the studio.</p>
<p>Director Hyung-tae Kim stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-better-story-than-stellar-blade">Stellar Blade 2 will address the lack of narrative in the original game</a>, which had its total number of cutscenes cut due to cost-saving measures. This included details on why main character Eve changes clothes so much.</p>
<p>"In the early stages of development, we planned to include detailed settings such as the reason the main character changes clothes in the story. However, as production progressed, the cost of producing cutscenes became too much," he said. "And eventually, for the sake of efficiency, we had no choice but to reduce cutscenes that supplemented the world view or character narratives outside of the main plot. That's how we were barely able to complete the game."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Playable on Switch 2, too</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>EA's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lost_in_random">Lost In Random</a> was very well-received when it launched back in 2021, with our very own review awarding the hybrid of roguelike, dice-rolling, deckbuilding, boardgame and real-time action (phew!) a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/lost-in-random">great 8/10</a>.</p>
<p>So, it may be of interest to you to know that the sequel to all of this very good stuff, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lost_in_random_the_eternal_die">Lost In Random: The Eternal Die</a>, came out yesterday on Switch (and Switch 2, though only via backwards compatibility - how very exciting that we now live in such a thriving ecosystem).</p>
<p>Described as a "fast-paced roguelike set in the world of Lost In Random", this sequel from Stormteller Games — now with Thunderful on publishing duties — serves as the next chapter in the story of a world where children must roll a dice to decide their stations in life. Which seems harsh (although what's the chances they'll end up in a worse spot than "games journalist"?)</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Of course, your main protagonists aren't having any of that, and we expect a further fight back against the establishment will follow as a new tale involving the Queen of Random — yes, the world here is called Random, you see — unfolds before us in the series' unique graphical style. As the press release details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mastery Meets Chance</strong>: Engage in fast-paced, second-to-second combat that blends real-time action with strategic decision-making - and a touch of luck.</p>
<p><strong>Forge Your Playstyle</strong>: Wield four unique weapons, throw your die-companion, and combine 100+ relics with powerful card-based abilities to unleash devastating synergies.</p>
<p><strong>Ever-Changing World</strong>: Traverse four randomly generated worlds, each with its own distinct secrets and challenges and face over 30 different enemy types and formidable bosses.</p>
<p><strong>A Dark Fantasy Tale</strong>: Immerse yourself in a fully voiced story set in a Tim Burton-inspired world, brought to life with hauntingly beautiful landscapes and an enchanting soundtrack."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Judging by the game's trailer, there's more than a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> in the mix here, which is a very good thing indeed, and feedback over on Steam has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2564520/Lost_in_Random_The_Eternal_Die/">very positive</a> thus far, so this is defo one to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Lost In Random: The Eternal Die released yestoday (17th June) with a 10% launch discount putting it at <strong>$22.49/£17.99.</strong> The Fortune Edition, which includes a special digital artbook, exclusive soundtrack and cosmetic DLC is available for <strong>$28.99/£23.19.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-widespread-nvidia-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although pre-release footage suggested the contrary, the Nintendo Switch 2 makes widespread use of NVIDIA DLSS, but it may be difficult to notice if the upscaler is being used due to differences in image characteristics compared to PC.</p>
<p>Replying to a supporter's question during this week's episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry highlighted how the new Nintendo consoles makes widespread use of the NVIDIA upscaler, saying that it was difficult to say if this was indeed the case before launch due to the image characteristics of Switch 2 DLSS being different from those seen on PC. Based on certain visual elements, however, it is now possible to say if a game is using NVIDIA DLSS on the system, such as the disocclusion and aliased edges patterns seen in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet update.</p>
<p>Looking further into the matter, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> tech experts also highlighted how there's a good chance that NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch 2 comes with different modes, like on PC. The most common version seems to be a lightweight version that can easily upscale the resolution to 1080p in handheld mode and to 1440p or 4K in docked mode, but that doesn't do a great job of reconstructing the image in motion. The most glaring example is in Fast Fusion, where NVIDIA DLSS is used to upscale to 4K resolution in docked mode. Image quality is fine in still shots, but in motion, things are much different. Hogwarts Legacy seems to use this lightweight version of DLSS as well, only that the much slower pace of the game, and the higher base resolution deliver much better results, although different from what the upscaler delivers on PC. Besides this lightweight version, however, there seems to be at least another version of NVIDIA DLSS available to developers, as the implementation seen in Cyberpunk 2077 seems to be closer to the PC version, rather than the one seen in the other launch titles.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #218: MindsEye Launch Disaster, Next-Gen PS Handheld Specs, Switch 2 Sells 3.5m!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWlnVVbtNwc?start=4663&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides supporting NVIDIA DLSS to deliver better image quality and performance upscaling from lower resolutions, the Nintendo Switch 2 offers plenty of unexpected benefits via its backward compatibility feature. Although updated games take better advantage of the increased system specs over the original system, several unpatched games can<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/"> brute-force better performance in several different titles.</a></p>

            <p>Gearbox's Randy Pitchford is "stoked" about Borderlands 4's price point, promising plenty of "awesome" DLC to come after the game's release.</p>
<p>There has been much discussion about how much Borderlands 4 will cost, even before the price was announced. It all kicked off when Pitchford made comments earlier in the year, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">if you were a "real fan" you would find a way to make a potentially more expensive purchase</a>.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this comment was met with backlash, so the Gearbox exec then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">attempted to justify his comments with a video</a> shared on social media. Here, he admitted he did not know how much Borderlands 4 would cost. </p>
<p>Fast forward to earlier this week, when it was announced the Borderlands 4 standard edition will in fact retail for £59.99 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4">Epic</a>, or <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnMAk">£69.99 for the same version on Xbox Series X/S</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAgD0j">PS5</a>. In the US, it's $70.</p>
<p>After the price reveal, Pitchford took to social media to talk about how "stoked" he is about it all. He added the team has "a TON" of "awesome" DLC planned for Borderlands 4. This will be a mix of free and paid for content.</p>
<p>"Just as we aimed to outdo everything we've done before with the main game, we're pulling out all the stops on our end game and our post launch commitment for Borderlands 4," he wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1935092460536950936">subsequent social media post</a>, adding the team is "just getting started, baby!"</p>
<p>In Pitchford's words: "We're not holding anything back!" (though, Gearbox does need to "land" the game itself first).</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.playforum.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=503136">PlayForum</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5s-stellar-blade-is-reportedly-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), developer Shift Up has secured a dev kit for the Switch 2 and has begun intial work for a supposed port of the game. The team has also gifted a whole bunch of Switch 2 units to its employees.</p>
<p>Shift Up itself has told PlayForum that "nothing is confirmed" regarding a potential Switch 2 release, but that it is "reviewing various possibilities internally".</p><p><figure data-videoid="Vza2oSKedQs" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vza2oSKedQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4bcd6evwsrgq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vza2oSKedQs">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The biggest question mark with all of this is whether Sony Interactive Entertainment would handle publishing duties for the Switch 2. The company is no stranger to releasing games on Nintendo hardware, having notably launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_horizon_adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> simultaneously with its PS5 release in 2024.</p>
<p>A hypthetical launch on the Switch 2 isn't entirely out of the question, however, since Stellar Blade recently made its way to the Steam Deck to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawWWDl7FZM">positive critical reception</a>, despite its inability to maintain that 60fps sweet spot.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's vastly improved specs over its predecessor has meant that games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> run remarkably well. The former has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-cyberpunk-2077-tech-review-on-switch-2">praised by Digital Foundry</a>, with positive comparisons made to the game on Xbox Series S in particular.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping our eyes and ears open for a potential Stellar Blade launch on the Switch 2 in the coming months, and we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

			<p>Although Stellar Blade developer Shift Up recently acquired a Nintendo Switch 2 development kit, a port of their popular game is not currently in development.</p>
<p>A new report from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playforum.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=503136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayForum,</a>&nbsp;translated from Korean by&nbsp;<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-switch-2-port-not-confirmed-yet-shift-up-clarifies-in-response-to-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automaton Media,</a> confirmed that Shift Up recently acquired a Nintendo Switch 2 development kit that will allow the studio to develop games for the console.&nbsp;Reportedly, the studio has begun designing content that reflects the console's specifications and unique features, using the experience gained developing Stellar Blade on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>Though a port is quite likely, considering both the game's and the Nintendo Switch 2's success, a new version of Stellar Blade is not already in development. A Shift Up representative confirmed to PlayForum that they have nothing to confirm regarding a Switch 2 port, as the studio is currently reviewing various possibilities internally.</p>
<p>After being a PlayStation 5 exclusive for about one year, Stellar Blade finally made its debut on PC last week. The game has quickly become a smashing success on the platform, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">selling 1 million units in only three days</a>, bringing the total number of units sold to over 3 million. This success on the market is wholly deserved, as it is an engaging action role-playing game, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

I've leveled up, I've got lots of juice, and a cool sword, and stuff like that, and I just throw myself at them again, and again, and again, and again.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was the technique I learned with Dark Souls," he continued. “It's not that you get better, it's more like monkeys and typewriters. You just keep doing it, and eventually, one day they're dead.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it turns out, Garland never had quite the trouble with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Starscourge_Radahn_Location_and_Boss_Fight_Guide">Starscourge Radahn</a>, instead offering his very own game help guide on how to take down the gravity magic-harnessing horseman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Radahn's really easy”, stated Garland. “I thought Radahn was quite easy, because as long as you sort of activated the people who can assist you in that fight, they get on with fighting him, and they take off whatever it is, half his energy, and you finish him off. It's all about activating those little summon signs dotted around.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Can we expect either of these bosses to appear in A24's upcoming Elden Ring film adaptation? Well, as you may expect, Garland gave us no details on what he plans to do with the project. Indeed, we know next to nothing about the Elden Ring movie, which is in the works from Garland as writer and director, Elden Ring publisher Bandai Namco, and A24. Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin, who helped create the original Elden Ring, is attached as a producer on the movie, as is Vince Gerardis. DNA’s Peter Rice will also produce, along with Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich from DNA. There’s no word yet on how involved FromSoftware or game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think the story of the Elden Ring movie should be? I, for one, think it would be smart to tackle a prequel based on the events of The Shattering, rather than the story of the game itself. Got your own idea?

                <p>Everyone knew that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/" data-ref-id="1100-6532411">Nintendo Switch 2</a> was going to be the hottest game console of 2025, but someone has provided an entirely different kind of heat. Earlier this month, thieves stole nearly 3,000 Nintendo Switch 2 consoles out of a truck without being detected until it was too late.</p><p>A semi-truck driver reported the theft on June 8 at a truck stop in Bennett, Colorado. The driver told police that he discovered the missing Switch 2 boxes while performing a pre-trip inspection. Police determined that 2,810 Switch 2 consoles were taken.</p><p>"They retail at $499. The cost to Nintendo is just over $410," said Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office public information officer Anders Nelson. "So either way you look at it, it's well over $1 million worth of merchandise stolen."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fp0MGCgz2Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-fp0MGCgz2Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/nintendo-switch-theft-truck-colorado/73-27ca5808-6901-4229-b1b4-4862c73b300b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">9NBC</a>'s report, MSU Denver computer science professor Steve Beaty noted that the thieves may use the Dark Web to sell the stolen consoles, but that doesn't mean the trail has gone entirely cold for Nintendo or the police. They can potentially identify the stolen consoles by their serial numbers when they go online.</p><p>"Nintendo does have the capability of what we call bricking the device and that is to make it nonfunctional," added Beaty.</p><p>In the past, Nintendo has gone to great lengths to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">track down and identify Switch 1 pirates</a>, so it's entirely plausible that the company will flag any stolen Switch 2 consoles that show up on its radar. But for now, the thieves behind this truck stop heist have yet to be caught.</p><p>Players in Japan have had such difficulty getting Switch 2 consoles because of resellers jacking up the price that they've been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/japan-is-getting-goofy-with-switch-2-marketplace-listings/1100-6532415/" data-ref-id="1100-6532415">posting parody listings for it on third-party marketplaces</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has received a fresh update for those playing in early access, as the studio finally approaches the final phase of development ahead of a full release.</p>
<p>Supergiant's sequel has been in early access for over a year, with its full release highly anticipated after both the success of the original game and positive praise for Hades 2. While many had expected an announcement as part of Summer Game Fest season (or the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s release), alas that time has come to pass.</p>
<p>There's no date yet for the full release, but at least Hades 2 is approaching its final form. "We're heading into the final phase of Hades 2 development, which involves adding the story's true ending and other finishing touches," reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512959549469100056">blog post from the developer</a>. "Please note we do not yet have a v1.0 launch date, though we'll share more as soon as we can."</p>

<p>It continues: "As we wind down our Early Access phase, our goal remains ensuring we've created our biggest, most replayable, most feature-rich game yet, and - most importantly - a worthy successor to the original Hades.</p>
<p>"We have a big game to wrap up! While we can't yet say when our v1.0 launch will be, we're very excited to be getting close, and to share the complete experience with you. This also means some of the most important work on Hades 2 is still to come, so may moonlight guide us! And to all our Early Access players, thank you for being here, and sharing your impressions of The Unseen Update with us."</p>
<p>As for The Unseen Update, it adds Hidden Aspects to the Nocturnal Arms, giving each weapon an all-new fighting style to unlock; new "stronger-than-ever" Guardians to beat; expanded magicks with Godsent Hexes; fresh optional story events to strengthen bonds with characters; and revamped Umbral Flames for a "snappier fighting style".</p>
<p>The update is available for free for those who have purchased the game in early access.</p>
<p>To finish Hades 2's development, Supergiant is adding: a true ending to conclude Melinoë's story, Achievements, and final touches of polish. Hopefully that means a launch date won't be too far off.</p>
<p>At the moment the game is only available in early access on Steam, but its full launch will include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">release on Switch and Switch 2 as a timed console exclusive</a>, as confirmed by Supergiant in April.</p>
<p>The original Hades was first released on PC and Switch in full, before arriving on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and later iOS (via Netflix).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-says-grounded-2-wont-have-lan-multiplayer-either-and-its-a-huge-shame<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Grounded 2 won't have local multiplayer support, just as there wasn't - and still isn't - LAN support in the current Grounded game. "We can confirm that Grounded 2 will be consistent with the prior game and does not support LAN multiplayer," a spokesperson from Obsidian told Eurogamer. I asked for an explanation why but was told Obsidian had nothing further to share.</p>
<p>It's a shame. The sequel presents Obsidian with an opportunity to revisit areas of the teens-shrunk-in-a-backyard co-op game that could use revision, and LAN multiplayer is one of these, trivial though it might seem.</p>
<p>Currently, in order to play Grounded with someone in the same room or house as you - and it sounds like this will be the case for the sequel - you need to connect via the internet first. In other words, you need to send a signal out of your house so it can be sent back to your house to connect to the other person's machine. The result? Latency, or lag as it's more commonly called, which causes a delayed response in the game and rubber-banding - a term used to describe characters or creatures which fast-forward suddenly to different places in the game.</p>

<p>Lag is not only annoying to play with but in Grounded's case, deadly. Back at launch, in 2020, I spent a couple of days writing guides about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-spiders-wolf-spiders-orb-weavers-7041">how to kill the spiders in Grounded</a>, because they're a menace, patrolling large areas of the back garden and attacking with speed and aggression if they catch you with eyesight of them. The wolf spiders in particular were ferocious. It was possible to defeat them if you learnt their attack patterns and had precise parry timing, but it was still hard to do.</p>
<p>However, confident I could deal with the spiders, I encouraged my partner to play the game with me, both of us playing on different machines in the same room. But I couldn't beat the spiders; the lag introduced by connecting via the internet meant I couldn't reliably perform the parry timings I'd learned. If I hosted the game, that changed, but one of us always suffered high latency as a result.</p>
<p>I couldn't understand why there was no LAN support in the game, given gaming's long history with LAN multiplayer: local networks were the preferred way to play together before broadband and stable internet connections came in. Plenty of other games - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> for example - offer LAN multiplayer as standard. So I went online to see if I was the only person having the problem. I was not.</p>

<p>"How difficult would it REALLY be for the devs to enable LAN support on multiplayer?" one poster <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedGame/comments/yz3osb/how_difficult_would_it_really_be_for_the_devs_to/">on Reddit asked in 2022</a>, two years after the game's release. "The rubber banding is so bad it makes me not want to play on very decent internet connections..."</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/128939-multiplayer-lan-latency-problem/">on the Obsidian forum</a>, again in 2022, a reply to a similar thread read: "This has been an issue from day one. I have posted about it here and on other forums. I have not ever seen the developers mention anything about fixes or work arounds for players attempting to plan LAN or from the same internet connection. It's pretty sad really. In my household we have 5 copies of this game, and we are unable to play it together because of the lag and terrible performance when trying to do so, from the same internet connection."</p>
<p>A lack of LAN support in Grounded is a prevalent enough problem for me and others that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/groundeds-inch-high-garden-survival-is-getting-a-sequel-and-its-out-very-soon">when Grounded 2 was announced a couple of weeks ago</a>, the main thing I was looking for was confirmation of LAN multiplayer support. But of course it never came, despite, again, Obsidian and Xbox underlining the game's focus on co-operative multiplayer.</p>
<p>My worry reading Obsidian's response to Eurogamer, about there being no LAN support in Grounded 2, is this has become the company's stance on the matter - that Grounded 1 and 2 will simply never have LAN support. But why? Is there a fundamental issue with the game's code that prevents LAN play, or is it something to do with Microsoft requiring an Xbox Live sign-in for security and validation reasons? Perhaps it's just a way to push Xbox Live. Even if it's all of those things, I still can't see why LAN support should be an impossibility. It would help if Obisidian would explain.</p>
<p>As it stands, this is disappointing and a missed opportunity. I enjoyed Grounded and I'm excited by the sequel, but I'm put off at the prospect of high latency ruining my co-operative experience again.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 releases 29th July on Steam Early Access and the Xbox Game Preview program.</p>

<p>Oh, boy... Look, we know folks are eager to get their hands on the Switch 2, but this ain't it.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YulZM-vmg7Q">9News</a>, over 2,800 Switch 2 consoles have been stolen from a semi-truck while it was en route to a GameStop in Texas. The theft was discovered while the driver was at a Love's truck stop in Bennett, Colorado on 8th June during a routine inspection.</p>
<p>It's not, however, currently known exactly when or where the heist actually took place.</p>
<p>The total value of the consoles has been estimated at $1.4 million. Investigations are naturally still ongoing at the time of writing, so we'll just have to keep an eye on this one and see how things shake out.</p>
<p>One GameStop store recently come under fire for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">stapling receipts to Switch 2 console boxes</a>, penetrating the packaging and damaging the console's screen inside. The company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-gamestop-tries-to-make-light-of-switch-2-staple-fiasco-but-lands-in-more-trouble">attempted to make light of the situation</a> with an amusing social media post, but again drew criticism for having allegedly used a photo that rightly belongs to the outlet Bloomberg.</p>

            <p>The best thing about Steam's Next Fests nowadays is that there are so many games. The most terrifying thing about Steam's Next Fests nowadays is that there are so damn many games. It's no surprise then, that according to calculations by developer Chris Hanney and the GameDiscoverCo newsletter, the latest summer Next Fest continued a trend of substantial year-on-year demo number growth.</p>
<p>Hanney, a dev on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-pirate-trainer">Space Pirate Trainer</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shredders">Shredders</a> among others, has had a go at pulling the numbers on the numbers of demos uploaded to Steam during each next fest running back to 2019's Game Awards-adjacent first edition.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hanney.bsky.social/post/3lrrxxznsis2m">Hanney's findings</a>, that December 2019 Steam Game Festival saw just 44 demos go live, whereas the latest June 2025 Next Fest included 1994 of them, all vying for your eyeballs, keyboards, mice, and firstborn children. On the other hand, GameDiscoverCo's <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/who-won-june-2025s-steam-next-fest">latest newsletter</a> cites the latter number as being in the region of 2,600 demos. As GameDiscover's Simon Carless points out: "It’s difficult to get an exact demo count, because lots of games drop out late or don’t submit valid demos and have to be culled."</p>
<p>Hanney's graph cites the numbers as being pretty stable between 160-ish on the low end to 300 demos on the higher end per fest throughout most of 2020 to 2022, with some fluctuation up and down. Then, things hit June 2023, which had 344 demos, and haven't stopped increasing since then. The biggest jump it cites is from 1079 demos in 2024's October Next Fest to 1710 in this February's edition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GameDiscoverCo's data has October 2024's Next Fest at an even higher number of demos than June '25, putting it at 3,008. The thing both sources have in common is pointing to a general year-on-year increase in demo numbers from June 2023 to this month, aligning with the idea that Next Fests are generally getting more crowded as time goes on.</p>
<p>So, what kind of boost did the top performers get out of this latest Next Fest, with all of that competition? Well, taking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> out of the equation as GameDiscoverCo cites it as a bit of an outlier since it fully launched during this June's Next Fest, two games are cited as <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZFAPcHkdkjZppOxWHlU6sq3qNqWBe3ExLXrDNyzEVpU/edit?gid=479676648#gid=479676648">having gained over 100,000 wishlists</a>. ARPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vindictus-defying-fate">Vindictus: Defying Fate</a> was the best non-SB performer, adding 151,605 wishlists to push its pre-fest total of 592,569 up to 744,174. Meanwhile, third place Dispatch gained 110,239 to go from 434,671 to 544,910.</p>
<p>Most of the top titles saw their wishlists multiply by similar factor in proportion to their pre-fest total. The biggest growers, and the exceptions to that trend, were the likes of Mr. Billion: Idle Rich Tycoon - which went from 864 pre-fest wishlists to 22,788, multiplying its wishlist total by 26 in the process. Topping that growth was bullet hell roguelike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terratech">TerraTech</a> Legion, which the data cites as having grown from one solitary wishlist to 20,715, multiplying its total by, er, 20,715.</p>
<p>I looked at the <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-the-top-announcements-of">publication's data</a> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T__AlDt9BDFsKutObeaijwp7oI9Z4Def8sGNO8GMT_Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0">'Not-E3' showcase season wishlist bumps</a>, and Next Fests are still lagging a bit behind those numbers at this point, though it is worth noting Vindictus: Defying Fate's Next Fest wishlist increase would have put it just inside the top 10 of that ranking of 'Not-E3' games' wishlists in the five days after they made their showcase appearances. Just behind Grounded 2 at 168,409 and ahead of the likes of Nioh 3 and Final Fantasy Tactics, though all of those games' totals were stating from zero.</p>
<p>GameDiscoverCo noted in its <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/which-games-hit-big-in-steams-feb?open=false#%C2%A7which-games-hit-big-in-the-feb-next-fest">February 2025 Next Fest analysis</a> that comparing that iteration to February 2024's Fest illustrated the top demos benefitting by a tiny bit more, while there was much more interest in the games further down the publication top 100 rankings, with the caveat that the substantial year-on-year growth in the total number of demos in the Next Fest arena is likely making it a lot tougher to get close to the top 100 spots.</p>
<p>This is the point that inspired Hanney's post, with the growth of Next Fests changing what they represent from the perspectives of game makers looking to use them to get eyes on their works. "The best worst part of this is always - every GDC talk [on launching games via Steam and gaining traction] is already out of date by the time it is given," wrote former Left 4 Dead writer Chet Faliszek in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chetsucks.com/post/3lrryp4swvc2g">a reply</a> to the post, "You have to be always moving, always trying new things."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That, however, isn’t always possible. Why? The developer of an upcoming Terminator video game has offered an explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terminator-2d-no-fate">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a>, due out this September, is a retro game based on 1991 action masterpiece <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-2-judgment-day">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>. It features iconic characters from the movie, such as John and Sarah Connor, the T-1000 and the T-800. Check out gameplay and comments from the developers at Bitmap Bureau in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Terminator 2D: No Fate <em>does</em> feature the T-1000 and the T-800 characters, it does not feature Arnie’s likeness. Speaking to IGN, publisher Reef Entertainment explained why, and in the process lifted the lid on how licenses like these tend to work for video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reef, with the Terminator 2 license to play with, has the rights to use the characters from the movie such as Sarah and John Connor, and on top of that, it has image rights for certain actors who have provided those rights to Studio Canal, which owns the rights to the first two Terminator films, as part of the agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the rights to use the Terminator itself does not include the rights to use Arnie's likeness. That’s why Terminator 2D: No Fate uses the endoskeleton for character artwork, rather than Arnie’s likeness.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/gettyimages-1203004081-1750236768610.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Michael Edwards as Old John Connor. Photo by CBS via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as all that, Reef got in touch with Michael Edwards, the actor who played General John Connor in the iconic opening of Terminator 2, to do a likeness deal for the video game. Terminator 2D: No Fate includes gameplay that sees the player control future war John Connor in a fight against the machines, fleshing out that brief opening scene in the movie into an entire section of the video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the movie, you only see Edwards’ John Connor for a few seconds, but those seconds are memorable indeed; his heavily scarred face and steely gaze looking out over the battlefield tell us he’s seen and done all sorts in humanity’s desperate struggle for survival against the machines. So Reef reached out separately to the 80-year-old actor to do a deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(It turns out that in 2021, Edwards reprised the role of John Connor in a fan-made Terminator film called <a href="https://youtu.be/tF89pdWxaZw?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skynet</a>.)</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/screenshot-2025-06-18-095636-1750237011381.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Michael Edwards reprised the role of John Connor in 2021 fan film Skynet. Image credit: Blinky Productions Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In short: there’s a difference between signing the Terminator 2 license and having the agreement to use the characters, compared to the actor’s likeness, which is separate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t to say it is impossible to get Arnie’s likeness for use in video games. After all, Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm has managed it multiple times, most recently for Mortal Kombat 1’s DLC character Conan the Barbarian. Before that, NetherRealm managed to get Arnie for the Terminator T-800 DLC character in Mortal Kombat 11. But there’s a gulf between the scope of a game like Terminator 2D: No Fate and the Warner Bros.-backed Mortal Kombat series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s worth noting that while NetherRealm’s Arnie likeness is in, a soundalike voice actor (Chris Cox) was used for his lines. It doesn’t look like the 77-year-old Schwarzenegger is in the business of doing video game voice work.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Reed Entertainment’s comment to IGN on how all this works in full:</p><blockquote>Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't in the game it’s just a T800. We didn't have his license, unfortunately. But for the rest, you have to ask each actor individually to use his portrait.</blockquote><blockquote>What we have is the right to use the characters. So like Sarah, John, T1000, T800, and then certain actors will also provide image rights to Studio Canal, which is included in the agreement. For example; Linda Hamilton is Sarah Connor, which is why you can see Linda at the beginning of the trailer. Whereas our right to use the Terminator itself, it doesn't include Arnold. When you see the character artwork for that, you'll see it's like the Terminator itself rather than Arnold. It's basically the endoskeleton that we have the right to use.</blockquote><blockquote>Michael Edwards played the future war version of John in the opening of T2. You see him, he lowers his binoculars, he's looking over the battlefield. Someone like that, we reached out separately to him to include his likeness. There's a definite difference between signing the T2 license and having the agreement to use the characters compared to the actor's likeness, which is separate.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by CBS via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the early sales of the Nintendo Switch 2 console (the new gaming hardware <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over 3.5 million units in the first four days and is said to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling</a> twice as fast as the original Switch), gaming market analysis firm DFC Intelligence has slightly bumped its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original forecast for 2025</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now the key driver of industry growth for 2025. DFC has increased its forecast for Switch 2 unit sales from 15 million to 16 million. If manufacturing could meet demand, the Switch 2 could sell as many as 20 million units, but DFC considers this unlikely as Nintendo is expected to take a conservative approach to inventory.</em></p>
<p><em>Reflecting its historically conservative approach to new product forecasting, Nintendo is estimating sales of 15 million Switch 2 units through the end of its fiscal year in March 2026. When the original Switch launched in March 2017, Nintendo initially projected 10 million units for the fiscal year but ultimately sold 15 million units in that period. Based on that track record, the fact that Nintendo is forecasting a 15 million unit number gives us confidence that they will be able to ramp up supply and navigate tariff challenges.</em></p>
<p>The long-term forecast hasn't changed. DFC Intelligence still <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecasts</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell as many as a hundred million units by the end of 2029, which would make it by far the leader in the console market for this generation. They also still believe Nintendo is trying to become more of a primary partner for third-party publishers, in contrast to its previous positioning as a separate player from Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed-14-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>When it comes to the overall industry, both the Nintendo Switch 2 and GTA VI from next year should help set new hardware and software sales records between 2026 and 2029, as seen in the chart above.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-players-kept-getting-squashed-by-ornithopters-so-an-update-has-made-everyone-invulnerable-to-vehicle-bashing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The developers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> have just released a patch in response to player complaints about the game's PvP zones. Folks were annoyed because they kept getting crushed to death by other players piloting an ornithopter (Dune's big flying bug vehicle). It was irksome because it's difficult to damage said vehicle or fight back in any meaningful way. The devs solution is pretty straightforward: "Players no longer receive damage when hit by vehicles". The same patch also addresses respawn times in PvP areas.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When it comes to the crushy ornithopters, the patch may mean we get <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/we-have-people-working-on-fixing-the-goomba-stomping-dune-awakenings-pvp-is-getting-dominated-by-packs-of-rabid-ornithopter-pilots-squishing-their-enemies/">fewer moments like this</a>, in which on-foot players are hounded and repeatedly squished by others flying a ship, like some freaky sci-fi version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SutDTIhbQ2g">Steven Speilberg's Duel</a>. Although I am certain some people will still find some creative ways to grief others using the bulky ships. As for the respawning, that was a whole other issue.</p>
<p>"Respawn timeout in PvP zones was adjusted," say <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546738448831086611">the patch notes</a>. "The first respawn will take 70 seconds, [the] second and following respawns will take 115 seconds."</p>
<p>This is a big increase from the previous respawn timers, which irritated players for being too short and allowing defeated opponents to come back and harrass you before you can even enjoy the spoils of your victory. One player complained a respawn was never longer than 12 seconds. "Even when you win a long winded battle the losing team will just re-spawn instantly in the local area," said the player in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lafve6/comment/mxmoaxp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1">miffed Reddit post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/funcom-says-its-working-on-a-bunch-of-changes-for-dune-awakening-pvp-after-player-calls-out-the-survival-mmos-biggest-issue/">PC Gamer</a>.

</figure>
<p>This was especially taxing when fighting a group larger than your own, said the player, since a big enough clan can always have enough fighters on the field. </p>
<p>"[Even] when you pick off members they are back in the fray before you can blink, which just feels bad... As it currently stands, even if you have the better team and beat the odds the larger group will always win as they can just keep chucking bodies at it till the other team gives up or their gear breaks." </p>
<p>As it happened, a developer from Funcom saw this post and responded to it. "We are working on a bunch of changes/fixes to these things," said the dev at the time. "Please bear with us."</p>
<p>And now they've tweaked it. Will 70 seconds be enough? I don't know, I'm probably not the person to ask. I tend to avoid PvP zones - the feel of the game's combat just doesn't click for me, and I don't fancy losing gear when it's a bit of grind to get that gear. An extraction shootist I am not. But I did like the world and many other survival game elements, as I said in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-review">Dune: Awakening review</a>. </p>
<p>There were some other minor fixes in the patch, including fixes for crashy moments and one frightening issue that would "cause the player to lose Solaris deposited in the bank". Your economic security is assured. Except you may still lose all your pocket money if swallowed by Shai-Hulud, of course.</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario Sunshine" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f804adf8a94a5/super-mario-sunshine.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> is often regarded as a bit of an oddball entry in Nintendo's flagship platforming series. It has its fair share of jank, sure, but it's also considered to be a cult classic with fans thanks to its unique gameplay mechanics and memorable setting.</p>
<p>If you happened to be clued in to the game's initial release back in 2002, then you might recall the time when Nintendo pulled off one of the most ridiculous marketing stunts we've ever seen, and it involves pasta – <em>lots</em> of pasta.</p>
<p>Y'see, Nintendo served up a total of 3,265 pounds of so-called 'Pasta a la Mario' at San Francisco's Little Italy, effectively breaking the Guinness World Record for the largest bowl of pasta.</p>
<p>Attendees who arrived dressed as Mario or Luigi were invited to jump into the bowl of pasta and recover hidden Nintendo-themed prizes, including a rather lucrative trip to Hawaii.</p>
<p>Footage of the event has resurfaced thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jusdberube.bsky.social">Justin D. Berube</a> over on Bluesky, who has had short videos of the stunt saved for decades.</p>


<p>Gross, right? Pretty funny, though.</p>
<p>If you're itching to replay Super Mario Sunshine and happened to miss out on the limited 2020 compilation <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> for the Switch, you'll be pleased to know that the game is scheduled to launch on the GameCube NSO app for the Switch 2 at some point in the near future.</p>
<p>GameCube games are exclusive to the Switch 2 via the Expansion Pack subscription tier, with three games playable at launch. This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>.</p>
