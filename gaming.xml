            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-Ukraine-reburn-la-quimera</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metro-dev-4a-ukraine-rebrands-to-reburn-and-reveals-brand-new-pc-fps.1121391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-Ukraine-reburn-la-quimera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series developer 4A Ukraine has announced that it's changing its name, and that its next project will be a narrative-led first-person shooter based on an entirely original IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, 4A Ukraine' new name is Reburn, and it's currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, a game the studio describes as an "action-packed first-person shoter with a heavy focus on narrative, world design, and characters".</p>

<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series' oppressive subterranean tunnels,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>will take place in "a fictional Latin American megalopolis" and will revolve around a "down-on-their-luck PMC outfit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=1KNYrj3i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=ALSsfXh4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the next project from Reburn (formerly known as 4A Ukraine).</figcaption></figure><p>Rather impressively, Reburn says it's working with filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn for the "world and narrative" of&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>. Refn is best known for movies like&nbsp;<em>Drive&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Neon Demon</em>, as well as 2008's prison drama&nbsp;<em>Bronson</em>.</p>

<p>The studio promises that the game's world will combine "Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology", which, I suppose, is where the title comes from.</p>

<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>in single-player, but if you want to, you can also team up with up to two friends for three-player co-op. Seems a little strange to stop at three, but hey, if it's good enough for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, it's good enough for&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, I guess.</p>

<p>Reburn says you can expect the same kind of "tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" you're familiar with from the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series, as well as "highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons".</p>




<p>Whatever the case may be,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, although it doesn't have a release date yet. No console version appears to be planned for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>It's been a long time since MercurySteam released an original game, but the studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-samus-returns-review/1900-6416751/" data-ref-id="1900-6416751">Metroid: Samus Returns</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-dread-review-space-truckin/1900-6417757/" data-ref-id="1900-6417757">Metroid Dread</a> has finally revealed a first look at its upcoming dark fantasy action-RPG Blades of Fury. In the announcement trailer below, players are introduced to Aran de Lira as he prepares to face his destiny head-on against some dangerous foes. Luckily for Aran, he's well-armed with weapons of his own creation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WOrS00j1Zo" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8WOrS00j1Zo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the game's backstory, Aran is the firstborn of the King's Ward, and he's forced to take a stand after the recently crowned Queen Nerea uses dark magic to solidify her power in the kingdom. Thanks to Nerea's spell, all steel in the kingdom has been turned to stone, and only the evil creatures at her command have the divine metal that can obliterate any normal weapon used against them.</p><p>That's why Aran will have to forge his own weapons to counter the divine metal's power, and there are several different weapons that can be chosen. Players will have to determine which weapons are most effective against the wide variety of monsters they encounter in the game. Picking the wrong weapon could have grave consequences and leave Aran unable to defeat his foes.</p><p>MercurySteam has teased that certain details about the story will be unknown, and "you will know only what our heroes know; your intuition and courage must fill in the rest." Thankfully, Aran doesn't have to figure it all out for himself. His companion, Adso, can aid him during battles with suggestions about how to defeat the creatures. Adso also speaks the language of the ancient forger, which will come in handy as they brave dangerous castles and mazes.</p><p>Blades of Fire will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC via the Epic Games Store on May 22.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-civ-7-update-ui<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I had quite a few issues with <em>Civilization VII </em>upon release</a>, but the most pressing was simply the fact that the game wasn't done. Thanks to some internal upheaval and an inflexible release schedule, the <em>Civilization VII </em>we all started playing earlier this month felt more like a playtest than a finished product. </p><p>The user interface, for example, had been completely overhauled relatively close to release, and just wasn't ready! And loads of other quality of life features that you expect from <em>Civ</em>, and that have shipped with previous games at launch, were also missing. </p><p>To give you an idea of just how incomplete <em>Civilization VII </em>was upon release, take a look at this roadmap for future updates Firaxis released today:</p><figure></figure><p>The fact "additional UI updates &amp; polish" is listed <em>four times</em>, one of them simply in the "more to come" timeframe, should give you an idea of how underbaked the game's menus and information screens are at the moment, and how much more time this game needed in the oven before being released.</p><p>Other coming additions, like auto-exploring, "quick move functionality" and the ability to rename your cities, are also Civ stalwarts that have featured in previous games at launch, and were extremely notable by their absence in <em>Civ VII</em>.</p><p>I want to be clear,<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> like I tried to with my impressions of the game</a>, that a lot of these problems aren't the fault of the <em>team</em>. Games change and evolve and throw out ideas all the time, that's game development. What stings here is that <em>Civ VII</em> was rushed out onto the market before some major changes were actually <em>finished</em>, which for the price 2K were asking--$70 in the US, an incredible AUD$120 here--is some bullshit.</p><p>Maybe by April enough of those updates will have been polished to make the game worth a revisit? That said, given how much work lies ahead, those holding out for a drastically-improved experience might be better served waiting for "beyond". </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
