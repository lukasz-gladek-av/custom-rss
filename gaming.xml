			<p>You know Theme Hospital and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/30/two-point-hospital-review/">Two Point Hospital</a>? Well, what if you made a hospital management game a lot like those management sim classics, but shot it up into the one place that hasn’t been corrupted by capitalism? Space! That’s Galacticare in a (space) nutshell.</p>
<p><iframe title="Galacticare Release Trailer | Launching May 23" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M09LcfXv7XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, space healthcare is really just a vast expanse for capitalism to exploit and your goal as the administrator of a series of Galacticare space stations is to build them up into effective and profitable healthcare institutions. There’s a decently lengthy campaign to progress through, with a sequence of story missions to beat and some pure sandbox maps alongside. It starts off in Earth’s orbit, takes you to provide for Burning Moon music festival, has you tend to a gigantic space farm, a space prison full of clones, and more.</p>


<p>As you’d expect from this corner of the management sim genre, there’s all manner of weird and wonderful diseases that you’ll encounter, including ones that turn people into star fields, give them metal craniums, a bit of jellification, and on and on. Treating them? Well, the Boning Chamber is there to use an industrial robot dog to gobble up and recombine patient with new bones, there’s lasers, giant guns, skin generating tanks, and on and on.</p>
<p>It’s all laced with a pleasing sense of humour, very much in keeping with its inspirations, and that’s aided by the narrative and characters. From the computer’s put downs of the janitor bot, to the quirky alien inflections, and the Matt Berry-adjacent rival CEO, each scenario is given a lot of flavour by these characters. That, and the wonderful evolving space backdrops that you should absolutely keep an eye on as you work through a stage.</p>


<p>The fundamentals of hospital management will be immediately familiar, as you put reception by the entrance, then fill the rest of the space with a growing range of treatment rooms, seating and items to fulfil patient wants and needs. And there’s a lot of wants and needs, as each race has particular desires.</p>
<p>The Tenki want to see high-tech upgraded rooms, the Dyonai want flora and fauna, the Vizarj desire windows and toilets – so I put toilets right next to windows looking into rooms – while us plain old humans want to see… cupboards, lockers, trolleys and posters. In general, you need to keep the place tidy, make sure there’s enough seating, doctor break rooms, vending machines and so on.</p>

<p>It might seem like that’s a lot to juggle, but really all of these demands are complimentary with one another, so you can very quickly rattle through and comply with all of these demands in a slap dash fashion or with your own room templates – it could have been interesting for human patients to be a little grossed out by alien decorations, for example, but letting you have a clumsy hodgepodge of decorations ensures it’s fast and accessible.&nbsp;It’s the room upgrades that take a while to acquire, as they rely on crafting holograms with a special currency, or buying them from the space whale trader called Baz.</p>
<p>There’s also not a huge amount of depth to the doctors you employ. Each has two perks and one con, which might shape your hiring when one is much more likely to kill a patient and blow up a room, but aside from that, there’s a simple room-based specialisation to choose and then basic levelling up after that point. Training rooms can be used to accelerate their levelling, but it’s really just about matching doctors to their specialism to ensure they’re working as efficiently as possible. There’s more nuance to the named consultant characters, unlocked through the story and with perk trees that boost their influence to your hospital.</p>
<p>There’s some neat touches to the care that each condition needs in Galacticare. While some will have a straight path from diagnosis room to a relevant treatment room, others (and particularly those that feature as mission objectives) have chains of treatment that put more demands on your hospital layout, waiting areas and capacity. It’s a somewhat more straightforward take on Two Point Hospital bouncing patients between different diagnosis rooms. It also helps to make all of the treatment rooms more multi-purpose, beyond the illness they were first introduced for.</p>

<p>You can funnel your treatment path through more than just canny room placement. Rooms can have be set with illnesses to prioritise, patients can be marked as priority, and through this you can optimise your hospital performance quite handily. At the same time, you can kind of just go with the flow, do the fundamentals decently well, and get past the tipping point of profitability to enable you to quickly open up a whole new wing, adding capacity at the cost of an influx of less specialised doctors.</p>
<p>It all adds up to a hospital management sim that’s a shade easier to grasp the depths of, that’s a little more accessible. You can happily set the game to fast forward as your cash pools fill up for the next big expansion, dipping in to squish space bugs for rewards and to avoid mess, or to grab freebies from Baz when he appears like a curious whale off the side of your station. Perhaps the biggest difficulty I’ve run into is keeping corridor congestion down – something the Kouber Baly desire – needing to have enough diagnostics rooms to keep up, and emphasising the mission critical treatment rooms a level needs.</p>

<p>Beginning May 21st, the collaborative event between Moonstone Island and Cassette Beasts will commence, introducing new content to both games. Cassette Beasts will feature Moonstone Island-inspired costumes, while Moonstone Island will habe the addition of Cassette Beasts’ Pombomb to its Spirit roster.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/26/cassette-beasts-review/">Cassette Beasts Review</a></h2>
<p>For our Cassette Beasts review, Nic said, <em>“Cassette Beasts is simply one of the best Pokémon-like games I’ve come across, and I’m looking forward to earning a 100% completion. With a massive end-game and modder support built in at release though, I feel like I’m going to get very sidetracked on the way there.”</em></p>

		<p>Please pray for me. The weather is beginning to turn a little warm here, so I turned on the AC for the first time, and it's making a loud noise. A loud noise might not be a big deal! A loud noise <em>could</em> be a big deal! I just looked up how much it costs for the most catastrophic scenario of an AC unit replacement, and I want to scream into a pillow. Here's hoping it's just a minor fix, and we're all on our (cold) way.</p><p>-pk, who's hoping yearly maintenance of the damn thing pays off</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY:</strong> You can here me chatting with Deconstructeam's Jordi de Paco, which was a wonderful chat that first premiered at this year's LudoNarraCon. All of our LudoNarraCon collaborations will be part of the podcast feed in the weeks ahead on the public feed. In a few hours, there will also be a YouTube VOD of our LudoNarraCon demo showcase. </li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>Janet, Rob, and Cado get back together for a third (and likely final?) Manor Lords stream. They'll remember to think about food this time, right? RIGHT?</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>Rob and Patrick were both smitten with the <em>Fallout </em>TV show, so while it does not involve samurai, sadly, we're going to record a podcast about one of the most successful video game adaptations yet. That'll drop next week.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>Remap Radio returns, and I can talk about <em>Hellblade II</em>.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Remap Radio is published, and Cado and I will tackle another wave of tricky sphinx riddles.</li><li><strong>ALL WEEK: </strong>We'll be publishing a few articles this week, including a new banger from Duncan Fyfe, but we're still working out the publishing schedule. I suspect Cado will be streaming some more <em>Balatro</em>, too.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em>support@remapradio.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>

That's where strategic media and influencer partnerships come in. They can be your megaphone, amplifying your game's unique voice and reaching players who are genuinely excited about what you've created.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team here at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reverbinc.com/">Reverb Communications</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has put together a few guidelines to help maximize your outreach efforts.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Identify what makes your game special.">Identify what makes your game special.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before you start pitching, it's crucial to understand where your game fits in the market. Knowing your game's niche will help you target the right media and influencers. Every game has something – a hook, a twist, or a unique feature set. Otherwise it wouldn’t exist! Identifying these Unique Selling Points (USPs) is foundational to your outreach strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Think about what sets your game apart. Is it the art, gameplay mechanics, story, characters, late 90s aesthetic, or something else entirely? Look at successful games in your genre and see how they positioned themselves. Once you've pinpointed your USPs, craft clear, concise messages that highlight them. Bigfry Media does a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124100/Transience/">fantastic job</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> outlining the key features of Transience, the studio’s upcoming indie FPS title.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Create a media kit.">Create a media kit.</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/embrace-the-chaos-how-indie-devs-can-thrive-in-a-changing-and-challenging-market" target="_self">Embrace the Chaos: How Indie Devs Can Thrive in a Changing and Challenging Market</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Think of your media kit as a trusty pocket knife. It's a one-stop shop for everything a journalist or influencer needs to write a story or create content. Typically hosted on file sharing sites like Dropbox or Google Drive, a media kit at minimum should include:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>One-pager:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> A brief overview of the game, hitting the key points and USPs.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Key Art and Screenshots:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Visually showcase your game's style and personality.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Developer Background Info:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This is your opportunity to showcase your bonafides.

A great example is the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://rogueco.com/kits/">press kit site</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from Rogue Games where you’ll find complete asset sets for each of their titles.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Research your targets.">Research your targets.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Make a list of media outlets and creators that cover your game's genre and cater to your target audience. This includes big names like IGN and Gamespot, as well as smaller, niche sites or blogs. Once you have your list, get to know the journalists who write for those outlets. Read their articles, watch their videos, and check out their social media. This will help you tailor your pitches and make genuine connections. Say you’re developing an MMO, here’s how your spreadsheet might look:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Identify the right influencers.">Identify the right influencers.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Influencers are like the cool kids in school – they have a following and people listen to them. Look for influencers who create content relevant to your game's genre and have an engaged audience. Check their average viewership on Twitch or YouTube, and make sure they're consistently posting new content. Tools like Social Blade and Lurkit can help you find potential influencers, but there's no substitute for good old-fashioned research. Watch streams, browse channels, and see who's talking about games like yours.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Build actual relationships.">Build actual relationships.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't just spam targets with generic pitches. Take the time to build real relationships. Follow them on social media, interact with their content, and show genuine interest in their work. When you finally reach out, personalize your pitch and reference something specific they've worked on. Remember, this is the start of a relationship, not a one-off transaction. Be flexible, offer value, and be patient.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Write a good (aka short) pitch.">Write a good (aka short) pitch.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Keep your pitches short, sweet, and to the point. Highlight your game's USPs and explain why it's a good fit for their audience. Reference something specific they've done that made you think of them. And don't be afraid to show your personality – a little humor or a personal touch can go a long way. Here’s an example of an organic pitch that worked for Reverb’s influencer team recently (names have been changed):</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hey NAME,</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We are working on a game called Legendary Hero which is a survival game where players must survive, craft, create and fight to achieve glory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We know you promote chill vibes and good times so we think the next time you want to try a survival title you would enjoy playing Legendary Hero. It’s set to launch onto Steam on March 21st.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We will have keys available closer to launch. The game will have Twitch drops activated at release, and we also want to offer you 48-hour early access with no embargo so you can be one of the first people to get into the full game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you were interested in more information on Legendary Hero, I've included a link to the YouTube trailer below. Thanks for your time and let me know if you are interested in Legendary Hero.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Consider all options.">Consider all options.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Reach out to influencers on various platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Twitter. Coordinate your messaging across these platforms for a consistent brand voice, but tailor the content to each platform's strengths. For example, a Twitch stream might focus on beta gameplay, while a Twitter thread could highlight behind-the-scenes development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A no is actually a yes.">A no is actually a yes.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Success isn't just about getting a "yes" – it's about learning and improving. Track your pitch responses, analyze which ones worked best, and adapt your strategy accordingly. If you're not getting the results you want, don't be discouraged. Use feedback from media and influencers to refine your pitch, messaging, or even your game itself. Happy Hunting!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="366" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the most important things in <em>Attack on Titan Revolution</em> is your Family, which chooses what family-specific perks you receive. The Family you get is completely random, and you must use a spin to randomly roll a new one any time you want to change. Here are all of the <em>Attack on Titan Revolution</em> Family Perks so you know which families are worth trying to roll.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-all-attack-on-titan-revolution-family-perks" data-injectable="false">All <em>Attack on Titan</em> <em>Revolution </em>Family Perks</h2> <p data-characters="702" data-current-count="1002" data-injectable="true">Also known as <em>Attack on Titan Revolution</em> Clan Perks, these perks offer buffs and even skills and abilities to your character based on the Family you are in. There are four Family rarities at the moment: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Unfortunately, Common families don’t offer any sort of perks, while Rare families will grant you a small buff or two as well as potentially a skill. Epic families are guaranteed one skill and 3-5 larger buffs. Finally, the ever-elusive Legendary families provide you with up to three skills, lots of useful buffs, and even some added passives and abilities depending on the family. Here are all <em>Attack on Titan Revolution</em> Family Perks currently in the game:</p>

			<p>The popular vampire-themed survival-RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/v-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V Rising</a> had its full release (following a lengthy early access period) on PC earlier this month, and thankfully, console players won’t have to wait soon to sink their teeth into the game. Today it was announced that V Rising will be launching on PS5 (this one isn’t coming to Xbox for now) in June. You can check out a new PS5 trailer for V Rising, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="V Rising - Date Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IjEw901V7JE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007965/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders for the PS5 version of V Rising are open now</a>, with the standard edition of the game costing $40. You can also grab the $60 Castlevania Edition, which includes the recently-released Castlevania DLC, or the $100 Complete Edition which includes all DLC and cosmetics released to date. Those who pre-order any version of the game will get a 10 percent discount.</p>
<p>Haven’t been keeping up with V Rising? Wccftech’s Francesco De Meo found the full version of the game to be a bloody good time <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/v-rising-bloody-yet-fun-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his review</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Enriched by many additions, including endgame activities that promise to challenge even veteran players' knowledge of the mechanics and fighting skills, the 1.0 version of V Rising is the culmination of two years of hard work. The number of options and activities the game offers to those willing to delve deep into its complex yet satisfying mechanics make for a survival game like few others on the market.</em></p>
<p><em>V Rising may not have the deepest survival game mechanics around, but that is hardly a problem. The experience crafted by Stunlock Studios manages to masterfully weave together mechanics from very different genres to provide an experience like any other on the market. While solo players may find the experience becomes a little stale over time, everyone else will find plenty of reasons to remain in this world, whether it's to perfect their characters or build the most haunting vampire castle ever seen.”</em></p>
<p>V Rising can be played on PC. The game launches on PS5 on June 11. Castlevania and Complete Edition buyers will be able to access the game five days early on June 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Stories 2 Preview: Hands-on With the PlayStation 4 Port]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-2-preview-hands-on-with-playstation-4-port</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-stories-2-preview-hands-on-with-the-playstation-4-port.876234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-2-preview-hands-on-with-playstation-4-port<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following its success on Nintendo Switch and PC a few years ago, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin</em> is at last making itself known on PlayStation platforms. Releasing for PlayStation 4 on June 14 alongside a remastered version of the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-preview-exploring-ps4-remaster"><em>Monster Hunter Stories</em></a>, Capcom is ready to bring the JRPG series to a whole new audience with both games in the series hitting at once.</p>

<p>As we did with the remastered <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>, we had some time to sit down with the PlayStation release of <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> and see just how it ended up working out on Sony’s machine. As this was also my chance to experience the game for the first time, having missed it before its original release, I wanted to take my time and dig into this fairly recent sequel.</p>

<p>From the outset<em>, Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> provides a massive jump across the board from its predecessor. From the opening cutscene, it’s obvious that unshackled from the constraints of a handheld platform, the game is being allowed to flourish.</p>

<p>The visuals are a huge step up – offering high-quality models, environments, and effects that showcase the anime <em>Monster Hunter</em> style taken to modern heights. The cel-shaded style is clean, and the overall direction gave me the impression that this RPG was going to be something big.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518224406_0.jpg?itok=5eDzlgG2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518224406_0.jpg?itok=8s2lWKlB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
As with <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>, <em>Stories 2</em> opens its narrative with the disappearance of the Rathalos, but this time on a much bigger scale. Right away, several characters come into view as you’re tasked with creating one of your own who happens to be descended from a legendary Rider known as Red.</p>

<p>Without diving too much into spoiler territory (and because we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-stories-2-review">original release</a> a few years ago), the story seems to be a lot more mature – focusing on characters that are more mature, and the grand adventures framed by the opening hours keep at an exciting pace.</p>

<p>Character creation goes further in-depth compared to the previous game, with added options for each feature of whichever body type you choose. One thing in particular I liked was the ability to add two different hair tones depending on the style I picked. It’s a small detail, but it goes a long way towards adding some personal customizations.</p>

<p>From there, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> eases you into its systems. Your character, who is basically the protagonist and a newly minted Rider, then gets shown the ropes by a girl named Kayna who acts as a teacher of sorts. Said ropes include showing off the Velocidrome monsties, as well as basic tutorials to ease you into the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518223837.jpg?itok=zNw4DXJ_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518223837.jpg?itok=XJ6emBZW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
After playing through a bit of <em>Stories</em>, I was glad to see <em>Stories 2</em> puts you into the action a lot quicker. There’s far less exposition and more – here’s the world, get on your mount and get going attitude going on.</p>

<p>Outside of the village, the world opens up with larger zones, and plenty of enemies on the field and it’s there you can gather items or fight your way through to more experience.</p>

<p>The turn-based battle system from <em>Stories</em> is largely back in play here as well, although it adds a few mix-ups of its own to keep things fresh in its Rock Paper Scissors-inspired encounters whilst using Power, Strength, and Technical type attacks selected through the command menu.</p>

<p>This time you can attack different parts of the monsters, and battles are more engaging with the ability to swap out weapons mid-battle using the Skill change option. <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> also adds a Kinship Gauge that fills up so you can perform fancy attacks with your companions.</p>

<p>It’s definitely a more fleshed-out experience, and on PlayStation, runs plenty smooth throughout even when there’s a lot going on on-screen in battles or exploring the colorful world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518231708.jpg?itok=V9DCm9Od 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2_-wings-of-ruin_20240518231708.jpg?itok=uIcjJXCb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
I played the preview on PlayStation 5 since it’s compatible and didn’t run into any overt issues. The framerate seems solid, the colors are vibrant, and the upscaling to 4K works fine enough given this isn’t a native PS5 release. My only complaint is there is some aliasing present on the edges of the characters – mostly noticeable in hair and things like that, but it’s not a deal breaker.</p>

<p>Similar to the other platforms, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> on PS4 has maintained its multiplayer elements. That means you can play co-op or multiplayer versus battle with other people on the PlayStation Network.</p>

<p>Co-op quests are of note because there are areas only accessible via multiplayer, and it’s here you’ll be able to encounter exclusive monsters and collect monster eggs – which is a key component of the gameplay loop and monstie customization.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em> on PlayStation feels like a solid effort. It’s a clean port with everything present in the original releases and does well to run smoothly on the current generation platform. Having come from playing the original <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> back-to-back, the upgrade here is immense, and the effort in direction and crafting a bigger world can’t be understated.</p>

<p>What’s more, you could probably pick up <em>Stories 2</em> and get into it just fine on its own, so it does have strength as a standalone title despite its sequel status. Either way, it wouldn’t exactly be a bad jumping-in point if you’re new to the series like me, or if you just want to check out a traditional JRPG you can do just that when it launches on June 14.</p>

  <p id="wkMe26">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/multiversus-guides"><em>MultiVersus</em></a> roster is expanding again, this time with two big bad guys: Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th horror franchise and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22842967/agent-smith-matrix-resurrections-trilogy-sequels-casting-mission">Agent Smith</a> from the Matrix films. Those two villains will join a pair of recently confirmed additions to <em>MultiVersus</em>: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155348/multiversus-joker-gameplay-mark-hamill-powerpuff-girls">the Joker</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT1zXiYqcfA"><em>Adventure Time</em>’s Banana Guard</a>. </p>
<p id="rXHsm9">Developer Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games confirmed Jason and Agent Smith in a new cinematic trailer hyping up the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23933735/multiversus-announcement-relaunch-release-date-warner-bros">impending relaunch of <em>MultiVersus</em></a>. And if you comb through Monday’s new <em>MultiVersus</em> trailer, you might spot teases for a few more unannounced characters. At one point (about 50 seconds in), we see Bugs Bunny crack open the Warner Bros. water tower, from which a few props escape. Those items appear to be Aquaman’s trident, Samurai Jack’s katana, and Octi, the beloved plush octopus of Bubbles from <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em>. There’s also a broomstick, which could belong to the Wicked Witch of the West from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> or someone from the Harry Potter franchise.</p>
<p id="Cr70Yk">There are also background references to DC superheroes Green Lantern, Robin in his <em>Teen Titans Go!</em> form, and Raven, though it’s unclear if those are teases or simply stage dressing.</p>

<p id="XD1c4G">Player First and WB seem to be leaning toward bad guys for the debut season of <em>MultiVersus</em>’ relaunch, season 1 of which is titled Puns &amp; Villainy. So if you’re guessing at new additions in the coming weeks and months, think supervillains.</p>
<p id="9gb4ys"><em>MultiVersus</em> comes back on May 28, with new additions Joker, Jason Voorhees, and Banana Guard available at launch, and Agent Smith coming sometime later in season 1. They’ll join existing characters featured in the trailer: Wonder Woman; Velma; Bugs Bunny; Marvin the Martian; Iron Giant; Rick Sanchez (who apparently knows Batman’s secret identity); Stripe from Gremlins; Finn the Human; and Cake the Cat, a variant of <em>Adventure Time</em>’s Jake the Dog.</p>
<p id="vTPJYJ">WB’s free-to-play fighting game will be available again for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X next week. It will boast a major new feature called <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158526/multiversus-pve-mode-rifts-video">Rifts</a>, <em>MultiVersus</em>’ take on a PvE mode.</p>

<p>It was recently revealed that Stellar Blade’s developer, ShiftUp, is considering a PC version of the game – as well as a sequel. In a report published on a South Korean website (and shared <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1792567131374031009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by KAMI on Twitter</a>), it’s detailed that ShiftUp will continue to expand and plans to release a new game every two or three years. Currently, the studio is working on a new IP called Project Witches which will be a cross-platform game spread between mobile, PC, and console platforms. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stellar-delivery">Stellar Delivery</h2>



<p>It has been reported that Stellar Blade is ‘exceeding expectations’ where sales are concerned. In certain regions, the game has sat at the top of the charts since being released exclusively on PlayStation 5 on April 26. This at-times controversial post-apocalyptic slasher has enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame in recent weeks, something that has really put ShiftUp on the map.</p>



<p>Like other PlayStation-exclusive games, fans have been requesting that Stellar Blade makes its way onto PC – and ShiftUp is at least considering that concept. Most recently, Ghost of Tsushima hit Steam and racked up big numbers despite having some niggling issues.</p>



<p>There’s a drive at ShiftUp to bolster the team and hire more developers as the fresh projects surface over time. It isn’t just new games, though – ShiftUp reportedly wants to secure existing IP and buy out some brands. It just hasn’t been confirmed <strong>what</strong>.</p>

                <p>Monster trucks, the apex predators of motorsport, have left an untold path of destruction over the decades. Now, the unstoppable brutes have added a fresh victim to their list as not even Fortnite's famed battle bus could withstand the crushing force of a 1,500-horsepower monster truck. During a recent Monster Jam event held at the Los Angeles SoFi stadium, a replica of the Battle Bus met its end when it was torn apart. This might just be the worst thing to happen to the Fortnite Battle Bus since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbJOTdZBX1g">YouTube Rewind 2018</a>.</p><p>You can see the full event in the video below, with the car-nage starting at around the four-minute mark.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HNcNtyE6Fk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="259">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6HNcNtyE6Fk?start=259" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For fans of freestyle monster-truck action, there are a few Monster Jam games out in the wild.

After all, Take-Two was among the first major companies to up the price of its topline games from $60 to $70, and now some believe Take-Two could charge even more for the next GTA game.</p><p>CEO Strauss Zelnick was recently asked for his thoughts about "pricing dynamics" for the GTA franchise and its entire portfolio. Zelnick did not comment directly or confirm anything about the price for GTA VI, but he did discuss Take-Two's general thoughts on pricing its products with "value" in mind.</p>

<p>"Look, there's more content constantly being made available, and we really aim to deliver great value at any given time," <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/u6vymezd/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he explained on an earnings call</a>. "We're so focused on delivering more value than what we charge. And that's sort of the rubric. And any time we establish a price, we want to make sure that it's good news for the consumer; that the experience vastly over delivers in the context of the cost. That's the goal."</p><p>While we don't know what the price of GTA VI will be--and no legitimate retailers are taking preorders for it yet--Take-Two has raised GTA ecosystem prices recently. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-gta-6-release-rockstar-raises-gta-price-by-33/1100-6522616/" data-ref-id="1100-6522616">GTA + membership recently raised its price by 33%, from $6/month to $8/month</a>. The price increase went into effect just as L.A. Noire was added to the service; Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption is already in the catalog, as is GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. Rockstar's Bully is coming to GTA+ later this year.</p><p>Many are wondering how GTA+ might factor into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA VI</a> when it releases next year, and that remains unknown. Take-Two has not disclosed anything as of yet regarding the profitability or revenue results from GTA+, but the company has said over the years that GTA Online--which makes money from its microtransactions--has been a big revenue-driver.</p><p>As mentioned, Take-Two was one of the first publishers to charge $70 for new releases, beginning with NBA 2K21. Zelnick said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/charging-70-for-nba-2k21-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-was-the-right-call-take-two-ceo-says/1100-6487277/" data-ref-id="1100-6487277">raising prices by $10 was the right call and was accepted by consumers.</a></p><p>"In terms of frontline pricing for NBA 2K21, I think that worked out very much as expected. And as planned, it's in a premium offering at the highest possible level, the title was built from the ground up for next-gen, so first title here that has been created that way," the executive said. "And the acceptance by consumers has been nothing short of extraordinary."</p><p>Former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden predicted the price increase from $60 to $70 years ago, saying the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/" data-ref-id="1100-6478908">AAA market was "unsustainable"</a> and that $60 for a new release would become "difficult" for big games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-in-fall-2025-window-for-gta-6/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-in-fall-2025-window-for-gta-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="334" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following confirmation that <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> will be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rockstar-narrows-window-for-grand-theft-auto-6-launch-to-fall-2025/">launching in the fall of 2025</a>, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has said the company is “highly confident” it will meet that target, while also setting some rather lofty expectations by calling the game “an experience that no one has seen before.”</p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">In a recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/17/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-take-two-interactive-ceo-strauss-zelnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC interview</a> (spotted and <a href="https://x.com/_Dyllie_/status/1792241924738285669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared by Twitter user Dyllie</a>), Zelnick was asked about the decision-making behind choosing a release window.</p> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">“Well, there is slippage in the industry, and we’re not immune from that,” said Zelnick. “However, we narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing.”</p> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="796" data-injectable="true">He explained there are multiple elements; one of which is determined by how many bugs are in the game. While the team at Rockstar will obviously be aiming to minimize that amount by launch, Zelnick added, “In the case of an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations, it’s not really about bugs. It’s about creating an experience that no one has seen before, and&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;seeks perfection.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Strauss Zelnick (Take-Two CEO) was interviewed by CNBC on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTA6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GTA6</a></p><p>– The game was internally delayed because rockstar seeks perfection, it’s going to be a game NO ONE has EVER seen before. <a href="https://t.co/6rMF374VgR">pic.twitter.com/6rMF374VgR</a></p></div>— Dyllie (@_Dyllie_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Dyllie_/status/1792241924738285669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="596" data-current-count="896" data-injectable="true">I don’t doubt the team at Rockstar is working extremely hard on <em>GTA 6</em>, and it’ll probably be a very good game. However, fan expectations already incredibly high for it (it’s been over 10 years since <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-grand-theft-auto-v/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 5</a></em>, after all), and suggesting <em>GTA 6</em> won’t be like any other video game feels like going overboard. It’s bound to be technically impressive, but I can’t imagine it’ll be that much different from previous <em>GTA</em> games. If anything, if it’s nothing like those games, that only risks upsetting long-time fans who are looking for a new <em>GTA</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="640" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">Zelnick’s comments can arguably be written off as him simply generating hype and not meant to be taken at face value. However, Take-Two itself likely has the highest expectations of all for <em>GTA 6</em>. <em>GTA 5</em> made $1 billion in just three days (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/20/gta-5-sales-hit-1-billion-in-three-days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) when it launched in 2013; is Take-Two expecting similar results? If anything, it may want even better results since<em> GTA 6</em> is no doubt proving more expensive to make than its predecessor, but a lot has changed in the past decade. Game prices have gone up and not everyone’s willing to drop $70 on a new release, especially when everything else has been getting more expensive too.</p>
 <p data-characters="587" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="false">As for that fall release date, Zelnick has acknowledged Take-Two isn’t immune to “slippage,” suggesting a delay isn’t entirely out of the question. That said, Take-Two will probably avoid pushing <em>GTA 6</em> back if it can, and only agree to a delay as a last resort. After all, given the fan expectations, <em>GTA 6</em> does stand to make a lot of money and Take-Two will want that income ASAP. It’s not going to want to wait till the game’s ‘perfect,’ since such a goal is frankly unobtainable, or at the very least take up even more development time.</p>

<p data-characters="181" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Vampires can be found in pretty much all media, going from classic books and movies to, of course, anime. The latter of which presents some truly novel interpretations of vampirism.</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">As you can imagine, however, not every series featuring them is sure to deliver. But don’t worry, as the ones that do are enough to make you fall in love with the concept even more. Here are the 10 best vampire anime of all time.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">10. Night Warriors: Darkstalkers’ Revenge</h2> <figure data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: Not officially available for streaming in the US.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="532" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">Let’s be honest, the ’90s were the golden era for Capcom anime. <em>Night Warriors: Darkstalkers’ Revenge</em> is a four-part OVA series that covers the events of the second game of the <em>Darkstalkers</em> franchise. Although not without flaws, the series offers superb animations and a more sober retelling of the game’s plot. <em>Night Warriors: Darkstalkers’ Revenge</em> was produced by Madhouse. Among their best works, we also have the anime adaptations of <em>Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</em> and <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> (2011). </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">9. Call of the Night</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime Video</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/Call-of-the-Night/0SK1DMJLCZPSKXS7GYT1E86CYZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Video</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="823" data-injectable="true"><em>Call of the Night</em> follows the story of the student Kou Yamori and the vampire Nazuna Nanakusa, as they grow closer in the hopes of turning the former into a vampire, a feat only only possible after he’s fallen in love with her. The series succeeds in mixing standard shonen and slice-of-life elements, and a pairing that brings an exciting but, deep down, bittersweet feel very few can match. <em>Call of the Night</em> is an adaptation of the manga series of the same name by Kotoyama.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">8. Blood Blockade Battlefront</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRWEQEZER/blood-blockade-battlefront" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="819" data-injectable="true">Based on the manga series by <em>Trigun</em>‘s Yasuhiro Nightow, <em>Blood Blockade Battlefront</em> follows the members of Libra, a secret organization whose mission is to protect the balance between Earth and the beyond. Apart from its cast, the series sets itself apart through a mix of explosive sequences and moments capable of making you laugh and cry in equal measure. You can also find a great protagonist in Leonardo Watch, whose character development is among anime’s best. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">7. Blood: The Last Vampire (2000)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>image via Production I.G</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: Not officially available for streaming in the US.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="797" data-injectable="true">The movie that kickstarted the <em>Blood</em> franchise, <em>Blood: The Last Vampire</em> follows the vampire and chiropteran hunter Saya during one of her missions. In it, she must pose as a high school student to identify and eliminate any creatures lying in wait by an air base. Although featuring a short runtime of around 40 minutes, <em>Blood: The Last Vampire</em> tells a heart-racing tale, all while exploring each of its characters and keeping your eyes glued to the screen.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">6. The Case Study of Vanitas</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GEXH3W8DG/the-case-study-of-vanitas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a> / <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/the-case-study-of-vanitas-1df7cad6-b21c-4635-ac24-a49101556dc5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hulu</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="894" data-injectable="true"><em>The Case Study of Vanitas</em> is an adaptation of the manga of the same name by <em>Pandora Hearts</em>‘ Jun Mochizuki. The anime follows the story of a young vampire named Noé, whose life changes completely after a meeting with the human Vanitas, the latter of which is on a mission to save vampires through the use of a fabled book. The anime features the intricate storyline and cast we all expect of Mochizuki. Another huge plus lies in the relationship between our two leads, which is the core of the series and feels just like that of Holmes and Watson. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">5. Shiki</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li>Where to watch online: <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G69P2WZDY/shiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="804" data-injectable="true">The ideal pick for all looking for a healthy dose of vampiric horror, <em>Shiki</em> takes place in a small town that has been plagued by mysterious deaths and inexplicable occurrences. We then follow the town’s hospital director Toshio Ozaki and high school freshman Natsuno Koide as they uncover the terrifying truth behind it. The anime is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Fuyumi Ono, and succeeds in bringing its anxiety-inducing feel to the screen.</p>

The parts are direct sequels of one another and follow three generations of the Joestar line as they face off against the supernatural. <em>Phantom Blood</em> and <em>Stardust Crusaders</em> also feature the same antagonist, in the vampire Dio Brando. <em>Jojo’s</em> brings a fresh take on vampirism by pairing it with its iconic over-the-top style. </p>

In it, we are presented with a visceral world through the eyes of Koyomi Araragi as he becomes entangled in a series of supernatural encounters. Featuring a loyal retelling of its source material, the series became a staple of quality given its jaw-dropping action scenes, woven together by a powerful story. </p>

Although the first movie in the series is also a classic, I decided to go with <em>Bloodlust</em>, given how well it portrays the unforgiving world of the series. The movie also pairs its excellence in narrative with some of the most beautiful animations I have ever seen. </p>
 <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="145" data-injectable="false">For those wondering, <em>Bloodlust’s</em> story is heavily self-contained, so feel free to watch it even if you haven’t seen<em> Vampire Hunter D</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-1-hellsing-ultimate" data-injectable="false">1.

		<p>Ah, Monster Hunter. It’s everybody’s favourite game series about hunting monsters, and then chopping off the useful bits to turn into even sharper and hardier stuff to hunt some more monsters. It’s a loop that’s been working for two decades, and we’re still not tired of it, or the spectacular menagerie of toothy antagonists. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/07/monster-hunter-stories-review/">Monster Hunter Stories</a> certainly has elements of the mainline series, but it’s safe to say that it’s a slightly different proposition.</p>
<p>Originally a tentpole 3DS title, back when Capcom was certain that the 3DS was the perfect home for the Monster Hunter series, Stories takes the beloved franchise and turns it into a turn-based JRPG, with bright, colourful graphics, and equally bright and colourful characters. As the Monster Hunter series has grown increasingly important to the company, it’s little surprise to find both Monster Hunter Stories and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/07/monster-hunter-stories-2-switch-review-pc-wings-of-ruin/">its sequel</a> finally being ported to the PlayStation, while the first game also arrives on PC and Nintendo Switch for the same time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Stories - Announcement Trailer | Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N5rgFruN1bg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Hunter Stories was, and is, a welcoming and easy-going introduction to the world of Monster Hunter. Instead of slaying the iconic beasts, here you’re more focused on forming a bond of friendship, riding them around the landscape and then utilising their special moves in turn-based combat. It’s like a How to Train Your Dragon RPG, but with more teeth.</p>
<p>There’s three different kind of attack: Power, Speed, and Technical. Much like Fire Emblem’s fabled weapon triangle, each type of move is stronger against one of the others, and choosing the correct type is the key to a successful battle. Each time you make a successful attack, you also build up your meter, allowing you to ‘Ride-On’ and hop on your Monstie, before unleashing a hugely powerful attack.</p>


<p>Successfully winning a battle will see a cavalcade of parts and bits shorn from that monster, and it’s here that the classic Monster Hunter loop comes into play, with parts accrued from battle then being crafted into new equipment to head back into battle with.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Stories certainly looks better than it ever has, with both its previous 3DS and mobile outings utterly trounced by the capability of the PS4, let alone the PS5. However, there are some clear signs that this is a fairly straightforward remaster, with some suspiciously low-res textures here and there, and a frame rate that somehow doesn’t feel as smooth as it should.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Monster Hunter Stories 2 is a match for the PC release, which in turn thoroughly trounced the somewhat disappointing performance of the Nintendo Switch version. It’s smoother, more modern, and expands the story and world in a meaningful way – where the original game feels a little outdated at times, that’s never the case with its sequel.</p>
<p>The great thing about Monster Hunter Stories is the way it opens up the world of Monster Hunter to a different demographic, and younger gamers will find a lot to love in its primary coloured take on the creature-centric series. If they’re wrapped up in it all, there’s also the accompanying anime which follows the storyline of the first game, and expands on some of the ideas and characters in a more well-rounded way.</p>

<p>Given how popular Monster Hunter has become it’s gratifying that fans of the series can now experience these enjoyable outings wherever they game – well, unless you’re an Xbox gamer. Where the original game is showing its age, both games weave a tale that’s well worth diving into, especially while fans wait for the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>

If you have been waiting patiently for the PlayStation 5 release date for vampiric survival game V Rising, I have some fang-tastic news for you to sink your teeth into. 
</p>
<p>
Developer Stunlock Studios announced V Rising will make its way to Sony's console next month, on 11th June. That being said (and as is becoming increasingly common these days), if you choose to pre-order one of the game's bundles, you will be able to get five days of early access.
</p>
<p>
But before I get into all that, you can check out V Rising's PS5 trailer below. 
</p>

<p>
On its PlayStation debut, V Rising will give a fresh wave of players the chance to embody a newly-awakened vampire, before setting about constructing an appropriately gothic not-so-humble-abode to live in. Oh, and there are of course bosses that need to be slain. 57 of them, in fact. 
</p>
<p>
The PS5 version of V Rising will have DualSense controller support, as well as a number of UI improvements. As for the editions and bundles, there is the standard edition of V Rising, which is retailing for £32.99 on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0775-PPSA16262_00-0000000000000001">PlayStation Store</a>. This version gives you the base game.
</p>
<p>
Then, there is the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0775-PPSA16262_00-CASTLEVANIABUNDL">V Rising Legacy of Castlevania Edition</a>, which will set you back £49.99. As you may have surmised, this edition comes with the base game as well as Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack. It will also give you five days of early access.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, there is the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0775-PPSA16262_00-VRCOMPLETEBUNDLE">V Rising Complete Edition</a>, costing £79.99. This edition includes both the base game and the Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack, but also adds the following three packs into the mix: Sinister Evolution Pack, Dracula's Relics Pack and Eldest Bloodline Pack. As with the Legacy of Castlevania Edition, this chap will also provide those who pre-order with five days of early access. 
</p>
<p>
If you are a PlayStation Plus member, you will get a 10 percent pre-order discount on all editions of V Rising.

Following two years in early access on PC, V Rising released in full earlier this month. Soon after, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/v-rising-hits-100000-concurrent-players-on-steam">breached 100,000 concurrent players on Steam for the first time</a> since it was released as an early access back in 2022.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-preview-exploring-ps4-remaster</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-stories-preview-exploring-the-ps4-remaster.876186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-preview-exploring-ps4-remaster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> has had an interesting journey over the years. Having begun its life as a Nintendo 3DS title and later smartphone platforms, <em>Stories </em>marked a shift in priorities for the series by going all in on a more traditional JRPG aesthetic.&nbsp; Whilst other entries focused more on action such as the fairly recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-review"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a>, <em>Stories</em> instead settles back on a turn-based battle system and monster collecting.</p>

<p>Now eight years later, Capcom is keen on reviving <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> for some more modern platforms – specifically, PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4. We had a chance to check out the HD port in an early preview and go hands-on with some early parts of the game.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Stories </em>opens up as one might expect from any RPG – a fancy cutscene sets the mood, there’s some character and monster introduction, and a glimpse of the colorful world to eventually explore. There’s then a shift to the real-time graphics and my first impression is that everything is very colorful and eye-catching.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518212840.jpg?itok=pvHTp4eG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518212840.jpg?itok=HrHjUWAz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
For a remaster, Capcom has done well to keep everything bright and cheery, despite the obvious limitations brought about by 3DS game design. This is immediately evident upon controlling a character – areas aren’t very big and tend to guide you down a linear path toward a marked objective. Not that there’s anything wrong with that – in fact I did appreciate that the game was telling me where to go.</p>

<p>After a short introduction, your character meets up with two characters known as Cheval and Lilia, who are searching for an egg. From here, you’re tasked with customizing your player avatar of sorts, and that includes selecting their gender as well as a limited number of hair, eye, skin color, and even voice options. You can even name them, if you’d like, or select a generated name to continue along the story.</p>

<p>The egg the group finds turns out to be a young Rathalos – named Ratha of course – who decides your character is their parent. Things seem well and good until you go back to the village of Hakum and a tragedy takes place killing others, including your new monster friend.</p>

<p>There’s a time skip and it’s from here that<em> Monster Hunter Stories</em> really gets going. With the threat of a sickness known as the Black Blight still around, you’ll be taking up a Kinship rite and a crystal in order to collect monsters and become what is known as a Rider.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518213841.jpg?itok=YVjHWvT2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518213841.jpg?itok=9AG1Ac4e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
With the monster hunting and capturing element now in play and a key element of the game, the player character leaves the village, encounters new characters, and ventures further into the mystery of the Blight corrupting the land.</p>

<p>While the narrative is front and center, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> does eventually get you to the battle and other systems after some lengthy exposition. Hoisting up the traditional JRPG mantle means the main system is turn-based, or each party member and enemy take turns attacking after abilities are selected from a menu without a time limit.</p>

<p>Your created character has a bit of flexibility when it comes to their turn as attacks are divided into three types: Power, Technical, and Speed. Each of these types of attacks comes with their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, use a Speed attack if an enemy is striking at you with a Power ability.</p>

<p>A cut-in scene known as a Head-to-Head when the enemy is targeting the attacking character. The attack type that is stronger in these situations will win out, or if they’re the same, you will end the turn in a draw. The other examples of attack strengths include Power being stronger than Technical, and Technical over Speed. It’s important to keep these elements of sorts in mind during battle so you can chase those bonuses.</p>

<p>Battles can also be mixed up with a number of weapon types such as a great sword, or a hammer. There are also different skills and, of course, the monster collecting aspect to consider in customization.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518222521.jpg?itok=ff2W7JY0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518222521.jpg?itok=G4sYmoJK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
Beyond the single-player aspect, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> lets you play around in multiplayer matches online, so there’s a lot to play around with here for anyone looking to get their turn-based itch.</p>

<p>Circling back around to the visual side of things, it’s important to remember that yes, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> is a remaster of a game that was originally developed for a handheld system. It’s because of that that the models are rather simplistic, even for an anime cel-shaded style.</p>

<p>There’s also not a lot of environmental detail or animations going on. Most of the dialogue scenes are in a sort of visual novel side-by-side style, although there are some traditional cutscenes and multiple CG cutscenes included. All of these have been upconverted from their original resolution to fit an HD output, although the CG scenes haven't been redone to compensate for more pixels.</p>

<p>Otherwise, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> is voiced in both English and Japanese, or if you want you can choose the original version’s voice track. I was even surprised the player character does have some canned lines and isn’t completely a silent protagonist. Despite other limitations, this does add a lot to the overall presentation.</p>

<p>Despite its origins on Nintendo 3DS, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> does at least deserve its time in the sun. With its sequel out now on Nintendo Switch and PC, this remaster release looks to provide fans or even newcomers with a chance to experience the <em>Stories</em> series all on the same platforms. And for PS4 players, it’s just the beginning with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-stories-2-review">sequel</a> dropping simultaneously on June 14, 2024.</p>

<p id="O2aop3">Typically priced at $50, the book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Worlds-Realms-Adventures/dp/0593835506?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Worlds-Realms-Adventures/dp/0593835506?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23922200__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23922200__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">available to pre-order</a> ahead of its Oct. 29 release at a slightly discounted cost of $46.50. And if you’re someone who loves to immerse themselves in D&amp;D lore and world-building, you’ll definitely want to check this book out.</p>
<p id="uXTcnn">D&amp;D’s multiverse is extremely vast and complicated, and <em>Worlds &amp; Realms</em> seems to fill a much-needed gap to help both newcomers and long-time players make sense of its fantastical realms. Featuring artwork pulled from 50 years of sourcebooks and adventures, each chapter of this illustrated guide takes a close look at one of the many worlds, planes, and settings in the D&amp;D multiverse — from the beloved plane of Mystara, to the perilous Shadowfell, to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23308644/dnd-spelljammer-review-losers">Spelljammer</a>’s boundless Astral Sea. </p>
<p id="afzuL8">But this is no dry, matter-of-fact history book. Instead, readers will explore these settings through the narration of the archmage Mordenkainen, who shares his personal experiences of these locations and thoughts on the legendary characters who’ve lived there. Readers will dive deep into Mordenkainen’s beloved home of Greyhawk (the default setting for the soon to be released 2024 revision of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24067481/dnd-dungeons-dragons-onednd-delay-2024-rules-refresh-players-handbook-dmg-release-date-price"><em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em></a>), and learn how his belief in the Balance influences his run-ins with creatures across the multiverse.</p>
<p id="hVSw1b"><em>Worlds &amp; Realms</em> also features original stories by Jasmine Bhullar, Geoffrey Golden, Jody Houser and Eric Campbell, and Jaleigh Johnson.</p>
<p id="hpywYG">Polygon has an exclusive first look inside <em>Worlds &amp; Realms </em>below, revealing 22 of the book’s 368 pages. To guide you through them, we’ve enlisted our own narrator — author Adam Lee himself — to share insights into the historic art and how <em>Worlds &amp; Realms</em> came together.</p>

<p id="VhYWI8"><strong>Adam Lee: </strong>There’s a place within my mind that is reserved for childhood memories, which are of a different quality than other memories. This image lives within that space. I remember looking at it with my little kid imagination, each detail providing stories in my mind.</p>
<p id="5cjwbr">Even before I knew how to play D&amp;D or even what it was, I was making stories just looking at the art on the box. Erol Otus’ art is so mythic and perfect for capturing the vibe of D&amp;D in the 80’s.</p>

<p id="cQ2rBq">I want to say that it took a lot of time, staring at the blank page in artistic agony, crumpling page after page, before the first words came for the introduction.</p>
<p id="DIq6xj">But I became (my version) of Mordenkainen fairly quickly and his voice and his intentions were apparent. I had spent some time thinking about the world from his perspective while working on D&amp;D, so I wasn’t working from zero, but he flowed onto the page and there were times I had to write fast to keep up.</p>
<p id="9ANxqB">As always, amazing art inspires the imagination. When I first saw this piece come in after being commissioned, I felt like it revealed another dimension of the master mage.</p>

<p id="oHaeRN">One of the things about writing from the perspective of an archmage is to find out what actually strikes them as important. What do they notice? When their world is so fantastical, what compels them to look deeper?</p>
<p id="1bF2RT">Here’s a person who wields the power of magic, who has traveled across the multiverse, who has fought interdimensional monsters, and has dined with angelic beings. Why not leave humanity behind for all the splendor of a host of extreme and otherworldly experiences?</p>
<p id="wAdTNH">I wanted to shine a light on the value of humanity through the eyes of Mordenkainen. For some reason, he didn’t join the heavenly host, nor did he become a demigod, or a tyrant on some high mountain peak. He became a protector of the multiverse.</p>
<p id="CKpQ89">I think there’s something about humanity that he’s immensely curious about. There’s something sacred within each being. A mystery beyond mere magic.</p>

<p id="qvqdIr">Figuring out how to write this book — a combination of lore and story — was something that I thought about a lot.</p>
<p id="oVXWHT">I wanted to talk about the worlds and share the existing lore, but I also wanted to bring something new to it, something never before revealed so that no matter what your experience was with D&amp;D, you were going to find out new and interesting stuff.</p>
<p id="02QM3g">Writing from the point of view of Mordenkainen allowed me to stretch outside of canon lore to allow for a bit of wizardly speculation which I found to be exciting — I was on an adventure with Mordenkainen as he investigated his own mind and the mysteries of the multiverse.</p>

<p id="dvPC6p">Long before I worked on D&amp;D as a professional, I was a player and a fan of these worlds, and I had my own opinions about them.</p>
<p id="nAvO4R">While working on D&amp;D, I had a chance to dive into many of the worlds at varying depths, but usually from a very agnostic point of view — we set the stage of the adventure and described the world for the Dungeon Master to interpret as they will. The players would experience the story and then form their own opinions.</p>
<p id="v4enMj">When I played the character of Mordenkainen for this book, I got to write from his POV. After a while, I began to have different opinions of the worlds as seen through his eyes. The most surprising reaction to any of these worlds was his reaction to Krynn.</p>
<p id="fDWeEB">I must say, I learned a lot from seeing Krynn through his eyes.</p>

<p id="NwlU1W">When writing anything for D&amp;D, I am always thinking about a DM getting a great idea for a one shot or a character for their campaign. I’m always in “modular mode” where I know that any chunk of what I am writing can be taken out and put into someone’s game.</p>
<p id="PJGxcD">I wish when I go into the great beyond that I can sit in front of a cosmic TV and watch how many snippets of my silly writing made it into games or made people smile or laugh. Hopefully, I’d be watching for a long time. That would bring me great joy.</p>

<p id="49Zvs3">Revisiting Ravenloft for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22745128/dungeons-dragons-best-campaign-curse-of-strahd-horror-beginners"><em>Curse of Strahd</em></a> was one of my favorite times working on D&amp;D. We dealt with so many questions about the nature of evil, the story of Strahd, and the metaphysics of Barovia.</p>
<p id="Enczzh">It was, ironically, great fun to live in Barovia, walk with the people, explore the domain, and write a few locations that were certain to be disturbing.</p>

<p id="jYpYCY">Every version of D&amp;D has its take on the legendary monsters and villains of D&amp;D. For <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2015/9/2/9242155/out-of-the-abyss-into-the-underdark"><em>Out of the Abyss</em></a> we got the treat of revisiting all the superstar demon lords and do the 5th edition version of them to continue that creative legacy.</p>
<p id="V5NFv5">For me, D&amp;D is as much a visual experience as it is a written one, and the images from the game’s earliest of days to now have an iconic stature in my mind and are forever imprinted in my memory.</p>

<p id="4PkZBK">Throughout Mordenkainen’s journey, the Balance is what keeps him grounded, and potentially keeps him sane, as he explores the multiverse, encountering all manner of fantastical beings and bizarre entities.</p>
<p id="GFnkYp">The multiverse is a bewildering place, and without a purpose, it can become as confusing as a hall of mirrors. But through it all, Mordenkainen follows the beacon of the Balance like the string that allowed Theseus to navigate the labyrinth, slay the Minotaur, and emerge alive and victorious. </p>

A climactic action sequence shows the player fighting against Imperial soldiers and even an AT-ST, a large mechanical war machine on two legs.

They stress that (as with any modding process) the load order is crucial to get right, and you can follow along in the video to help avoid any issues.</p><p>DeityVengy points out that all the mods shown in their list aren’t actually turned on for the gameplay shown during the video, as some more experimental mods break things and prevent you from having a smooth gameplay experience. The overhaul mostly relies on pre-existing mods like <em>Star Wars</em> Replacer, with DeityVengy creating a custom HUD for the experience including weapon icons accurate to the modded guns.

<p>It was a couple of days ago that Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, narrowed down the release window for Grand Theft Auto 6. Instead of ‘2025’, we’re now looking at a ‘Fall 2025’ launch window. In a follow-up statement, Zelnick met the community on transparent ground and acknowledged that delays can happen, but the reason the company pushed out the Fall 2025 window is because they are ‘highly confident in that timing’. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-have-faith">Have Faith</h2>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will be released in Fall 2025, and Take-Two is highly confident it’ll hit that timeframe. It’s not expected that there will be any delays, especially considering GTA 6 has likely been in development for the better part of a decade, but never say never.</p>



<p>Since being revealed by Rockstar Games in December 2023, GTA 6 has dominated newsfeeds worldwide. Every tidbit of information generates more hype, with the most recent topic of discussion being the matter of who is voicing the protagonist(s). There continues to be an immense sense of anticipation around GTA 6, and that won’t dissipate until it’s in the hands of gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview with CNBC, in which Zelnick makes his comments about the launch window:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>There are expectations that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be ‘the most important release’ in entertainment history. It’ll likely be the fastest-selling game ever made, and it’s easy to see the open-world epic pulling north of $1 billion in a single day.</p>

<p>A new claim regarding Black Myth: Wukong is giving some new insight into what players could expect to experience when it launches in August. This comes from leaker Lunatic Ignus <a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1792541397192528213">on Tw</a><a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1792541397192528213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">i</a><a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1792541397192528213">tter</a>.</p>



<p>According to Ignus, Black Myth: Wukong features “around 160 enemy types” and “80+ bosses”. They go on to say that the game will have New Game+ at launch as well as multiple endings to experience. </p>



<p>“The game is slightly easier than soulsborne games,” they added.</p>



<p>As always, take the latest claims with a grain of salt until it’s either confirmed by the developer or independently verified by Insider Gaming.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">GameSpot parent company Fandom has released its fourth annual Inside Gaming report, and one of the key takeaways is that personal expression within games is increasingly important to players. The Inside Gaming report is based on data from Fandom's 350 million monthly unique visitors, 45 million pages of content, and 250,000 wikis.</p><p dir="ltr">The report found that the main reason people play games is to unwind and relieve stress (54%), but a close second was "creation, imagination, and self-expression" (46%). This is up 10% from 2023, demonstrating a growing trend. Within games, the top five in-game customization players seek out to express themselves include character personalization (76%), Gamertags and usernames (48%), communication (35%), signatures and emblems (31%), and emotions and gestures (30%).</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304876-screenshot2024-05-17at3.22.15pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304876" data-ratio="0.81330868761553" data-width="1082" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304876-screenshot2024-05-17at3.22.15pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304876"></a><figcaption>Why do you play games?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304876-screenshot2024-05-17at3.22.15pm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The report also found that there is a significant gap between how people express themselves in real life versus online. 80% of respondents said their "gamer personality" is different than their real-life personality. And then 64% said it's easier to be themselves online rather than in person.</p><p dir="ltr">The Inside Gaming report went on to say that 60% of people believe self-expression in gaming is more important than ever before, with the study specifically calling out titles like Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox for offering extensive options to personalize their characters.

You can now download or watch the latest GamesIndustry.biz Microcast, offering you a quick dive into the biggest stories  from the past week.
</p>
<p>
This week, we discuss the news from Sony regarding retired CEO Jim Ryan's replacement. Or rather, replacements. Plural. We reflect on the benefits of having long-serving execs like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-names-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino-as-its-new-ceos">Herman Hulst and Hideaki Nishino in charge of PlayStation</a>, as well as the challenges they face and the platform holder's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sonys-focus-on-engagement-time-over-units-sold-makes-sense-for-playstation-opinion">increased focus on player engagement over units sold</a>.
</p>
<p>
We also discuss the Stop Killing Games campaign, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-government-responds-to-stop-killing-games-campaign">the UK government's response to it</a>, and the wider shift we see in both the games industry and entertainment in general that is reflected by the rise of such a campaign. Brendan dives even deeper into this issue in the latest <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/disgraceful-degradation-this-week-in-business">This Week In Business</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/birds-really-arent-real-in-this-fallout-4-mod/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=birds-really-arent-real-in-this-fallout-4-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="259" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You’ve likely heard the joke conspiracy theory that birds aren’t real and/or are government drones (if you haven’t, please <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/technology/birds-arent-real-gen-z-misinformation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treat yourself</a>). Well, one <em>Fallout 4</em> modder wondered what it would be like if that was a reality in the dystopian RPG.</p> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">Perhaps more out of general annoyance for the flying critters rather than confirming to an online joke, Nexus Mods user <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/83051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capra</a> has turned <em>Fallout 4</em> into a birdless paradise. Specifically, the mod takes aim at crows and “seagulls” (though they’re likely referring to <a href="https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Radgull" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radgulls</a>).</p> <figure data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Capra/Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">After getting frustrated with them, Capra decided to take action, removing them from the game. It doesn’t affect gameplay or lore in any way, and chances are many of us who play can easily ignore any and all birds, but it’s there if you want it.</p> <h2 id="h-birdemic-or-lack-thereof" data-injectable="false">Birdemic, or lack thereof</h2> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">Technically, the modder hasn’t actually deleted the birds from <em>Fallout 4</em>. What they’ve actually done is replace both the crows and gulls with “empty textures,” made them unkillable, and basically muted their sounds. In summary: they’re there but not there at the same time.</p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">Now, I’m wondering whether the concept of irradiated birds that are invisible, indestructible, and silent is actually more of an issue than them just not being in the game at all. I’ll leave you to ponder that.</p> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">I looked into it, and apparently, <a href="https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Bird" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallout 4</em> only has these two types of birds</a> throughout the whole game (with a brief mention of sparrows during some dialogue). This means you can wander the wastelands of Boston City assuredly confident that birds do not, in fact, exist.*</p>
 <p data-characters="12" data-current-count="12" data-injectable="false"><sup>*as good as.</sup></p>

            <p>
Free-to-play platform fighter MultiVersus has confirmed the inclusion of Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th and Agent Smith from The Matrix, ahead of the game going live (again) next week, on 28th May.
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros' take on Super Smash Bros originally launched in early access last summer, but has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">offline for the past 11 months</a> while it was upgraded to Unreal Engine 5. 
</p>
<p>
MultiVersus will arrive next week compatible with cross-platform and cross-progression play for PC (Steam and Epic), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. (No Nintendo support is a surprise, but at this point, it's probably best just to wait for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.)

<p>
27 unique <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-characters-roster-unlock-free-rotation-9024">characters are playable in MultiVersus</a>, taking from a rollcall of Warner Bros-owned franchises (and characters not already snapped up by Fortnite). 
</p>
<p>
The roster includes Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Joker from DC Comics, Finn and Jake from Adventure Time, Gizmo and Stripe from Gremlins, Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Taz from Looney Tunes, LeBron James from Space Jam, Arya Stark from Game of Thrones, Shaggy and Velma from Scooby-Doo (but not actually Scooby-Doo himself), Rick and Morty from Rick and Morty, the Iron Giant from The Iron Giant, plus Tom and Jerry. 
</p>
<p>
As for the game's newest arrivals, Jason Voorhees will be available at launch, when Season 1: Puns &amp; Villainy begins. Agent Smith will then debut later in the season.
</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-wants-always-on-game-success-for-dc-game-of-thrones">Warner Bros said it wanted "always on success" for its biggest franchises</a>, four of which (DC, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and Mortal Kombat) are valued at worth a billion dollars each. Live service games such as MultiVersus are designed to provide just this, with Warner Bros saying it wanted to make "sure we get as much engagement and time with fans as possible".</p>

Dirt Dog management told FOX5 it often puts on themed events like this that are staffed by “regulars” who volunteer dress up and bake goods for the day. “We expected like maybe 50 to 60 people—not in the sense of like the whole city coming out,” Taj Wilder, a spokesperson for the restaurant, told the TV station. “Just now knowing who Bluey is, we would have planned ahead and would have had security.” </p><p>It’s all a bit reminiscent of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/reimagined-willys-chocolate-experience-coming-america-1851404595&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/reimagined-willys-chocolate-experience-coming-america-1851404595">AI-generated Willy Wonka fiasco</a></span> in Glasgow earlier this year, minus the sad Oompa Loompa who ended up going viral after everyone fell in love with her <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/glasgow-sad-oompa-loompa-interview.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/glasgow-sad-oompa-loompa-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following a no-nonsense tell-all appraisal of the event</a></span>. As a parent myself who has on one occasion completely failed to manage the expectations of my children, I can sympathize with both the parents dealing with toddlers addled by the horror of witnessing imposter Bluey, and the food service workers unexpectedly thrust into the brutal gauntlet of a hundred families trying to kill a few hours before nap time during a Saturday lunch rush.

<p>On April 18, Warhorse Studios lifted the lid on Kingdom Come: Deliverance II in the most epic way possible. With a stunning reveal trailer and a lengthy showcase that was equal parts explorative and regal, ‘KCDII’ was uncovered in full, filling fans worldwide with an immense sense of anticipation and excitement. It’s the direct follow-up to 2018’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and it has been in development for quite a while.</p>



<p>Recently, I had the pleasure of catching up with and interviewing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thisistommckay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom McKay</a>, the instantly recognisable actor and white-hot talent behind Henry of Skalitz, the lead in both Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the sequel, which is due to be released later this year. </p>



<p>This is what I’ve dubbed ‘Becoming Henry’.</p>

<h2 id="h-on-the-road-to-kingdom-come">On The Road To Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a stunning open-world game that’s rooted in realism. There is attention to detail in everything, from the period-accurate combat mechanics to the survival elements that make the game challenging. It’s even set in a real-world location that was painstakingly researched by what was once a very small team – <a href="https://www.instagram.com/warhorsestudios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warhorse Studios</a>. </p>



<p>I’ve come to learn that the studio has expanded massively since the first game, and it’s now backed by PLAION. In my chat with Tom McKay, I was eager to rewind and learn how he came across the role in the first place, given that Kingdom Come: Deliverance was the first (and still the only) game franchise McKay has worked on.</p>



<p><strong>McKay:</strong> ‘<em>It comes through the same channels as most of your acting work, and more and more in a way that I think is good and exciting, the worlds are kind of blending. Historically, they were very separate beasts, and a lot of TV, film, and theatre actors wouldn’t necessarily move between gaming and vice versa, but that’s happening more and more and there are lots of brilliant, big names doing it. </em></p>



<p><em>It was very much the same way that I would audition for any other job, and then I went out to Prague in like 2016 to meet everybody and do essentially a final audition, and that was it. Then they offered me the job. I don’t think anybody at that point, certainly not me, thought we’d be having this conversation eight years later – but the second game is so anticipated and I think that is absolutely brilliant.</em></p>



<p><em>I’m biased, but I’m seeing a lot of the work that the guys have done at Warhorse and it is completely mindblowing. It’s not just the kind of next level from the last game, it’s like fifty levels up from there, I think.</em>‘</p>



<h2 id="h-the-transition">The Transition</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>I was interested to learn about the ‘switch’ between Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. It’s a different world to the one that existed several years ago when the first game was being pieced together, and that’s something that McKay confirmed as he broke down the intricacies of playing Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘The biggest technical difference was the facial capture. We didn’t do live facial capture for the motion capture the first time around, and this time we did. We had big head cams, which make you look like stag beetles, which are technically challenging in a way – intimate scenes and fight scenes are more challenging because you can’t get that close to each other.&nbsp;In terms of suits and the studio – we were in a different studio but it felt very similar.</em></p>



<p><em>In terms of extracurricular training, there isn’t a tonne. Most of us have done a basic level to get us to a good enough level, but when it becomes stunts, <strong>it becomes stunts</strong>, like it would on any other production. In terms of weaponry, we’ve got loads of photos and we’ll show them at various points, but the actual weapons are just hilarious, like polystyrene. That’s how they’re supposed to look, that’s how they look in every other motion capture studio, but they don’t look like the kind of beautiful, ornate, intimidating weapons you’ll see.</em>‘</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that the voice acting portion of the production had wrapped up after a whopping 500 hours of studio time. Not being familiar with how that worked from an acting perspective, I engaged McKay with a question about the process:</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘The first chapter of our involvement is the motion capture. We finished about two years ago, and on this occasion, it was two big chunks of roughly about six or seven weeks each. Those were separated by a period of maybe about four or five months. That was very much the kind of first brick in the wall from the acting perspective. From a developmental perspective, there’s a huge amount of work and a huge amount of people heavily involved well before any of us actors turn up. That was the same for the first time, it was even more so the case for this game because it’s much bigger. We’re relatively late to the party in that respect.</em></p>



<p><em>The guys at Warhorse were very considerate about everything, but particularly about sort of ‘vocal stamina’ because there were so many lines for Henry. Anything the player can say in any iteration of the game has to be recorded, which is why it’s such a huge volume of material. I had to do eight-hour sessions, whereas most actors would do four-hour sessions because it’s more manageable vocally, but in terms of just getting through it, we realised that the only way we’d hit the targets and the deadlines was to just do eight-hour days. We started with the more vocally smooth stuff and then if there was any intense barking or anything like that, that was at the end of the day. And actually, the last day was about an hour of just absolute full-on screaming and yelling.’</em></p>



<p>Naturally, McKay couldn’t reveal any details about the game, but he did mention that the core ‘feel’ of the product is relatively the same as the first title:</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘I’m not going to speak too much about that because I’m not sure how much I’m allowed to say. I’m very much understood from all the feedback that the realistic element was key and a big part of its USP and it’s what made it harder but my understanding is that it’s what made it really enjoyable. My understanding is that the very realistic element, the immersive element, is still very much the heart of this game.</em>‘</p>



<h2 id="h-deliverance">Deliverance</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is reportedly ‘at least twice the size’ of the first game, both in terms of the map space available and the overall scope of the project. It’s an ambitious undertaking that is much more technically advanced than the first game, which was made evident by the stunning trailer that Warhorse Studios showcased little more than a month ago. </p>



<p>McKay confirmed he’d never played the first game as he ‘isn’t a massive gamer’, but he pledged to give Kingdom Come: Deliverance II a shot:</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘Most of the staff I know very well on a personal level now, we’ve become very good friends, because you would never work with a team like this for that length of time at those close quarters in any other game. I see more consistently just by being in the office what’s being executed day in, and day out, and it’s absolutely mindblowing. Yeah, I will definitely be playing this game. In terms of my technical ability to play it well, that’s another matter.’</em></p>



<p>It isn’t yet known when Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will be released, but we’ve been given a window of 2024 – so within a few months, we’ll be back and in control of Henry of Skalitz, continuing the vast adventure that was kicked off way back in 2018.</p>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Immersive sims are an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/weekly-kusoge-die-hard-nes-immersive-sim-retro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">odd and exceedingly specific niche</a> that some players just don’t feel like dealing with, <em>but</em> those who enjoy them play all of them. If you’re a fan, too, then you’ll be thrilled to hear that <em>Gloomwood</em>‘s next major update is coming very, very soon. Kind of!</p> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">More specifically, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gloomwood-is-a-fun-blend-of-survival-horror-and-immersive-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gloomwood</em> is an Early Access ImSim</a> that’s going through a slow and meticulous production process headed by the developer Dillon Rogers. The game’s next major update, titled ‘The Underport’ had been slated for mid-2024 for some time at this point, but plans have now changed, and the chunk of content featured in it was so substantial that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1150760/view/6009568738059053793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had to be sliced in half</a>. The Underport is now, therefore, <em>two</em> updates instead of one, and its first half, titled ‘The Power Station’ is coming later this month.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Dillon Rogers</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-gloomwood-s-power-station-level-is-coming-this-month-the-hive-is-on-the-horizon" data-injectable="false">Gloomwood’s Power Station level is coming this month, The Hive is on the horizon</h2> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true"><em>Gloomwood</em> first launched via Steam Early Access in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gloomwood-early-access-august-16-trailer-pc-new-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 2022</a>, and the game has been iterating upon its immersive sim core ever since. While the fact that the Underport has bifurcated into two separate releases is a bit sad, the flip side of the equation is that we’ll soon have a sizeable new chunk of <em>Gloomwood</em> goodness to tide us over. A fair trade, I’d say.</p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">At this time, we don’t know when the second half of the Underport, now known as ‘The Hive’ might be coming out. Presumably, it’s still slated for 2024, but we’ll need to wait and see what Rogers has to say on that front.</p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true">The bit that we do know for a fact, though, is that <em>Gloomwood</em> still has a fairly long and storied road ahead of it. As per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1150760/view/4182228661134367002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous bit of news about the Underdark update</a>, Rogers intends to focus on the aptly titled Research Update after all of its content comes out: “[Research] will allow the doctor to take body parts from enemies back to the lab at the lighthouse in order to study them and gain new abilities.” Fun!</p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">After the Research Update, Rogers explained his team will be working on the ‘Bank’ level, which is due to introduce a high-tech section of the city, which is a wholly different brand of excitement, all things considered.</p> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="false">So, it’s slow going, but <em>Gloomwood</em>‘s been nothing short of great so far, and ImSim fans are used to waiting anyway. Especially now, with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-people-making-the-games-keep-paying-the-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio behind the legendary <em>Prey</em></a> sadly about to close down. For those who’d like to play <em>Gloomwood</em> in its 1.0 form, all I can say is – stay tuned.</p>
