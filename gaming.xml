              <p>In a night filled with gory trailers for loud action games, one of the new reveals at The Game Awards stood out for its gentle nature: <em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em>. The game defied almost every trend of the night: it was a single-player game, in a beautiful cel-shaded animation style, in which the main character is an elderly woman. This, it turns out, is the first new game from Bruce Straley, one of the co-directors of the original&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, since he left Naughty Dog in 2017.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-naughty-dog-exit-interview/">an interview with&nbsp;<em>Polygon</em></a>, Straley spoke for the first time about his surprise exit from Naughty Dog, soon after shipping his last game with the company,&nbsp;<em>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</em>. After 18 years at the developer, Straley found himself struggling with a sense of repetition as the studio settled into making, you know, Naughty Dog sorts of games. (In the two decades prior, the company had also put out both <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> and&nbsp;<em>Jak and Daxter</em> games, before settling on the cinematic action of <em>Uncharted</em> and&nbsp;<em>TLOU</em>, the only game series Naughty Dog has released since 2007.)</p>

 <p>“I felt like I was answering the same questions over and over again,” Straley told <em>Polygon</em>. “We were kind of in this paradigm of this style of game—that I was part of creating! But it felt like I’ve been in this position before. My brain isn’t good with that type of repetition. I need new problems to solve, I need new creative outlets. I’m not saying there wouldn’t be opportunities there, but couple that feeling with the idea that I was working really, really hard at something that wasn’t mine.”</p>

  <p><em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em><em>&nbsp;</em>is certainly a significant step away. The first game from Wildflower Interactive, a 16-person team established in 2021, it describes itself as an “emotionally rich, stylized, single-player adventure.” You play as an elderly witch called Gertie, accompanied by a peculiar creature who will learn from Gertie’s actions how to best assist her in their journeys through woods, dungeons and bogs. The claim is that this unnamed beast will be an NPC dynamically shaped by how you play the game.</p> <p>Elderly women are extraordinarily under-represented in video games, almost always confined to being evil antagonists—the only other example of a playable elderly woman I can think of is in Tale of Tales’ 2008 tiny game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/27020/The_Graveyard/"><em>The Graveyard</em></a> (which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/preview-the-graveyard">I loved</a>).&nbsp;<em>Coven</em> looks charming, if a little too close to&nbsp;<em>Ori </em>in its&nbsp;creature design (and vocal sounds for that matter) for my liking. There’s no release date at this point, but you can of course already <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041680/Coven_of_the_Chicken_Foot/">wishlist the game on Steam</a>.</p>

                <p>The release of the upcoming RPG Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely far, far away.

The <a href="https://www.arcanautstudios.com/careers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">studio's careers page</a> contains listings for several senior-level positions, so the announcement trailer also doubles as a recruitment advertisement, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-dev-reminds-fans-that-cg-trailers-are-often-used-first-and-foremost-to-recruit-staff/1100-6496192/" data-ref-id="1100-6496192">tactic that developers often employ</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic: Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>With the lengthy development cycles that high-profile games undergo these days, we're probably years away from seeing anything concrete from Fate of the Old Republic, and even further from a release. Skepticism about the game even releasing this decade is quite reasonable.</p><p>"We’re still early in development, with many challenges ahead," Hudson told StarWars.com. "I'm grateful to have enjoyed the support of KOTOR<i> </i>fans for many years, and I look forward to embarking upon this journey together, sharing more of what we’re doing as soon as we can!"</p><p>Since his work on the original KOTOR, Hudson stayed in contact with Lucasfilm, and the opportunity arose to make a new title in the Star Wars universe sometime after Arcanaut's founding.</p><p>Details are sparse on the premise. It isn't a direct sequel to Knights of the Old Republic, but Hudson says that the new game introduces new characters and will tell an "all-new story crafted specifically to deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars<i> </i>that was at the heart of KOTOR."</p><p>The Old Republic has been making the headlines as of late, with a report claiming that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-full-star-wars-kotor-2-remake-was-in-development-report/1100-6536775/" data-ref-id="1100-6536775">KOTOR 2 remake was once in development</a> before being put on hold. And in other Star Wars news, The Game Awards 2025 also included a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-galactic-racer-announced-the-game-awards/1100-6536876/" data-ref-id="1100-6536876">reveal for Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-series-creator-reportedly-going-to-netease-while-tencent-is-rumored-to-be-acquiring-a-japanese-studio/">left SEGA in 2021 after 32 years with the publisher</a>, and announced his new studio, Nagoshi Studios, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nagoshi-studio-unveiled-by-netease-focused-on-global-console-games/">which he formed in partnership with NetEase a year later in 2022</a>. Now, at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, Nagoshi Studio has announced its debut project, Gang of Dragon.</p>



<p>The new action-adventure game is proof that Nagoshi made good on his promise to players in 2022, which was that <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-creator-promises-he-wont-make-smartphone-games-at-netease/">he wouldn't start making mobile games just because he formed his new studio under NetEase,</a> a Chinese publisher and developer known for its success in mobile and live-service titles. </p>



<p>Instead, Gang of Dragon looks to be directly in Nagoshi's wheelhouse, as the cinematic trailer reveals a tone similar to that of the Yakuza series, without necessarily having to strictly keep to the pillars of what defines those games.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gang of Dragon World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KX2pzle9dkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Gang of Dragon is set in Kabukicho, Shinjuku, a nightlife district in Tokyo and stars South Korean actor Ma Dong-seok, also known as Don Lee, as the lead character and high-ranking member of a Korean crime syndicate, Shin Ji-seong.</p>



<p>You likely recognize Don Lee for his work in films like Train to Busan, Marvel's Eternals, and The Outlaws, or his recent role in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach as Samson Hook.</p>



<p>"<em>I'm both relieved and deeply focused as we finally reach the day to unveil Gang of Dragon,</em>" said Nagoshi in a press release. "<em>This project depicts, with unwavering honesty, the lives of outlaws who inhabit the real streets of Kabukicho. Through gameplay, my team and I are committed to delivering a powerful new human drama born from this world. What is shown in this teaser represents only a small part of what Gang of Dragon truly has in store, and we look forward to sharing much more with you in the future</em>."</p>



<p>There's currently no word on when to expect Gang of Dragon, or what platforms it'll arrive on beyond PC. The game is reportedly "<em>deep in development</em>," however, so now that it has been unveiled, it might become a game we see at future events throughout 2026 with a 2027 release window, but that's just a guess.</p>

And maybe it's some strange combination of all three?</em></p><p><em>The conversation around the indie horror game Horses got Patrick thinking about challenging art, and the way art pushes and pulls you in different ways depending on how old you are, what you're seeking out, and how expectations radically change over time time.</em></p><p><em>For Rob, of course, it was a chance to talk about Little Women.</em></p><p><em>Of course.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Do you remember the first piece of art that fucked you up?</p><p>I have this very distinct memory of my mom bringing home a VHS copy of <em>E.T. </em>and the family gathering on the couch. Me, my younger brother, my mom, and one of her best friends <em>E.T. </em>came out in 1982 and I wasn’t even born until 1985, so I have no idea what age we were watching the movie at, but like—we were very young. My mom had seen the movie before and was excited to share it with us. She had also forgotten the hardcore jump scare that kicks the movie off in the cornfield <em>and</em> the whole sequence where <em>E.T. </em>almost dies. I mean, that shot of <em>E.T. </em>in the fucking ditch has lived rent free in my head for decades. My brother and I were bawling, while my mom reportedly looked over to her friend and said “I don’t remember all this!”</p><p><em>E.T. i</em>s the definition of a popcorn flick, albeit a very good one. But it was the first time a movie—or a piece of art—really drove a sharp emotional response from me. I didn’t process it that way at the time, but in hindsight, that was a big moment. (By contrast, the first time my nine-year-old cried during a movie was watching 2009’s <em>Hotel For Dogs,</em> in which she was hysterically crying towards the end. It seemed like the literal “hotel for dogs” at the center of the film was being destroyed, leaving the dogs without a home. The hotel, thankfully, lived on.)</p><p>You can draw a pretty straight line between many of my personal interests and that moment!</p><p>What I’ve always enjoyed about horror is feeling uncomfortable. It wants to push you. I feel physically and psychologically moved when I engage with an effective piece of horror, and probably more than any other genre, you can arrive at an emotional <em>moment</em> very quickly.</p><p>I started thinking about this because of our recent discussion about <em>Horses</em>, the indie horror game that spurred a bunch of discussion about art, censorship, and the roles of platform holders like Steam. You weren’t present for that conversation, but I assume you’re aware of the beats.</p><p>One of the pleas I made on the podcast was to seek out uncomfortable art. Go to storefronts where you might find something that is genuinely surprising. Understand that storefronts are carefully curated, and while it might feature many good things, curation is a judgment call. Find an .exe that gives you pause about whether there might be a virus hiding in the file structure.</p><p>I think <em>Horses</em> is…okay. I’m glad I played it, but I won’t think about it a week from now. It mostly reminded me that I need to spend more time taking my own advice and experiencing weird stuff.</p><p>My wife and I do have a process to get outside of our comfort zone with movies, at least. It’s going to sound kinda boring and normie, but I do value that we follow this process every year.&nbsp;</p><p>We watch every single movie that’s up for Best Picture at the Oscars. No, this does not mean I am experiencing the most avante-garde art from indie filmmakers on a shoestring budget pushing at the definitional edges of filmmaking, but most years, I can barely keep up with the fun and goofy blockbusters rolling out. Plus, fun and goofy blockbusters pair well with a Saturday evening as you split a bottle (or two) of wine with a partner. Less so with sad movies!</p><p>I can’t remember how long we’ve been doing this watch-every-nominated-film schtick, but I managed to get my neighbors to get in on the action, too, and it’s led to some hysterically fun conversations about movies that click, movies that don’t, and just generally watching stuff that I would not otherwise click to rent on iTunes or whatever. (<em>Sing Sing</em> is one of the best movies I’ve seen in the past decade, and I’m not sure I would have watched it without this in place.)</p><p>Anyway, I’ve gone on long enough. What movie—or other form of art—fucked you up, Rob?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Is this where Patrick admits he hasn't actually seen </span><i><em>Goodfellas</em></i><span>?</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Okay, so my dad loved mob movies and so they were on in the background a lot growing up. Which means that the image of Robert De Niro sitting down in his car and then being blown into oblivion by a car bomb is engraved in my brain, though until recently I'd also seamlessly blended that scene with the opening of <em>Backdraft</em>, where the killer's first victim in the film opens their front door and gets blasted by the titular backdraft and their entire head is shown melted in the next scene.</p><p>All that was bad enough but then my dad had <em>The Godfather </em>playing and nothing rattled me about that movie. Not the horse's head, not what happens to Sonny, not Michael shooting the police captain. But then, right when things seem to be going well for Michael in Italy, what happens? That's right: car bombing.</p>

            <guid>1382041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that a new game based on the Alien franchise is back in development.</p>



<p>According to sources, this new Alien title is a single-player arcade survival horror game that sees players trying to survive being aboard a decaying space station. They’ll have to evade a mix of xenomorphs and spec ops units in what was described to Insider Gaming as being “Shadow of Tomb Raider with xenomorphs” at its current stage.</p>







<p>The game, which has been in the works since at least 2020 under a variety of names and was even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first reported on</a> by Insider Gaming in November 2022. What was once codenamed “Marathon” and others that Insider Gaming promised not to share to protect sources, was believed to be dead for a few years. It had switched developers multiple times, but recent documents dated from earlier this year show that the current studio working on Alien is Eidos Montreal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to gameplay, its planned to have a mix of combat, platforming, and puzzles. Players will need to rely on stealth, resource management, and problem-solving, with puzzles ranging from repairing machinery to cracking codes. And during combat, enemies won’t just rush blindly. The AI is designed to adapt and react to whatever tactics you use.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Documents also show at least three characters in the game. The main character Aubrey is an engineer who has the ability to use items like grappling hooks and magnetic boots, among others. Another new character is Ryuzo who uses the space station as his fortress and is likely an antagonist of some sort. Finally, there’s Ripley 8. In the movies, she was famously played by Sigourney Weaver and there’s an internal hope that she could reprise her role for the game. That said, only a first approach has been made as of now with nothing set in stone.</p>







<p>The early budget for the game is less than $75 million, but it’s higher than the earlier budget of $30 million from a few years ago. It’s also slated for release in 2028 for all major platforms. However, it was emphasized that the game is still in “early development”, and that the date, along with other game details, could very well be changed. Sources say, though, that the state of the game is in a good place at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Eidos Montreal nor Embracer responded to multiple requests for comment on this story.</p>

<p>The best way to spread Holiday cheer is by playing Fortnite Winterfest 2025 loud for all to hear. If you’re staying up past your bedtime, eating milk and cookies to keep a lookout for Winterfest 2025 details, this guide can help.</p>



<p>Unless Epic Games decides everyone needs coal in their stockings this year, expect <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-suggest-overwatch-crossover-could-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> Winterfest 2025 to drop and get the community into the festive spirit. Like Santa, it comes once a year and delivers a bunch of fun gifts to enrich the Fortnite festive spirit!</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has gathered up the latest leaks and tidbits about Fortnite Winterfest 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-potential-fortnite-winterfest-2025-release-date">Potential Fortnite Winterfest 2025 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another winter map makeover would be nice. Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s looking likely that Fortnite Winterfest 2025 will start the week of December 15, potentially launching as late as Friday, December 19.</strong></p>







<p>This is not a guarantee, and it’s simply using leaks and logic from previous Winterfest events. Firstly, HYPEX declared on December 10 that: “FORTNITE WINTERFEST 2025 STARTS NEXT WEEK.”</p>



<p>As of writing, today is Friday, and it’s looking unlikely that Winterfest 205 is dropping sadly. However, this would be in keeping with previous years, as Winterfest has never dropped before December 13—as it did in 2022.</p>



<p>Winterfest 2024 was the most recent incarnation, and it went live on December 20, 2024, which was the third Friday of the month. December 19 would be the third Friday of the month this year. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Winterfest does have a history of launching on different days throughout the week, though, so don’t rule it out starting a bit earlier.</p>

<p><strong>A Harry Potter collaboration is expected to be the main attraction for Fortnite’s Winterfest 2025 event and theme; the Cabin is expected to return, and there will be other Xmas-themed activities and a boss.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a lot to wrap and unpack this Christmas! Let’s start with Fortnite Winterfest 2025’s Harry Potter collaboration. Insider Gaming reported a while ago that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite and Harry Potter collab was coming soon</a>.</p>



<p>The official Fortnite account has posted about the expected collab: “Unlock the Chocolate Frog Back Bling before it hops away AND get ready for customizable Hogwarts house-themed Outfits in the Shop later this month!</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Something magical is brewing…</p><p>Unlock the Chocolate Frog Back Bling before it hops away AND get ready for customizable Hogwarts house-themed Outfits in the Shop later this month! <a href="https://t.co/dxU8F0don5">pic.twitter.com/dxU8F0don5</a></p></div>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1999359954533462056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In addition to this, Shiina (through <a href="https://x.com/itsmeleaky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@itsmeleaky</a> &amp; <a href="https://x.com/blortzen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@blortzen</a>) has revealed a leaked Winter Hatsune Miku skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Along with a Harry Potter skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you thought this was all, well, be prepared to have your Muggle mind blown with the reveal of more skins and a broom!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, another leak from <a href="https://x.com/FinnLeakss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Finn | Fortnite Leaks &amp; News</a> suggests a ‘Yule Trooper Boss’ is coming to cause trouble.</p>

<p>Producer Andrew Willis says unionization is "incredibly important" for developers "across the industry" in order to "push back on all the unilateral workplace changes" being imposed on workers by "industry executives".</p><p>Local 6215 president Ron Swaggerty (which, by the way, is an excellent name), meanwhile, says that id Software's native Texas is now a "force in building collective power" in the gaming industry, and that the union looks forward to negotiating a contract that "reflects the skill, creativity, and dedication" of the studio's workers.</p><p>This isn't the first time a studio at Microsoft has unionized, of course. id Software follows in the footsteps of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-overwatch-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c8571b8-a998-407f-adb5-66bec141aeba" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">developers at Blizzard</a>, Bethesda's parent company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenimax-qa-union-strike" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="09d99387-8c9a-4aef-8a3d-6226b7553603" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">ZeniMax</a>, and <em>Call of Duty </em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-activision-microsoft-labor-complaint" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e5cbcf28-95af-4834-91c2-6ea91eaef2c5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Raven Software</a>, to name but a few.</p><p>The topic of unionization is a particularly pertinent one at the moment, too; back in November, <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>developer Rockstar was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2fb963bf-6dd1-47b3-bfbd-3f16511b3076" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">accused of union-busting</a> after firing a number of employees who were involved in union activity.

"This is a game made by adults for adults," is a line that features in a recent interview with Ryan Hill, creative strategist at CI Games, talking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> in tandem with its Geoff's Night of Pretending to Like Video Games gameplay reveal trailer. The reason this line comes up is because the upcoming sequel is a violent one, one that hopes to be bloodier and gorier than its predecessor, to the point that you can, if you like, chop off any limb you can see in the game.
</p>
<p>
"When we asked our community just how far we should push the gore in the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a>, the answer was loud and unanimous: 'go all in'," Hill told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-limb-can-be-removed-lords-of-the-fallen-ii-publisher-discusses-dismemberment-lore-and-learnings-for-the-sequel-the-game-awards-2025-ign">IGN</a> in said interview. "This is a game made by adults for adults, and we didn't want to dilute the brutality or intensity of that experience.

"Soulslikes thrive on challenge, and that rush you get when defeating an enemy is unlike anything else. Enhancing that moment with a dynamic dismemberment system takes the satisfaction to another level - instead of enemies simply ragdolling to the floor, players can literally tear them apart."
</p><p>
Hill also made sure to clarify that again, yes, "every limb can be removed." You can see some of that in the gameplay trailer up above, and yeah, that sure does look like some limb slicing, though how that affects moment to moment gameplay isn't immediately apparent just yet.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder Lords of the Fallen 2 is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ci-games-reveal-new-lords-of-the-fallen-sniper-ghost-warrior-and-a-major-new-action-rpg">follow-up to Lords of the Fallen</a> (2023), not Lords of the Fallen (2014), in case you lost track of which Lords of the Fallen came out when, and maybe where. The sequel is supposedly launching in 2026, but if I've learned anything in my time doing this work, it is that betting on dates is as clever as pissing in the wind.

            <guid>1381990</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Almost everyone has that one mysterious corner of the house where the internet simply refuses to cooperate. You step into that corner, suddenly your phone can’t load a webpage, your videos start buffering, downloads stall, and frustration sets in — especially if that dead zone happens to be somewhere you actually need reliable service, like the bathroom. We will not go back to reading the back of a shampoo bottle like they did in cave man times.</p>
<p>A Wi-Fi range extender is an easy and effective way to eliminate those annoying weak zones. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6367/">Right now, this Wi-Fi 7 one from TP-Link has been cut in price by 25%</a>. For a limited time, you can pick one up for just $90. It’s normally selling for $120, so you end up saving yourself both $30 and a lot of headaches of dealing with crap internet coverage.</p>
<p>With Wi-Fi 7 technology, you can enjoy incredibly fast download and upload speeds totaling up to 3.2 Gbps. That means smooth 8K streaming, lag-free online gaming, and a noticeably more responsive connection throughout your home. This TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 extender supports dual-band 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz signals, with the 2.4 GHz band delivering up to 688 Mbps and the 5 GHz band reaching up to 2,594 Mbps. Note that this particular model does not include support for a 6 GHz band. Also you’ll only reach these speeds if your router, modem, and plan with your internet provider reach those speeds as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6367/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Wi-Fi Coverage in Every Corner of Your Home</h2>
<p>This TPL-Link Wi-Fi 7 range extender can provide additional coverage in your home of up to nearly 2,400 square feet. Its two high-performance antennas work together to broaden and strengthen your wireless signal, helping it pass through walls and reach areas your router couldn’t reliably cover on its own. The extender also boosts your network’s device capacity, allowing you to connect as many as 64 additional devices at once. That means more room for your smartphones, smart TVs, streaming sticks, Alexa Echo units, security cameras, smart bulbs, and all the other connected gadgets you rely on every day.</p>
<p>The range extender employs smart adaptive roaming. This means you’re devices will automatically connect to whichever is the strongest signal in your home. So if you have your main router on the first floor, and then the TP-Link range extender is upstairs, your phone can shift between the two when you go up and down the stairs, moving throughout your home with no extra effort from you.</p>



<p>If you’re home is already working on a mesh network, great news. The TP-Link ranger extender is EasyMesh-compatible. It can work in unison with other EasyMesh-compatible routers or nodes to keep increasing the Wi-Fi coverage of your property.</p>
<p>With the right range extender, you can finally enjoy strong, stable Wi-Fi in every corner of your home.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6367/"> And now that the TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 range extender is on sale for 25% off, now’s a great time to upgrade.</a></p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/epic-celebrates-the-end-of-the-apple-tax-after-appeals-court-win-in-ios-payments-case/</link>
            <guid>1381987</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Back in April, District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-after-court-slams-apples-obvious-cover-up/">delivered a scathing judgment</a> finding that Apple was in “willful violation” of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/injunction-apple-must-open-up-app-store-payments-in-90-days/">her 2021 injunction</a> intended to open up iOS App Store payments. That contempt of court finding has now been almost entirely upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, a development that Epic Games’ Tim Sweeney tells Ars he hopes will “do a lot of good for developers and start to really change the App Store situation worldwide, I think.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-Court-of-Appeals-for-the-Ninth-Circuit-December-11-.pdf">The ruling</a>, signed by a panel of three appellate court judges, affirmed that Apple’s initial attempts to charge a 27 percent fee to iOS developers using outside payment options “had a prohibitive effect, in violation of the injunction.” Similarly, Apple’s restrictions on how those outside links had to be designed were overly broad; the appeals court suggests that Apple can only ensure that internal and external payment options are presented in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>The appeals court also agreed that Apple acted in “bad faith” by refusing to comply with the injunction, rejecting viable, compliant alternatives in internal discussions. And the appeals court was also not convinced by Apple’s process-focused arguments, saying the district court properly evaluated materials Apple argued were protected by attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p>While the district court barred Apple from charging <em>any</em> fees for payments made outside of its App Store, the appeals court now suggests that Apple should still be able to charge a “reasonable fee” based on its “actual costs to ensure user security and privacy.” It will be up to Apple and the district court to determine what that kind of “reasonable fee” should look like going forward.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters Thursday night, though, Epic founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said he believes those should be “super super minor fees,” on the order of “tens or hundreds of dollars” every time an iOS app update goes through Apple for review. That should be more than enough to compensate the employees reviewing the apps to make sure outside payment links are not scams and lead to a system of “normal fees for normal businesses that sell normal things to normal customers,” Sweeney said.</p>

                <p>Fortnite's latest collab is with Kim Kardashian, and in a new interview, the megastar discussed how the partnership came to be, how good she is at Fortnite, and how closely she worked with Epic to bring her vision to life.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a69700805/kim-kardashian-fortnite-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elle Magazine</a>, Kardashian said she is a "decent" Fortnite player. "I wouldn't say I'm great, but I wouldn't say I'm horrible," she said. She added that her son, Saint, is "definitely better than I am."</p><p>"But, you know, he doesn't teach me all of his tricks," she said.</p><p>As for how she came to know Fortnite, Kardashian said her brother introduced her to the game years ago. And while she does play Fortnite, she only does so "moderately" because she believes things should be enjoyed "in moderation."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1t45vRyCs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EE1t45vRyCs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Kardashian also confirmed that she worked closely alongside Epic Games on the collab, saying she spent an hour each night--from 10 to 11 PM--talking with Epic to "perfect everything" and ensure that "everything looked as realistic as possible."</p><p>Also in the interview, Kardashian said Fortnite is an "iconic" game and she is happy to join the ranks of high-profile people and brands that have come to the game over the years. "Just to have seen all of the previous characters and how cute they look, I was really excited to have my own character," she said.</p><p>Kardashian previously worked with Glu Mobile on the popular mobile game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-kim-kardashians-mobile-game-is-really-popular/1100-6434875/" data-ref-id="1100-6434875">Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</a>, but it closed down in early 2024 after about a decade of operation. "I love the gaming space," she said in the interview with Elle.</p><p>One of the emotes for Kardashian in Fortnite is called "Slurp the Internet," and it's a reference to her famous "Break the Internet" shoot for Paper Magazine years ago. In that photo, she has a champagne glass on her butt, but in Fortnite, the champagne glass is on her foot. This is "because it could just fit better and look better," she said. Her other emote is called "Diamond Drop," and it's a reference to how she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnJ7butR77g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped a diamond earring in the ocean in Bora Bora while filming Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>. She said she was "brutalized" over the mishap, and is now having some fun with it.</p><p>"You lose your diamonds in the ocean, and a little boat appears. You're just sitting, crying wherever you're at in the game. We got pretty creative with our emotes," she said.</p><p>Additionally, one of her weapons is a purse, and it's modeled after the one she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U26-nQ-1AdA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smacked Khloé Kardashian with</a>, and it even features the "same movement that I hit her with," she said.</p><p>Kardashian arrives in Fortnite on December 13.

More specifically, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-insists-gta-6-devs-were-fired-for-leaks-not-unionizing/1100-6536894/" data-ref-id="1100-6536894">Rockstar Games told GameSpot</a> that those developers were let go for discussing "specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles" and other "confidential information" in a public forum. IWGB took issue with that, telling GameSpot that the characterization is inaccurate.</p><p>"Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation--they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals," the union said in an emailed statement. "Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as 'leaking information.' It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month. From the UK Prime Minister in the House of Commons, to the game developers across the world erupting in protest--all eyes are on Rockstar and their lawless attack on the people who make them their billions."</p><p>The situation has intensified since bursting in October 2025. Protests were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/07/uk-union-accuses-gta-maker-rockstar-games-of-firing-employees-attempting-to-organise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">formed outside Rockstar North's office</a> in Edinburgh. Over 200 Rockstar Games developers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-200-rockstar-devs-sign-letter-demanding-fired-staff-be-reinstated/1100-6536181/" data-ref-id="1100-6536181">signed a letter</a> demanding that those ousted workers be reinstated. Even the UK's Prime Minister said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-kingdoms-ministers-will-look-into-rockstars-dev-firings-says-prime-minister/1100-6536840/" data-ref-id="1100-6536840">they will keep pressure on Rockstar Games</a> regarding the incident. All eyes are truly on this matter, as Rockstar Games and IWGB debate back and forth over how and why those developers were terminated and what sould be done about the situation.</p><p>In other union news, Doom developer id Software has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-dev-id-software-forms-a-wall-to-wall-union/1100-6536938/" data-ref-id="1100-6536938">formed a "wall-to-wall" union</a> to protect its 165-person, Texas-based studio against AI while delivering better benefits. Microsoft has recognized that union.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Amazon is continuing to celebrate The Game Awards, which took place on December 11th, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=120158211011&amp;pf_rd_p=cb919822-ef92-44d0-941a-1bcdb4d30dd7&amp;pf_rd_r=7PJJHZQP9THN1Q4JEA03&amp;ref_=GoG24&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">a big sale</a> on titles that were nominated in their respective categories. The deals include a discount that brings the PC version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-Standard-Online/dp/B0FNGXKPK9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, which ended up taking home nine awards (including game of the year), back down to its all-time low of $39.99 ($10 off). If you’ve somehow made it through your gaming backlog, don’t mind adding to it, or need a last-minute gift for your favorite gamer, it’s a good time to pick up some of the top titles of 2025.</p><p><strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></strong> is a turn-based RPG with an engaging battle system with plenty of tactical diversity, an atmospheric soundtrack that sets the right mood, and a story that our reviewer found heart-wrenching, stirring, and humorous. Battles feel dynamic thanks to a dodge and parry system that rewards you for launching a countermove. Getting a perfectly timed parry can turn the tide of your battle, but it may take you some time to learn how certain enemies move before you can learn the right timing. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc">Read our review</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> is the latest entry in the long-running survival horror series set in 1960s Japan, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Hill-PlayStation-Amazon-Exclusive-Day/dp/B0F1C14LY8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PS5 version</a> is on sale for $44.99 ($25 off) exclusively for Prime members. Its strengths lie in its beautiful visuals, intriguing location, deep story, and tense, melancholic atmosphere. There aren’t many jump scares, but you may feel a general sense of unease. The game’s protagonist, a high schooler named Hinako, grows more assertive as the game progresses, and she wrestles with both the enemies in front of her and an internal struggle between tradition and modernity. The game has five possible endings, which adds to its replayability. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/782012/silent-hill-f-review-ps5-xbox-steam">Read our review</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em> </strong>is the latest title from Kojima Productions, and you can snag the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Stranding-2-Beach-PlayStation-5/dp/B0F19GPDW3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PS5 game</a> for $49.97 (around $20 off). The game is a direct sequel to the original <em>Death Stranding</em>, and it follows protagonist Sam and his adopted child Lou as the former continues his quest to connect the world to an internet-like network.</p><p>The game’s landscape is bleak and empty, and you’ll have to contend with ghostlike creatures as you trek through the game’s world with weapons, traversal gear, healing items, and cargo. The missions, which range from rescuing a hostage to keeping your cargo above a certain temperature in harsh terrain, keep the game feeling interesting. The game’s story is easier to follow than its predecessor, though knowing the backstory can help a lot. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Split Fiction </em></strong>is a co-op adventure game that takes place in two different worlds simultaneously, and both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Split-Fiction-Playstation-5-PS5/dp/B0F6423HHW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Split-Fiction-Playstation-5-PS5/dp/B0DQF6GRT8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">PS5</a> versions are on sale for $30 ($20 off). Protagonists Zoe and Mio are both trapped in a machine, but one is transported to a land of futuristic cities, while the other finds themselves in a fantasy land full of magical kingdoms. The characters get new powers in each section, but two players need to work in tandem to navigate through their respective connected worlds. Coordination is key, whether you’re outwitting a boss in a section reminiscent of two-player pinball or playing little minigames that take place in the middle of its narrative. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two">Read our review</a>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandt Ranj</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/843459/game-awards-playstation-nintendo-pc-games-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-adds-another-80-off-laptop-as-holiday-clearance-deals-continue-on-amazon-not-listed-on-official-site-2000651632</link>
            <guid>1381966</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops (and PCs) don’t have to be massive or insanely expensive to get the job done. If you’re after a machine that takes care of all your everyday work and play-related tasks with ease, Amazon is letting you upgrade for under $500 right now; you read that right.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/">The 15.6-inch HP laptop, which would run you around $2,000 on a regular day, is currently going for $400</a>. That’s after the retailer took a whopping 80% off its retail tag. But as you’d expect, the deal is selling fast. Whether you’re looking to snap one for yourself or want to gift it to a student or work professional in your life this holiday season, now is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Display, Reliable Performance</h2>
<p>Looks-wise, it’s a classic HP laptop. The sleek, lightweight design makes it ultra-portable, letting you carry it around easily wherever you go. The 15.6-inch screen is bright, while the 85% screen-to-body ratio offers a larger room to work and play on. You’ll enjoy crisp, vibrant visuals consistently (for movies, shows, presentations), and also won’t have to fight your own reflections when working in well-lit rooms. Translation? An immersive viewing experience that’s easy on the eyes, even when using the laptop for an extended period of time. Paired with the screen is a full-sized, soft grey keyboard with a numeric keypad to make typing long documents comfortable.</p>
<p>HP has packed the laptop with a 4-core Intel N100 processor that’s capable of hitting speeds up to 3.4 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology. It does not make the machine a powerhouse, sure, but it’s still great for regular office work, study requirements, and post-work entertainment. There’s a 16GB RAM to keep everything running smoothly, and especially comes in handy when you’re trying to multitask through busy days. With this at hand, you’ll be able to use a bunch of different applications at the same time, keep a ton of tabs open on your browser, take some quick meetings, and more; without noticeable slowdowns that kill the momentum.</p>



<p>As for storage, it gets you a 256GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD, which can house your important work documents, some media files, and necessary programs. We won’t sugarcoat it; the storage isn’t massive, so if you’re someone with a massive library of heavier projects, it might not be sufficient for you. But for casual use, it does the job. Moreover, SSDs are much faster than traditional drives, so you’ll also enjoy fast boot and load times with this one.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3 wireless card, and a wide range of ports, including one USB Type-C, two USB Type-A, one HDMI, one headphone/microphone combo, and an AC smart pin. Some other features that deserve a mention are dual speakers and an HP True Vision 720p HD camera to make video calls a breeze.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially at its current price. You can grab it for just $400 right now, which is nothing considering all the features</a> it packs. If you’re looking for more memory and storage, there’s a 32GB RAM/1TB SSD version of the laptop available too, which is currently sitting at $600. Again, the deal expires soon, so it’s better to grab yours before that happens.</p>

Understand its fragile balance, uncover its deepest questions, and find more than just the answers.</p><p><em>Chroma Zero</em> immerses you in a universe of mystery, color, energy, and movement, and challenges your expectations and intuition. There are no levels, the puzzles are integrated into the fabric of the space itself, and everything can change in the blink of an eye. Exploration and curiosity are rewarded.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Playtesters have taken between six and 12 hours to finish the game, and a bit more to explore everything. Most progress is gated only by knowledge, which is gained by exploring and experimenting.</p><p>This is an immersive, non-linear, risk-taking and moderately challenging game, made by a solo developer. The narrative is mostly light-hearted, but can be impactful at times. The puzzles ramp up in difficulty, though the game helps to guide you as well. So if you’re exploring everywhere, you will know what to do—maybe just not how to do it! I was inspired by games like <em>Antichamber</em>, <em><a title="Games > Outer Wilds [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a></em> / <em><a title="Games > Riven [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/riven">Riven</a></em>, and the discovery elements of <em>Tunic</em>. I hope to bring more games like these into the world, since by their nature they are focused on giving you a wonderful and surprising first-playthrough.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Knowledge Based Progression</strong> – Learn the rules of the space, and you can progress farther in the world and deeper into the mystery</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Open-World [791 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">Open-World</a> Puzzles</strong> – Explore everywhere, the world itself is the puzzle.

                <p>Gears of War fans hoping to see a new trailer for the upcoming prequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day/" data-ref-id="5000-631971">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, may have been disappointed that it skipped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a> this year. That may be why the official Gears of War social media accounts have shared a message assuring fans that E-Day is still coming in 2026.</p><p>The image shared on the Gears of War X account didn't share any spoilers and it was just a skull set against some haunting red and black shades. But it did confirm the 2026 release window.</p><p>For now, Gears of War: E-Day is only confirmed for Xbox Series X|S and PC. However, it seems very likely to be the second game in the franchise to make the leap to PlayStation 5, given that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-launch-times-revealed-for-franchises-debut-on-ps5/1100-6534232/" data-ref-id="1100-6534232">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>--a remake of the original game--became the first title in the series to appear on a Sony console. Cliff Bleszinski--the co-creator of the franchise--has mentioned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-co-creator-is-thrilled-that-the-franchise-isnt-xbox-exclusive-anymore/1100-6534071/" data-ref-id="1100-6534071">he's happy that the Gears of War games are no longer exclusive</a> to a single console.</p><p>Gears of War: E-Day was announced during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024, but there haven't been many updates about it since that time. Just over a year ago, it was revealed that John DiMaggio (Futurama) and Carlos Ferro <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-is-bringing-back-original-marcus-and-dom-voice-actors/1100-6527641/" data-ref-id="1100-6527641">will reprise their respective roles</a>, Marcus Fenix and Dominic "Dom" Santiago.</p><p>The game is an original prequel story that's set 14 years before the first Gears of War, when Marcus and Dom were still young soldiers in the Coalition of Ordered Governments. Their world, Sera, has finally found some measure of peace before the Locust Horde struck on Emergence Day, which threatens to wipe out all of the humans living on the planet. A new city, Kalona, will be one of the central locations for the story within the game.</p><p>Outside of the gaming realm, John Wick and Deadpool 2 director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-director-is-excited-about-gears-of-war-movie-and-making-his-first-war-film/1100-6534228/" data-ref-id="1100-6534228">David Leitch is set to direct</a> the live-action Gears of War movie for Netflix. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dave-bautista-really-wants-to-play-the-lead-in-netflixs-gears-of-war-movie/1100-6509125/" data-ref-id="1100-6509125">Dave Bautista has lobbied for years to play Marcus</a>, but he has yet to land the part.</p>

<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Mega Dimension Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161133/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>After hopping into my 20th Hyperspace in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>’s DLC, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a>, I realised something. I’ve been doing the same things over and over again for the past few hours.</p>
<p>Now, I know the series isn’t exactly known for varying things, but it feels particularly egregious within a condensed DLC experience. And for the entire 10-15 hours I’ve spent running around these Hyperspace pockets, I can probably count on one hand what I’ve done.</p>
<p>This is a pretty chunky DLC in Pokémon terms — the main story can probably be beaten in around 6-8 hours, but there are a lot of new Pokémon, new Side Missions, and more to dig into, including after the credits — but the bulk of Mega Dimension feels like empty calories. Here I am, back in Lumiose City, a place I already got bored with fast because of its lack of variety, and now I’m running around the same handful of randomly-generated Hyperspace pockets over and over again just to fulfil research tasks and progress the story.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Mega Dimension Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161132/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, you read that right: randomly-generated. Mega Dimension is <em>sort of</em> a roguelite, and that stopped me from completely sleepwalking my way through every single dimension. For what the liminal pearly white snapshots of Lumiose City lack in variety, they make up for in a handful of other ways. They’re home to an abundance of new returning creatures. Not only that, the ‘mons in these spaces are all over level 100, with many reaching way beyond 150 in the later stages.</p>
<p>I’ve grown up with this franchise, and if you think I don’t still get excited whenever I see a Cubone running around carefree or even newer ‘mons like Sandygast bobbing around in the concrete, then I’m sorry. It’s especially exciting to see these Pokémon at levels way beyond the level cap. Who knew a gang of level 120 Mankey would be lethal? I watched six of them beat up my Feraligatr in no time at all. I got the same level of thrill encountering Alpha Pokémon in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a> whenever I jumped into a level 180 dimension and found something I hadn’t caught before.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Mega Dimension Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161134/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The higher levels in these dimensions is easily the best thing about this DLC. It makes catching wild Pokémon fun in a different way; no longer am I guaranteed to get something <em>just</em> because it’s a Meditite or a Sandile. It might beat me and my Pokémon up before I get a chance to weaken it a little or sneak up on it. In fact, I found the compact corridors and rooftops of Lumiose worked to the DLC’s advantage, because I had to be a little more thoughtful about how to catch things here than in the base game’s Wild Zones.</p>
<p>Catching Pokémon and dealing with high-level monsters are the highs; the lows are the repetitive maps, the annoying platforming, and the list of random tasks that you complete to build up research points. The grind only gets longer the further in you get.</p>
<p>There’s nothing compelling about awkwardly floating from one rooftop to another, or scrambling around to find the right ladder to get to the top of the building you’re aiming for. Destroying boulders, watering down sludge, picking up items, breaking Poké Balls, catching ‘mons I already have 10 of in my box, or fighting trainers à la the Z-A Royale. It’s all the same stuff in the same spaces I’ve spent hours and hours running around a few months ago.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Mega Dimension Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161139/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>These alternate pockets of Lumiose City exacerbate all of my problems with the city in the base game. The city lacks character, and in these spaces, it’s all just a blank slate of whiteness. There’s no real way to jump, meaning you have to drop and float and hope you land in the right spot. They’re a chore to get around, with no map and a time limit determined by the type of donut you feed Hoopa before jumping in. And there’s maybe only about six variations of these spaces. When I’m excited to see a sewer, of all places, you know something’s up.</p>
<p>The aforementioned donut making could be cute, and initially, it kind of is – Hoopa and new character Ansha are a delightful pair, and who doesn’t like donuts? But like exploring Hyperspace, baking is a chore. Using berries from the base game (and eventually, Hyper berries), you make donuts that determine how much you increase your Pokémon’s levels and the amount of time you can spend in Hyperspace, depending on the dimension’s star rank <em>and</em> the donut’s rank.</p>
<p>You need to make a lot of these, and you can only make one at a time. It’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> crafting all over again. Weirdly, there’s an option to make the exact same donut you just made, but if your Coba-flavoured confection was a test and you know how to make it better, have fun making one at a time over and over again. And if you don't have any great donuts available, well, get ready to run around the city or Hyperspace or buy them one by one from a vendor.</p>

<p>Luckily, what <em>is</em> great about the base game is still great here. The action-oriented combat is still largely excellent, perhaps let down by some of the chaotic forced double battles peppered throughout the story. The Rogue Mega Evolution fights are actually even better in Mega Dimension, because your foe actually moves around and engages with the space. I even lost to one of them because I jumped in unprepared and was shocked at just how fast it moved and how hard it hit.</p>
<p>When you’re fighting something that matches your level, or something that exceeds it, things get nail-biting, a scramble of defensive choices, Pokémon-swapping, and dodging. But when the DLC basically requires you to be level 100 in the first few hours, but <em>still</em> throws mandatory trainer fights at level 70 your way, it’s a little baffling.</p>
<p>The repetitiveness of Mega Dimension really does let the DLC down because, like with Legends: Z-A, there are some really good foundations here. A Pokémon roguelite could work really well, but there’s little variety to take much advantage of the randomness, besides the Pokémon you encounter.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Mega Dimension Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161129/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The combat is great, but give me a set of consistent, high-level fights. Even the Side Missions are a step-up here, for the most part, but for every good battle, story of a city struggling with change, or brand new Mega Evolution encounter, there’s another fetch quest or “trail the Pokémon” task.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The core of Pokémon and the highs of Pokémon Legends: Z-A just about manage to shine through in the Mega Dimension DLC, but the repetitive Hyperspace dimensions, bland level design, and dull donut making stop this from being a true Mega Evolution for the game.</p>
<p>If you’ve grown up with this series, you’ll find it hard to resist the lure of the expanded Pokédex and seeing your favourites almost looking their best is a joy. Repetition is not freeing, though, and as with the base game, I’m missing the freedom of the core series again.</p></section>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/leon-and-graces-screen-time-will-be-equally-split-in-resident-evil-requiem</link>

<p>"the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>During The Game Awards, Capcom finally confirmed the existence of Leon Kennedy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> with an awesome new trailer. It seemingly confirms that players will experience more traditional survival horror while playing as Grace Ashcroft, while Leon's gameplay will be more akin to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>
<p>But will the campaign be skewed in favour of one character over the other? According to Capcom, no. In speaking with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/">Automaton</a>, director Kōshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa confirm that Leon and Grace will share almost equal screen time throughout Requiem.</p>
<p>In fact, Nakanishi compared the structure to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a>, during which players jumped between Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield (funnily enough, this, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</a>, was also directed by Nakanishi).</p>
<p>Here's how Nakanishi describes the two play styles with Leon and Grace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’ve said before that Leon isn’t well suited to horror. Since quiet sections where you cower before monsters don’t fit him, his chapters focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action. Grace’s sections, on the other hand, are the scarier ones. We’re really emphasising the difference in their experiences this time.</p>
<p>"It’s almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together. Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna (laughs). It was important to combine the slow and fast segments well, and Grace and Leon turned out to be the best combination for that. Leon also has lots of new actions, giving you a strong sense of release compared to Grace’s sequences."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The director also explicitly states that Grace's gameplay is based specifically on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resident Evil 2</a>, while Leon's is based on Resident Evil 4. By including two distinct styles, the development team is hoping to relieve some of the terror players might feel when playing as Grace by allowing Leon to be the badass we know he is.</p>
<p>That said, Nakanishi is also keen to stress just how much weight Leon is carrying on his shoulders now that he's an older protagonist. He specifically mentions the idea of Leon returning to Raccoon City and responding to the "place where it all began" now that he's a lot more experienced.</p>
<p>This all sounds pretty great to us, and we can't wait to see how things pan out when Requiem launches on Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

		<p><span>Despite being the most-hyped reveal at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-game-awards">The Game Awards 2025</a>, there’s a good chance you may not be familiar with the games that precede <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/divinity-original-sin-3">Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>. However, it looks like RPG fans may soon get the chance to experience the breakout sequel that put this series on the map as well as its developer, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/larian-studios">Larian Studios.</a> The same Larian Studios that created one of the genre’s modern masterpieces, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Divinity - Cinematic Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxzyVeAG00w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition has been floating in the ether for a while now. We assumed that, given the success of BG3, Larian would have quickly followed up with an enhanced version of its previous game, eager to steer its legion of newly-acquired fans towards Larian’s own original IP which debuted way back in 2002.</span></p>
<p><span>After appearing on a ratings board (which is usually a good sign of a game’s impending release) Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive fell off the radar, but now it has reappeared. Ahead of the big reveal at The Game Awards, <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1998412420050796931">a post from PlayStation Game Size surfaced on social media</a>, confirming the game’s existence on PS5.</span></p>


<p><span>Given that this information comes from a pretty reliable source when it comes to leaking PlayStation Store data, hopefully we can expect an official announcement from Larian Studios in the coming days.</span></p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/26/divinity-original-sin-2-review/">Divinity: Original Sin 2 review</a> we scored the game a smashing 9/10, saying that it was “the strongest CRPG in decades, with a fascinating plot that enthrals, despite taking a while to get going and being hard as nails at times. It’s the little adventures that flesh out the world and so much of it can be missed at first glance because you didn’t have the right skill or failed a persuasion check. Massive in scope and jam packed with features that includes a GM mode that shows a surprising amount of customisation with great ease, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a bumper package.”</p>

			<p>For long stretches since Routine was announced way back in 2012, it’s been easy to assume this was vapourware, that it would never be released. It is therefore with great delight that I can confirm that, not only is it fully complete, but it has actually turned out to fulfil all my expectations and more. The retro-futuristic stylings, the moments of sheer terror, and the fascinating storyline all combine to produce a game that is well worth the wait.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROUTINE | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dm8Gw2MaLEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game’s title is a suitably tricky play on words, with dual references to the everyday nature of your job as a computer technician and the nature of the programs you interact with on the 1980s style terminals scattered around the lunar base. The aesthetic of the game draws equally on the Alien series and Duncan Jones’ Moon, with clear narrative echoes to both appearing as well. I am a sucker for this kind of vision of the future so have been eagerly awaiting the chance to immerse myself in Lunar Software’s debut game.</p>


<p>Routine begins in standard science fiction disaster fashion. A lunar base outpost has suffered a complete systems breakdown shortly after the crew reported a mysterious finding. You take the role of a solo systems tech who must travel to the base and find out how to restore power and function. Little do you know that you will be exposed to mysteries and horrors beyond your imagination and find yourself changed in ways you never thought possible.</p>


<p>The general atmosphere and aesthetics of Routine are superb, taking clear influence from the retro-futurism of films like Alien and Silent Running. Huge CRT monitors are littered around the environment with many being accessible for hacking with your gun-like multitool. Unlike many similar games, objects around you are more interactive, with intuitive prone and leaning mechanics being necessary to hide and navigate around parts of the environment. </p>
<p>The early enemies are threatening and merciless but have nothing on what will face you later on. Environmental signposting is good and it is worth trying to orient yourself through this as there was no in-game map that I could find. While there is a degree of backtracking involved, the individual areas are compact enough to avoid this becoming a chore.</p>

<p>Interacting with the world requires the use of your CAT (Cosmonaut Assistance Tool), which looks like a gun but is not really an offensive weapon and feels more like a blend of a VHS camera and radar speed gun. You can fire off bolts of electricity to stun enemies, but this function was mostly used for puzzle solving in my playthrough. In the very beginning of the game the embedded tutorial teaches you that the CAT requires batteries (fortunately these are incredibly common around the map) with different modules you find along the way using up different amounts of power.</p>
<p>Your first module is a Wi-Fi feature that lets you connect to the main terminals in the game – terminals that act as save points, task journals, and manual. This immersive menu is incredibly effective and means that you never have to break free of the game to save and access your journal whilst also ensuring that you need to find a terminal to access these functions. The immersive nature of the mechanics continues with the CAT itself which you have to directly engage with to insert batteries, activate the WiFi and also use the later module upgrades which require you to hold up the device’s miniature screen and zoom in.</p>

<p>Puzzles range from looking for password codes to directly using the CAT functions to search the environment for hidden clues. These functions are introduced regularly throughout the game in a way that means you are never left doing the same thing for too long.</p>
<p>The pacing of the game in general is excellent, unless you put it down for a day or two and forget your way around… Playing prior to release added a great deal of extra satisfaction as there were no walkthroughs or puzzle solutions to look up. I’d absolutely recommend persevering if you’re stuck to experience the game this way.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Routine is one of the best linear narrative experiences I’ve played this year and is well worth the lengthy wait for release. The atmosphere and aesthetics combine to create a game that oscillates between unnerving and genuinely terrifying whilst the surreal and philosophical storyline will hook you all the way to the game’s conclusion. I’m looking forward to a host of video essays dissecting the narrative in the near future.	</p></div>

              <p>Everyone knew <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> was a frontrunner to clinch some of the biggest categories at the Game Awards 2025, but I don’t know that anyone expected it to sweep the night and <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">set a new record for winning the most awards</a> with nine (<em>The Last Of Us 2</em> earned seven back in 2020). Instead of resting on its laurels, Sandfall Interactive used the night to shadow-drop <em>Clair Obscur</em>‘s free mini-DLC to give fans a reason to dive back into the Belle Époque RPG.</p> <p>This content drop <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-free-update-expansion-bosses-2000633193">was teased earlier this year</a> and includes a new playable environment called “Verso’s Drafts,” inspired by the character’s childhood. There’s also new late-game boss battles, more Luminas and Weapons, extra costumes, and the addition of a photo mode for players to document their dress-up sessions with. Here’s a trailer for the new area:</p>  <p>The photo mode comes with dozens of filters and the devs say they’re excited to see how players use them to capture moments from the game’s memorable cinematic scenes in completely new ways. And for anyone who hasn’t played <em>Clair Obscur </em>yet, it’s worth noting that the game is currently just $40. Normally $50, it’s 20 percent off on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox until December 16. It’s also still available on Game Pass.</p> <p>Here are the full patch notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/491585297311596633">the free 1.5 update</a>:</p>  <ul> <li> <p>Verso’s Drafts, a new playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover&nbsp;🙂<wbr></p> <ul> <li> <p>Located on the World Map, next to Lumière – Accessible from Act III<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Esquie’s Underwater ability is required!<wbr></p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19, with more to come!</p> </li> <li> <p>New costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving even more customization options for players throughout their adventure&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>New boss battles for late-game players to overcome in the Endless Tower – They are variations of iconic bosses from the main game, designed to be even more challenging<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added new Luminas and Weapons<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added the “Old Key” quest item to the final area of the game – Previously obtainable only during the Prologue, this addition gives players a second chance to collect all journals within a single playthrough<wbr></p> </li> </ul>  <ul> <li> <p>Added Photo Mode with plenty of settings and options for players to get creative with while capturing your favourite moments from the game, accessible at any time from the pause menu!&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added Lumina Sets feature, allowing players to save up to 50 different lumina loadouts for adapting to plenty of different fighting tactics at any moment&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added Abandon Battle option in the pause menu which can now be opened in battle&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added HUD Scale setting, allowing players to adjust the size of in-game HUD elements from 80% to 120%&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added FSR 4 support, including AMD temporal upscaling for sharper visuals and Frame Generation for smoother gameplay on compatible GPUs&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added new filters for Pictos and Luminas and improved the UI&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added input remapping for controller</p> </li> </ul>  <ul> <li> <p>The game is now certified on Steam Deck and ROG Xbox Ally!&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Global improvement of text legibility<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed multiple fog and lighting issues:&nbsp;&nbsp;<wbr></p> <ul> <li> <p>Overly intense effects during the Flying Manor boss fight (which also impacted some cinematics)&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Overexposed areas in the Visages&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Overly dark areas in the Endless Tower<wbr></p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Fixed FPS being capped at 30 on Steam Deck&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>VSync can now be properly disabled in the settings when playing on Steam Deck<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Graphic settings are now adjusted for Steam Deck users&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Improved first-time setup flow:&nbsp;&nbsp;<wbr></p> <ul> <li> <p>Controller input is now supported in installation wizards (no longer touchscreen-only)<wbr></p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>External controllers now switch seamlessly with the Steam Deck controls&nbsp;<wbr><wbr></p> </li> </ul>  <ul> <li> <p>Fixed an issue where using Battle Retry after a cinematic or automatic trigger could spawn the player out of the world if the last save was created in a different location&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>The playtime displayed on save files now accurately reflects total playtime, including time spent on Game Overs<br> (Note: this fix does not retroactively update existing save files.)&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed inventory behaviour so that sort order now persists after closing the game menu&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed issue preventing Intel XeSS Frame Generation setting from being accessible on PC Game Pass&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed an issue where the usage of particular diacritic marks (e.g. ^, ~, ´, `) in Windows is blocked after launching the title<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed Breaking Death always breaking all enemies when the character dies, it should only break the enemy that killed the character – As a result, it shouldn’t work when the character kills themself anymore<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Characters’ turn order during a First Strike, triggered by attacking an enemy on the map, now correctly respects characters’ Speed<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed Boucharo giving +150% Critical chance instead of +50% Critical chance&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed some Luminas giving unintended hidden +10% damage:&nbsp;&nbsp;<wbr></p> <ul> <li> <p>Sweet Kill&nbsp;&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Teamwork&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Dead Energy II&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>First Strike and others</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>

              <p>Enhance your gaming experience by treating yourself to audio that actually does your games justice. If you’ve been relying on the default speakers built into your TV, you probably don’t realize how much you’re missing. Switching to a quality over-ear headset feels a lot like discovering you’ve needed glasses your entire life—once you try it, everything suddenly becomes sharper and far more detailed. With proper surround sound, you can pick up tiny environmental cues, like the faint scuffle of an opponent approaching from behind, and identify their position using audio alone. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6369/">Even better, the Logitech G522 Lightspeed PC gaming headset is currently 25% off, dropping from $160 to just $120 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6369/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Advanced Synchronized Audio</h2>
<p>Logitech knows to take comms seriously. It doesn’t matter if you are a pro-level&nbsp;<em>League</em> player telling your jungler when to make their move or if you’re just laughing with friends because you barreled back down the mountain in <em>PEAK</em> again. The best in class voice clarity with full bandwidth 48 khz/16 bit microphone ensures your words are coming across crystal-clear. Its can handle broadcast-quality audio if you intend to use this headset while livestreaming on Twitch.</p>
<p>The audio you hear is equally impressive. The state-of-the-art PRO-G audio drivers can deliver synchronized 48 khz/24 bit audio of the highest quality, producing rich bass with minimal distortion. You get real sound—not the hollow tin-can crap you hear with bargain-bin headsets.</p>
<p>The Logitech G522 Lightspeed headset offers several choices for how to connect to your PC or mobile devices. Use a wired USB-A and USB-C connection for uninterrupted play. Bluetooth is also supported so you can connect to your phone or even a Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Any gaming headset worth its weight in gold needs to be comfortable. The Logitech G522 Lightspeed headset utilizes rounded cushion ear cups for maximum comfort. The suspension band allows it to fit around the contour of your head perfectly. Plus, its washable so you can keep the whole thing hygienic. No one has ever gotten a Victory Royale without sweating a little bit. The headset is lightweight too so you’ll barely even notice it while wearing it on your dome.</p>
<p>And of course, this wouldn’t be a capital-G “Gamer” accessory without the state-of-play-mandated RGB support. The side-facing lighting can produce up to 16.8 million colors, fully customizable by you. There are eight different lighting zones across the headset so you can create different combinations of colors.</p>
<p data-start="2463" data-end="2767">Battery life is another standout. With lighting off, you’ll be hitting close to the 60 hours of game time before you need to plug it back in. Not stats unfortunately on how long the headset lasts with lighting on. And with a 30-meter wireless range, you can wander off between matches to make much-needed trips to the kitchen to replenish your snacks without losing audio.</p>

              <p>Last night’s Game Awards revealed the first trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-movie-trailer-cast-release-date-2000652775">next year’s&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em> movie</a>, and people’s reaction has been excellent to watch. Given the source material, and the multiple straight-faced attempts to make it work as a movie over the last few decades, there was a base assumption that this would be another self-serious attempt to make a dramatic action movie. When it was clearly not that, but instead something that looked both fun and even funny, the world reacted with a collective “huh?” But to solve the puzzle, there’s one important piece that people missed: the director.</p> <p><em>Street Fighter</em> is being directed by Kitao Sakurai. Who’s that? you ask. Kitao Sakurai is the director of 62 episodes of <em>The Eric Andre Show</em>.</p> <p>If that doesn’t mean anything to you, this should help:</p>  <p>And now we’re all on the same page.</p> <p>I think it’s really worth watching the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em> movie trailer again, following the above.</p>

  <p>I was pretty sure that was Eric Andre dancing behind the news desk as Don Sauvage for a split second there the first time I watched. And yup, it is! And it all starts to make so much more sense.</p>

 <p>As social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spacecoyote.com/post/3m7r5oye4xc27">filled with memes</a> about the extraordinary new look for Guile, and game sites tried to comprehend what they’d just seen, it was all reasonably skewed by prior expectations. Me too! And <em>Kotaku</em> in general! Ethan’s take was to call the trailer “<a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-movie-trailer-cast-release-date-2000652775">surprisingly good</a>.” It’s only been 16 years since we were served Andrzej Bartkowiak <i>Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li</i> (<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/street-fighter-the-legend-of-chun-li/">a 17 on <em>Metacritic</em></a>), and no one can shake 1994’s Steven E. de Souza version, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue. There was no reason to think that we should hope for something better this time, either. So watching the trailer, preconceptions were so heavy that it was almost impossible to see what was really happening.</p>

 <p>What we actually see in this trailer is <em>deranged</em>. With the blinkers of pessimism removed, every cliched pose, every choreographed punch and kick, starts to reveal what it truly is: a goof. Seriously, look closer. That hoary old shot of Zangief pulling the tractor—there are two bored men sat on top of it, one reading a paper. The crash zoom on Andrew Koji’s Ryu, a shameless Bruce Lee rip-off moment—that’s on purpose. And Noah Centineo looking like the Ken doll version of Ken Masters—that also makes much more sense. In this light, Guile’s spectacular (and faithful!) flattop is no longer an anomaly, but a natural part of events.</p>

 <p>Now factor in the details like how Kyle Mooney has a character in this film, and how Sakurai’s more recent work has included&nbsp;<em>Twisted Metal</em>, and his only previous feature film was the surprisingly good genre-bending comedy <em>Bad Trip</em> starring Eric Andre and Lil Rey Howery, and there’s no way to believe this new&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em> movie isn’t going to be a weird-ass comedy from start to finish.</p> <p>Heck, given the pacing on <em>The Eric Andre Show</em>, the frenetic trailer might even match the final experience.</p>
