			<p>In a completely new round of speculations, it's rumored that Concord is still continuing to be updated on Steam, with Sony updating Concord's game files via Steam's back-end, leading to rumors swirling that Concord will be making a return. Concord will go down in PlayStation's history, but not in a positive light like they were hoping. Instead, the game completely flopped and was <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">removed from the store</a> within weeks, and refunds were given to all who purchased the title. The rumor comes from Reddit, which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1g0gxi7/concord_files_are_still_being_updated_via_steamdb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows the exact files</a> that have been changed in the SteamDB for Concord, with the files being updated on October 8. Multiple industry professionals have commented on the Concord debacle, with many saying that going F2P is the only thing that could possibly save this game. However, there are also professionals who say that Concord is just completely dead in the water, with no chance of redemption.</p>
<p>Considering that Concord was a huge project for Sony, reportedly sinking millions of dollars into Concord, it makes sense that they would try their hardest to redeem this game, even if it seems that the general gaming audience also doesn't care much about whether it ends up saved or not. To be able to salvage a game as big as Concord, Sony would have to invest more money into the project, which, after how the game performed, is just not an option at this point.</p>
<p>In a genre that is already heavily saturated, it makes sense that a premium hero shooter didn't quite hit the mark. When games like Overwatch, Apex Legends, and Valorant exist, there are already plenty of options on the market for players, which begs the question of why would anyone pay for a premium hero shooter when there are free ones that could perform better and are more accessible for a larger audience?</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if Concord will resurface as a free-to-play hero shooter in an attempt to scrape together some of the money that they funneled into the project, but it's uncertain territory right now, especially for Firewalk Studios, who were the developers of the game. It's said that they are bracing for mass layoffs, as Firewalk is one of the more expensive studios owned by Sony. Already, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/concords-director-has-reportedly-stepped-down/">Game Director of Concord</a> has stepped down, so it's possible that more are to follow. With how badly the launch of Concord went, some of the team are even expecting Firewalk to be closed down entirely.</p>
<p>If it goes free to play on Steam and PlayStation, it may just save the game by the skin of its teeth, but no one knows for sure.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monomyth-preview-dungeon-full-of-opportunity</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monomyth-preview-a-dungeon-full-of-opportunity.1006410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monomyth-preview-dungeon-full-of-opportunity<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monomyth</em> is said to be inspired by the likes of old-school dungeon-crawler RPGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a>'s <em>King's Field</em>, along with classic immersive sims such as <em>Arx Fatalis</em>. Those games are a bit before my time, but if they invoke the same feelings of exploration and mystery as <em>Monomyth</em>, I have a couple more items to add to the gaming backlog.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-character.jpg?itok=y4niyLiA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-character.jpg?itok=RgIvnVVo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Choices, choices.</figcaption></figure><h2>Who Will You Be in <em>Monomyth</em>?</h2>
<p>Indeed, if there ever was a game that captured the spirit of exploring an unknown, unfathomable dungeon, <em>Monomyth </em>is a crowning example. If I had to draw an even closer comparison, <em>Monomyth</em> feels like one giant<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/elder-scrolls">Elder Scrolls</a></em> dungeon, though this game is much more robust and open-ended.</p>
<p>This is precisely the reason why I'm excited to see how <em>Monomyth </em>develops throughout its Early Access duration. Strange obelisks, forgotten ruins, and decrepit crypts are the tip of the iceberg in <em>Monomyth</em>, and you'll explore all of these areas with your very own classless character.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-church.jpg?itok=_NADI1yQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-church.jpg?itok=e1bAS-7V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't mind the dagger, Mr. Priest.</figcaption></figure><p>I emphasize classless, as the main character is not necessarily bound to a single archetype. You'll start this adventure by crafting your character, and this is primarily through the allocation of stats. You have RPG standards like strength, dexterity, and intelligence as attributes, but also a selection of skill points to further enhance your build.</p>
<p>Attributes are generally useful all around, but to fine-tune your character as you create them and after each level up, you'll want to allocate points into skill points such as athletics, stealth, speech, archery, types of magic, and more. It's almost a bit overwhelming since you're not entirely sure how effective said points are, but for the sake of the playthrough, I went for a more stealthy character.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-douse.jpg?itok=GBnpg423 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-douse.jpg?itok=W5qBaaxh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even basic magic is possible, like Douse, which will put out open flames. Useful for stealthy types!</figcaption></figure><h2>Diving into the Dungeon of <em>Monomyth</em></h2>
<p>After a brief tutorial segment -- which sees our character get captured, thrown in jail, and escape from said jail in <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fashion-- we're thrown headfirst into <em>Monomyth</em>'s world. So far, at least, it's entirely underground, though this cave system comprises various fortresses, settlements, temples, and more.</p>
<p>There's a plot and objective that propels the player forward, but there's no urgency, and exploration is what <em>Monomyth</em> is all about. Since this is an immersive sim, many elements are interactable. It behooves the player to thoroughly search the area for items. Since I'm the stealthy type, I also specialized in lock picking, allowing me to find even more treasure.</p>
<p>Other immersive sim elements come into play as well; for example, wooden doors can be set on fire with a torch. Even if it's locked, you don't have to waste a lockpick. Just set fire to the door, and it'll fall apart (or just bash it with a weapon). Weapons, however, dull over time, so you'd then have to heat it up at a forge and use a hammer to hone its edge.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-dungeon.jpg?itok=6A_HG_iX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-dungeon.jpg?itok=DQH5iJEi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This area seemed vastly different from the rest, and that's very intriguing to me.</figcaption></figure><p>Certain areas have hidden entrances that are accessible through player ingenuity, so it benefits the player to use a bit of observation and thinking to find various ways into buildings and areas that may seem otherwise inaccessible.</p>
<p>Adding even more to the immersive sim elements, you can even cook your own food. Eating food raw makes you sick, so any fish or raw meat needs to be placed near a fire. I found a bakery in a fortress with raw pies and dough, and seeing them actually cook over time was satisfying.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-combat.jpg?itok=iUmTCRjM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-combat.jpg?itok=np9wXfJT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Genuinely, what did I do to deserve this?</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting For My Life</h2>
<p>This cave is not without peril, however, as enemies and traps wait as I path my way through uncharted territory. Giant rats, Wastelanders (which are these orc-like enemies), and even human thugs are among the enemies you'll fight.</p>
<p>Combat is where <em>Monomyth</em> could use a lot of work. Combat is dull, plain and simple. It amounts to swinging your weapon and dodging and blocking attacks. Since I went for a stealthy build, I had hoped for a stealth attack bonus or something. Getting one free attack unnoticed is all well and good, but some of these enemies are quite tanky and deal an insane amount of damage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-explosive.jpg?itok=xrvMqJKZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-explosive.jpg?itok=SgfhmDif 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I've had enough of dying -- time to break out the explosive barrel.</figcaption></figure><p>Things worked out a bit better once I found a rapier to replace my dagger, but as a game that advertises itself as classless, it should feel like any build is viable. Had I gone for a more magic-focused build, perhaps I would have found more success. By the time I found offensive magic, I was pretty deep into my melee build and it wasn't really viable to restart.</p>
<p>God forbid you come across multiple enemies. You might be lucky and find an explosive on the ground or something, but there's not much a player can do when you're hounded by a bunch of bandits. You could quite easily sneak past tougher enemies with a build like mine, but then there's less experience to be gained since I'm not slaying said enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-town.jpg?itok=g-oUBFUT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-town.jpg?itok=nG4s3fIf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A town full of future possibilities?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Monomyth </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I eventually found my way into a bigger area in what seemed like <em>Monomyth</em>'s first town. There doesn't seem to be a great deal to do here, and interacting with NPCs mostly leads nowhere. I can't help but think the developer, being a one-man operation, bit off more than they can chew in some areas. But when <em>Monomyth</em> works, like in its overall dungeon design, solving various puzzles and finding a powerful piece of loot, it's fantastic.</p>
<p>Throughout its Early Access period, it's my hope that combat is refined to be a bit more exciting and intricate, and that there's more life to its various NPCs and the towns they inhabit. There's already the foundation for a super intriguing, fun adventure with the various hidden areas and puzzles, so if the rest of the game is just as good, I'll be back for more <em>Monomyth</em> soon enough.</p>

<p>The next generation of Nvidia graphics cards are coming in January. According to a new report from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32-gb-rtx-5080-16-gb-rtx-5070-12-gb-ces-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wccftech</a>, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs will be announced at CES 2025 from Las Vegas. </p>



<p>This reveal will include the Nvidia RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070.</p>



<p>In addition to the report of a launch at CES, Wccftech also has information on expected specs for each card. All of the details come from the outlet’s sources, and should be taken with a grain of salt until Insider Gaming can confirm or an official announcement is made.</p>



<p>One of the biggest bits of information from the report is that the RTX 5070 will have fewer cores and SMs than the RTX 4070 Ti. The RTX 4070 Ti has 7,680 CUDA Cores with 60 SMs. If the chip reportedly being used on the RTX 5070 is fully enabled, it can support a max of 6,400 CUDA Cores and 50 SMs. That said, it’s worth noting that they are different generation graphics cards. Until we can actual test out they perform, it’s unknown how much of a difference there will be in performance.</p>

            <p>
That great disturbance in the Force you just felt wasn't a million voices crying out in terror. It was, in fact, me crying out in terror a million times. You see, Aspyr have just announced that they're porting Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles to PC and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2443630/Star_Wars_Episode_I_Jedi_Power_Battles/">Steam</a>. I have a complicated relationship  with Jedi Power Battles, in the sense that I think I still have scars on my thumbs from when I played it all night on a busted PS1 controller. I have bled for this game. I'd close my eyes after each six-hours session and see fields of lightsabers flickering and dancing like luminous leeches, chasing me through the Dagobahnian jungles of my dreams.

<p>
Jedi Power Battles isn't even all that amazing. Originally published in 2000, it just happened to come along at a time when myself and a friend were obsessed with Jedi Knights and the seven lightsaber duelling forms. It was an atrocious period in my life, nestled squarely between my liverish career as a Trekkie and my later, more forgiveable spell in the labyrinths of Tolkien and Warhammer. I had a dedicated Jedi name, I think. Evaed Paleee? It is very important that I don't remember this era in great detail, so I'll be watching the below PC port trailer through squinting eyes and parted fingers. Here you go:

<p>
A quick overview: Jedi Power Battles is a scenic, fairly punishing 3D platformer-brawler that follows the events of the Phantom Menace movie, except that I don't remember Liam Neeson tumbling into pits quite so regularly, or Ewan McGregor being unable to hack through a Pilot Droid's forearms, or Samuel L Jackson getting launched by a little green man. The best thing about it is that you get a bunch of nicely animated Jedi movesets to, as the case may be, argue about till 3am, at which point it belatedly occurs to you that you've never been kissed in your whole adolescent life, and that your bedroom smells of mortality.
</p><p>
What are Aspyr doing with it all? Well, you can expect a choice of modern or classic controls, secret areas unlocked from the start, Vaselined visuals, cute flourishes such as Big Head mode, and a total of 13 returning and newly playable characters, including the Rifle Droid and Tusken Raider. It's out 23rd January. Here's hoping they give it a bit more time than they did the recent Battlefront port, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-devs-working-to-address-bugs-following-disastrous-launch">a planet-sized shambles</a>.
</p>
<p>If you're thirsty for more of my midlife regret, or want my ill-informed take on movie choreography, I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jedi-power-battles-and-the-legacy-of-the-phantom-menace">went long for Eurogamer about JPB</a> a year or so back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But those combing through the website were able to garner some additional info about the mysterious test. </p><p>According to dataminer OatmealDome, downloads for the special software would start the week of October 21 with the test going live on October 23. Users need at least 2.2GB free on their Switch’s internal storage. “Nintendo also recommends using TV mode and a wired connection during the test,” OatmealDome added.</p><p>That last part might be the most telling, and it has some fans thinking this might be a test for a new cloud streaming feature. That would explain why a wired connection is recommended and why users must have active Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscriptions. Presumably, if there was a cloud streaming feature, it would be paywalled behind that $50 a year membership. Or perhaps Nintendo would even use it to raise the price. Streaming could be used to play newer games that the Switch isn’t natively powerful enough to run, or even facilitate retro emulation for devices like the GameCube or Nintendo DS. </p><p>There have already been streaming experiments on Switch, though <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/17gqluf/resident_evil_2_cloud_trash/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/17gqluf/resident_evil_2_cloud_trash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they’ve rarely gone well</a></span>. The <em>Kingdom Hearts 1 </em>and <em>2</em> remasters, for example, are only available on Nintendo’s device via streaming, as is the <em>Resident Evil 2</em> remake. It’s possible the new software might aim to remedy those shortcomings, or be part of a third-party partnership. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1693868974033756457?t=4b1Tmt1BioYa0xk6CTzchA&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1693868974033756457?t=4b1Tmt1BioYa0xk6CTzchA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft has the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games over Ubisoft+</a></span> as part of the Microsoft acquisition.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-diablo-4-difficulty-levels/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The difficulty tiers are one of the most significant changes you’ll find going into the most recent season of Diablo IV. There are no longer World Tiers; instead, Blizzard took a step back and reintroduced the Torment system from Diablo 3. It’s straightforward enough on the surface, but you’ll soon find the game proves more challenging than ever before. Here’s what you need to know about the new Diablo 4 difficulty levels when creating a character in Season 6!</p>



<h2 id="h-an-overview-of-the-diablo-4-difficulty-levels">An Overview of the Diablo 4 Difficulty Levels</h2>



<p>Instead of jumping through World Tiers 1-4, Diablo 4 offers eight difficulty levels ranging from Normal to Torment IV. The higher up the scale you go, the better the rewards, but the more challenging the enemies. On Torment difficulty, the ARPG will challenge you, requiring you to prioritize proper build and gear planning.</p>



<h3 id="h-normal">Normal</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Default</li>



<li>Standard difficulty setting with baseline EXP and gold drops.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-hard">Hard</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Default</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 75% more Experience</li>



<li>Monsters drop 75% more Gold</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-expert">Expert</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Complete the Prologue</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 125% more Experience</li>



<li>Monsters drop 125% more Gold</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-penitent">Penitent</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Complete the original story campaign</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 175% more Experience</li>



<li>Monsters drop 175% more Gold</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-i">Torment I</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 20 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 300% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Ancestral items drop</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armor reduced by 250</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 25%</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-ii">Torment II</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 35 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 400% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armor reduced by 500</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 50%</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-iii">Torment III</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 50 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 500% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armored reduced by 750</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 75%</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-iv">Torment IV</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 65 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 600% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armored reduced by 1000</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 100%</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-torment-difficulties-in-diablo-4">How to Unlock Torment Difficulties in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>As mentioned briefly above, you can unlock the new Torment difficulties in Diablo 4 by progressing through the game until you reach the new max level of 60. From there, open up The Pit and progress deeper into the end-game mechanic until you reach Tier 65. Once you hit this point, you’ll unlock all Torment difficulties. </p>



<p>You only need to reach Tier 20 to unlock Torment I, though!</p>

Sign-ups went live on Thursday morning and the playtest quickly filled up. Now fans have to wait 10 days to learn what this program is all about.</p><p>Speculation around the program is already running, with some jokingly (?) suggesting that it might be an Arms 2 playtest or the <a href="https://x.com/juneybee03/status/1844147115448242359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">return of the Miiverse</a>. Others wondered if it might have something to do with Nintendo Switch Online retro games, such as the release of GameCube games on the service.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/07/01/miiverse0724131280jpg-e930671280wjpg-9c6bd4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Could the Miiverse be making a comeback? It's just one of many theories being generated by fans right now.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"I want to believe Miiverse could be coming back. Limited numbers, different language regions, could definately be a test for moderation strategy etc.," journalist <a href="https://x.com/LaurakBuzz/status/1844396508650897829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Kate Dale wrote on X/Twitter</a>. "Test now, make it a launch day Switch 2 feature. Bring it back Nintendo!"</p><p>For those who don't recall, the Miiverse is a defunct service introduced on the Wii U. It was much-loved for the wholesome creativity that it generated from fans as well as its various online hooks. The service <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/29/nintendo-miiverse-to-shut-down-in-november">officially went offline in 2017</a>.</p><h2>What we know about the Nintendo Switch Online playtest</h2><p>Here's what we do know: Playest users must have have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership as of October 9. They must be 18 years of age or older, and they have to be registered in Japan, the U.S., the UK, France, Germany, Italy, or Spain. The test download is 2.2GB.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want to believe Miiverse could be coming back</p></div><p>Crucially, Nintendo appears to want players to play docked and with a strong Internet connection. This is leading some fans to theorize that Nintendo is testing a cloud-based streaming service for Switch games, similar to the kind offered by Xbox, PlayStation, and Nvidia.</p><p>As for whether it's Switch 2 related, the playtest <em>does </em>take place on the anniversary of the Nintendo Switch reveal on October 20, 2016. But with Nintendo's next-gen console still remaining elusive despite heavy rumors of an October reveal, we have to take pretty much every rumor to do with the Switch 2 with a grain of salt at the moment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"Feels like if it was a thing for something known. There is not much reason to keep it as just 'new feature' or NSO," one fan speculated on <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-program-begins-oct-23-6-pm-pst-expansion-pack-tier-only-%E2%80%94-tl-dr-in-thread.11282/page-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Famiboards</a>. "They’d probably just say it publicly like other stress test announcements in the past. It’s probably something new, but could range from really unexciting to something pretty hype that Nintendo announces in the week following the application closure."</p><p>One way or another, Nintendo fans will just have to sit tight and wait until the playtest kicks off on October 20. Maybe they can set the time on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-latest-in-long-line-of-weird-nintendo-hardware-some-failed-hard">their new Alarmo</a>.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sand-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If stomping your way across the desert on a giant, leggy, weaponized platform with a few of your best friends sounds like a good time, have I got a game for you. Especially if along the way you want to explore a ruined world, scavenge wrecks and ruins, take pot shots at other scavengers, and get in a few knock-down drag-out landship brawls with hostile crews with their own custom-built Trampler mechs.</p><p>That's just what goes down in Sand, an upcoming PvPvE survival shooter where you and your crew want to get down to the planet Sophie, get the goods while exploring the surface, and get out—hopefully making a profit in the process. The world is an alternate history before World War 1, so your gear and the world is all this riveted industrial stuff from the age of iron-clad dreadnoughts, old western revolver-rifles, trousers with suspenders, and some absolutely legendary facial hair. I was able to sit down and try a PvP only test build of Sand with some of the developers, showing off a game that has a clear design vision I think will really resonate with some gamers.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Sand Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Taking a bold note from more crafting-heavy games like Rust, or from or map-based games like Sea of Thieves, Sand has a slower pace of events. Your Trampler can be pretty fast, depending on how you outfit it, but it still moves and turns like a great stomping ship. Spotting enemies in the distance by their smoke plume is one thing, but your pilot has to do a good job maneuvering and it always helps to have a navigator plotting the course. That's not to mention your real purpose for hitting the surface: loot. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Trampler battles are also slower-paced. It's a challenge just lining up targets as the gait of your mech throws off aim and the rolling dunes present a constant challenge in just getting a good  line of sight. </p></div><p>Shipwrecks and island towns litter the once-wet surface of planet Sophie, any of which could have the find that lets you strike it rich. Or the ammo and power cores that keep your ship going for another round of searches. Or the weapons and gear that outfit your crew for a boarding action against another ship that was more successful in finding riches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>To get all that done you have to take a more methodical approach, and the controls reflect that. You can carry very little loot on your person before you need to find a container to hold it in instead, for example. You always have to aim before firing a weapon, which I found really helped differentiate the size and purpose difference between the pistol, revolver-rifle, and sniper rifle I found on the surface. (I found shotgun shells too…but no shotgun.) </p><p>Trampler battles are also slower-paced. It's a challenge just lining up targets as the gait of your mech throws off aim and the rolling dunes present a constant challenge in just getting a good  line of sight. Other Tramplers take a lot of hits from a cannon to go down, requiring you to destroy their engine room for real takedown—which depending on how good a shot you are might take more shells than you brought with you or found on the surface. But it's either that or board the enemy Trampler, kill the crew, and capture their helm to make it your own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With that much work and risk in a Trampler-on-Trampler brawl, you need to be sure it's worth it—because there's a real sting in spending ten or fifteen minutes chasing someone down to realize they just didn't have anything worth stealing. Not to mention the circumstance I can foresee players dreading the most: when a fight starts and the other salvage crews start circling like vultures to pick off whoever survives. That's a scenario I saw more than once through my binoculars.</p><p>Not for my crew, though! We had a giant Trampler to stomp around in, a ramshackle monster that the developers assured me was not something you can build with starting resources. And build it you do. A pretty robust, in-depth system of Trampler design lets you place sleeping compartments, the helm, storage facilities, the engines, decks, more engines, fighting balconies, fighting emplacements, and guns all over these things. You can even do cool stuff like customize where doors and hatches are located to make your ship a maze that enemies will struggle to invade. All of that takes resources you've gathered on the planet below and that you're—at least somewhat—risking when you take down your new steel behemoth for another run.</p><p>Which is something I already know I'll find myself doing whenever I next get my hands on Sand.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">In 2022, Color Gray Studio and Playstack dropped The Case Of The Golden Idol--a point-and-click investigation game centered around the titular gilded totem--and it quickly became a smash hit. Now, after announcing the follow-up at last year's The Game Awards, Color Gray and Playstack have confirmed that The Rise Of The Golden Idol will launch on November 12, while a new demo is available on Steam today.</p><p dir="ltr">The Rise Of The Golden Idol continues the story of the cursed curio, as it takes place in the 1970s--300 years after the Cloudsley family's exploits in the first game. The new story follows a relic hunter who has heard stories about the Golden Idol, and they've decided to seek out the ancient artifact for themselves.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Blizzard Entertainment was reportedly toiling away on a mobile version of Overwatch in the past, though it's unknown whether the project is still in active development. A new book about the acclaimed developer--titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Play-Nice-Future-Blizzard-Entertainment/dp/1538725428?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a>--drops the little nugget of info about the hero-shooter series.</p><p dir="ltr">In the book, author Jason Schreier references an Overwatch mobile project when talking about Walter Kong. Here is the passage from Play Nice: "Overwatch was led by Walter Kong, who oversaw the release of regular heroes and content for Overwatch 2 as well as new projects, like a mobile version of the franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">There has been no official comment on a mobile edition of the Overwatch franchise. Overwatch 2 launched last year as a free-to-play game for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. The title offers cross-platform play, so it's possible a mobile project would be the same experience but for smartphones and tablets, or it could be something completely different, if it still exists at all.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="567225701" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-further-delayed-to-march-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1844377892303798752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new statement posted on X</a>, developer Sports Interactive has made the difficult decision to delay Football Manager 25. This isn't the first delay the game has experienced, as the game was originally set to release in September, but after an update that was posted on the Football Manager website, they announced that they needed more time to work on the game. Unfortunately, those who were excited to jump into the new era of Football Manager will have to wait a little bit longer. The title has now been delayed once more, and the game is now set to release in March 2025.</p>
<p>Football Manager 2024 was a massive game for the company and was one of the most groundbreaking titles released by Sports Interactive. However, it seems that they've now got stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to meet the deadline to appease the football fans. However, the fans in the comments on the statement are not happy at all and are coming at them with total aggression. A lot of the comments are telling the developers to skip working on Football Manager 25 entirely and move on to FM26. Which, realistically, what is stopping Sports Interactive from saying that Football Manager 25 is Football Manager 26 after making some tweaks?</p>
<p>Tempers are rising, with most saying to scrap the game as there is "no point in releasing it at the end of the season." For the vast majority, Sports Interactive has had a monopoly on this particular genre of sports gaming, with FIFA being a strong competitor in the football gaming scene. However, when it comes to combining football with a management sim, no one does it quite like Sports Interactive does.</p>
<p>In their statement, they mention, "Following discussions with Sega, our licensors, and partners, we have agreed the best course of action is to delay the launch until March 2025... This additional time has not been sufficient to ensure the game quality and experience meet your expectations and our very high standards."</p>
<p>While most Football Manager games are a <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-xbox-game-pass-positive-football-manager-head-says/">huge financial success</a> for Sports Interactive, they are not the only company that is suffering during this time in the games industry. Companies that you wouldn't expect to are having difficulties, with layoffs being a disappointing constant at this point in time, alongside many games either being scrapped or delayed. At this point, it's uncertain whether there will be any development or release issues with Football Manager 26 or whether they will just skip a season due to timelines being too tight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sunderfolk-a-tactical-co-op-adventure-game-inspired-by-tabletop-rpgs-is-dreamhavens-first-internal-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, multi-studio developer Dreamhaven, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dreamhaven-studio-blizzard-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> four years ago by former Blizzard boss Mike Morhaime, announced its first internal game, Sunderfolk. It's a tactical cooperative adventure game inspired by tabletop roleplaying games and set in a fantasy world made by Dreamhaven's Secret Door team.</p>
<p>Sunderfolk features an unfolding narrative that will take adventurers on a quest through the Sunderlands, starting in Arden, their idyllic home village, which they've been recruited to save. As they battle their way through the mines, wilds, and labyrinths of the game's fictional world, players will meet colorful characters, discover hidden secrets, and develop new cooperative strategies to defeat their enemies. One of the twists of Sunderfolk is that each player can use their phone or tablet to control their character during a session that can be either local (couch co-op is fully supported) or online.</p>
<p>Chris Sigaty, Secret Door's studio head, said:</p>
<p><em>We have a bunch of dedicated board and tabletop game fanatics on the team at Secret Door—getting together for game night has been a regular highlight for many of us going back years and years. As developers we also like to look at what inspires us and think about how to make those types of experiences easier to get into, so that more people can enjoy them as much as we do. With Sunderfolk, we’re excited to offer players a game that’s easy to pick up and play, while still challenging to master, and we can’t wait to share it with the world.</em></p>
<p>Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Dreamhaven, added:</p>
<p><em>The team at Secret Door, and really all of us at Dreamhaven, are all about bringing players together around fun experiences. Sunderfolk is a beautiful game, it’s full of personality and charm, and it also creates epic moments where everyone is engaging directly with each other to work out strategies or celebrate victories. There’s nothing quite like it, and we’re really looking forward to seeing what players think.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Sunderfolk | A New Way to Play" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fBOhgqT3Q78?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sunderfolk features six different heroes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, Rogue), each with their own strategic role and passive abilities. Players can customize them and equip them with weapons, armor, items, and skills as they level up. In battle, players must strategize positioning and turn order, selecting from their deck of Skill Cards to perform moves, attacks, and use items. Luck is also a factor, with Fate Cards played each turn that can affect their effectiveness. As missions are completed, players gain experience and rewards, gradually unlocking ways to customize their decks. After the missions, players will return to Arden, the party's base of operations, to upgrade merchants for new items and equipment&nbsp;and befriend the townspeople for rewards.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when Sunderfolk is released at some point next year on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2414270/Sunderfolk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010574" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch, only one copy of the game (which is a premium title with TBD pricing) will be required to start a four-player session, clearly an attempt to incentivize non-hardcore gamers to try it.</p>
<p>Progress from one session will carry over to the next (tied to the host's game), so groups can pick up where they left off without having to start over. If a party member is unable to make a session or has to leave early, the host can choose to take control of that person's Hero so that the Hero is ready to continue the quest when the person returns.</p>
<p>Similarly, if one or two players miss a session, the remaining players can continue the adventure without any problems. When the missing players return, they'll gain the same level (and corresponding Skill Cards) as the rest of the party, but they'll lose any gold and other items collected during the missed missions. (However, players can trade gold and items with each other while in town, so the loot from all missions can eventually be distributed however the players wish.<br>
players choose).</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-pc-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-pc-in-october/">coming to PC</a> after 14 years, and there’s finally a posted price for players. </p>



<p>According to the store pages for the game on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/red-dead-redemption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668510/Red_Dead_Redemption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Read Dead Redemption will cost $50. That price puts it at the same for the Nintendo Switch version of the game.</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption on PC features the base game along with the Undead Nightmare DLC. There are new updates for the game, however, including native 4K resolution at 144Hz, Ultrawide and Super Ultrawide support, HDR10, and full mouse and keyboard functionality.  In addition to that, there will be support for AMD FSR 3.0 and Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>What it won’t include, however, is any multiplayer component. The remaster is the single-player experience, only.</p>



<p>If you are looking at picking up the game on PC, you won’t need the most powerful system to play. According to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements</a>, the minimum required is an Intel Core  i5-1670 or  AMD FX-9590 and an Nvidia GTX 960 or AMD Radeon R7 360.</p>



<p>What do you think of the $50 price point for Red Dead Redemption on PC? Let us know in the comments and in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/read-dead-redemption-pc-price-has-been-revealed.895/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums.</a> </p>

			<p>It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-thursday-adds-22-games-to-october-lineup-including-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">GFN Thursday</a>, which means there are new games being added to the ever-growing catalog on GeForce NOW. This time, the update comes with something a bit more important than just games, as Game Sync has finally been added for Battle.net accounts. Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox, and Ubisoft Connect stores already have game library sync, and Battle.net is one of the last to join the roster on that front. This GeForce NOW Thursday sees the addition of Diablo IV's Vessel of Hatred DLC to the cloud, meaning members of GeForce NOW will be able to stream it without having to wait to download the game. Those who are Ultimate members will be able to play the game at up to 4k and 120 FPS.</p>
<p>Having your client accounts linked to GeForce NOW means that the gaming experience will be more seamless than ever. It allows for "plug and play" activity, meaning that you'll be able to stream some of the most current and popular games out there right now on a top-notch rig without worrying that it's going to cause your low-tier rig to combust into flames by running in 4k. By now, adding Battle.net to the mix means that all of your games will be more accessible than ever, and you will have the potential to play the games on a variety of devices, including your phone and TV.</p>
<p>Those who own the game through Battle.net will no longer have to worry about their games not syncing up to GeForce NOW, as the update for Blizzard games will officially be rolling out to members this week. Along with the addition of Diablo IV's long-awaited expansion, there are six new games for members to stream, with plenty more games to come over the next couple of weeks to see out October. Here are all of the games that you can expect to see on the Geforce NOW client, available to stream from a powerful rig, with the player getting to choose how long their gaming sessions are via the tier of their subscription.</p>
<p>Below is the list of all of the games that are being released this week and will be available for members to stream as soon as they are released on the platform mentioned.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/timberborn-update-6-adds-full-3d-water-physics-mod-support-and-more.1006257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Mechanistry has released&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>Update 6, which introduces a number of major new features to the beaver city-builder, including new water physics, official mod support, and more.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a string of major updates for&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>since its Early Access release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week">back in September 2021</a>, with other big major updates adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-timberborn-update-adds-infinite-metal-and-more">infinite metal</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-adds-robot-beaver-workers-and-more">robot beaver workers</a> (yes, really), and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-4-brings-new-map-faction-changes-and-more">new maps</a>.</p>
<p>The first big new feature in Update 6 is a new 3D water physics system, which replaces Mechanistry's "cleverly designed 2.5-dimensional system". You can now run layers of fluids on top of one another, over buildings, and more. That's right: you can finally build&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>aqueducts if you wish.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/timberborn-update-6-water-physics.jpg?itok=kzm3HyTQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/timberborn-update-6-water-physics.jpg?itok=oLm_J2Lg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Timberborn</em>'s new water physics open up a range of possibilities.</figcaption></figure><p>This new water physics system introduces a range of other possibilities to&nbsp;<em>Timberborn</em>, including new automated sluice gates, new metal platforms with overhangs, and more. You can also look forward to new vertical power shaft buildings to add efficiency to your colony.</p>
<p>Since many&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>players have been requesting more concrete endgame objectives for the game, Mechanistry has introduced Wonders, which are advanced structures you can work towards in order to "complete" your run if you want to.</p>
<p>Once a wonder has been constructed, you can change where you start for future runs on a map as well, giving you a little more flexibility in terms of how your next&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>game goes.</p>
<p>Another major feature that's been added in&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>Update 6 is official mod support; you can now download and run&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>mods via the Steam Workshop, which should make changing up your game that much easier.</p>

<p>If you want to see everything that's new, you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>Update 6 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1062090/view/4617965876718311948" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes right here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062090/Timberborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. It previously cost $24.99, but starting from October 24th, it'll be getting a $10 price increase to $34.99. Bear that in mind if you've been looking to pick it up.</p>
