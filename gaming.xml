            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22948034/steam-deck-best-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="AEA9fw">Since it launched in 2022, the Steam Deck has quickly amassed a reputation as one of the best, if not <em>the</em> best, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22949326/steam-deckreview-pc-gaming-portable">handheld gaming platforms</a> on the market today— especially when considering the benefits of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23950861/steam-deck-oled-review-valve-handheld-gaming">OLED version</a>.</p>
<p id="DNMol4">With a library of games spanning much of Steam’s vast storefront, a docking station to play games on TV and monitors, and an increasing number of titles being optimized and verified for the Deck every day, Valve’s proprietary handheld is a perfect example of the viability and promise of portable PC gaming. That’s why we’ve collected 26 titles that showcase what makes the Steam Deck so special.</p>
<p id="C3O5cs">To curate the list, we’ve pick games that benefit the most from the Steam Deck’s special features. You will find PC exclusives, Switch games that benefit here from faster load times, and games that break apart nicely into short sessions.</p>
<p id="nnkfX6">Don’t expect to see some presumed contenders on the list. Not every game is compatible with the Steam Deck, nor is every genre a perfect match — we’re looking at you, RTS games. And for now, this list also excludes emulation and cloud streaming.</p>
<p id="JvJsjU">We intentionally limit our lists to avoid overwhelming readers, so be sure to share your personal picks that didn’t make the cut in the comments.</p>
<p id="y7hgpe">Our latest update added <em>Animal Well</em>,<em> I Was a Teenage Exocolonist</em>, and <em>Stardew Valley</em>.</p>

<p id="roHVqx">For at least a few of the games on this list — like, say, <em>Elden Ring</em> — you’re going to mess with the game’s settings on Steam Deck in order to make sure you’ve got a decent frame rate and the game feels good to play. Not a concern at all for <em>Animal Well</em>, a pixel-art masterpiece that feels like it could’ve been at home on the Game Boy. With a file size of just 33 MB, it sure won’t take long to install, either. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch"><em>Animal Well</em></a> packs quite a bit of mystery and time-intensive puzzle-solving into its very small package. What starts off as a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24156522/animal-well-metroidvania-not">compelling Metroidvania</a> soon spirals into an extensive Easter egg hunt with items hidden behind delightfully esoteric clues. You may as well play it on the go, since it’s going to take over your brain for a while and you’re carrying that around with you already. —<em>Maddy Myers</em></p>

<p id="3m0Q9F">Last weekend, on a whim, I booted up <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/6/11372562/hyper-light-drifter-review-PC"><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em></a> on my Steam Deck for the first time since playing it back in 2016. Nine hours later, I finally managed to wrest myself from the siren-like call of its pixelated tableaus, blistering combat, and melancholic score, having completed it again and earned the game’s secret ending. Such is the magnetic appeal and power of Heart Machine’s debut even eight years after its release. </p>
<p id="avpNKH">Game director Alx Preston and co. set out to create a 16-bit action-RPG that channeled the very best elements of the Legend of Zelda and Diablo series, with a story not so much told as it is <em>felt</em> through its dialogue-less cutscenes that play out as if they were fugue-like visions of some doomed alternate universe. <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> achieved all of that and more, coalescing into an action-RPG that stands the test of time. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="V83Pck">The Yakuza series spans hundreds of hours across seven mainline entries, along with a handful of spinoffs. Which is to say, the portable Steam Deck provides the best chance at seeing the entirety of this Japanese gangster epic, especially in the form of short missions on lunch breaks. If you don’t have time for every game, or just need a place to start, we recommend <em>Yakuza 0</em>. A sort of prequel to the series, the adventure takes place in 1980s Japan and provides lots of colorful backstories. Don’t be fooled by all of the violent combat and seedy locales; this series (and especially this entry) has more heart and joy than 99% of games from big-budget publishers. Hero Kazuma Kiryu wants to make the world a better place, one city block at a time. <em>—Chris Plante</em></p>

<p id="A6HQqi">There are few mobile gaming experiences as serene and enthralling as <em>Dave the Diver</em>. Dave dives not just to collect fish and cooking materials for the sushi restaurant he staffs every night, but to uncover ancient secrets. Regardless of your objective, navigating the deep feels like a blend between Animal Crossing and a roguelike, where you’re amassing better tools to uncover what (and who) is lurking in the depths.</p>
<p id="3F6uT6"><em>Dave the Diver</em> is a family-friendly game (if you can look past small clouds of blood when you harpoon a fish) that is startlingly good at blending many game genres in one. You swim; manage a restaurant; farm fish, veggies and more; and are solely responsible for reversing a climate change-inducing threat under the sea. And on the Steam Deck, it’s so much easier to fit in just one more dive session. <em>—Cameron Faulkner</em></p>

<p id="5ET32I">You might not expect <em>Dredge</em> to feel at home on the Steam Deck at first glance, but it totally does. This haunted seafaring adventure tests the protagonist’s psyche, and the gameplay loop is perfect for quick pick-up, put-down sessions. Not to mention, it’s a lot of fun being set free to fish, solve mysteries, and complete objectives before the sun goes down. And if you dare, dredge the depths after dark for some spooky surprises. <em>—CF</em></p>

<p id="v7f9wX">Part coming-of-age visual novel, part exploration-heavy sci-fi RPG, part poker-esque card game, <em>I Was a Teenage Exocolonist </em>is a brilliantly captivating game that you’ll want to play again and again (and again). You take on the role of a young kid in Earth’s first planetary colony, and follow their life on a strange new alien planet over the course of 10 years. Every activity you pick impacts your personal journey and the relationships you make — and also plays a huge role in the future of the planet.</p>
<p id="ktqmtE">What really makes <em>I Was a Teenage Exocolonist</em> so compelling is the replayability — finishing a playthrough gives you knowledge that you take through to the next, allowing you to make different (and possibly better!) decisions. For instance, there’s a character who dies very early on in the first playthrough that can’t be saved at all. Their death haunts that first run.</p>
<p id="cOL6tF">But in the second one, you can save them because you have a hunch as to how things will go. It’s a game that invites you to play through another round and another and another — just to see if you can get it <em>all</em> right this time (or make things go horribly wrong! Or crack the secret as to <em>why</em> you’re living these lives over and over again!). —<em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="wvPtwU">My love for the Star Fox series has evaporated with each new entry, to the point that I began to wonder if I ever really enjoyed those games or if I just liked chunky ’90s 3D graphics. <em>Ex-Zodiac</em>’s creators have done what Nintendo couldn’t for the past couple of decades: bottle the original magic of the space flight franchise and add just enough tweaks to make the adventure palatable for our collective evolved tastes. (Hey, video games have come a long way since the SNES!) Developer MNKY also created bonus levels inspired by other retro classics, like <em>Space Harrier</em>, emphasizing its knack for refueling once exciting genres that have spent way too long collecting dust in the garage. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="UL9oUd">Stray is a game about being a cat. You don’t talk like Garfield or wink at the camera like Bubsy. You stretch, scratch, and occasionally leap between ledges at perilous heights. Your cat participates in a harrowing adventure set in a dystopian, cyberpunk underworld in which robots echo the lives of their long-dead human counterparts. But most engagement happens on your behalf through an adorable, English-speaking, artificially intelligent drone named B-12. The game’s creators keep your cat’s direct involvement ambiguous. Is the cat the savior of a dying planet? Or is the cat just a cat who happens to be the incidental shepherd of historic change? Like I said, typical cat stuff. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="6DRNT1">There’s a reason <em>Stardew Valley</em> is still so beloved after eight years: It’s just damn good. The latest big update adds so much to the already robust game, fleshing out Pelican Town and its inhabitants. It’s not just farming, but mining, fishing, foraging, and getting to know all the townspeople (and possibly marrying them). Rebuild your little community and get really invested in perfecting your farm’s layout! Or travel to the deepest, darkest levels of the mines. Or just spend a <em>lot</em> of time fishing.</p>
<p id="pWmA3u">There’s just <em>so</em> much to do in <em>Stardew Valley</em>. It’s clear to see why this game revitalized the farming sim genre and why every farming sim these days wants to be just like it (with a twist). —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="jzABe1">I am proud of the work we do at Polygon, but every publication has its weaknesses. I’ve accepted that we’re not the go-to experts for old-school side-scrolling shooters and shmups. That honor goes to our pals at Eurogamer, specifically Martin Robinson, who I trust more with this genre than I do any pundit with American politics. When he proclaimed <em>Drainus</em> is “<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drainus-review-the-most-spectacular-side-scrolling-shooter-since-gradius-5">the most spectacular side-scrolling shooter since <em>Gradius 5</em></a>,” I had to give it a try. Is it the best? I said I’m not an expert. But I can say, with confidence, it’s been a blast on Steam Deck, a delicious digestif after hours in a modern open-world game, and an unusually accommodating entry point for a notoriously impenetrable genre. <em>—CP</em></p>

I mean, I could write more reasons you should play this game, but let’s be real — either you have played a version of <em>Final Fantasy 7</em> already or you’ve been told countless times to bump this one up your queue.

<p id="BSR44u">Meet the Steam Deck’s killer app. It’s not perfect — I play on low settings and occasionally experience frame rate dips — but <em>Elden Ring</em> works, and that’s all I need to farm souls (er, “runes”) in FromSoftware’s open-world expansion of its Dark Souls formula. This is <em>the game</em> that has kept me awake past midnight. I promise myself that I’ll stop once I see what’s at the end of a moss-lined cave or over a burning horizon, but then I see some new curiosity, and suddenly, I’m pummeling my way through another dungeon. The convenience of a portable device turns what I meant to be a 15-minute grind session into a two-hour journey through a labyrinthine dungeon. <em>—CP</em></p>

Now prepare to burn dozens of hours on a $2.99 2D dungeon crawler that nearly plays itself. <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is the unholy union of clickers, roguelikes, and Gauntlet. Runs take 10-30 minutes and pair well with an audiobook or podcast. The developers have discovered the formula for a perfect portable game, but for the time being, you can’t find this one on Switch or smartphones. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="PuQG0N"><em>Jusant</em> has been my go-to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23843388/jusant-dont-nod-climbing-preview">chill-out game of choice</a> this year, and I can’t imagine playing it on anything other than the Steam Deck. The post-apocalyptic fantasy climbing game from French developer Don’t Nod (<em>Life Is Strange</em>) has a lot going for it: a mysterious and compelling world with beautiful art design, a moving orchestral music score, and tight controls that are easy to learn and gratifying to master.</p>
<p id="klLxrw">It’s that last point that makes the Steam Deck my preferred platform of choice to play <em>Jusant</em>. The satisfying sound and haptic feedback of the Deck’s left and right triggers makes the challenge of climbing the cliff faces of the game’s impossibly vast and looming tower as painless and pleasing as possible, and the visual and sound quality of the Deck is terrific at rendering the gorgeous vistas and ambient soundscapes of the world. If you’re looking for a relaxing yet exciting adventure game experience that plays great on the Steam Deck, this is the one to play. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="ySyznG">The best place to play <em>Dragon Quest 11</em> has changed over the years. The JRPG to end all JRPGs first launched in 2018 on Steam and PlayStation 4, only to be bested a year later by a Definitive Edition for Nintendo Switch, which included additional content and could be played on the go. The Definitive Edition then came to Steam in 2020, but, of course, it lacked the portability of the Switch version, forcing players to choose between visuals and convenience. With the Steam Deck, folks can now have it both ways. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="eDIVXL">My blurb for Polygon’s best games of the 2010s applies to why <em>Nier: Automata</em> belongs on every Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote><p id="1pk1He"><em>Nier: Automata</em> is the game I most often find myself wanting to play instead of the many fine-but-forgettable shooters and open-world distractions that land on my desk. I think about it every week partly because its soundtrack is my favorite writing music, partly because its toys litter my desk, and mostly because it’s just that good. Yes, you have to beat it five times, but in hindsight, I wish I had a reason to play it another five hundred. <em>—CP</em></p></blockquote>

<p id="iHoi7a">You assume the role of multiple characters, who are all trying to survive a supernatural cataclysm that’s out for everyone’s soul. The story is told to make you care about each one of them, not knowing who’s about to bite the dust at the next turn of events. <em>—CF</em></p>

<p id="jpMBws">In 2009, Volition created an open-world terrorism simulator set on Mars. With a hammer and construction-grade explosives, a bald space bro destroys landmarks, government office complexes, and mining facilities piece by piece. Where its open-world peers focused on realism and narrative, Red Faction emphasized chaotic fun. Publisher THQ planned to convert Red Faction into a “transmedia” property, but little materialized beyond a mediocre sequel and a made-for-TV movie. The closest we’ve seen to a spiritual sequel is 2020’s <em>Teardown</em>, an indie heist game that invites players to bust through buildings made of chunky voxels. Speaking of, I should install <em>Teardown</em> on my Steam Deck. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="6fg5fq"><em>Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</em> and <em>Zero Escape: Virtue’s Last Reward </em>were two of the most beloved visual novels on the Nintendo DS, 3DS, and PlayStation Vita. Unfortunately, Nintendo and Sony no longer support the DS and Vita online shops, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22937165/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-eshop-closing-date-virtual-console">the 3DS online storefront will close in 2023</a>.

<p id="nTmKwr"><em>Spelunky HD</em> kept my PlayStation Vita within arm’s reach long after Sony gave up on the cult handheld. Last year, developer Mossmouth ported <em>Spelunky </em>and its sequel to the Nintendo Switch — and I finally moved my Vita into its long-term home in my storage bin of gaming artifacts. I won’t say the Steam Deck is a better home for Spelunky than the Switch, just that it’s another portable home. And any portable that can play Spelunky should play Spelunky. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="qcj2R6"><em>Wildermyth</em> made <a href="https://www.polygon.com/c/22796149/50-best-video-games-of-2021-polygon-goty">Polygon’s top 10 games of 2021</a> list by reimagining the D&amp;D experience without the need for a part-time Dungeon Master. The combat is clever enough (your magic can convert any object into a deadly weapon), but I especially cherish its creator’s dedication to characters. Party members find lovers and nemeses, they acquire weapons and battle scars, they age and eventually die. Quests are broken into 10- to 15-minute episodes of story and combat, ideal for filling any gaps in your day. The controls on Steam Deck do take a little practice, but the game has benefited from an active community of modders and storytellers, so I wouldn’t be surprised if we see improved user-made control settings soon. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="6L1b4w">In 2004,<em> Half-Life 2</em> helped launch Steam, attracting thousands of players to Valve’s then-unproven video game ecosystem. In return for joining Steam, players could download a first-person shooter that was far ahead of its time. Today, <em>Half-Life 2</em> (and its pair of supplemental episodes) works as another example of Valve’s magic. I installed a PC game I bought nearly 20 years ago onto a portable computer, and it only took a few minutes to enter the streets of City 17. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="S6GQJU">What if Hideo Kojima made his magnum opus, but most people wrote it off as a tedious walking simulator? Reader, it happened! <em>Death Stranding</em> is my personal game of the decade, an astounding mishmash of everything to appear in a Kojima game: earnest critiques of capitalism and the pain points of democracy, eerie premonitions of global pandemics and a gig economy forced to carry society on its shoulders, and enough mommy issues to justify a lifetime of therapy. Plus, the game itself is fun. Like, very fun! </p>
<p id="yxBeGW">No, you don’t get to shoot much stuff, nor do you conquer the giant open-world map. But you do make the world a little more manageable for you and other players, slowly building bridges, roads, and ladders that will inevitably be destroyed by nature. Where other games ask you to become the ruler of their world, <em>Death Stranding</em> reminds you that we are all merely tourists awaiting our one-way flight off of this rock. Did I mention the poop grenades?</p>
<p id="7xbH1F">Plenty of folks didn’t give the game a shot on PlayStation 4 or PC. Maybe the Steam Deck will make the game convenient enough to win over a handful of curious people to take the plunge into <em>Death Stranding</em>’s sticky, inky depths. <em>—CP</em></p>

Despite loving Rosario Dawson with all my heart, I couldn’t stick through <em>Ahsoka</em>, and I didn’t get past the first episode of <em>Boba Fett</em>. (You can’t effectively express your hate for me—they took away our comments.) But I’ve loved <em>The Mandalorian</em>, and thoroughly enjoyed the first two episodes of <em>The Acolyte </em>when I watched them last night. It’s a top show, and being set a couple hundred years before the movies, doesn’t feel bogged down in almost 50 years of baggage. Boggage?</p><p>It’s perhaps for similar reasons that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/bastard-of-the-old-republic&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bastard-of-the-old-republic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my absolute favorite thing to have ever come from the <em>Star Wars</em> universe</a></span> is BioWare’s 21-year-old RPG, <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>. Set an extraordinary 4,000 years before Luke first whinged across the galaxy, it was gloriously able to be its very own thing in a superbly established galaxy. And that first game had a fantastic story to boot, with a great twist ending that would serve a whole new generation were it to be repeated as a TV show. I’m pitching that Headland adapt the first game first, before getting onto Kreia. Because I want it. Me. It’s about me.</p><p>Headland’s focus is certainly on the sequel, however. She told <em>Omelete</em>, “I’ve always wanted to explore a live action version of the <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> game and the character of Kreia.” And blimey, would it ever be great. Following Kreia’s path through both sides of the Force, and her rebellion against both sides’ conventions in what she considered “enslavement” to the insidious metaphysical nanobots, would make for an epic show. And Headland would clearly be the person to deliver it.</p><p>When <em>Omelete</em> asked if her interest in the games raised the possibility of <em>KotOR</em>’s Darth Revan showing up in <em>The Acolyte</em>, she replied, “Start writing some emails! Start crowdfunding!”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Official 'The Truth Lies' Live Action Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Putting a big game like Black Ops 6 on Game Pass will no doubt be "expensive" for Microsoft, Harding-Rolls said, but it could be a smart move in the long run. The analyst outlined a number of reasons for how putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass could lead to an uptick in revenue, starting with how it could drive upsell to the more Game Pass Ultimate from Game Pass Console to increase the average revenue per user.</p><p>Harding-Rolls also said people may opt to purchase the more-expensive versions of Black Ops 6 to play early, instead of waiting for Black Ops 6 to come to Game Pass on its traditional launch date. Activision historically lets people play the campaign early by purchasing a more expensive version of the game, and while the details remain unconfirmed for Black Ops 6, it seems like the company would do the same.</p><p>Harding-Rolls also pointed out how with Starfield, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-starfield-5-days-early-without-spending-100/1100-6515108/" data-ref-id="1100-6515108">Microsoft sold a $35 upgrade option so Game Pass subscribers could play early</a>. Harding-Rolls said this worked well for Starfield and could help "boost premium revenue streams" for Black Ops 6 as well.</p><p>Additionally, Harding-Rolls mentioned how Black Ops 6 is likely to carry forward Call of Duty's heavy microtransaction offerings. So while Microsoft might miss out on some premium full-game sales due to Game Pass, the tradeoff is a potentially larger audience to sell microtransactions to.</p><p>Regarding the effect putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass could have on PlayStation 5, Harding-Rolls said people who play Call of Duty on PlayStation will "inevitably be disrupted to an extent," and that this will be "a concern for Sony."</p><p>That said, Harding-Rolls mentioned how Call of Duty also has the free battle-royale game Warzone, and this means "the disruption will not be as significant as it might have been in the past when all revenue from a content point of view was centered on premium sales."</p><p>For people who own both an Xbox and a PlayStation console, they might be encouraged this year more than ever to play on Xbox due to Game Pass, Harding-Rolls said. But thanks to things like multiplatform accounts, people can always switch back or move between systems easily than before.</p><p>"Indeed, there could be scenarios where PlayStation-first multi-console gamers switch to Xbox to play the premium campaign while still playing the free-to-play Warzone on their preferred console under a single Activision account," Harding-Rolls said.</p><p>Black Ops 6 is rumored to launch on October 25. The release date and other information should be announced at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-reveal-event-when-its-happening-how-to-watch-what-to-expect/1100-6523968/" data-ref-id="1100-6523968">Black Ops 6 Direct on June 9</a>, so keep checking back with GameSpot for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-reportedly-marks-long-awaited-return-of-theater-mode/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cod-black-ops-6-reportedly-marks-long-awaited-return-of-theater-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="372" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">First introduced in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em>, Theater Mode allowed players to record clips, piece them together, and then upload them directly from the menus. In future iterations, the feature also made it possible to watch back Zombies and Blackout matches and create clips. For the first time in a few years, it appears that the beloved feature could be making a return. </p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><em>Call of Duty</em> leaker Bob <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1798771567373193379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims</a> that Theater Mode will return in Black Ops 6. Theater mode works similar to the spectator mode used in Call of Duty League matches. Players can save gameplay, take screenshots, fast-forward, pause, and rewind videos. The feature will make it possible to rewind a match from any perspective on the map, allowing users to take notes and learn where they made mistakes. </p> <figure data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">In addition, the feature will be useful for the community in weeding out cheaters. Streamers already have the capability of rewinding their stream to determine if an enemy cheated or not. Theater Mode should make it easier for every player to do the same. Of course, this also comes with risks, as false accusations will inevitably be made and posted online. Treyarch is going to have its hands full sifting through so many videos, but this feature should have a positive impact and result in plenty of fun highlight reels going viral. </p>
 <p data-characters="125" data-current-count="125" data-injectable="false">We will learn more about the upcoming series installment during the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-watch-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> Direct</a> on June 9 at 1 p.m. ET. </p>

<p data-characters="228" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Nintendo is plumbing the depths of the Blue Bomber’s portable efforts this week. All five <em>Mega Man </em>Game Boy games launched simultaneously via Nintendo Switch Online, and are <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/a-mega-new-update-for-nintendo-switch-online-members/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now available</a> for those who have a subscription.</p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">The games included in the drop are <em>Mega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge</em>, <em>Mega Man II</em>, <em>Mega Man III</em>, <em>Mega Man IV</em>, and <em>Mega Man V</em>. You just need the basic Nintendo Switch Online paid membership to dive in, so no worries for those who haven’t ponied up for the Expansion Pass version. You can relive all the green-tinted glory in Nintendo’s June 2024 Game Updates trailer below.</p> <figure data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Game Boy – June 2024 Game Updates – Nintendo Switch Online" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVbuHPyM3VA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Starting with <em>Mega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge </em>in 1991—known as <em>Rockman World </em>in Japan—the Game Boy takes on Capcom’s NES platformers were actually pretty impressive efforts. Many of them can be seen as remixes of sorts, with the first challenging players to four Robot Master stages from the original <em>Mega Man</em>, followed by fights with four Robot Masters from <em>Mega Man 2 </em>within the treacherous halls of Wily Castle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false"><em>Mega Man II </em>mixes content from the second and third NES games, so you can see a pattern developing. The series came to a close with <em>Mega Man V </em>in 1994, featuring Super Game Boy support and, in a first for the Game Boy entries, a totally fresh story with new levels, bosses, and weapons.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="false">All of the games have their awkward aspects, but they’re absolutely worth firing up if you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. And hey, it beats paying exorbitant eBay prices for complete versions of these bite-sized bad boys. Now we’ll just patiently wait for Nintendo to expand Switch Online support to include the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mega-man-3-for-dos-is-easily-the-worst-mega-man-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOS version</a> of <em>Mega Man 3</em>.</p>

<p data-characters="299" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The current season of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4</a></em> is in full swing, providing the best endgame grind since the game came out. With it currently going on, how long do we have until season 5? Here, we’ll go over the end date of <em>Diablo 4</em> Season 4 and other tidbits of useful info regarding this season over to the next.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-end-date-of-diablo-4-season-4" data-injectable="false">What is the end date of <em>Diablo 4</em> Season 4?</h2> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">To start off, <strong>Season 4 of <em>Diablo 4</em> will end on Tuesday, August 6, 2024</strong>. That will most likely also be the date when Season 5 starts. When the day comes, the game’s servers will go down for a few hours as the new update with the next season’s content is deployed.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Is it too late to play Season 4 of <em>Diablo 4</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">It is not too late to get into Season 4. In fact, with the major improvements to leveling, farming, and looting,<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-season-4-is-not-even-a-day-old-and-fans-think-its-the-best-season-start-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it’s the best time to do so</a>. You can go from level 1 to 100 for your seasonal character within a week or two, depending on skill and hours put into <em>Diablo 4</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">With the streamlined experience gained from the Helltides and dungeons in general, you can quickly work up a build that’s endgame viable rather quickly. You can also easily go through the Battle Pass within that same time frame it takes to get to 100, if not, a bit after.</p> <figure data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">The only things that you may not fully get through are <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-pit-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the incredibly difficult </a>Pit tiers that go beyond level 60 and onward, the Tormented versions of Uber bosses, and the revamped Uber Lilith fight. This is where that true endgame lies. With the right build invested into and with time, you can eventually conquer these.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">Even the Nightmare Dungeons feel a lot better and are just as rewarding. You can easily get to or close to Tier 100 with a semi-decent build.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">When did Season 4 start?</h2> <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-exact-release-time-global-launch-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 started on May 14, 2024</a>. While we’re a month into it already, as mentioned earlier, if you want to hop in, you can still get a majority of the season’s offerings in a few weeks.</p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Loot Reborn sparked the interest of many who dropped the game because of an unrewarding endgame grind, and things have only gone up since then.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>An astonishingly rare Xbox console given to a UK charity shop is expected to sell for thousands at an upcoming auction.</p>
<p>The lime green original Xbox console – designed to commemorate the 2003 release of the movie Hulk – is a limited edition original given out as a cinema scratchcard prize.</p>
<p>While 50 Hulk editions were made, just 36 were claimed, 16 of which are considered missing, lost, or scrapped.</p>

<p>"This one really caught my eye," tester Paul Smith told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce440j9gdl5o">BBC</a>. "I'm a games enthusiast myself, but the rare green colour combined with the Hulk and Pepsi logo really stood out."</p>
<p>With eight days to go on the auction, the console has already attracted over 20  bids and is expected to fetch up to £9000. It appears to include all the original cables, five original Xbox games – Tony Hawk's Underground, Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, what I think is Bilbo's The Hobbit, and one other game I can't quite make out – and the original controller.</p>
<p>"This Green Hulk/Pepsi Xbox was a special promotional Xbox made to commemorate the release of the Universal Pictures movie Hulk in 2003 for the UK release," explains the item description. "The console featured a jewel on top with a promotional image of the Incredible Hulk's eye and the Pepsi logo. These special editions were only available by having a winning scratch card when you purchased a popcorn and Pepsi meal in participating UK UCI Multiplex cinemas.</p>
<p>"We believe there are only 36 of these consoles were ever won and only around 20 that have been found. We believe only 50 were made. but like we mentioned, only 36 were won.</p>
<p>"In the USA, a green Xbox was created for the brand Mountain Dew, they made 5000 of those and they are highly sought after, so this is even rarer."</p>
<p>The auction advises that there are no other such consoles on eBay and "none have been sold in the past", "so these are rare, the likelihood of finding another is slim, so a rare chance to own this item".</p>
<p>All proceeds go to the British Heart Foundation charity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24173526/wallace-and-gromit-short-penguin-vengeance-most-fowl-release-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="xsMfUq">I always breathe a sigh of relief after the announcement of a new Aardman Animation project. The studio behind some of the most imaginative stop-motion projects of the last 50 years has never been a household name or box-office titan like Walt Disney Animation, but founders Peter Lord and David Sproxton’s quirky claymation company remains just as vital to the art. So you can imagine how loudly I yelled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmT094XH9g">“cheeeeeeese!”</a> when Netflix announced a new outing for Aardman’s unofficial mascots, Wallace and Gromit. </p>
<p id="bPuQVd">Due out “this winter” (but positioned as a 2025 release in Netflix’s news release), <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl</em> picks back up the well-mannered bumbling inventor Wallace and his vigilant dog Gromit standing on the edge of our current techpocalypse. Wallace, it seems, is fully Silicon Valley-pilled, and “Gromit’s concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions proves justified,” per a synopsis. The tipping point: Wallace’s invention of an AI “smart” gnome that goes rogue. But there’s another familiar face pulling the strings: Feathers McGraw. </p>
<p id="cmXdJN">Introduced in the 1993 Oscar-winning short <em>The Wrong Trousers</em> — one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/26/21152552/wallace-and-gromit-best-chase-scene-wrong-trousers-aardman-streaming-amazon">the all-time great chase movies</a>? — Feathers is a silent criminal mastermind known to masquerade as a chicken using a red rubber glove worn as a hat. He has appeared in blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameos in other Wallace and Gromit shorts, the pair’s lone feature film, <em>The Curse of the Wererabbit</em>, and even the woefully under-discussed 2003 video game <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit in Project Zoo</em>, but <em>Vengeance Most Fowl</em> is expected to give the penguin his true sequel moment, as seen in a brief teaser for the film.</p>

<p id="BTvQlS">While the distinctly British output from Aardman has struggled to connect with American  audiences — films like <em>The Pirates! Band of Misfits</em>, <em>Shaun the Sheep</em>, and <em>Early Man</em> were hits around the world and blips in the States — the streaming era has been kind to the studio. Along with producing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23924148/chicken-run-dawn-of-the-nugget-netflix-preview-animation-mission-impossible">last year’s sequel to <em>Chicken Run</em></a> for Netflix, the studio also collaborated with Disney for the first time in 2023, producing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23713171/star-wars-visions-season-2-show-interview">a segment for the <em>Star Wars: Visions </em>anthology series</a>. And last December, Aardman even produced a Wallace and Gromit VR game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJuoDhPDfE">for Meta Quest</a>, reminding us there is no place these two can’t go.</p>
<p id="TdgZDI">A new Wallace and Gromit short on Netflix is a no-brainer, and a sign of respect: if <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23900570/wes-anderson-roald-dahl-netflix-short-films-order-to-stream">Wes Anderson could do it</a>, obviously so can Aardman.</p>
<p id="UMSYgW"><em>Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl</em> is once again directed by longtime Aardman creative Nick Park. Actor Ben Whitehead returns as the voice of Wallace, after taking over Peter Sallis starting with <em>The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</em>. The short is set for this winter, teeing it up right up for Oscar season.</p>

  <p id="iLXjk0">I first saw <em>Hit Man</em>, the new Richard Linklater movie now streaming on Netflix, at an early morning press screening at the London Film Festival. The film played really well and the audience was into it, but I was still shocked when one late scene drew huge peals of laughter from the audience and an actual applause break at its climax. An applause break! At 9:30 in the morning! From film critics! <em>British </em>film critics! (Something you may not know about British people: We don’t applaud in movie theaters. Ever.)</p>
<p id="h35hmd">Just as surprising: the content of the scene that drew that response. Given the movie’s premise — a professor poses as a contract killer to help the police arrest people for soliciting murder, but gets lost in the role — you might guess the audience was hooting at a Tarantino-esque slapstick bloodbath. But the scene was, in fact, the most cleverly conceived and delightfully played piece of pure romantic comedy I’d seen in years.</p>

</p>
<p id="Hqc0Cp">As a filmmaker, Linklater is fluent in genre conventions, but he often finds his own space in the cracks between them. In that sense, <em>Hit Man</em> is true to form. Written by Linklater and its star (and frequent Linklater collaborator, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23068332/top-gun-maverick-review-tom-cruise"><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em></a> heavy) <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24046802/hit-man-netflix-trailer-glen-powell-comedy">Glen Powell</a>, it’s an easygoing movie that doesn’t break a sweat as it flits between comedy, romance, suspense, philosophical musing, and a quiet tinge of noirish darkness. Under a straightforward, pleasing exterior, the movie is elusive and prone to shape-shifting — a bit like its main character.</p>
<p id="X6MFy7">That character is Gary Johnson (Powell), a placid, nerdy professor of philosophy and psychology with a talent for electronics. That talent leads him into a side hustle running recording equipment for the New Orleans police department, and helping with a sting operation where a cop named Jasper (<em>The Walking Dead</em>’s Austin Amelio, in venal mode) poses as an assassin to catch people in the act of soliciting murder. When Jasper gets suspended and Gary is parachuted into the sting at the last minute, he discovers a new talent for role-play. He takes to being a fake hitman like a duckling takes to water.</p>
<p id="dbfWuo">Gary, student of human nature that he is, pours himself into researching his marks and constructing identities that will work for each of them. Contract killers are a myth anyway, he reasons, so why not lean into the fiction and play into the expectations formed by decades of cinematic assassins? Powell has a lot of fun donning wigs and voices to imitate a comical range of stereotypical killers. At one point, he does an absolutely uncanny impression of Christian Bale in <em>American Psycho</em>.</p>

<p id="IpgFPx">Up to this point, <em>Hit Man</em> is a <a href="https://time.com/6313456/hit-man/">more-or-less true story</a>. There was a real Gary Johnson, in Houston, Texas, a mild-mannered cat-lover who moonlighted for the police as a fake hitman in the 1990s and 2000s. For the movie, Powell and Linklater adapted a <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/true-crime/hit-man-2/">2001 Texas Monthly article</a> about the real Johnson, who might not have donned so many disguises, but certainly got the arrests.</p>
<p id="GrDnY6">It’s a good yarn about a resonant character — the unassuming everyman who can take on another identity to slip into a netherworld. In the process of fictionalizing this story, Powell and Linklater spin it out in two directions: a philosophical inquiry into the mutability of the self, and a light romantic thriller. Gary adopts the role of cucumber-cool hitman “Ron” to meet Madison Masters (Adria Arjona), a wife who wants her abusive husband killed. He’s smitten — but is it with Madison, or with Ron, the super-smooth, confident, uninhibited version of himself he has invented for her?</p>
<p id="lMcu9W">For its first half, <em>Hit Man</em> ambles along pleasantly in a typical Linklater mode: the anecdotal shaggy-dog story that takes plenty of time to muse about its own implications. (Quite literally: Gary quotes Nietzsche and ponders questions of identity and morality with his college class. Also, his cats are named Ego and Id.) </p>

<p id="FAss8L">The stakes for a hitman movie where real hitmen don’t exist seem pretty low, but the dual-identity setup with Gary/Ron and Madison is a classical Hollywood comedy gambit, like something out of a 1940s Preston Sturges movie. It kicks the movie into an uptempo second half that is more constructed, plotty, and commercial than Linklater’s usual extremely chill work. It’s easy to imagine it done in a more heightened, screwball mode — maybe something like Jonathan Demme’s quirky, snowballing 1980s comedies <em>Something Wild</em> and <em>Married to the Mob</em>.</p>
<p id="yPWiUr">That isn’t Linklater’s vibe, though, and that isn’t this movie. Powell and Arjona make a powerfully sexy, charming pair, and Powell and Linklater find clever ways to enmesh the characters’ simmering romance in a tightening web of compromise, danger, and deceit without tipping into the crime movie clichés the movie is spoofing.</p>
<p id="7Zbi1w">The payoff is that perfect rom-com moment, the one that drew applause from a crowd of sleepy London critics. It’s a spectacularly conceived, written, and performed scene that plays out on two levels simultaneously: one in the fiery, hard-bitten dialogue, one in the flashing eyes, frantic gestures, and crackling chemistry of the two leads. In this moment, <em>Hit Man </em>joyously (and pointedly) unites the thrill of connection with the thrill of danger, and operates harmoniously as two films at once — the same way Gary is perhaps becoming two people at once.</p>

<p id="OmEcYj">It’s such a satisfying scene that it more than makes up for some slackness in the script elsewhere. Arjona’s part is underwritten, and as willing as Powell and Linklater are to ponder the big questions, they gloss over some of the moral implications of the storyline: Gary’s arguable gaslighting, Madison’s culpability and agency, and whether the police operation was wholesale entrapment in the first place.</p>
<p id="cnvK5l">There’s a darker side to this story and these characters, strongly hinted at by one surprisingly cruel late turn in the plot. Powell and Linklater nod to that darkness, but ultimately decide not to go there. Just as Gary can decide to turn himself into Ron, they can decide to steer this slippery movie into a sunnier place. <em>Hit Man </em>could have been a lot of different movies, and part of the joy of the film is in how playfully it gestures toward all those different potential versions of itself. But ultimately, that one perfect scene defines it as a great romantic comedy with a delicious bite. </p>

Moll and Lora were exclusive to the Mothra Tamagotchi, and until rhubarb_pie’s post, were just NPC nurses who would heal your little guy whenever it got sick—unless you used a “battery glitch” to play as them. Rhubarb_pie discovered how to unlock them naturally through gameplay.<br></p><p>“The way to get them is extremely obscure so I am not at all surprised they were never found until now,” they wrote in a post in the “Tamatown Forum” Discord. “Looking at it now, this looks like a bad schoolyard video game urban legend. But it is real.” In order to do it, you’ll need to raise a character called “Mothra Leo” with no “care mistakes” (like allowing its hunger or happiness bar to hit zero and ignore their calls for attention/help for more than 15 minutes), keep it to a specific weight, and wait about 80 hours. When Mother Leo dies, it will lay an egg that contains the twins Moll and Lora.<br></p><p>Rhubarb_pie described the process as “absolutely brutal,” saying that it took “about three weeks” IRL to successfully birth the twins. But the prospect of discovering new playable characters has the Discord incredibly excited, even if it’ll take some serious work to unlock them. Rhubarb pie wrote: “This pretty much blows open all other Tama devices for possible other extremely-well-hidden secrets,” they said. “I think this is the first time there’s been an actual raisable character that is completely undocumented, its existence not even hinted at. Something Tama fans always thought was possible, whispered about in hushed tones, but dared not dream of…”<br></p><p>The post also mentions another “undocumented secret character” they unearthed while digging through Mothra Tamagotchi’s source code: a Mothra grave, or the in-game sprite that pops up after a Mothra dies.

<p>As spotted by users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/1da1tgx/what_the_hell_it_on_my_ps_store_page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reddit</a>, New World: Aeternum appeared to show up on the PlayStation Store today, signaling a release on consoles.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the game will be releasing in mid-October on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p>



<p>Amazon Games’ New World is an open world MMORPG that launched in 2021. In 2023, the game eventually <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pivoted to a seasonal model</a>. Aeternum is the name of the central location that players explore in New World. The existing New World title is only available on PC.</p>



<p>New World: Aeternum’s appearance on the PlayStation Store included a sponsored promo image.  This gave fans a small glimpse of the potential art design. </p>



<p>Fans also reported today that Amazon quickly removed its brief appearance on the PlayStation Store. So, fans speculate that it slipped ahead of a major reveal at Summer Game Fest. </p>



<p>The Summer Game Fest event begins today, June 7, 2024, starting at 5 pm EST / 2 pm PT / 10 pm GMT. It will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">2 hours of gameplay showcases</a>. </p>



<p>A new report surfaced this week suggesting that a trailer for Summer Game Fest costs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-trailer-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$250,000 for one minute</a>. However, it would be an ideal place for Amazon Games to invest in a big reveal like New World: Aeternum coming to consoles.</p>



<p>At this time, Amazon Games has not officially confirmed anything about New World: Aeternum.</p>

Make your way through the mission, completing the first three major encounters where you can use a Rally Banner.

Hang a left and you'll move into a small dark alcove. Look up for a light on the wall--it marks a hole you can slip through. Jump up (you can use the door frame on your left for a boost) to get to the ledge, duck into the hole, and follow it into the darkness until you emerge on the other side into a small room that houses the prismatic chest.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Lost_City">The Lost City</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Facet_of_Grace">Facet of Grace</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314404-destiny2facetofgracebluepath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314404" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314404-destiny2facetofgracebluepath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314404"></a><figcaption>Head toward the blue building to find the Prismatic chest in the area beyond.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314404-destiny2facetofgracebluepath.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Go past Micah-10 and drop down into the Lost City. When you leave the Tower, turn right and cross the big gap to the blue building with orange lines on the rooftop. You'll find a path that goes around the blue building, with another building in front of you. Move around to the side to find an opening to go into the building, and the Prismatic chest inside. As you get close, you'll see a message noting that Omens have appeared, and some Dread enemies will spawn. Clear them--particularly the Weaver with the orange life bar. When it's dead, you'll see a message noting that a second Omen has arrived. You need to hunt it down and kill it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4314406-destiny2facetofgraceyellowpath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314406" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4314406-destiny2facetofgraceyellowpath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314406"></a><figcaption>Find the second Omen enemy by following the platforms marked in yellow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4314406-destiny2facetofgraceyellowpath.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cross back to the area in front of the Tower entrance and go straight across to the platforms that are marked yellow. Kill all the enemies and the Weaver to trigger a third Omen spawning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314407-destiny2facetofgraceredpath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314407" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314407-destiny2facetofgraceredpath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314407"></a><figcaption>The last Omen is down this red path.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314407-destiny2facetofgraceredpath.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Return to the main area near the Tower and now cross to the red platform. Follow the path to one more set of enemies and one last Weaver. With the last one dead, you'll see a new message, noting the arrival of The One Foretold. Go back to the main area again and you'll find out what that is: a Tormentor.</p><p dir="ltr">As usual, kill everything here. Doing enough damage to the Tormentor will trigger a shield generated by Bound enemies, so you'll need Transcendence to clear them out. Keep going until the Tormentor is dead and it drops a Prismatic key, and then return to the blue path to find the chest and open it.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Facet_of_Mending___Outskirts__The_Lost_City">Facet of Mending - Outskirts, The Lost City</h3><p dir="ltr">This chest has a bit of a run-up to find it, involving locating several lost Ghosts hidden in the area. First, load into the Tower transmat zone and head toward the Lost City. You want to jump over the rooftops and move all the way to the west; you're backtracking through the first area you crossed when you came through the portal during the campaign. When you hit the Outskirts area, you'll find a mess of Hive attacking you as you walk through a small garden courtyard ringed by buildings and shops. The exit will be on your right, but don't leave through that archway yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, listen for the notification sound your Ghost makes when there's something scannable nearby. If you pull your Ghost out and you're near what you're looking for, the Ghost will turn toward the object you're searching for. The first one is up on the arm holding a sign that attaches to the wall in an alley to the left of the exit archway. Hop up on top of it and use the Activate button to pick up your first Ghost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314402-20240606171900_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314402-20240606171900_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314402"></a><figcaption>The first Ghost shell is out of the way on top of these sign.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314402-20240606171900_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Continue through the Outskirts. Next, you'll reach the edge of this area. Crossing the big gap ahead are four square platforms. Instead of crossing them, go to the edge and look down to find scaffolds and a staircase. Drop down and you'll find the next Ghost on a box next to the stairs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314403-destiny2ghostshell2lostcity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314403" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314403-destiny2ghostshell2lostcity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314403"></a><figcaption>Drop down to this scaffold and look for the Ghost shell on a crate under the stairs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314403-destiny2ghostshell2lostcity.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cross the gap to continue. You'll enter a new building and drop down. When you get through and go back outside, turn around and face the door you just passed through. There's an awning above the door that you can jump up onto, where another Ghost waits.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314401-20240606172255_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314401" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314401-20240606172255_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314401"></a><figcaption>Jump up on this awning to find the Ghost shell waiting on a box.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314401-20240606172255_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Keep following the path and you'll find another Ghost just beneath the big tree you pass through. Head to the amber-colored metallic piece of architecture you pass beneath. Hop up onto it to find the Ghost nestled against the ring.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314400-20240606172426_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314400" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314400-20240606172426_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314400"></a><figcaption>The final Ghost shell is under the orange ring stuck in the tree.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314400-20240606172426_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the other side of the big tree, you'll see a Pyramid tech structure with a pressure plate in the middle and the Ghosts you just found ringed around it. Stand on the plate to summon a mess of Dread enemies. You'll fight four different waves as the plate charges up, culminating with a Subjugator. Once you damage it enough, Bound Dread enemies will appear, so you'll need to stand on the nearby Prismatic well to charge up Transcendence and break their shields and make the Subjugator vulnerable again. Repeat that process one more time when the Subjugator becomes invulnerable again, and when it dies, it'll drop a key to the Prismatic chest next to the big Ghost.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Landing">The Landing</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Facet_of_Justice">Facet of Justice</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314409-20240605230942_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314409" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314409-20240605230942_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314409"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314409-20240605230942_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This Prismatic chest is hidden in the crystal cave area you passed through during the campaign. From The Landing transmat zone, head to the left and make your way along the cliff to the caves, then follow the path until you find a round side room with two floors and a big Solar crystal at the top.</p><p dir="ltr">When you pick up the crystal, Hive runes will appear around the room. You'll also have three runes beneath the crystal. Each of the runes around the room corresponds to a pedestal where you can place the crystal, so your goal here is to place the crystal in each of the pedestals in the order they appear vertically, from top to bottom.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314410-destiny2facetofjustice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314410" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314410-destiny2facetofjustice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314410"></a><figcaption>You'll need to remember the three runes stacked beneath the crystals, identify where they are around the room, and place the crystal in each corresponding location to unlock the chest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314410-destiny2facetofjustice.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The trouble is, if you jump into the center of the room so you can see the runes, they'll disappear and Dread enemies will spawn to attack you. To see where you need to take the crystal, you need to look through the opening near where the crystal appears and count the pedestals to find the corresponding one. Shadow Thralls will appear to bother you as you do so, but they're not too big of a deal.</p><p dir="ltr">Each time you place the crystal, you'll have to fight a bunch of enemies, culminating in a couple of Ogres and Dread enemies. As usual, some Bound forces will appear to lend shields to the bosses, so you'll need to use Transcendence to clear them out in order to finish everything off. Grab the key when you're done to open the Prismatic chest.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Refraction">The Refraction</h2><h3 id="Facet_of_Awakening___Memory__Refractions_of_Light">Facet of Awakening - Memory: Refractions of Light</h3><p>Unlike many of the other Prismatic chests, the Memory of Light chests require you to earn five Vestiges of Light items from around the Pale Heart. You can find these by venturing into Cysts as part of the Alone in the Dark quest you get from Micah-10, and from the Light Offering chests you find in areas where Overthrow events are taking place. When you get five Vestiges of Light, they'll combine to become a Memory item, which will unlock a new search area on the map of the Pale Heart in the Director. Head to that area and look around to find the Prismatic chest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314426-20240606002215_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314426" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314426-20240606002215_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314426"></a><figcaption>Climb up to find the Prismatic chest on the branches and vines above.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314426-20240606002215_1.jpg"></figure><p>The search zone for Refractions of Light will take you to The Refraction.

How you open the chest isn't immediately obvious, though; the puzzle you need to solve is hidden nearby.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314411-20240606160731_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314411" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314411-20240606160731_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314411"></a><figcaption>You can jump through the holes in this wall to find the generators you need to charge up to unlock the Prismatic chest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314411-20240606160731_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Just past the chest on the side of the hallway is a wall of panels, some of which have fallen off to open holes through the wall. Find a hole big enough to pass through and you'll find several pieces of Fallen technology, including a computer terminal and two generators. If you interact with the terminal, you can summon a Scorch Cannon--use it to blast the terminals to break the ice locking you out from using them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314412-20240606160721_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314412" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314412-20240606160721_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314412"></a><figcaption>Use this terminal to call a Scorch Cannon, which can destroy the ice and release the energy orbs you need to charge up the generators.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314412-20240606160721_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The trick here is to find orbs of energy to fully charge the generators. The energy orbs you need to find are also stuck in piles of ice, scattered around the nearby area. You'll need to hike around to find them a bit. One is just on the other side of the Prismatic chest, but you'll have to jump off the walkway and explore the side area to find it at the end of the room, on a platform. The others are down the halls in both directions away from the chest and in side rooms.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll find two Solar orbs, three Arc orbs, and two Void orbs. Each orb provides a different amount of energy to the generator, which is measured by green units that light up on the generator when you dunk them. Your goal here is to charge each generator fully, which is 10 units, without going over.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to solve the puzzle on your own, skip this next bit. If not, you'll want to know that <span data-embed-type="spoiler">Arc orbs provide two power units, Solar orbs provide three units, and Void orbs provide four units. Therefore, you want to plug in two Solar and two Arcs in one generator, and two Void and one Arc in the other generator.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Once both generators are fully charged, you'll need to fight a bunch of Dread enemies, including a Subjugator, to get the key and open the chest.</p><h3 id="Facet_of_Honor___Memory__Divisive_Darkness">Facet of Honor - Memory: Divisive Darkness</h3><p>Like the Memories of Light, Memories of Darkness require you to gather five Vestiges of Darkness in order to create a memory item that unlocks a search area in the Pale Heart. You can get Vestiges of Darkness by solving and opening corrupted chests in Overthrow areas.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314428-20240607001925_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314428" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314428-20240607001925_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314428"></a><figcaption>Corrupted chests look like this, and solving them will get you a Vestige of Darkness.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314428-20240607001925_1.jpg"></figure><p>To find the chest for the Divisive Darkness memory, make your way to frozen mountain in The Divide. You'll need to climb all the way up to the top of the mountain. When you hit the peak, look off the side of the structures at the edge of the cliff on the right when you're facing the path into the facility. The Prismatic chest is waiting for you near the nice view.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314429-20240606174529_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314429" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314429-20240606174529_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314429"></a><figcaption>Drop down over the edge of the buildings at the top of the mountain in The Divide to find this chest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314429-20240606174529_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Transgression">The Transgression</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Facet_of_Defiance">Facet of Defiance</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314396-20240606231549_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314396" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314396-20240606231549_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314396"></a><figcaption>Look for the cave on the north side of The Transgression.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314396-20240606231549_1.jpg"></figure><p>Start at the transmat zone in The Impasse and head east into The Transgression. Keep moving forward until you reach a valley with a statue of a Guardian in the center with a spike going through their chest. From the statue, turn left and you'll see a cave ahead with an orange glow. If you head in, you'll find the air is toxic and you'll take damage. This mechanic shows up all through the campaign, so you'll be familiar with it. You need to stand next to and shoot the Darkness seed near the entrance to the cave to gain a buff that protects you from the toxic air, and keep refreshing it while you're in the cave whenever the timer runs out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314398-20240606231908_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314398" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314398-20240606231908_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314398"></a><figcaption>Seek out and destroy these Eyes of Suffering to drop the shields on the enemies so you can take them out.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314398-20240606231908_1.jpg"></figure><p>Push all the way to the back of the cave to find the Prismatic chest. Find the triangular splinter object in the middle of the room and activate it. Enemies with invulnerable shields will spawn in. Avoid them since they're invulnerable, and instead, look for the round Taken Acolyte Eyes scattered throughout. You need to find the eyes, which are a bit hidden, and destroy them all to make the enemies become vulnerable so you can kill them.</p><p>Repeat the process of finding and killing the Eyes three times. Each time, more shielded enemies will spawn, making the sprint to find the Eyes a little more frantic each time. When they're all dead, a bunch of Dread enemies will appear, along with a Tormentor. You'll need to use Transcendence to make the Tormentor vulnerable, but once that happens, you can take it down to get your Prismatic chest key.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Destiny 2: The Final Shape guide hub</a> for tons more information about everything to find in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/super-earths-heartfelt-thank-you-to-helldivers-2-players-inadvertently-revealed-yet-another-harrowing-cost-of-the-galactic-war/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=super-earths-heartfelt-thank-you-to-helldivers-2-players-inadvertently-revealed-yet-another-harrowing-cost-of-the-galactic-war<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="294" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Helldivers 2</em> universe is a satirical take on our own, asking what things would be like if we took spreading managed democracy and the values that come with that lifestyle to the extreme. However, Super Earth has just revealed an in-universe fact that’s more harrowing than hilarious. </p> <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">When you play a mission in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, your squad has a set number of reinforcements. It’s pretty standard because we all know that at least a few of our soldiers are going to be killed, churned up by the endless onslaught of Terminids and Automatons. What you might not consider is how much those deaths cost. Not how much the bill Super Earth foots is, but the bill the poor Helldiver’s family pays to see whatever’s left of their loved one. </p>
 <h2 id="h-dead-helldivers-are-just-another-revenue-stream-for-the-relentless-super-earth" data-injectable="false">Dead Helldivers are just another revenue stream for the relentless Super Earth</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Sony</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">Following perhaps the most impactful event in <em>Helldivers 2</em> history, the collapse of Meridia into a black hole, <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1798363487258710165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Earth put out a message</a> commemorating those brave soldiers who had lost their lives fighting to make this happen. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Terminid Supercolony could not have been destroyed without the brave sacrifice of many, many Helldivers.</p><p>In their honor, this personalized memorandum has been issued to their designated next-of-kin. We will always remember [Helldiver Name]. <a href="https://t.co/fHLljtbKTo">pic.twitter.com/fHLljtbKTo</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1798363487258710165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">The message is perfect because it’s filled with sections with options that are obviously meant to be chosen from instead of sent in this form. The point that stuck out to me is the customary fee for a Helldiver corpse, helmet, or limb that’s usually charged. This is most likely because every body on Meridia was ionized when the black hole was created. </p>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">In this one and only case, Super Earth is waiving the transportation fee so families can see the scraps of their loved one return from the front lines. The rest of the time, these families are charged for this service, though, meaning your spouse might get a fair pay packet for fighting for Super Earth, but all your savings will need to be spent bringing pieces of them back from a hostile alien world just to bury them. </p>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">This is incredibly dystopian and fits the <em>Helldivers 2</em> universe incredibly well, but it just stood out to me as something we can point to that shows how capitalism really has gone too far in this universe. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-adds-throwing-knives-and-the-very-first-vehicle-customizations-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charging Helldivers for new equipment by using a currency they can only earn from battling aliens</a> for Super Earth is one thing, but it feels like you’re taking the piss with an already captive market when you start charging for repatiration. </p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="false">I couldn’t tell you how much delivering a Helldiver’s had across the galaxy costs, but I looked it up, and repatriation to the UK is about £3,600 and that’s without space travel, so it’s probably a lot more. Considering that Super Earth potentially <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-may-have-been-given-an-impossible-major-order-to-boost-recruitment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set Helldivers an impossible objective to boost recruitment numbers</a>, this all feels a lot like a tactic to boost income instead of spreading more democracy. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-adds-five-classic-mega-man-games.892386/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-mega-man<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added five classic&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and they're available to enjoy right now if you're a subscriber.</p>
<p>The first five numbered&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games for the Game Boy, which were originally released between 1991 and 1994, are now on Nintendo Switch Online as part of a basic subscription, so you won't even need the Expansion Pack to enjoy them.</p>
<p>What's more, these games aren't available as part of any of Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Legacy Collection&nbsp;</em>compilations. They were available on the Nintendo 3DS eShop, but since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wii-u-and-nintendo-3ds-eshops-are-being-discontinued">that service has been discontinued</a>, Nintendo Switch Online is pretty much the only (entirely legal) way to enjoy them on modern hardware.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-classic-mega-man-game-boy.jpg?itok=NznUuzOx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-classic-mega-man-game-boy.jpg?itok=-xWi1eNc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Five - count 'em, five - classic&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games are now available with Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>The Game Boy&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>titles generally offer stages, bosses, and enemies that also feature in the main NES&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>series, although&nbsp;<em>Mega Man 5&nbsp;</em>features a set of original bosses.</p>
<p>Four of the Game Boy titles were developed by Minakuchi Engineering, which also worked on the SNES version of&nbsp;<em>Mega Man X3</em>, as well as the Game Boy version of&nbsp;<em>Bionic Commando</em>, another Capcom platformer.</p>
<p><em>Mega Man 2</em>, on the other hand, was given to&nbsp;<em>Sokoban&nbsp;</em>publisher Thinking Rabbit, although Capcom would return to Minakuchi for the following three games in the Game Boy series after&nbsp;<em>Mega Man 2</em>'s quality didn't quite come up to par for the studio.</p>
<p>In any case, if you're already a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber, you can give all five games a try right now, and if you've never played a&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>game before, they'll certainly make for an interesting introduction to the series.</p>

<p>These&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games are part of a long list of Game Boy titles available on Nintendo Switch Online. That list also includes classics like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch"><em>Super Mario World</em></a>, Capcom's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-july"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Oracle&nbsp;</em>games</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can also enjoy SNES and NES games if you're a subscriber, and if you fork out for the Expansion Pack, you'll also get access to a range of Sega Genesis, Game Boy Advance, and N64 titles.</p>
<p>You can grab a Nintendo Switch Online subscription right now via the Nintendo eShop.</p>

    <p><span>Firefly and Jade join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Farewell, Penacony,” will launch on June 19, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [162 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-888606"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update introduces the highly anticipated Stellaron Hunter, Firefly, as well as a significant figure from the IPC, Jade. Additionally, under the guidance of Mr. Screwllum, the new update in the Simulated Universe, “Divergent Universe” will be unveiled as well.</p><p>With the abrupt termination of the Charmony Festival, The Family’s reputation is in tatters, with numerous delicate issues urgently demanding attention. In response, aside from the Oak Family, the major lineages are preparing their strategies to address the aftermath. In the Version 2.3 Trailblaze Mission, the Express Crew will be invited aboard the Radiant Feldspar, soaring into the skies above Penacony to witness crucial Family discussions firsthand.</p><p>Meanwhile, aboard the Radiant Feldspar, a new project within the Simulated Universe, “Divergent Universe” will be conducted under the guidance of Mr. Screwllum, utilizing technology from his home planet to bring gameplay improvements. For instance, the “Arithmetic Mapping” function in the Divergent Universe testing removes character download limitations. If a character’s level is below the current Equilibrium Level Cap, it will automatically increase to meet the cap. The update also introduces the “Equation” feature, where combining buffs from two different Paths grants corresponding combat abilities once the required amount is achieved. Additionally, when facing defeat in the Divergent Universe, Trailblazers can now restart challenges without needing to force-stop the game. With the new Restart Challenge option, players can regroup and give it another shot, allowing for more strategy and playability, as well as providing a richer, more fun gaming experience.</p><p>In Version 2.3, Origami Birds will also make their way onto the Radiant Feldspar, bringing a new mini-game. In this arcade challenge, Trailblazers must achieve eliminations within a set number of moves to boost the birds’ Combat Power. During the “Origami Bird Clash” event, Trailblazers can not only participate in Story Challenges, but also freely battle friends from across the universe!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Aside from gameplay updates, the 5-star character Firefly will also join the team as a playable character, fighting alongside the Trailblazers. Firefly is a member of the Stellaron Hunters, originating from the long-destroyed world of Glamoth. Once a prosperous and expansive empire, Glamoth was annihilated by the Swarm. Firefly, a young girl encased in mechanical armor known as “SAM,” was created as a weapon and suffers from Entropy Loss Syndrome due to genetic modification. Driven by the quest to find meaning in life and to defy fate, she joined the Stellaron Hunters.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_888611"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As a 5-star Fire-Type character, Firefly possesses an immense power. After using her Technique, she can summon her SAM armor and leap into the air, moving freely, with SAM attacking all enemies within a set range to enter battle. Each wave of enemies can have Fire Weakness forced upon units without Fire Weakness, lasting for a set number of turns. In the heat of battle, SAM will be operating in two forms. In the initial form, using her Skill consumes HP but simultaneously replenishes her Ultimate energy. The less HP Firefly has, the less damage she sustains. Furthermore, when activating her Ultimate, SAM transforms into its second battle form — the dazzling Complete Combustion state! Alongside more potent Basic Attacks and Skills, her Speed and Weakness Break efficiency are also heightened. The Break DMG dealt by SAM is increased until the countdown for Complete Combustion ends. An aspect worth mentioning is that this state provides players with an immersive perspective from within Sam’s mech, showcasing Firefly’s unwavering gaze and embodying the fiery spirit capable of setting the seas ablaze.</p><p>Another Quantum-Type 5-star character, Jade, is set to make her distinguished debut. As a senior manager in the IPC Strategic Investment Department and one of the Ten Stonehearts, she is recognized by her Cornerstone, “Jade of Credit.” Cold and elegant, Jade is a skilled moneylender with a keen understanding of the human heart. Her personal hobby, “Bonajade Exchange,” highlights her patience in waiting for high-value acquisitions through accepting pawning of assets and her ability to extract value from seemingly destitute clients.</p><p>Jade’s Skill allows her to forge a binding agreement with a single ally, making them her “Debt Collector” and bestowing upon them enhancement. Each attack launched by Jade or her Debt Collector accumulates Charges for Jade. Once fully charged, Jade unleashes a follow-up attack against all enemies. Her Ultimate, however, enforces the terms of the agreement with unyielding precision, dealing damage to all enemies while also enhancing her follow-up attack.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the limited 5-star characters — Ruan Mei and Argenti — will make their appearances in the Warps during the first and second halves of Version 2.3, respectively. Their formidable strength ensures they will remain powerful allies in your future adventures. Finally, please stay tuned for the upcoming Summer Game Fest 2024. At this grand mid-year gaming carnival, Honkai: Star Rail will make an appearance alongside numerous top-tier global games, giving players an exclusive preview of the next chapter in the galactic adventure.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,174 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [20,281 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

<p>A Civilization VII banner has appeared on the 2K Games website ahead of its Summer Game Fest announcement.</p>



<p>The information that Civilization VII would be announced at Summer Game Fest was provided to content creators and media earlier this week. The <a href="https://www.2k.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> does direct users to a trailer and wishlist, which are currently not live.</p>



<p>In mid-May, 2K Games announced it would announce the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-announcement-soon-june-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next iteration of one of its ‘biggest and most beloved’ franchises</a> during Summer Game Fest. Many speculated that the series could be Marfia, Bioshock, or Borderlands, but those rumors have seemingly been squashed. </p>



<p>In 2016, it was reported that the Civilization series had sold over 33 million copies, with over 1 billion hours played. However, more recent numbers are yet to be provided, but sales are expected to be well over 50 million.</p>



<p>What do you think of Civilization VII? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

The MMO set in an alternate 1600s America saw huge concurrent player numbers on Steam, and is currently the eighth most-played game on Valve’s platform all-time with a whopping 913,634 peak concurrents. Player numbers have declined since that peak, however, with Steam concurrents hovering around the 10,000 mark in recent weeks.</p><p>A console release would certainly provide a boost, and a confirmation seems imminent after the official New World X/Twitter account teased “an exciting announcement” for Summer Game Fest, which kicks off today, June 7, at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— New World (@playnewworld) <a href="https://twitter.com/playnewworld/status/1798784534584152243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Questions remain, however. The PlayStation Store insert is for a game called New World Aeternum, whereas the Steam version is simply called New World. Perhaps the console version is a different game entirely, or Aeternum is the name of a new expansion that will replace the original name across all versions.</p><p>Or, New World Aeternum may mark a new beginning for the MMO, similar to Final Fantasy 14 A Realm Reborn. Fans are also wondering whether New World is also set for Xbox Series X and S, given the insert was spotted on the PlayStation Store.</p><p><em>Image credit: OMG_R3A11Y / Reddit.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Anyone who's got kids will be aware of the worries about them being drawn into TikTok and other addictive phone apps. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">Board games</a> offer the perfect antidote. They’re enthralling, face-to-face, and social, and most of them don’t involve using a screen at all. But when it comes to picking out titles for them to play, the marketplace is absolutely dominated by mass-market producers who favor glossy advertising over great gameplay.</p><p>Delving into the hobby market is the obvious answer, but here you have the opposite problem: dozens of worthy titles that look about as exciting as a brown box with a glum man on the cover. Fortunately, more and more designers and publishers are discovering the importance of serving the kids’ market and the last few years have seen a glut of great-looking, fast-playing games. Below are our picks for the best -- but also check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">best family board games</a> for ideas that are fun for everyone, regardless of age.</p><h3>TLDR: Best Board Games for Kids</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/E3EjX" target="_blank">The Color Monster</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/P25py" target="_blank">Dragomino</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jBj42" target="_blank">Animal Upon Animal Junior</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/vdd37?_ga=657280166.1701788289" target="_blank">First Orchard</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/8BBPq?_ga=657280166.1701788289" target="_blank">Outfoxed</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/rwbNX" target="_blank">Unlock!

The Color Monster, based on a <a href="https://zdcs.link/y2rDP" target="_blank">popular children’s book</a>, achieves this but also helps with emotional development. On your turn, you roll a die and move to land on a color space, then talk about the emotion that’s associated with that color. Afterwards, there’s a simple memory element to place the emotion in the correct jar as a step toward a cooperative win. Adults have to take turns too, of course, making this a wonderful platform for sharing your feelings and experiences with your kids.</p><h3>Dragomino</h3><div id="155418"><p><h3>Dragonimo</h3></p></div><p>Children’s versions of popular <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a> often aren’t worth the time over their bigger siblings but Dragomino, a spin-off of <a href="https://zdcs.link/n6wxD" target="_blank">Kingdomino</a>, does something special. Your goal is to build a map in traditional domino-style, winning dragon eggs if your piece placement matches the ends of one or more adjacent dominos. So it’s possible for a good placement to get you several eggs, which may contain baby dragons for your victory tally. It’s a very simple framework yet it makes basic strategy play accessible to preschool children, an impressive and unusual achievement.  It's a great <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds">board game for 5 year olds</a> if that's what you're looking for.</p><h3>Animal Upon Animal Junior</h3><p>Once kids have developed a little dexterity, at around age three, the wonderful world of stacking games opens up. Animal Upon Animal is a great place to start and is fine fun for adults too. A die roll decides who gets to choose an animal shape and who will stack it. Cause the pile to fall, and you must take some of the toppled animals: first to clear their pieces wins. It's the shapes that really make this game, a brilliant set of designs that open up a myriad of stacking options that reward clever play.</p><h2>First Orchard</h2><div id="201799"><p><h3>HABA First Orchard</h3></p></div><p>This is a super-simple cooperative race game against a cute wooden raven that’s so straightforward that even very small kids can play it by themselves. On your turn, you roll a die and either take a brightly-coloured wooden fruit of the corresponding colour or advance the raven if its icon comes up. Your goal is to pick all the fruit before the raven reaches the end of its track, which is short to make for a quick game. The rules are easy, the components are gorgeous, and it’s cooperative so it doesn’t feel too bad when you loose. Best of all, there’s one really simple strategic choice to make to increase your chances of winning in a largely random game, and it’s a lovely moment when your kids finally figure it out.
</p><h2>Outfoxed</h2><div id="161850"><p><h3>Outfoxed</h3></p></div><p>Kids love working things out based on simple clues, it makes them feel super-smart, and Outfoxed lets them play as chicken detectives, trying to identify which of sixteen dastardly fox culprits stole the pie! There’s an exciting push your luck dice roll mechanic to either turn over suspect cards or get a clue, but if you fail the roll, the fox piece moves instead, and you’ll lose if he gets away. Clues come in the form of inserting tokens into a neat widget that tells you whether the suspect has a particular item of clothing or other identifying feature, so it’s a Guess Who style race to flip over the suspect cards and eliminate them to find the truth before the criminal escapes.
</p><h2>Board Games for Elementary School-Age Kids</h2><h3>Unlock! Kids: Detective Stories</h3><div id="196147"><p><h3>Unlock! Kids: Detective Stories</h3></p></div><p>Escape Rooms are very popular at the moment, especially with kids, and there’s a burgeoning genre of board games that essentially provide the same kinds of puzzles in a one-shot box. The Unlock series is one of the more popular, and it now includes this fantastic entry aimed at younger players. The puzzles are simpler, there’s no timed element and no “failure” - you just keep trying until you get the answer. And the three scenarios, set across a farm, a funfair and a haunted house, are written to draw in young imaginations. It’s a great series of challenges that will fill kids with a real sense of accomplishment once they’ve solved all the riddles and made it out.</p><h3>Kids Chronicles: Quest for the Moon Stones</h3><div id="196146"><p><h3>Kids Chronicles: Quest for the Moon Stones</h3></p></div><p>This is an app-driven game, so you’ll need a screen to play, which might be a little controversial if you’re trying to steer the kids away from electronic devices. But the app is excellent and is incorporated seamlessly into a cooperative experience that will see the players working together to come up with a plan to find the legendary moon stones, so it can be a good incentive to encourage kids to get involved. It’s a junior version of the very adult Chronicles of Crime series. Players have to scan 3d scenes on the phone, identifying characters and objects they can use as clues, which will propel them through an unfolding narrative. It’s a simple mystery, but it’s very engaging for kids, especially given the great writing, graphics and sound of the app element.</p><h3>Valley of the Vikings</h3><div id="155419"><p><h3>Valley of the Vikings</h3></p></div><p>Dexterity meets tactical puzzling in this bizarre yet entertaining bowling game. The aim is to push a large ball into a group of colored barrels. For each barrel you knock over, the corresponding player piece is advanced down a pier track toward the water. What you’re trying to do is dunk other players in the sea while keeping yours dry. The tactics come from the fact that your reward when another player goes swimming depends on the icon above your own space. So, sometimes you want to advance your own piece after all, sometimes not, and sometimes a clumsy ball flick leaves you with no choice in the matter.</p><h3>Andor the Family Fantasy Game</h3><div id="155420"><p><h3>Andor</h3></p></div><p>Adventure games tend toward the longer and more complex end of the spectrum, and that’s a shame because it’s a theme that kids really dig. Andor aims to redress that with a straightforward yet fun and varied quest framework. Players choose a class and try and complete random missions while a dragon slowly makes its way toward the capital city. If it gets there before you’ve delved into the dungeon and rescued the cute wolf cubs therein, it’s game over. You can push it back by battling its minions, but that diverts efforts from those all-important quests, giving players a basic priority balancing strategy to work with.</p><h2>Kittin</h2><div id="201800"><p><h3>Alley Cat Games Kittin</h3></p></div><p>Children of this age tend to love dexterity games, not least because their fast reflexes and nimble fingers mean they can compete and win against clumsy adults, and Kittin (it comes in a tin, geddit?) is a fast, simple stacking game with a theme that’s guaranteed to appeal. You flip a card off a stack showing a pile of cats, and then you’ve got to grab the correct pieces and be first to stack them in an identical shape to win the card. Three cards wins the game, but be careful: if you get the arrangement wrong or your stack falls, you’re out of the round. The cutesy, irregularly shaped wooden cats make this harder than it sounds, and as a bonus that eight player capacity makes it great for sleepovers. For extra tweenage cachet there’s a <a href="https://www.alleycatgames.com/product-page/pusheen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pusheen branded version</a> coming soon.</p><h2>Board Games for Middle School-Age Kids</h2><h3>My Lil’ Everdell</h3><div id="196148"><p><h3>My Lil’ Everdell</h3></p></div><p>The original Everdell won a lot of acclaim thanks to its combination of rich worker placement strategy and incredibly cute artwork featuring anthropomorphic animals. That latter aspect has clear family appeal, so the rules and strategies have been simplified, and the cute art made even more cute for this slimmed-down family version. Players send their friends out into the meadow to pick up resources, which they can then spend to recruit other cards into their burgeoning community. Some give instant bonuses, others permanent round-by-round extras. Between them, they allow players to construct basic engines and build an ongoing strategy. It’s a fantastic introduction to the wider world of worker placement and engine games, offered in incredibly appealing clothes.</p><h3>Horrified</h3><div id="155421"><p><h3>Horrified: Universal Monsters</h3></p></div><p>Don’t be fooled by the theme: this is based on classic Universal monster movies of the ’50s and is even less scary than they were. So it’s a great way for kids to face their fears as they work together to overcome some hokey horror foes. Players must move around the town and collect items necessary to defeat the selection of monsters they’ve chosen to face. There are six to pick from, each with different powers and requirements to defeat. But beware, as you’re not the only targets: you’ll also need to protect wandering villagers and guide them to safety. And when the kids are done, this is a pretty <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">good horror board game</a> for adults, too.</p><h3>Zombie Kidz: Evolution</h3><div id="155426"><p><h3>Zombie Kidz Evolution</h3></p></div><p>At first, this seems too simple for this age bracket. Players move their characters over the school map, eliminating zombies. If they can meet and lock the gates against the zombie horde before being overrun, they win. But as each scenario is passed, the real magic of the game unfolds. This is a "legacy" style game for kids, where each game adds to a growing narrative. Your choices also make your copy unique with pens and stickers and unlockable envelopes of new rules and other content. It's a wild ride of imaginative customization that children will love.</p><p>That's all we have right now for kids, but if you want to keep climbing through the years, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-teens">best board games for teens</a>.</p><h2>When Is The Best Time to Buy Board Games in 2024?</h2><p>If you love board games, it can unfortunately be a rather expensive hobby.

            <p>Good news, Mega Man mega fans – five Game Boy Mega Man games have just joined the Nintendo Switch Online library.</p>
<p>In a Nintendo Online Switch update published to YouTube this morning, Nintendo confirmed that "the original five Game Boy Mega Man titles" are now playable to those with an NSO subscription: Mega Man: Dr Wily's Revenge, Mega Man 2, Mega Man 3, Mega Man 4, and – yes, you've guessed it – Mega Man 5.</p>

<p>Mega Man's first titular outing popped up on a Nintendo-flavoured console in 1987, but Mega Man: Dr Wily's Revenge – a handheld remake of Mega Man 1 and 2 – didn't debut on Game Boy until 1991.</p>
<p>The remake of Mega Man 2 and 3 was sold as Mega Man 2 on Game Boy in the same year, while Mega Man 3 bundled together Mega Man 3 and 4 in 1992.</p>
<p>The pattern continues with Mega Man 4 and Mega Man 5 being sold together as Mega Man 4 in 1993, although 1994's Mega Man 5 was exactly that – just Mega Man 5.</p>
<p>Last month, as Game Boy passed its 35th birthday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-game-boy-classic-added-to-nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo added the legendary Super Mario Land, Breakout puzzle clone Alleyway, and Baseball.</a></p>

			<p>The Unreal Engine 5.4 is capable of producing some impressive visuals, but they can take a toll on performance, even on powerful GPUs.</p>
<p>In a new video showcasing the <a href="https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/9VpwR/scans-abandoned-manor-ruins-in-a-dark-wood">Abandoned Manor Tech Demo</a> by SCANS, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows how beautiful the demo looks at 4K native resolution and hardware Lumen, which is enabled as part of Epic settings. Unfortunately, at these settings, even the RTX 4080 has trouble hitting 30 FPS in certain scenarios. Performance is definitely more acceptable at 1440p resolution, as even at Epic settings, the RTX 4080 can run the demo at above 60 frames per second most of the time, even hitting the 80 FPS mark in certain scenarios.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unreal Engine 5.4 Abandoned Manor Tech Demo - A Glimpse Into Next-Gen Graphics | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VrinSa-1unk?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unreal Engine 5.4 is the latest version of the game development engine by Epic. Released <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-out-now-60fps-performance-improvements-shader-compliation/">last month</a>, it introduced a variety of improvements, including the new Nanite Adaptive Tessellation option, Heterogenous Volumes, which can produce realistic and dynamic smoke and clouds, improved Temporal Super Resolution upscaling, easier implementation of AI and machine learning tools, performance and shared compilation improvements and much more.</p>
<p><em>“With many developers targeting 60 Hz experiences, we’ve invested significant effort into improving rendering performance in UE 5.4. This includes refactoring the systems to enable a greater degree of parallelization, as well as adding GPU instance culling to hardware ray tracing, which also now benefits from additional primitive types and an optimized Path Tracer. Further optimizations have been made to shader compilation, resulting in a notable improvement in project cook times.”</em></p>
<p>Additional information on the Unreal Engine 5.4 can be found on its official website.</p>

<p data-characters="193" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Fortnite</em> is well known for hosting a bunch of different game modes these days, but fans of the game are begging Epic to bring back the ultra-popular <em>Imposters</em> mode which was based on <em>Among Us</em>. </p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">With Battle Royale, <em>LEGO Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket Racing</em>, and <em>Fortnite Festival</em>, Epic Games has served up a smorgasbord of ways to play the game, in an attempt to keep as many gamers as possible inside their ecosystem at all times. For <em>Fortnite</em> fans, however, it’s the <em>Among Us</em>-inspired <em>Imposters</em> that they want to see. </p> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">Added in August 2021, we were able to enjoy it for a full year until Epic removed it in 2022. Two years on, we haven’t heard anything about it since, and want that to change.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption><em>Imposters</em> was all about trickery. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">“I don’t know why they ever removed it,” wrote HypixL on Reddit. “It was fun and really good for grinding XP if you missed most of the season.” Alexfrizzell agreed, stating: “I was devastated when they removed it. I know it was quite glitchy at times but it was still really fun, sometimes the glitches made it even more fun.”</p>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">Some even enjoyed it more than the original, with Sto_Nerd stating that their “friend group never got into <em>Among Us</em> but we all loved <em>Imposters,</em>” while The Cartel100 simply stated that it was “way better than <em>Among Us</em>.”</p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="false">Despite the love for the mode, Epic has been silent about it ever since vaulting it in August 2022. There’s been no talk of a return, even amongst leakers, which makes it seem like it may have been removed for good. For me though, I agree with the commentors about—I liked <em>Imposters</em> even more than <em>Among Us</em>, and with so many other modes now in the game, it would be the perfect next addition to <em>Fortnite</em>‘s growing roster. </p>

		<p>What a week it’s been! I’ve put myself through the wringer by racing in an open-water triathlon in the midst of a hailstorm, so I’m pretty weary right now. What that does mean is I’ve had a good dose of time to sit and relax, and Fabledom has been at the top of the relaxation charts. Alongside that, I’m checking out Star Wars Hunters, and I’ve been ambling my way through various bits on PC as well as making a start on the new Elder Scrolls Online chapter.</p>

<p>Tuffcub has been playing Destiny 2. Obvs. And that’s even more true with The Final Shape finally dropping this week. His thoughts on it will be along soon.</p>
<p>Aran has been playing #Blud for review but can’t say any more than that until the 17th. He’s also been playing SteamWorld Dig, saying, “I’m enjoying it. Just digging away, finding resources and completing some little platforming sections.”</p>
<p>Gamoc has played some Dredge (excellent), some Fallout New Vegas (excellent), some Xdefiant (fine), some Stranded: Alien Dawn (good), and some The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners (excellent). He also got Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader, saing, “It is fantastic, but has crashed on me three times so far in 16 hours.”</p>


<p>Nick P has played a bit of Killer Klowns, Dead by Daylight and got the plat on Stellar Blade. Meanwhile Ade has also been playing all the XDefiant, and is “absolutely loving it! And it’s free!” He didn’t just indulge in a bit of Ubisoft shooting either, as he also played Tails of Iron 2 for preview. He tells us, “So far, it’s looking every bit as good as its brilliant predecessor.”</p>
<p>Steve rattled through Immortals of Aveum, telling us “I enjoyed it for the most part although it started crashing on me towards the end. A perfectly fun mid-tier game that unfortunately cost AAA dollars to make. Alongside this I have been playing the chilled-out and meditative Hauntii which is 87% vibes and 13% knowing what you’re supposed to be doing! My kids and I have been working through the fantastic Lorelei and the Lazer Eyes for review (coming soon) and I can highly recommend that one. Finally I dug out the 3DS for a train journey and restarted Mario 3D Land which I don’t think I ever finished originally.”</p>
<p>Now then, what about you? What have you played?</p>

            <p>Hayley Atwell - known for her role as Peggy Carter in numerous Marvel projects - is set to voice Lara Croft in Netflix's upcoming Tomb Raider animation. While this has been known for a while now, we hadn't heard how the actress sounds in her new part. Until now.</p>
<p>In a sizzle reel shared by Netflix to promote the various animated shows on the streaming service, we finally hear Atwell's Lara speak. The show is set to take place after the events of the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy, which comprised Tomb Raider (2013), Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. </p>
<p>These games rebooted the Tomb Raider series, and served as an origin story for Lara. As such, this Lara was less assured than the Lara we were first introduced to back in the 90s. However, judging by the most recent Netflix trailer, Atwell is bringing back some of that iconic confidence to the character. You can check it out for yourself below, at around the 40 seconds mark.</p>

            <p>
Tonight's Summer Game Fest showcase marks the beginning of a weekend of announcements, filling the typical June slot the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/e3-is-officially-dead">now-dead E3</a> used to fill.
</p>
<p>
But how much does a trailer in Geoff Keighley's showcase actually cost?
</p>
<p>
One industry insider told <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/">Esquire</a>, as part of a report on Summer Game Fest, "Geoff's a black hole of information". Yet trailer costs have been revealed, and since corroborated by <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">Kotaku</a>.

<p>
Want a one minute trailer in the showcase? That'll be $250k in Keighley's pocket.
</p>
<p>
One and a half minutes jumps to $350k, two minutes is $450k, and two and a half minutes is $550k. A document obtained by Kotaku adds this money also includes a set number of social media posts.
</p>
<p>
Using these costs and last year's showcase, Esquire estimates Keighley made $9.65m. What's more, Keighley is the only person listed on his company's most recent LLC filings with the California Secretary of State, so it's unclear how many people work as part of Summer Game Fest.
</p>
<p>
As one PR professional said: "The current pricing tiers make Summer Game Fest an unattainable goal for most indie developers and publishers."
</p>
<p>
Yet Kotaku confirmed through a number of indie publishers and developers some "free slots" are provided to smaller, non-AAA games and studios. This is part of "earned editorial placements" that provide free airtime for certain projects.
</p>
<p>
However, these placements are also likely reserved for the biggest reveals from companies like Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. Which begs the question: who exactly is paying these prices?
</p>
<p>
That's not all. Summer Game Fest continues after the showcase as a physical event. A biz dev partner badge for a day's access costs $500 - after approval. A private meeting cabana costs $50,000 for three days, including space for six people, table service, free parking, and six entry badges, or $20,000 per day. 
</p>
<p>
A "full hands-on pod" can also be purchased, including four large HDTVs and more, with publishers and developers able to spend more on custom venues and spaces.
</p>
<p>
On the flip side, one PR professional told Esquire that for "general brand awareness, the impact [of the showcase] is pretty huge", though this "depends on the placement and trailer length". "Longer slots perform better and seem to drive more coverage, whereas short trailers don't capture quite the same attention," they said.
</p>
<p>
Another marketing professional added fans can buy tickets to the showcases, suggesting revenue here could be used to lower the cost of entry for smaller clients. 
</p>
<p>
In a Twitch stream earlier this week ahead of the showcase, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-kingdom-hearts-and-more-wont-be-at-summer-game-fest">Keighley set expectations by specifying certain games that will and won't appear</a>. He described 2024 as a "lighter year" and said his excitement was an 8/10, which seems a little mean spirited to the developers spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to take part.

</p>
<p>
A big reason for the "lighter year", of course, are the thousands of layoffs that have rocked the games industry - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">layoffs have surpassed 10,000 for 2024 already</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-will-never-represent-our-industry-in-the-way-it-needs-so-what-next">Keighley was criticised after The Game Awards</a> last year for not acknowledging the layoffs or state of the industry. He did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-speeches-were-too-short-geoff-keighley-admits">admit afterwards that speeches were too short</a>, though there's no danger of a "please wrap it up" at Summer Game Fest.


</p>
<p>
Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Summer Game Fest has spawned a number of other showcases</a> geared specifically towards indie games and minorities. We've got a list of all the showcases to check out, including not only events by Keighley, Microsoft and Ubisoft, but the Access-Ability showcase, Wholesome Direct, Women-Led Game Showcase and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-features-companions-ability-wheel-for-strategic-combat-romance-has-no-limitations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, BioWare <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the official new title for the upcoming installment in the roleplaying game franchise. The studio decided to drop the previous title (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-more-info-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreadwolf</a>) to place a bigger emphasis on the player character and his seven companions rather than on the villain of the story.</p>
<p>The focus on companions appears clear everywhere in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Speaking to IGN</a>, BioWare General Manager Gary McKay detailed the new companions' ability wheel players will encounter in combat.</p>
<p><em>As an RPG, strategy in combat is important as you bring two companions to every fight. Each companion brings unique powers and abilities that have a direct impact on how you choose to take down the enemies at hand. To add another layer to that strategic element, we’re introducing a new ability wheel where you can pause the action and set up your next move – whether it’s your companions’ abilities or your own.</em></p>
<p><em>The ability wheel opens up a huge amount of strategic possibilities, giving players the ability to control the flow of combat and link powerful combinations of abilities between players and their companions that can quickly turn the tide of any battle. We think we’ve found an exciting balance between fun, fluidity, and strategy for every encounter.</em></p>
<p>There's a couple of notable tidbits here. First, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is reducing the party size from four to three, explaining why the game will have fewer available companions than Inquisition (seven instead of nine). Secondly, while not outright confirmed, the ability wheel appears to corroborate the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-wont-let-you-control-party-members-directly-according-to-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous rumor </a>that players would not be able to directly control party members. It sounds like it will be very similar to Mass Effect, which also featured a party of three characters with two companions that could be issued orders.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will also remove any limitations on companion romances, pivoting from the previous franchise entry, where companions had gender and/or race preferences (and some of them, like Varric and Cole, could not be romanced at all).</p>
<p><em>We spent a lot of time making our companions feel authentic based on their own unique experiences within this larger fantasy world, which in turn makes the relationships you form with them feel even more meaningful. We’ve tapped into Dragon Age’s deep lore and explored its most iconic factions to bring each of the seven companions and their stories to life. As you accompany your companions to unravel their backstory and earn their loyalty and friendship, you’ll visit more regions of Thedas across a deeper variety of biomes than any Dragon Age before it.</em></p>
<p><em>I won’t spoil next week’s reveal but I can say we’ve created a story where you can impact the world and the companions that surround you. Player agency is important to the Dragon Age: The Veilguard experience and allows each player to form unique personal connections with their companions of choice. And, yes, you can romance the companions you want</em>.</p>
<p>The game will be finally revealed with a 15-minute video from the opening scenes on Tuesday, June 11, at 8 AM Pacific Time. Rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-devs-pretty-confident-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> it will be released within 2024, and the developers are <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-has-everyone-at-bioware-really-happy-with-how-it-turned-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confident of its success.</a></p>

<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree’s game size and pre-load details have seemingly been revealed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a post by a prominent gaming news source, <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1798320557706076525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree will take up more than 16.502 GB on your console and PC to run. This post matches <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-file-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our earlier report</a> on the game size, which stated players would need more than 61GB of free space on their devices to run the DLC plus the game.</p>



<p>According to the post, Shadow of Erdtree’s pre-load date has been set as June 19, 2 days ahead of the June 21 release.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regarding the Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree is FromSoftware’s largest expansion to date. The DLC includes a brand new story set in the Land of Shadow, where dark new secrets await to be revealed. Players can explore a new but similarly dense map with new weapons, equipment, weapon skills, and magic to try out. Furthermore, the players will come across new and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-previews-tease-new-enemies-difficulty-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even more deadly enemies</a> and boss encounters this time around, so all that grinding in the base game will be for nothing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is available for pre-order now for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC. Pre-ordering the expansion will fetch you a Bonus Gesture for the game. Also, there are 3 editions of the game that players can purchase. </p>



<p>First up is the Shadow of the Erdtree edition, which includes the base game and the expansion. Then we have the deluxe edition, which includes an Elden Ring Digital Artbook &amp; Original Soundtrack and Shadow of the Erdtree Digital Artbook &amp; Original Soundtrack, on top of the base game and DLC. Lastly, we have the Shadow of the Erdtree Premium Bundle, which includes the DLC, its Digital Artbook and Original Soundtrack, but does not come with the base game. &nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The real enthusiasts can also go for the Collector Edition, which includes a 46cm statue of one of the boss characters in the DLC, “Messmer the Impaler”. You also received the Shadow of the Erdtree Digital Artbook and Original Soundtrack. However, the base game isn’t included in this edition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What do you think about Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree’s game size, and have you pre-ordered the DLC? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Microsoft has revealed the latest library update for Xbox Game Pass, which will include Octopath Traveler and Octopath Traveler II. Both of these are available now. Additionally, the update will introduce The Callisto Protocol, Isonzo, Depersonalization, and Still Wakes the Deep to the collection through June.</p>
<p><iframe title="STILL WAKES THE DEEP - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GFUCpvNnrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<ul>
<li>Octopath Traveler (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 6th</li>
<li>Octopath Traveler II (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 6th</li>
<li>Depersonalization (PC) – June 12th</li>
<li>Isonzo (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 13th</li>
<li>The Callisto Protocol (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 13th</li>
<li>Still Wakes the Deep (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – June 18th</li>
</ul>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/octopath-traveler-review/">Octopath Traveler Review, </a>Stefan said, <em>“Octopath Traveler is a wonderful collection of adventures and stories, but the quirk of storytelling that lends it its name is both its greatest strength and weakness. While the turn-based combat and ‘breaking’ enemies makes practically every battle engaging, the eight tales this game tells don’t really feel like they need to be told together. It’s a little unbalanced because of this, but this remains a charming, beguiling JRPG.”</em></p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/17/octopath-traveler-2-review/">Octopath Traveler II Review</a>, Reuben wrote, <em>“Octopath Traveler II manages to improve on almost every aspect of its predecessor, whether they needed it or not. The exploration is deeper with more nooks and crannies to nose your way through. The combat is far more intricate, giving greater options to build your party and skillset, and a large degree of player choice. The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and the sound design is phenomenal once again. Honestly, Octopath Traveler II has basically negated the need to play the first title, and I cannot think of higher praise.”</em></p>

<p>Microsoft has also confirmed the games that will be leaving the Xbox Game Pass library this month. They are Bramble: The Mountain King, High on Life, Rune Factory 4 Special Spacelines from the Far Out, and The Bookwalker. All of these titles will be removed on June 15th.</p>

            <p>Silent Hill 2's original creators "didn't want to make the same thing again" when it came to Silent Hill 2 Remake, causing Remake developer Bloober Team to push back on some of their suggestions.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202406/6918">Famitsu</a>, Silent Hill 2 Remake producer Motoi Okamoto – who joined Konami in 2019 to revive the dormant horror series – discussed how Konami and the original developers worked alongside Bloober to find the right "balance" between remaking and reimagining the revered game.</p>

<p>"The Japanese staff who worked on the original version said, 'I want to change this'. But on the other hand, Bloober Team had a lot of opinions like, 'No, I don't want to change this!'" Okamoto said, as translated by Google.</p>
<p>"Although opinions sometimes clash, in the end, we managed to get it right," Okamoto added. "If you watch the trailer, you'll see that it has been reborn in a modern style while retaining the good points of the original version."</p>
<p>Acknowledging that "game creators don't want to make the same thing they created again", Okamoto said: "They don't want people to enjoy the same thing. So, I think there were a lot of parts that they wanted to change drastically in the remake".</p>
<p>"But in the end, thanks to the opinions of Bloober Team – who are big fans of the original [game]– the remake is highly faithful to the original."</p>
<p>Okamoto did assure players, however, that the long walk in through the forest at the beginning of the game "will appear almost unchanged", and as the remake didn't want to use "gamer-like user interfaces", the team removed the UI map in favour of giving James a physical map that he carries with him instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-is-excited-and-very-confident">Bloober Team says it is "very confident" and "excited" about Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>. In the studio's annual report to shareholders earlier this year, the team expressed its excitement about the highly anticipated remake, stating that it was "very confident about the final result", and acknowledged the success of Silent Hill 2 Remake will be "the most important test" the studio has faced.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">Silent Hill 2 Remake is set to release on PC via Steam and PS5 on 8th October, 2024</a>. It was one of gaming's worst-kept secrets <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-is-back-but-is-it-too-much-too-soon">before it was formally revealed back in October 2022</a>.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-short-but-sweet-new-trailer/">Black Myth Wukong</a> PC system requirements were leaked online today, confirming how 4K resolution will require 32 GB of RAM</p>
<p>As shared on X/Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lunatic Ignus</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ZFeetyou30399/status/1798999945141452906/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ZFeetyou30399</a>, the game will require a Core i5-8400 or Ryzen 5 1600 CPU, GeForce GTX 1060 or RX 580 GPU for 1080p low, and a Core i7-9700 or Ryzen 5 5500, RTX 4070 or RX 7800 XT for 4K resolution, no ray tracing. With ray tracing on, Game Science recommends a&nbsp; Core i5-9400 or&nbsp; Ryzen 5 1600 CPU, RTX 3060 GPU for 1080p low, Intel Core i7-9700 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU, RTX 4060 GPU for 1080p high, and an Intel Core i7-9700 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU an RTX 4080 Super for 4K resolution. Interestingly enough, the developer doesn't list any AMD GPU option for ray tracing. As mentioned above, 32 GB of RAM will also be required for 4K resolution with both ray tracing on and off.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong is setting out to be one of the most interesting action role-playing games releasing this year. Rooted in Chinese mythology, the game will feature a unique take on the popular Journey to the West tale, giving players to set out as the Destined One to uncover the obscured truth beneath the veil of a glorious legend from the past, taking on all sorts of enemies in Soulslike fashion.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on August 20th.</p>
