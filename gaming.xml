			<p>Announced during yesterday's State of Play, Hell is Us was announced to get an official release date of September 4, 2025. This title comes from Rogue Factor, a company that made Necromunda: Underhive Wars and Mordheim: City of the Damned. This new ambitious title will be developed by Rogue Factor and then <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/hell-is-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by Nacon</a>. If this game is something that you want to delve into, pre-orders are now open on the PlayStation Store and will follow suit in the next coming days for Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell is Us | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8iZbNIAM8eQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game was previously announced in 2022, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-gets-15-minute-extended-gameplay-video/">15-minute extended gameplay video</a> being released during a State of Play in September last year. In this video, viewers were introduced to the dark world of Hell is Us, where you'd have to explore a war-torn country, going on an investigative journey to uncover the past, as well as confronting the ongoing chaos through the country.</p>
<p>This new trailer introduces viewers to the main character Rémi, who is voiced by Elias Toufexis (Criminal Minds, Supernatural, Assassin's Creed, Starfield) in the English language version of the game.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to join my friends on Hell is Us. I wanted to take this role because Rémi is particularly interesting: while he may seem cold or reserved at first, we gradually discover the complexity of his character and the events that have shaped his personality," says Elias Toufexis. "The world of the game is so endlessly fascinating. I can't wait for people to play it!"</p>
<p>Hell is Us is a third-person action-adventure game where you rely on melee combat for your main method of attack, with a heavy focus on player-incentivized exploration and a captivating story. Instead of being given markers to show them the way, players are encouraged to follow their instincts. This methodology is being used as an homage and return to the roots of adventure games from the 90s, where hand-holding in video games was very minimal.</p>
<p>You play as Rémi, a protagonist who is on an investigative journey to find who he was in a country that was torn apart by civil war. Along the way, he'll find supernatural creatures that are reminiscent of ancient headstones and monuments that were found in the region.</p>
<p>Along with the Standard Edition of the game, there will also be a Deluxe Edition that you can purchase, giving you some in-game goods. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hell is Us</li>
<li>Hollow Walker Skin + 1 Additional Skin for Rémi</li>
<li>Digital Artbook</li>
<li>Hollow Walker Skin + 1 Additional Skin for The Drone</li>
<li>Digital Soundtrack</li>
<li>Secret Code for in-game bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you pre-order the game, you will be rewarded with a Military Pack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe Edition, you'll get 72-hour early access to the title.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-receiving-yakuza-skins-soon-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1108797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-receiving-yakuza-skins-soon-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>According to a reliable leaker, Fortnite’s next game collaboration could be with the popular Like a Dragon series (formerly Yakuza).&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR, known for providing players with Fortnite leaks at the earliest, recently posted about the Yakuza collaboration on <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1889756376404029528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. Their post revealed that the series’ beloved characters, Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima, will be coming to Epic’s popular battle royale. <span>The information comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank">Wensoing</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD" target="_blank">Loolo_WRLD</a>&nbsp;on X. Kiryu was the initial protagonist for the series, whereas Majima leads their latest game,</span>&nbsp;Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. </p>



<p>Fans are already pumped for the Fortnite x Yakuza collaboration, with many hoping for a slew of emotes and song tracks for which the Like a Dragon series is popular. Players have also started discussing alternate outfit options for the characters, such as “<a href="https://x.com/Hakuji_03/status/1889846041928933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Mad Dog style and the Cabaret Manager style</a>”. Some wonder if Ichiban Kasuga could be added in the future, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-yakuza-is-a-good-fit-for-fortnite-s-lawless-season">Yakuza is a Good Fit for Fortnite’s Lawless Season</h2>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is gearing up for a new season called Lawless, which will be released on February 21, 2025. The next adventure takes players to Crime City, where Big Dill is dropping their new single. According to ShiinaBR, the upcoming season’s vaults can’t be opened with key cards and must be broken into with <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1889782607249818034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thermite</a>. Releasing the Yakuza collaboration with the upcoming season makes sense, too, as it matches the “Lawless” theme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Fortnite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leak-jujutsu-kaisen-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jujutsu Kaisen Wave 2 skins</a> that leaked recently are live now. Also, the game might receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-get-more-dc-collabs-after-multiversus-shutdown-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more DC collabs</a> after the Multiversus shutdown.

            <p>
Pokémon fans attending this month's big meetup in Los Angeles are being encouraged to bring a can of soup along with them. 
</p>
<p>
The initiative is part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic's push to aid LA's wildfire relief efforts - which also involves a joint $1m donation from the developer and The Pokémon Company group.
</p>
<p>
Some fans were unsure whether Pokémon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles would still go ahead at the city's Rose Bowl Stadium later this month, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-tells-staff-impacted-by-la-wildfires-that-what-matters-most-is-taking-care-of-yourselves-and-each-other">January's devastating wildfires</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But after several weeks of uncertainty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-offers-refunds-for-los-angeles-event-following-wildfires">Niantic confirmed at the start of February that the event would continue as planned - with optional refunds</a> for those who decided they no longer wanted to attend.
</p>
<p>
"For ticket-holding Trainers attending the in-person event, Niantic will host a donation drive at Rose Bowl Stadium supporting the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.
</p>
<p>
"The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank supports food pantries across Los Angeles County, and we encourage ticket-holding Trainers who are able and willing to participate in this drive to bring one can of protein or low sodium soup to the event."
</p>
<p>
Numerous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-donation-to-los-angeles-wildfire-relief">video game and entertainment companies have donated to LA wildfire relief efforts</a> over the past month.
</p>
<p>
Treyarch co-founder Peter Akemann - who more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to flying the drone that crashed into, and grounded, a firefighting plane assisting in the efforts to control the wildfires. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treyarch-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-flying-drone-that-crashed-into-firefighting-plane-during-la-wildfires">He now faces up to a year in prison</a>.

		<p>Raw Fury and developer Ground Shatter have announced that their pun-tastic medieval sequel Knights in Tight Spaces is coming to PC on 4th March. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315400/Knights_in_Tight_Spaces/">A demo is available to play now on Steam</a>, and you can wishlist to note support for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="⚔️ Knights in Tight Spaces | Date Reveal Trailer | Wishlist Now! ⚔️" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Be9T5dAxzfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Knights in Tight Spaces is, obviously, a successor to the more business suit brawling of Fights in Tight Spaces, but looks to take that idea to a whole new realm. A fantasy realm.</p>
<p>You’ll still be battling it out with enemies in small arenas, but this time it’s knights, rangers and wizards fighting against skeletons, banshee, bandits, other knights and more. Your main character is the titular knight, but you can hire others to fight alongside you, join a secret society (or not) and then see how far you can get in the roguelite format of this game.</p>
<p>All of your actions are determined by the cards in your hand, but they now combine with the different classes and gear you’ve equipped. you also need to be mindful of your surroundings, carefully positioning yourself around enemies and obstacles to get a tactical advantage, building up combos to release special moves.</p>

<p>We loved the first game in this series, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/02/fights-in-tight-spaces-review/">our Fights in Tight Spaces review</a>, “Fights in Tight Spaces is a really unique and stylish take on the deck building genre with a level of strategy on offer that will be enough to keep people coming back for a long time. Fights in Tight Spaces is worth your attention.”</p>

<p>Milestone has announced the official release date for Monster Energy Supercross 25. Available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, the game is scheduled to launch on April 10, 2025.</p>



<p>It’s been two years since the last game in the franchise, and the developers at Milestone have been “re-inventing” the franchise “from the ground up.” Monster Energy Supercross 25 sees the franchise make the move to Unreal Engine 5 and leave the last-gen systems behind.</p>



<p>“[With] Unreal Engine 5, the game delivers a graphical overhaul with a cutting-edge physics system for precise control over riders and bikes, both in the air and on the ground, as well as the integration of neural AI for increased immersion,” Milestone said. “This package of novelties will result in a more realistic and simulative gameplay which all fans will get to master through dedicated tutorials.”</p>



<p>Along with the release date, a short gameplay showcase trailer was released to give players a look at the gameplay changes coming with the new game. You also get a look at the Anaheim 1 and Glendale circuits with their 2025 layouts as well as a custom-built Motocross course exclusive to the game.</p>



<p>Monster Energy Supercross 25 launches April 10. Those who pre-order the game will get access starting April 7.</p>

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket card listings have been spotted on eBay, with players charging around $10 for some cards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/people-are-making-money-selling-virtual-pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, Pokemon TCG Pocket cards like <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/405516225584?_skw=pokemon+trading+card+game+pocket&amp;itmmeta=01JKZ7CQRGBCSSKACZV0DRADFH&amp;hash=item5e6aa68c30:g:X6kAAOSwb4FnnyZ-&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1eF6GR6UIxsrCeh9V9p9DhqadEgZyZ5Xp9TDFdXwq3aEI2tK5%2BeaL%2BSWVUFnlsgHgMEPCr%2BYiz6rzyrQrwdjWu81kj9hGgPEj8Wz8nf5fvi8%2FDOZLjnu%2FHT%2FD9A0WJGCAj7nvDXW76koW6z7dheEVkYiKNanxupqbXAah7pKys5xz9dv6fQG%2FcMHqApI8KgJTwSCbYNPmJFtPdb2BVpsVf2uCRL0ZIG%2FdK8EHBT%2BnEY0LhYflRGtWNBnLLqaHsTq63haDs0b4FhT4w68S8PsdAN%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR7T8suefZQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blastoise Ex</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/316188339515?_trkparms=amclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D1110006%26algo%3DHOMESPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D280766%26meid%3D4d4addc9a15446559b0d13c582e1788b%26pid%3D101224%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D5%26sd%3D316188373597%26itm%3D316188339515%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2332490%26algv%3DDefaultOrganicWebV9BertRefreshRankerWithCassiniEmbRecall%26brand%3DPok%25E9mon&amp;_trksid=p2332490.c101224.m-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mewtwo Ex</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/405516259939?_skw=pokemon+trading+card+game+pocket&amp;itmmeta=01JKZ7CQRGGP8QY4S7PQ1EXW1Q&amp;hash=item5e6aa71263:g:9IkAAOSw1GJnnyqL&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1f4BEHVgCJq8rJeMbdXEbBdJG8VpHIbnDQlWd0Lp7qNEKWy1%2Bq6A2CrGmBzIV2qahSdEr8agf955XrOO2GfsbBBfWdB5jEIIhrn%2B9dU7wEDniSYs%2BjQKXYmkaz%2FRbOzR3u2ZRzaetp%2F87cuBvmAwDhN3JX6pLPfeNq2K7noujawG0nh5AbSewwstejyIeDyJFuSl%2B1NUCX5zx907NaSJOP80bV7XnQJ%2FywHpsBrojP770YDG6ZVAmebITPKUlu%2FtKjb5Vlbxjq7ealMxLsnbUcg%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR7T8suefZQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gengar Ex</a>, and more have been listed on eBay, with prices ranging from $4 to $10 for each card. Players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ioctqy/this_is_actually_insane_lol/?share_id=ZW-qMKXrJkBFfLFq-ZP_M&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/PTCGP</a> subreddit have also caught on, with one user posting a screenshot of someone trying to get $5 out of them for a Tauros. The community on the subreddit wants such players to be reported instantly, but the game doesn’t have the feature. However, some wonder how one would prove a card was sold or not sold for real money outside the app, even if a report feature existed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The eBay listing for these cards has appeared even after Pokemon TCG Pocket rigorously tried to stop players from using real money to trade. The developers have already notified players that using “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-real-money-trade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real money</a>” to trade is an offence that can get them banned. Moreover, the developers had instilled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restrictions</a> into the trading feature to prevent such behaviour, but players have clearly found a way past them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, one of the restrictions of Pokemon TCG Pocket’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-trade-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trading feature</a> states that players can only trade cards of the same rarity, which means the eBay traders will receive a new Ex card for every Ex they trade. This means they can keep doing these trades until the developer catches them.</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket recently gifted players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-gifting-players-free-trade-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,000 free trade tokens</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment laid out the roadmap for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>'s coming months yesterday, confirming a massive overhaul of the hero shooter. There was a lot to dig into, from perks and the incoming Stadium mode to plenty of cosmetics, but one notable piece of Overwatch history also returned: loot boxes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode">Loot boxes are returning to Overwatch 2 with Season 15</a>, and it's spurred some interesting discussion around whether that's a good thing or not. For those unfamiliar, these boxes are drops you can accrue over time, which will randomly spit out an Overwatch cosmetic at random once you open them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Loot boxes were a core part of Overwatch 1's original monetization model and methods for doling out cosmetics, especially for those who would rather spend time than money. They had seasonal variants, great animations, and were a way to build up a modest portfolio of skins, poses, and highlight intros even if you weren't spending extra cash on Overwatch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch 2 Season 15 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, loot boxes have also been a historic point of contention in the industry. Reports called them <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lootboxes-manipulative-exploitative-new-report">manipulative and exploitative</a>, and some players found them — alongside similar microtransactons like gacha — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-how-loot-box-addiction-destroys-lives">addictive</a>. As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-developer-agrees-to-20m-fine-over-loot-box-violations">recently as last month</a>, these forms of microtransactions were eliciting fines. Overwatch itself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-battle-pass-store">ditched the model years ago</a>, shifting to a free-to-play, battle pass-driven model.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To those points, it's not surprising that the return of Overwatch's loot boxes will look a bit different from its previous iteration. For one, loot boxes are a free offering; Blizzard confirmed to IGN that you can acquire loot boxes through free means, like the battle pass' free track or weekly rewards, but you won't be able to buy them directly. Secondly, there are some relatively helpful mechanics for getting boxes and finding what you want. Game director Aaron Keller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRoM9B6vmhw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed in an interview with Overwatch content creator Emongg</a> that duplicate drops can be re-rolled, and other venues for boxes (like Discord and Twitch promos) will be available. Plus, it sounds like the team is dipping into past Overwatch cosmetics for box fodder, even adding things that aren't available in the current shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So with all that laid out, how is the Overwatch community responding to the return of loot boxes? Well, that's a little complicated. A celebratory post on the Overwatch X/Twitter account, below, has a mix of enthusiasm and jabs in the replies.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>LOOT BOXES. ARE. BACK. 🙌🎁</p><p>Available in both the Battle Pass and weekly rewards, see what surprises are waiting for you when Loot Boxes make their official return in Season 15 🎉 <a href="https://t.co/BGZmIlii5d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BGZmIlii5d</a></p></div>— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1889741290394227102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some streamers <a href="https://x.com/BroYouWack/status/1889766365575131588" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showed genuine excitement</a> at the return of loot boxes, and if you head over to the Overwatch subreddit, you'll also <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1inyadh/ladies_and_gentlemen_loot_boxes_are_back/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find some threads</a> where players are happy to see loot boxes back. The sentiment is largely carried by this being a free option for progression. Plus, in my opinion, nostalgia is a factor. The animations and tangible tension, hoping for a legendary drop, all rekindles some of Overwatch 1's original vibes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there are criticisms of loot box's return. With all the aforementioned fines and stories around microtransactions, the tone around loot boxes has shifted quite a bit since Overwatch launched in 2016. And though these boxes are free to stack up over time, there are <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1inywdx/overwatch_2_is_bringing_loot_boxes_back_from_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty outside Overwatch-affiliated spaces</a> who are sceptical about their return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do think this highlights another interesting critique. Overwatch bringing back loot boxes, combined with ongoing 6v6 experiments, the new Perk mechanics, incoming Stadium mode, and more all paint a picture of a studio trying to drastically overhaul its game. The fact that loot boxes seem to be resonating most with the Overwatch fans, both current players and those who have moved onto other games, lends some credence to it. Bringing back loot boxes as a free offering and doling out past cosmetics through it feels like a strong play for nostalgia, a return to an older, "classic" form of Overwatch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing's for sure: Blizzard certainly seems like it's trying to pick up momentum in 2025. Alongside the heroes, cosmetics, and maps you'd expect from a live-service shooter, Perks seem set to dramatically shift the play space, and Stadium could go even further. We'll see how all that, loot boxes included, pans out for Overwatch 2 when Season 15 goes live on February 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is joined by a PlayStation 5 Pro patch, which allows the best resolution while running at 60 frames per second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Detailed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/13/astro-bot-five-new-levels-and-special-bots-begin-rolling-out-today/?sf276380355=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> post, Tick-Tock Shock is the first level available now. Subsequent stages — Thrust or Bust, Cock-A-Doodle-Doom, Hard to Bear, and Armored Hardcore — will be available each following Thursday at 6am Pacific / 9am Eastern / 2pm UK.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Unlike our last update Winter Wonder, which was a walk through the Xmas park, this new update features harder levels to test your jumping skills," said director of developer Team Asobi, Nicolas Doucet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each level comes with a brand new Special Bot to rescue and, once that’s done, can be replayed in Time Attack mode with online rankings."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the third full wave of Astro Bot downloadable content, which began with a similarly structured five speedrun levels after launch and, until this release today, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reveals-free-expansion-coming-to-astro-bot-this-week">most recently saw a special Christmas themed level released</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have long expected more DLC, however, as a number of unreleased bots appeared in the Astro Bots credits. Featured here are licensing credits for Rayman, Worms, Assassin's Creed, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, Croc, and Tomba, potentially revealing which five special bots will be released alongside these levels. That being said, Armored Hardcore is almost certainly a reference to Armored Core, while Cock-A-Doodle-Doom is likely Doom, so bots from these franchises are also likely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-astro-bot-sells-15-million-in-2-months">Astro Bot has proved incredibly popular for PlayStation, having sold 1.5 million units in its first two months</a> on sale and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">earned a 9/10 in IGN's review</a>.

                <p>One of the earlier side quests you can take on in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a> is called "Mapping the Living Lands." You accept this quest from Sanza in Paradis once you get through the first couple of story missions. Sanza employs a cartographer named Geirmund who has gone missing somewhere in Dawnshore and he tasks you with finding him, or whatever is left of him.</p><p>Unfortunately, unlike other side quests in Avowed, Mapping the Living Lands gives you no quest marker on the map, so you have little idea of where to look for the cartographer. While you can stumble about for a bit trying to find Geirmund on your own, you can also look at the guide below to make things far easier on yourself.</p><h2>Dawnshore Cartographer's location in Avowed</h2><p>The only piece of information Sanza gives you about Geirmund's location is to the east of Paradis near a cave. While that might be helpful if you've already explored a large chunk of Dawnshore, that vague description likely means nothing to you if your map is still mostly fogged out.</p><p>To make your trek simpler, you can see the general area of the Dawnshore Cartographer in the map screenshot below:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442424-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.05.53.22.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442424" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442424-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.05.53.22.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442424"></a><figcaption>The quest marker for the Dawnshore Cartographer in Mapping the Living Lands</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442424-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.05.53.22.png"></figure><p>As you can see, the area of the Dawnshore cartographer is right above the Usher's Hand region, which is a brief walk east of Paradis' walls. If you go directly to Usher's Hand, though, you'll be met with a tall cliff you need to climb to reach the cartographer's actual location.</p><p>Inside the quest area, the exact location of Geirmund is right in the center near the God's Gate fast travel beacon. Geirmund is lying on the ground, dead, next to a large stone column. Right beside Geirmund's body is the quest item called "Geirmund's Map," which you need to pick up to progress the Mapping the Living Lands quest in Avowed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442430-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.07.16.53.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442430" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442430-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.07.16.53.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442430"></a><figcaption>Geirmund's map location in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442430-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.07.16.53.png"></figure><p>With Geirmund's Map in hand, return to Sanza in Paradis and give him the bad news about his cartographer. While Geirmund is dead, there are other cartographers out in the Living Lands that you can find as you explore more maps in Avowed. Those are also a part of the Mapping the Living Lands quest, but you can't unlock them until you reach the other maps in the game.</p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a> is the latest RPG from Obsidian Entertainment, the same development studio behind The Outer Worlds, Pillars of Eternity, Fallout: New Vegas, and other acclaimed titles. Set in a fantasy world of magic and curses, Avowed pits you as a Godlike who needs to stop a plague from consuming an entire foreign continent. At the same time, you're an imperial envoy from your homeland and need to contend with political dissidents, assassins, and warring settlements.</p><p>Across your journey in Avowed, you'll complete dozens of quests, recruit several companions, and travel to vastly different environments. One question you might have before jumping into Avowed is exactly how long it takes to beat the new RPG. We'll answer that question for all playstyles in the guide below.</p><h2>How long to beat Avowed - Main story length</h2><p>If you're just looking to beat Avowed's main story, it will take you roughly 25 hours if you breeze right through it without partaking in any additional content. Hopping from main quest to main quest will cause you to miss a majority of the different maps in Avowed, however. The main quests only take you to a few set locations on all of the maps, leaving much of the other areas unexplored if you only stick to the story.</p><p>The main story in Avowed takes place over four different maps, but you unlock each map subsequently throughout the story. The maps are all open world, so you can explore them fully as soon as you enter each one. As you explore the maps, which are uncovered through a fog system, you'll unlock new points of interest, such as fast travel beacons, party waystones, dungeons, etc. Hopping from fast travel points can save you a tremendous amount of time during the main story, but in turn, you need to spend time unlocking those points in the first place.</p><h2>How long to beat Avowed - All playstyles</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442876-avowedscreenshot2025.02.08-21.02.08.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442876" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442876-avowedscreenshot2025.02.08-21.02.08.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442876"></a><figcaption>Avowed is no stranger to unique and compelling locations. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442876-avowedscreenshot2025.02.08-21.02.08.79.png"></figure><p>For main-story enthusiasts who might turn their combat difficulty down to Easy or Story, you can blow through Avowed in around 20-25 hours. What about players who might want to partake in other content, though?</p><ul><li>Avowed features a flurry of short and in-depth side quests that can add hours and hours to your overall playtime  <ul><li>Most of the side quests are relatively easy to seek out, as they're usually available in the hub towns of every map. Completing most or all of the side quests will add anywhere from 15-25 hours of extra playtime onto your playthrough.</li></ul></li><li>In addition to side quests, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-woedicas-inheritance-treasure-map-location/1100-6529372/" data-ref-id="1100-6529372">treasure maps</a> you can purchase that act as quests and bounties to collect across all of the maps. Completing these can add a few hours to your total playtime.</li><li>Finally, if you're a completionist, you can attempt to uncover every single point of interest and completely unfog all four maps in Avowed. This is quite a large undertaking, as the fog system for the maps is precise and only uncovers where your feet travel.</li></ul><p>All in all, here are the playtime estimates for all playstyles in Avowed:</p><ul><li>Main story: 20-25 hours</li><li>Main story + some side content: 35 hours</li><li>Main story + most side content: 40-45 hours</li><li>Completionist: 50+ hours</li></ul><p>Avowed can be a massive game if you explore everything it has to offer. There are dozens of interesting characters and locations to come across along with plenty of secrets on all four maps. </p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

In order to get the most out of each Totem, you will need to find all seven pieces, including the base. The Totem of Rightful Rulership can be found in Dawnshore, the first area.

                <p>It seems like the PS5 and Xbox Series X came out just yesterday, but it appears that Xbox is already looking ahead to the next generation of hardware. A <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-might-legit-publish-more-games-on-ps5-this-year-than-sony-does-gamers-react-to-playstation-state-of-play-and-the-strange-times-xbox-finds-itself-in#xenforo-comments-539992" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new report</a> from Windows Central's Jez Corden says that "Xbox's next-gen console hardware" has moved past early pitch stages, meaning that it's been approved by management for the next stage of development.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not clear what exactly this might mean for the timeline of said console's reveal and ultimate release, but it's a possible indication that Xbox is moving forward with a clear idea for its new console. Xbox representatives have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGlD9SO3rKU">consistently promised</a> that its next console will make the "largest technical leap" ever seen from one hardware generation to another, which is a significant promise, given that the Xbox Series X is already the most powerful console ever made.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently said that the next Xbox should be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-should-be-more-innovative-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529067/" data-ref-id="1100-6529067">more innovative</a>"--what exactly that looks like remains to be seen. Microsoft has continued to embrace its multi-platform strategy, as its recent timed exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-platforms-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6520456/" data-ref-id="1100-6520456">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will hit PS5 next spring. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-may-bring-all-their-big-games-to-ps5-analyst-says/1100-6528617/" data-ref-id="1100-6528617">Rumors and speculation</a> from analysts have big franchises like the new Gears of War or Perfect Dark might come to PS5 as well, given Xbox's stated approach. Meanwhile, PlayStation's recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/">State of Play</a> event featured the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-is-returnal-developer-housemarques-new-game-starring-rahul-kohli/1100-6529469/">Saros</a>, the next game from Returnal developer Housemarque, as well as Days Gone Remastered.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's cross-platform release strategy puts the company in a unique position this year--as it currently stands, there are more Xbox first-party games than Sony titles confirmed for a PlayStation release in 2025.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256" data-mce-href="/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/">February 2025 State of Play livestream</a> on Wednesday contained announcements for several games, but the presentation showcased very few first-party PlayStation games, instead highlighting many third-party titles like Monster Hunter Wilds and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/" data-ref-id="1100-6529459" data-mce-href="/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/">Borderlands 4</a>. The only notable Sony-published PS5 titles shown were a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-rides-for-ps5-this-year/1100-6529467/" data-ref-id="1100-6529467" data-mce-href="/articles/days-gone-remastered-rides-for-ps5-this-year/1100-6529467/">Days Gone re-release</a>, Lost Soul Aside, and Housemarque's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-is-returnal-developer-housemarques-new-game-starring-rahul-kohli/1100-6529469/" data-ref-id="1100-6529469" data-mce-href="/articles/saros-is-returnal-developer-housemarques-new-game-starring-rahul-kohli/1100-6529469/">Saros</a>, which is scheduled for 2026.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-uBOF0T2FY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S-uBOF0T2FY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For those keeping track (and as pointed out by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-newscast-nintendo-everything-we-learned-switch-2-1-1-1" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-newscast-nintendo-everything-we-learned-switch-2-1-1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Sony's PS5 games confirmed for 2025 are Days Gone Remastered, Lost Soul Aside, MLB: The Show 25 (which also releases for Xbox and Nintendo Switch), Ghost of Yōtei, and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. Release windows for Marvel's Wolverine, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, and Marathon from Bungie have yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Conversely, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/" data-ref-id="1100-6529156" data-mce-href="/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/">Forza Horizon 5</a>, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Doom: The Dark Ages, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, Age of Mythology: Retold, The Outer Worlds 2, and Ninja Gaiden 4 confirmed for PS5 this year.</p><p>That's seven PS5 games from Microsoft, not even including the inevitable next Call of Duty game, compared to Sony's own five titles with solid 2025 release windows. It's a bizarre future for console owners dedicated to one brand over the other, but a future we'll all have to get used to as more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-microsoft-decides-when-xbox-games-come-to-playstation/1100-6528310/" data-ref-id="1100-6528310" data-mce-href="/articles/how-microsoft-decides-when-xbox-games-come-to-playstation/1100-6528310/">Xbox properties potentially migrate to PlayStation</a>.</p><p>Of course, the balance between the two competitors in this year's release schedule could shift as Sony announces more dates for its titles. Ultimately, this ironic twist may not matter to Sony, which touted successful hardware sales numbers from its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-just-had-its-best-sales-quarter-yet-ps5-lifetime-sales-now-at-75-million/1100-6529481/" data-ref-id="1100-6529481" data-mce-href="/articles/playstation-just-had-its-best-sales-quarter-yet-ps5-lifetime-sales-now-at-75-million/1100-6529481/">most recent quarter</a>, with 9.5 million PS5 consoles shipped and 75 million sold in the platform's lifetime.</p>
