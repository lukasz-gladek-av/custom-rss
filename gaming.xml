Some days you wake up, look at your copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, with special focus being paid to the fact that its cart is red and not yellow like the old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a> one, and you decide that's just not gonna cut it. No, sir.</p>

<p>Our tale of woe begins on the TikTok of the man in question, where he's posted some pictures of some old yellow DK carts and his disappointingly red Bananza one. Disgusting.</p>

<p>Next, Gardner explains his reasoning in a video posted to his TikTok, before getting to work on spraying:</p>
<p>“If you look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/donkey_kong_land">Donkey Kong Land</a> or Donkey Kong 64, you’ll see they both have these vibrant yellow cartridges,” he says, "I just am unable to play Bananza knowing that I’m putting a red cartridge in my Switch.”</p>

<p>Things start to go wrong when the cart won't fit as it's being pushed in thanks to the fact the label has been messed with. Of course, it then gets completely stuck inside the console.</p>
<p>After attempting to pry at it, pliers are called in, at which point the cart breaks whilst still in the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Now, to round the story off in a less traumatic way than just finishing with a man and his borked Switch 2, Gardner has posted one final video on the matter, in which he addresses some of those who have decided to mock him for his mistake, whilst also going pro-mode on removing the cart from his console.</p>

<p>Thank Goomba for that.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-preview-a-classic-fps-back-from-purgatory.1252044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Outside of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-dark-ages-review" rel="nofollow">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>,&nbsp;</em>it has been a fairly sparse year as far as <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/first-person-shooter" rel="nofollow">first-person shooters</a> go, but&nbsp;an upcoming title hopes to change that by rebooting yet another classic series.&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;is back from the dead, and this time you'll want to take a few friends along for the ride.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's right; differing from the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>from 2004, this is a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/cooperative/games" rel="nofollow">cooperative</a> take on the franchise, which is a bold new direction for the series. With customizable weapon configurations, you'll fight your way through various levels of Purgatory while contending with demonic hordes of foes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-environments.jpg?itok=Wxdhmhb- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-environments.jpg?itok=rlBSq-bX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Environments look quite beautiful, I must say.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Painkiller</em>, Back From the Dead</h2>

<p>The basic gist of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s gameplay is that it's a cooperative shooter supporting up to three players. You and a group of friends tackle linear, but "dynamic" levels with objectives along the way, eventually leading to an ending sequence that might put you against hordes of enemies or even a fearsome boss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our preview for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;comprises two levels as well as access to every weapon and character. First things first, though, a tutorial/prologue session. This tutorial immediately establishes a tone for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller.&nbsp;</em>One could mistake&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>game at first glance, but it sets itself apart by offering comedic quips and humorous writing.</p>

<p><em>Painkiller's&nbsp;</em>lighthearted tone and humorous dialogue clash with its grimdark, Gothic setting of Purgatory, but it's a tone I don't mind at all. Silly&nbsp;dialogue from characters like angel Metatron helps set it apart from other FPS titles with a similar aesthetic. I even found myself chuckling at a few lines of dialogue, and nothing was enough for me to roll my eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-shotgun_0.jpg?itok=MK9cq-X0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-shotgun_0.jpg?itok=SBXQKGZg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A shotgun to the face is always devastating.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Purgatory's Arsenal&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The tutorial goes over the basic elements of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, as any good intro sequence should. Making a return is the eponymous Painkiller weapon, this sort of handheld propeller from Hell. It slices and dices through groups of weak enemies like a hot knife through butter.</p>

<p>Eventually, we're granted two starting weapons: One is the Stakegun, which, true to its name, shoots out giant stakes. The other is the Electrodriver, which rapidly shoots out shurikens and slices through hordes of enemies with ease. At the end of the tutorial, these are your only two weapons players have access to, but you'll unlock more as you complete levels and purchase them.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-weapon.jpg?itok=1uZn_YUe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-weapon.jpg?itok=52xXzDpZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's the eponymous Painkiller.</figcaption></figure><p>Weapons are a huge emphasis here, as they should be -- it's an FPS, after all. With only six weapons at our disposal, it's slim pickings. We can only equip two weapons each run, too. There's no way to change your loadout mid-level, which is a shame since gameplay can start to feel repetitive.</p>

<p>Despite some repetition in the gunplay, it does feel satisfying to mow through hordes of smaller enemies and, even with the larger and more powerful foes, your weapons seem to pack a punch. I wish gore was a bit more visible just to see the impact of your weapons, but shotgunning a group of zombies in the face is never boring.</p>

<p>There's also weapon progression, so as you play, you can upgrade and tweak the way your guns behave after each run. Guns have their own skill tree, essentially, and choosing a path will further upgrade a gun's functionality and make it more powerful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-upgrades.jpg?itok=Qfa58DfU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-upgrades.jpg?itok=pUyoyrW3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The shotgun and its tree of upgrades.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Guns, Tarot Cards, and You</h2>

<p>These upgrades have an effect on your primary fire's behavior, but each gun also comes with a secondary fire, of which there are several to choose from. The shotgun, for instance, can repulse enemies with kinetic force and send them flying off cliffs. Another choice for the secondary is the Freezer attachment, which freezes enemies in a wide area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then come core fire upgrades, so you can have it so that the shotgun shoots slugs, or, for another choice, have it shoot in a wider radius. Each weapon has both these core upgrades and enhancements to secondary fire, so variation is actually quite large. They also come with visual upgrades, which is a neat touch.</p>

<p>These upgrades do come pretty fast, so I worry about how exciting gunplay will feel in the long run, especially when you're stuck with your loadout between each run. Nonetheless, experimenting with different weapon builds is what drove me to continue playing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tarot-cards-painkiller.jpg?itok=aGGygW2l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tarot-cards-painkiller.jpg?itok=14G_2M3M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A bit like gacha, you get what you get and you don't throw a fit.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Another part of your toolkit is tarot cards, which sound exciting on paper, but didn't do much to impress me. You can spend in-game money to roll for new tarot cards to add you your deck, and you can equip two of these. Some of these add base stat increases like more health or damage, while others seem to be very situational.</p>

<p>For instance, one card, Frost Fall, has the effect "Landing from height freezes nearby enemies." Another, called Profane Blessing, grants your weapon 30 percent more damage. Some cards are way more useful than others, as you can see, usually the more powerful ones are also the most mundane.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-smg.jpg?itok=8yW19NHP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-smg.jpg?itok=HqM0gdnx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>And here's a look at the SMG.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tearing Through the Grounds of Purgatory</h2>

<p><em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;touts dynamic levels, so in theory, no run is the same. The two levels available in the demo were, by and large, 99 percent the same. The same exact layout, just with some treasure chests or gold hidden in different areas. I really&nbsp;<em>wish</em>&nbsp;there were more variance to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s levels, because I have a feeling this might get old real quick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Levels are pretty fast, after all, and take around 30 minutes to complete. During this half hour, you'll be running through the level, slaughtering a bunch of weaker enemies, and taking on the occasional powerful foe.</p>

<p>Levels typically have a few objectives you'll need to complete along the way. These instances take place within some well-crafted combat arenas. These arenas take advantage of<em>&nbsp;Painkiller</em>'s run-and-gun. The developer knows how to craft an exciting environment to rip and tear through, I'll give them that.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-level-layout.jpg?itok=Pd-7MFXR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-level-layout.jpg?itok=wU-fx_rg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat arenas look pretty cool! There's a good mix of hazards and platforms to make battle a bit more interesting.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Admittedly, levels are well-made, but feel old upon repetition. I'm not sure if&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;is meant to be played as a one-and-done sort of deal, but the way the gameplay systems are designed leads me to believe multiple runs to upgrade your weapons is the way to go.</p>

<p>If that's the case, I hope Anshar Studios has more than a handful of levels for us to explore, otherwise, I can see&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s online population dropping off quite quickly after finishing their initial run through the campaign. As a game that requires a healthy player base to survive, I'm a bit worried based on what I've played.</p>

<p>You can play with bots, but that's not quite the same experience as playing with humans. Bots are competent enough, but did have trouble following my order to stand on a certain switch or target specific enemies. I also had one instance where a bot died on a spike trap, so another bot went over to try to revive it. They both got stuck and died until their lives ran out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-blood-tank.jpg?itok=ibVkOWq- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-blood-tank.jpg?itok=5nY0ad0P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fillin' up on blood.</figcaption></figure><p>Bots are even more of a nuisance when it comes to completing one certain objective. Your progress will halt when you reach certain checkpoints in the map, so you might have to survive a few hordes of enemies, and then you can move on. Others require you to fill tanks of blood by killing enemies in their proximity, which is simply not fun.</p>

<p>You, as the player, can carry these blood tanks, while the bots can't. Stopping your shooting to reposition these tanks with janky physics is a nuisance, and for some reason, there are quite a few of these objectives within the maps. I'm sure it's less painful to play with actual players, at least.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But still,&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em> desperately needs more variety in the different types of tasks players. Most of the gameplay comprises surviving said hordes of enemies, or filling these blood tanks. That's all. Give us more objectives to do, and make it dynamic. Things get stale pretty fast otherwise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-boss.jpg?itok=YHX_wulD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-boss.jpg?itok=BSvZDUuw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The run ends before we can fight this boss, but I am very interested to see how the fight pans out.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Painkiller </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There is merit to cooperative titles with hordes of enemies. Look at the success of games like&nbsp;<em>Left 4 Dead</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</em>. The difference, though, is that levels are longer and more grander in scope, and enemies are more diverse and complex.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also elements of unpredictability in those types of games, which&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;lacks. The core gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;is solid, and levels are decent enough the first time around, but consecutive runs? I'm not so sure.</p>

<p>I desperately wish for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s success. Levels are richly detailed. Each weapon has more than a few unique quirks about them. Combat areas are vertical, visceral, and well-crafted. But to truly garner attention, I hope for a greater degree of randomization between each run, as well as a stronger progression system. Time will tell when it launches this October.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead Take</em> is a horror game by actors, about actors, and for fans of video games and horror alike, as you step into the aftermath of a glitzy Hollywood Hills party in search of your friend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ahead of the game's July 31 release, I had a chance to converse with Abubakar Salim, the Creative Director of <em>Dead Take</em> and the founder of Surgent Studios, about <em>Dead Take's</em> main characters, unique gameplay elements, and the potentially risky story to tell.</p>


<h2>Actors Playing Actors Auditioning For A Role</h2>

<p><em>Dead Take</em> will follow the journey of two actors: Chase, played by Neil Newbon, and Vinny, played by Ben Starr.</p>

<p>"You'll play as Chase. The game begins as you arrive at the mansion in search of Vinny after a glitzy party, and the story will unfold as you solve puzzles and splice live-action videos together to get deeper inside," Salim said.</p>

<p>While it isn't 100% clear the full nature of the relationship between Chase and Vinny, Salim did expand that "<em>Dead Take</em> is about two actors going for the same role." The announcement of Newbon and Starr as cast in <em>Dead Take</em> introduced them not only as playing their own characters, but that both play the role of Willie.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-interview-ben-starr.jpg?itok=VXSnmt8f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-interview-ben-starr.jpg?itok=9qTm3tQG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ben Starr screaming as if to escape from the game itself</figcaption></figure><p>Video game fans will be familiar with Neil Newbon with his incredible performance of Astarion in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2158b818-8ae7-45f2-997e-44a5977e48f4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, and many know Ben Starr for his roles as Clive in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c87144b4-8f70-4aae-9ed0-f3bc6e8d065e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xvi-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a> and Verso in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07f3b1f2-234f-4782-8556-c21c1fb23302" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></a></p>

<p>In the universe of <em>Dead Take</em> it seems that Chase and Vinny are both trying to book the role of Willie.</p>

<p>"It’s been fascinating to have actors playing actors, because so many things in the game hit so close to home for them," Salim said.</p>

<p>As you progress through the game, you'll get to see these characters showing different approaches to a single role.</p>

<p>Drawing on their own experience, Salim was complimentary of Newbon and Starr not just in their performances but "also when sharing their own experiences in the industry." This involvement throughout the development process helped "shape the narrative in a big way."</p>

<p>There is a dark twist to the performances that we'll see, too. Knowing that the game would be told from the point of view of one actor and we'd get to see multiple live-action performances, I questioned how reliable will what we're seeing as the players be if it's just from Chase's perspective or the perspective of a camera.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-interview-footage.jpg?itok=_VRIV2zI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-interview-footage.jpg?itok=nRixas8B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"When you have big aspirations for yourself, like so many actors have to, you create these grand narratives in order to understand how you fit into the industry," Salim explained. "So much of what unfolds in <em>Dead Take</em> is about those grand narratives, picking them apart to see the awful truth underneath."</p>

<h2>Telling a Dark Hollywood Tale</h2>

<p>Knowing just how specific a story this is, one of "a side of the entertainment industry only discussed in whispers," as the Steam store page cites, I was interested to hear where this idea originated from and what it was like to develop.</p>

<p>"It felt a bit dangerous to me, and once I’d had the idea, it wouldn’t go away. When I told people about it, their reactions were either 'You have to do this,' or 'Ditch this idea, you’re gonna get blacklisted,'" Salim said. "But for me, the most important thing was to acknowledge the elephant in the room. Not everyone with power uses it responsibly, and there’s something about being an artist that makes it doubly insidious."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their reactions were either "You have to do this,” or “Ditch this idea, you’re gonna get blacklisted.”</p>

<p>Knowing that Salim has credits as an actor, director, and producer across live-action, animated, and actual-play content, I was interested to hear what led him to pursue this story in the medium of video games. He explained that he was looking to create a deeper connection to the player.</p>

Not wanting to tell the players how they should feel or interact with the world, but instead to experience the narrative from his view and to then draw their own conclusions.</p>

<p>"It feels more collaborative to me, and I like the feeling of connecting to players in that way."</p>

<p>Seeing snippets of walking through creepy, darkened hallways and reassembling a trident to open a path forward, I immediately thought of games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="33eaca7a-990f-42da-a131-81cbcae617b8" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/resident-evil-9-requiem-closed-door-presentation-shows-classic-re-puzzles-and" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil</a> or newer <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e1e84774-c3b4-4fe9-aa03-b12cca7e88b8" href="https://techraptor.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys" rel="nofollow"><em>FNAF </em></a>games, putting players in a tense situation with puzzles to solve.</p>

"Although there are plenty of puzzles that play on the bizarre mix of items you find in a movie mogul’s house, we also wanted to tap into the reality of being an actor trying to score a role," Salim said.</p>

<p>Referencing the different live-action footage filmed of actors, players will be "finding and splicing together live-action videos." You'll not only be able to solve the mechanical puzzles of the game, but also learn more about who the actors are that you're playing as or trying to find.</p>

<p>"We wanted to tap into the reality of being an actor trying to score a role. For a lot of us, how well you’re doing can be measured by what you’re actually filming: audition tapes? Screen tests? Interviews? There’s something about behind-the-scenes content, showing actors slip in and out of character like it’s nothing, that is so creepy and unsettling, so we wanted to play with that in a puzzle," Salim said.</p>

<p><em>Dead Take</em> releases on July 31 for Steam. Joining Newbon and Starr, other familiar faces that you might see include Jane Perry and Alanah Pearce, as well as Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Travis Willingham.</p>

            <p>The last patch is never the last patch. CD Projekt have been teaching us that lesson for about a year with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is the latest game to have its devs go 'no, wait, one more'. To be fair to Supergiant, they did specify that the roguelike's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-latest-patch-is-likely-the-last-one-before-it-emerges-from-the-early-access-underworld">previous update would "likely" be the last one</a> before full release.</p>
<p>It wasn't. An eleventh early access patch has hit the underworld, but the devs swear it'll be the last one for realsies this time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a gander at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512964244473382774?l=english">notes for patch 11</a>, there's still no release date for Hades 2's full launch, but Supergiant are clearly full steam ahead in their dungeon run towards that goal. The headline note in the patch is some direct prep, with the devs reminding folks that when the game's "True Ending" is deployed, any crafting materials like zodiac sand or void lenses you've collected will be converted to prestige automatically when you first load up your save in 1.0.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a bunch more changes to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms' abilities and aspects, with the Umbral Flames, Moonstone Axe, and Black Coat all receiving nice buffs. As usual, those tweaks are accompanied by a bunch of fiddling with boons, blessings, and Daedalus hammer upgrades.</p>
<p>Hexes'll now be quicker to cast and I'm glad to report that Supgiant have buffed a cat. Well, Toula the wildcat, whom Melinoë can recruit as a familiar in Erebus, but same difference. They're all furry, purry, and wouldn't really care that much if you died, yeah?</p>
<p>The devs have also dialled down the amount of enemies you'll face in any single wave while battling through Olympus, on the summit, or when running into Icarus. The former'll also have more places for you to take cover. There are tweaks to a bunch of common enemies, and Supergiant look to have done more tuning down than tuning up.</p>
<p>You can also no longer die in the time it takes Athena to rock up after she says she's on her way, which sounds handy in avoiding instances of goddesses saying 'Oh nuts, you alright there kiddo?'</p>
<p>Here's hoping we do get that full release date soon, since this (fingers crossed) does look to be the final Hades 2 patch before 1.0. Or maybe it'll just shadow-drop at 3AM on a random Tuesday. As Greek lad Socrates once said, "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sike-hades-2-devs-supergiant-had-another-pre-full-release-patch-hiding-under-their-himation]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> is obsessed with time. From the opening moments, which drops the audience <em>in media res</em>, brilliant scientist Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal) is scouring the cabinets of his 1960s-retro-future-inspired bathroom for iodine. The man known as Mister Fantastic calls out to his wife, Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), to ask where it is. The Invisible Woman quickly responds that she needs twelve seconds. Reed retorts that’s incredibly specific, and it’s the first of many mentions of definitive lengths of time throughout the movie.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It turns out, after two years of trying to have children, one-half of the Fantastic Four is expecting a child. This means Reed’s best friend Ben Grimm, aka The Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Sue’s brother Johnny, or the Human Torch (Joseph Quinn), are going to be uncles. It’s an exciting, well, <em>time</em> for the family.</p><p><em>First Steps</em> takes place at a critical inflection point for Sue and Reed, sure, but also for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it goes through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-dr-doom-doomsday-avengers-1851786672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-dr-doom-doomsday-avengers-1851786672">a creative readjustment</a></span>. Post <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, Marvel films have arrived with a considerable amount of hand-wringing, but the burden of proof feels even heavier for the <em>Fantastic Four</em>, laden with rescuing the MCU from its multiverse doldrums. Doubly so, when the disguised competition <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/superman-post-credits-james-gunn-dcu-marvel-supergirl-1851786204&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/superman-post-credits-james-gunn-dcu-marvel-supergirl-1851786204">just hit a grand slam with the launch of their new cinematic universe</a></span>.</p><p>You’d be hard-pressed to know all this watching a movie that’s this light on its feet. The fourth reboot of Marvel’s first family (but the first from Marvel Studios) is helmed by <em>WandaVision</em> director Matt Shakman, with a script from a quartet of writers: Josh Friedman, Eric Pearson, Jeff Kaplan, and Ian Springer. The result is an entertaining return to form for the MCU, bolstered by stellar visuals and even better performances.</p><figure id="" data-id="3d380d915e3c80ad1a6f8754163d4636" data-recommend-id="image://3d380d915e3c80ad1a6f8754163d4636" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Johnny and Sue chat at the table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Johnny and Sue chat at the table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d380d915e3c80ad1a6f8754163d4636" data-recommend-id="image://3d380d915e3c80ad1a6f8754163d4636" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Johnny and Sue chat at the table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After the reveal that Sue and Reed are pregnant, <em>First Steps</em> kicks into a savvy and breezy bit of exposition, detailing the origins of the team through an Ed Sullivan-esque magazine program. Here we see the team’s past as astronauts, and how they were affected by cosmic radiation that gave them superpowers; a speedy prologue before throwing the four into the movie’s central conflict. Alien harbinger The Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) appears in Times Square to declare the planet marked for destruction by the world-eater Galactus (Ralph Ineson). In an attempt to save their world, the Fantastic Four rocket deep into space to persuade Galactus otherwise, only to learn the celestial creature wants Sue and Reed’s unborn child. Should they refuse, he’ll devour the Earth. Time’s tick, tick, ticking away.</p><p>So begins the central tension of <em>First Steps</em>. The denizens of Earth-828 (fittingly named in honor of <em>Fantastic Four</em> creator Jack Kirby’s birthdate of August 28, and distinct from Earth-616 where most MCU movies are set) aren’t particularly keen on the notion that they’ll die if Galactus isn’t appeased. What was once nervous excitement on behalf of the soon-to-be parents becomes outright fear at the possibility of having to give up something once thought impossible. Thus, the movie becomes a race against time to find a solution that spares Earth but without having to lose their child.</p><p>This worst possible situation brings out the best in <em>First Steps</em>, allowing each of its leads the depth and breadth they need. As the second act unfolds, the thrill is in seeing how each of the main characters reacts to the crisis. For Sue, that’s to find strength in the familial love she’s cultivated, while for Reed it’s about trying to solve everything, even if that means considering the worst possible options. Pascal and Kirby navigate these difficult situations with a welcome sense of maturity—especially by MCU standards—and shine all the brighter because of it. Sue and Reed are a perfect pair—even in the thorniest of arguments, there’s never any doubt about the strength of their relationship. Their big, emotional moments play exceedingly well.</p><p>Johnny and Ben take on more secondary roles, but not in a way that shortchanges their development. Moss-Bachrach’s version of The Thing has melancholy moments of self-reflection, but not at the expense of being the sturdy foundation of this family. He might come across as the brawn, but Ben’s all heart. Johnny, on the other hand, is eager to prove he’s more than a flirty ladies man, and seeing his passions come ablaze is a delight—he shows he’s just as capable as the rest of his superlative super family.</p><figure id="" data-id="aaba06a124aa157df0bcf1e98831c924" data-recommend-id="image://aaba06a124aa157df0bcf1e98831c924" data-format="jpg" data-width="1393" data-height="784" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Thing raises a car above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Thing raises a car above his head." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aaba06a124aa157df0bcf1e98831c924" data-recommend-id="image://aaba06a124aa157df0bcf1e98831c924" data-format="jpg" data-width="1393" data-height="784" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Thing raises a car above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>First Steps</em>’ <em>Jetsons</em>-like, ‘60s retro-future aesthetics make this feel unlike any other Marvel film. Full of color—a blue hue saturates the world—it’s a far cry from the washed-out sheen of most MCU projects. Director Shakman’s framing also results in some awe-inspiring moments: when the family first gazes upward at Galactus, it’s worthy of inclusion alongside Marvel’s most memorable moments. This is a movie full of cosmic scale and spectacle, very much befitting the world Jack Kirby and Stan Lee rendered across dozens of comics back in 1961 when they introduced the team. That grandness is also helped by Michael Giacchino’s score, one of Marvel’s very best.</p><p>Perhaps <em>First Steps</em> stumbles a little in the third act, with the predictability of the plot, the rushed nature of its conclusion, and underutilization of its villains. Galactus is fine—he doesn’t need much more motivation outside of needing to devour. But the Silver Surfer Julia Garner portrays is thinly-drawn, especially when contrasted alongside the Fantastic Four. The sub-two-hour runtime means that once things everything’s in motion, the film moves through big events in quick fashion, brushing past moments that could have used a few more minutes to breathe. Ironically, the film doesn’t have enough time.</p><p>Whether it’s the seconds Reed needs to try to save the world, or the years that could quickly fly by as their newborn child grows up, there’s never going to be enough time to go around. Yet, for the first time in a while, I’ve walked out of a Marvel movie thrilled and entertained by what’s transpired on the screen in front of me.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-movie-marvel-mcu-1851786852]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is out now, and it's having a big start on Steam.

            <p>
Itch.io, the digital distribution platform known for its focus on independent game developers and other artists, has "deindexed" all NSFW content following discussions with payment processors contacted by the same Australian pressure group that recently targeted Steam.
</p>
<p>
Hints that something was afoot on the platform first surfaced on social media earlier today, as itch.io creators began reporting their NSFW games were no longer being displayed in search results. Alarm bells immediately began ringing given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">recent similar events on Steam</a>, which saw Valve "retiring" unspecified NSFW titles and introducing vague new rules banning "certain kinds of adult content" from its store.
</p>
<p>
Itch.io's response, meanwhile, has been even more drastic. It's confirmed the deindexing, albeit temporarily, of "all" adult NSFW content from its browse and search pages. "We are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change," platform founder Leaf Corcoran wrote in a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">statement shared on the website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted on itch.io," it continued. "Due to a game titled No Mercy, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">temporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April</a>, the organisation Collective Shout launched a campaign against Steam and itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms."
</p>
<p>
Collective Shout is an Australian pressure group claiming to be "against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls" and "for anyone against the pornification of culture". Its previous video game activities have included calling for a ban on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> and <a href="https://x.com/CollectiveShout/status/964663931439480834">promoting a 2018 petition</a> to pull Quantic Dream's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>, arguing it depicted "child abuse and violence against women". More successful were its efforts to ban Tyler the Creator from touring the country in 2015.
</p>
<p>
In July, Collective Shout mounted a campaign against Steam and itch.io - presented as an "open letter to payment processors profiting from rape, incest, and child abuse games" - and later took credit for Steam's decision to pull certain adult games, calling it a "win". And its decision to pressure the likes of MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal has now had a similar impact on itch.io.
</p>
<p>
"Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform," itch.io continued. "To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritise our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance. This is a time critical moment for itch.io. The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform's core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologise for the abruptness of this change."

Itch.io says all NSFW pages on the platform will remain deindexed while it conducts a "comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors", confirming the process will result in "some pages being permanently removed". After that, "new compliance measures" will be introduced, including mandating that all creators "confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragami Games and Nada Holdings have announced that they're working together on a new&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>game, as well as an anime adaptation that will presumably focus on the events of the original game.</p>

<p>Following the announcement of the two companies' partnership <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-lollipop-chainsaw-projects-coming" rel="nofollow">last week</a>, a new <a href="https://nadaholdings.com/new-lollipop-chainsaw-ip-development-to-feature-brand-new-game-and-anime-adaptation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the Nada Holdings website confirms that a brand new game is in development. The team includes "key staff members who were involved in the previous title", according to Nada.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the new&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>game will be developed "with close attention to fan feedback", and Nada says it will be free of "excessive creative restrictions in the name of DEI". To that, I can only say "hmm".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-game-anime-juliet.jpg?itok=9RkKZHDi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-game-anime-juliet.jpg?itok=-kcT7BV5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>game is in development.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know whether the new <i>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</i>game will serve as a full sequel to the original or whether it'll be more of a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/travis-strikes-again-no-more-heroes-launching-this-january" rel="nofollow"><em>Travis Strikes Again</em>-style spinoff</a>, but it looks like original co-creators Suda51 and James Gunn will once again not be involved with this project.</p>

<p>As well as the new game, Dragami and Nada also confirmed that an anime adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>is in the works. The announcement doesn't contain any more details about that adaptation, though, so we don't know which studio is working on it or what the story will be.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, it's a hack-and-slash action game developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and originally released back in 2012. The game revolves around Juliet Starling, a cheerleader who must battle a horde of zombies alongside the disembodied head of her boyfriend Nick.</p>




<p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">remastered last year</a>&nbsp;and released for modern systems complete with upgraded visuals and performance. According to Nada and Dragami, the game has surpassed 1.5 million sales so far, which explains why they're eager to create a followup.</p>

Nintendo has put out a couple of big exclusives, sure, but by and large, the draw of the system largely lies in the ability to play games on the go that used to demand you be tethered to a TV. So if you’re thinking of buying the thing in these early post-launch months, you might be wondering what the must-have games it has to offer are. The pickings are slim, but we put together a list of the best games currently available on the Switch 2.</p></div><div><p>CD Projekt Red’s open-world RPG is one of the most impressive technical showcases for the Switch 2 thus far. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> once broke PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones across the globe, but it runs well on Nintendo’s system. Driving around Night City is still a dream, and the Switch 2’s optional mouse controls are pretty intuitive in the game’s shooting segments. There are certainly better ways to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but seeing it running on a Switch 2 is a reminder that while the system might seem like a pretty lowkey upgrade from the original, playing console-quality games on the go is still a novel experience eight years later. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Story-driven RPG fans<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People with a weak stomach for some tough subject matter</p></div><div><p>A divine maiden must be escorted across a corrupted mountain so she can purge its towns, caves, and forests of gruesome demonic spirits. There are lots of ways a game could ask you to do this, but <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> settles on a unique hybrid of tower defense and excellent third-person arcade action. Japanese folklore permeates the meticulous, hand-crafted art direction, and Capcom’s in-house expertise when it comes to tight combat and beautiful animations is on full display. The Switch 2 version doesn’t look quite as polished and pristine as <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> does on other platforms, but it’s still one of the most underrated real-time strategy adventures around, made better by the recent addition of new game plus and endless roguelike modes. —Ethan</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who love collecting orbs</p><p><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Anyone afraid of big, long demon tongues </p></div><div><p><em>World of Assassination</em> is a treasure trove of stealth challenges, each one ending in a satisfying execution of a person you won’t feel too bad about removing from a shadowy world of conspiracy and dark secrets. With three full campaigns, side missions, countless arcade challenges, regular updates featuring celebrity targets such as the recently added Le Chiffre from <em>Casino Royale</em> (played by Mads Mikkelsen), and the endless roguelike Freelancer mode, <em>Hitman</em> <em>WoA</em> is a perfect forever game for those of us who like to sneak around places we’re not supposed to be. True, performance on the Switch 2 isn’t as great as it can be on more powerful hardware, and you do need to be online to access Freelancer mode and many other challenges. But <em>Hitman</em> presents such a rich buffet of unique and memorable stealth sequences, each full of opportunities to come up with an endless variety of clever solutions, that you could easily spend an entire console generation playing it before you feel like you’ve mastered everything the game can throw at you. — Claire Jackson</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who love sneaking around</p><p><strong>Not a good match for:</strong> People who <em>don’t</em></p></div><div><p>It’s no surprise that the two best games on the original Switch are vastly improved in their Switch 2 incarnations. <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>run at a smooth 60fps on the Switch 2, and if seeing these games running on a device that doesn’t feel like it’s struggling to keep them afloat isn’t enough, the Switch 2 editions come with new content thanks to the Zelda Notes app that adds new challenges and lore to two already dense games. If you played them before, they’re worth revisiting. If you never touched Link’s open-world adventures, they’re even more essential on the Switch 2. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who want peak<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People who get overwhelmed with dense systems</p></div><div><p>Nintendo’s biggest launch title for the Switch 2 is still arguably the best game the system has to offer. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is a sublime addition to the kart racer series’ long line of quality party game staples. Though it’s not without its frustrations, <em>World </em>is the chaotic, rollicking fun of throwing a blue shell down a track or barreling through your enemies as a Bullet Bill at its best. The open world is kind of empty, but it’s a fun playground to practice all the cool stunts you can do now, like riding on the wall and grinding on rails. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is all about giving you the freedom to race how you want, and that means giving you more tools, more players on the track at once, and more bothersome items to chuck at your foes. This is only the beginning, and Nintendo will likely be updating the game for years to come. <em>Mario Kart World </em>will undoubtedly be a staple of the Switch 2’s lifetime. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Everyone, really<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Anyone looking for something chill</p></div><div><p>Y’all, it’s a damn galaxy in your pocket. Do I even need to say anything else? Over the years, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has continued to improve, expanding the potential of what you can do in its virtually endless playground of procedurally generated planets and ecosystems. Being able to jump into your ship and fly directly to a planet you can see off in the distance hasn’t gotten old since 2016. Though there are many quests and neat challenges you can take on, you don’t have to; <em>NMS</em> is the game you want to make out of it. Want a hardcore survival experience across the vastness of a simulated galaxy? It’s here. Want to set up an oxygen farm on a remote moon somewhere? Time to get digging. Want to catalog all of the lifeforms on a planet that’ll take you hours upon hours to walk across? Lace up your boots. Hello Games’ massive space sim works really well in portable format, whether you’re playing online or off. Dogfights in space. Finding planets no one’s seen before. Seeing a gorgeous vista where you can seamlessly travel to virtually anything you can see. When you’ve an appetite for galactic expeditions, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is here to deliver multiple courses. — Claire Jackson</p><p><strong>A good match for:</strong> Digital space explorers who aren’t afraid to find their own fun</p><p><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Folks who find survival mechanics overbearing or want a more traditional, guided gaming experience</p></div><div><p>Hazelight’s co-op platformer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span> doesn’t feel built for the Switch 2. Its split-screen format makes it a pain to play in tabletop mode, so it’s really best played on a TV like you would on your PS5 or Xbox. But once you’ve got it running on a big screen, the game is still a hoot. Though its cheesy writing leaves much to be desired, as a cooperative platformer with a ton of mechanical and environmental variety, it’s easily the best in Hazelight’s long history of co-op games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868">That final level still whips ass, too</a></span>. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Someone with a friend to play with<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Someone who doesn’t have a friend to play with</p></div><div><p>Fighting games were always going to be one of the biggest tests of the Switch 2's technical capabilities, and Capcom thankfully managed to bring one of the best genre entries in recent years to the system without much compromise in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span>. Some of its Switch 2 features, like amiibo support and motion controls with the Joy-Cons, feel like cute nods to the system’s original features rather than something that fundamentally changes the game, so you’ll most likely go right back to standard play before long. Once you do, though, you’ll find a really great version of an already stellar game running at a smooth 60fps. Sure, it’s probably not going to be the version people are playing at EVO, but it’s more than good enough to break out at the function and play with friends. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>The fighting game sickos<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People who don’t like to memorize combos</p></div><div><p>Donkey Kong and Pauline’s latest adventure is one of the Switch 2’s most impressive technical achievements.

Is it the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">cultural moment the system needs to bring people in out of the gate</a></span>? Maybe not. But it’s still an absolute delight worth booting up if you’ve got the system in its first few months. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>People who wanted <em>King Kong </em>to have a happier ending<br><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>People who can’t move on without finding every collectable in a level</p></div><div><p>Shin’en Multimedia is back, filling another <em>F-Zero</em>-sized hole in another Nintendo console launch. <em>Fast Fusion </em>is a simple but slick racer in which you zip through crisp, hyper-realistic sci-fi courses snagging speed boosts and avoiding crashes. There’s a jump button because it’s fun to jump when it feels like you’re about to break the sound barrier, and a new mechanic that lets you combine two vehicles together to take advantage of their combined stats. It’s better than it has any right to be and a fun, flashy exclusive to show off Nintendo’s new console. — Ethan</p><p><strong>A good match for:</strong> Unreal Engine sickos who love <em>WipeOut</em></p><p><strong>Not a good match for: </strong>Those who get easily carsick</p></div><div><p>The life sim RPGs that helped define the modern Nintendo handheld landscape are alive and well on Switch 2, and <em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em> is the best of them when it comes to rewarding grinding loops that give you a fair bit of freedom. It’s a city builder, survival crafting sim, and simple action-RPG all rolled up into one, with a pleasant art style and music by longtime<em> Final Fantasy </em>composer Nobuo Uematsu. There are so, so many parts, and the sum of each of them offers a progression loop that’s rewarding and compelling enough to make up for its flaws. —Ethan</p><p><strong>A good match for: </strong>Those who wish <em>Final Fantasy V</em> was more like<em> Animal Crossing</em></p><p><strong>Not a good match for:</strong> People who hate experiencing life through menus </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-games-mario-kart-donkey-kong-1851786840]]></content:encoded>

Yes, <em>that </em>James Gunn — long before his days making <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/superman-2025">Superman</a> and running the DCU, and still a couple of years before the first Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's press release states that the franchise has so far shifted 1.5 million units, though the vast majority of these — at least 1.24 million — are sales for the original game, rather than its recent remaster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That remaster drew something of a mixed response, as it lacked the original game's licensed music soundtrack and arrived later than expected — after Dragami switched from its original plans to fully remake the game. This initial idea was ditched, purportedly after fans said they were keen to play a remastered version of Lollipop Chainsaw as close to the original as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's announcement of a sequel again makes mention of a desire to develop a second game that was in line with fan wishes. There's also mention that "key staff members" who worked on the original game were back for the sequel, though no mention, as expected, of any involvement by Suda51. Or James Gunn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Under the strong partnership between Nada Holdings and Dragami Games, development is already underway on a brand-new Lollipop Chainsaw title that both preserves and builds upon the appeal of the original," today's announcement reads. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With a firm commitment to honoring the spirit of the original work, the development team includes key staff members who were involved in the previous title. The new project is also being developed with close attention to fan feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement then concludes with this — an oddly-worded affirmation that the sequel will continue the "distinctive tone" of the original and not tone it down due to "DEI". Is this a reference to Suda51's most recent No More Heroes letting Travis Touchdown wear a "F**k Racism" hoodie, or something to do with James Gunn's Superman, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-gunns-superman-immigrant-comment-was-a-mistake-that-could-hurt-the-films-box-office-former-superman-actor-dean-cain-says">which seems to have upset Fox News</a>? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or, perhaps, it's simply a suggestion that fans of the original's skimpy cheerleader costumes won't leave empty-handed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As with the original, the new title aims to recreate a world rich in dark humor," the announcement concludes. "The development process will prioritize staying true to the distinctive tone and spirit of the original work, without imposing excessive creative restrictions in the name of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no word yet on when Lollipop Chainsaw 2 will launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> reports that an estimated 512,000 Pro Controllers were sold in the US in the first month of the Switch 2's release, which is a huge number considering the luxury controller isn't necessary for playing the console or any of its launch games, and the original Switch's Pro Controller is also compatible. It's also worth noting that the Pro Controller saw a $5 price hike after its announcement, likely due to concerns around Trump's import tariffs.</p><p>Of course, the kind of consumer who is buying a console at launch is likely to be the same kind of consumer who splurges on extra accessories, so the Pro Controller's adoption rate is unlikely to stay this high for long, but it's still an impressive sales stat for the brand-new console.</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Piscatella gave the caveat that it's difficult to predict how well a console will do throughout its lifespan from its early sales, as early sales usually just reflect how much supply the company has made available. That's not to say the Switch 2's numbers aren't still impressive, with Piscatella calling the console's launch month sales a "helluva good start" towards long-lasting success.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You can’t talk about Wild Hearts S without understanding what’s gone before. This Switch 2 port comes some two years after Koei Tecmo’s ambitious hunting game appeared on other platforms, taking the monster hunting formula that Capcom originated, and building something that retained enough of the familiar framework, while creating new gameplay experiences within it.</p>
<p>It did an excellent job of it too, with Wild Hearts right up there as the best non-Capcom hunting game we’ve ever had. Here, Wild Hearts S brings the game to Nintendo’s brand-new portable, retaining all of the game’s previous updates and improvements, expanding the original’s three-player parties to four, while shrinking and compressing everything down for the portable platform. In doing so, it’s not necessarily the best place to play, but in a post-Monster Hunter Wilds world, Wild Hearts S sets out its stall as a compelling alternative.</p>
<p><iframe title="WILD HEARTS S: Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGflRQNZk-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The original Wild Hearts pushed its platforms to the limit. I’ve played on PC and PlayStation 5, and while my PC brute-forced its way through many of the more challenging sections, the PlayStation 5 version looked decidedly less polished than you’d expect. Some of that was due to the scale and detail that Koei Tecmo pumped into each area, as well as the incredible monster design, while some of it was poor optimisation. It’s fair to say that these issues persist in the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>As a game that’s been out for a couple of years, and which has received a steady stream of updates, I was expecting a flawless experience on Switch 2. That has, however, not been the case. The frame rate drops below 30fps, stuttering through heavily detailed, larger areas, while there’s visible pop-in as assets stream into place. That’s on top of lacklustre snow effects, flat or reduced textures and a visual grain that makes everything look that bit less detailed. It’s not a great look on the new Nintendo hardware.</p>

<p>That said, it runs well enough the rest of the time, the majority of the central action feeling quick, challenging and enveloping, particularly when playing on handheld, which smooths out some of the issues.</p>

<p>This is a hunting game. The central loop sees you take your character into a large, distinct area, seeking out one of the insanely large, naturalistic monsters known as Kemono, and then whittling down its health with a series of sword, hammer, or spiky umbrella strikes. Killing them grants you a bevy of monster bits that you can then use to make new weapons and armour. So far, so Monster Hunter.</p>
<p>The added wrinkle here is the Karakuri. You can conjure up hunting tools to aid you in battle, and while these start off as a series of crates that you can clamber up and leap off of, they soon expand into barriers, weaponry and traversal tools, with an exciting and interesting combo system that gives hunts a new, more frantic and freeform feel, clearly differentiating Wild Hearts from its inspiration.</p>
<p>Wild Hearts S’ Japanese-style setting still makes it feel like a companion to Monster Hunter Rise, both exploring the mythology and potential of that setting, while playing with the core hunting mechanics. Wild Hearts S is less bombastic, and manages to make its characters that little bit more compelling, a touch more human, than Capcom’s, though it lacks the solidity and assurance of Rise’s well-established monster roster and mythology.</p>

<p>It’s Monster Hunter Wilds, though, that is currently on the minds of hunting fans. The clear advantage that Hearts S has over it is its difficulty level. While it streamlines some of the aspects of Monster Hunter, giving you options to help locate your prey, and doing away with crafting for health potions and other items, Wild Hearts S boasts a series of creatures that will decimate your health if you’re not incredibly tuned in and aware. You need to grind for parts, upgrade your equipment, then snatch the correct moment to attack, bring the Karakuri to bear at just the right time, and it feels, for all intents and purposes, like an older Monster Hunter game. Wilds is brilliant, but, it’s not hard enough. Wild Hearts S is.</p>
<p>While Koei Tecmo have expanded the hunting party size to four for Wild Hearts S, there’s no crossplay available with the other platforms, making it feel strangely lonely for a multiplayer title. I’m sure that new Switch 2 owners looking for a Monster Hunter kick will find a lot to like in Wild Hearts S, but sticking with three players or updating the other consoles to match the new four player count and having crossplay would have helped Koei Tecmo establish a wider community for the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, Sucker Punch <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Ghost of Yotei would last roughly as long as Ghost of Tsushima. Now, in another pre-release interview, the Seattle-based development studio has discussed the map size.</p>



<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ghost-of-yoteis-map-is-about-the-same-size-as-ghost-of-tsushimas-the-devs-didnt-want-to-compromise-on-density-for-a-larger-map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Automaton Media</a>, Sucker Punch revealed to have adopted the same vision. They didn't want to have to produce filler content for a much larger map. However, they did make sure to make the map feel grander, which is appropriate since this setting is much larger in real life than that of the previous game. </p>



<p>Jason Connell, Co-Director of Ghost of Yotei, explained:</p>



<p><em>Even though the map is roughly the same size, Hokkaido is obviously much larger than Tsushima in real life, so we concentrated our efforts on making the world appear larger than it actually is. You’ll see vast plains and massive mountain ranges towering in the background. This is all scenery that wasn’t as present in Tsushima, and it’s designed to help players feel the scale of things.</em></p>



<p><em>If we did that [doubled the size of the map], we’d have to fill the map with twice the content, and that content would need to be meaningful so as to not tire the player. Ghost of Tsushima was already a big enough game, so rather than upscaling just for the sake of it, we chose to focus on delivering more variety and higher quality while maintaining a similar scale.</em></p>



<p>The development team also improved exploration gameplay in various ways:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yotei includes various systems and details aimed at making exploration feel free and rewarding. For example, running through flowers increases your movement speed, and if you follow these flower trails, you might discover hidden secrets. We’ve also added new items like telescopes and binoculars to allow players to enjoy the scenery. All these details work together to ensure that players won’t get bored even on a large map</em>.</p>



<p>Ghost of Yotei launches on October 2 for Sony's PlayStation 5 console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Itch.io has announced that it's deindexing all of its adult-oriented NSFW pages from search engines and browsing due to "scrutiny from [its] payment processors".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the Itch.io website, Itch.io says it understands this is a "sudden and disruptive" action, and that creators weren't provided with advance notice beforehand, which it acknowledges is "not ideal".</p>

<p>However, the site says it recently came under "scrutiny" from its payment processor partners regarding "some content hosted on Itch.io", pointing specifically to a campaign started by Collective Shout earlier this month that drew payment processors' attention to a game by the name of&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-deindexing-adult-content-main-page.jpg?itok=Xdbp_IWq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-deindexing-adult-content-main-page.jpg?itok=2t9gwK3d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Itch.io is deindexing all of its adult content pages due to controversy surrounding a game called&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Collective Shout released an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">open letter</a> to payment processors like PayPal, Mastercard, and Discover, outlining the (admittedly rather disturbing) ways in which&nbsp;<em>No Mercy "</em>fl[ies] in the face of efforts to address violence against women".</p>

<p>In the letter, the group says the fact that Itch.io and Steam hosted the game effectively means payment processors are "facilitating and profiting from rape, incest and child sexual abuse game sales", which led to Itch.io's decision to deindex adult pages.</p>

<p>Itch.io says it's in the process of "conducting a comprehensive audit of content" to ensure it meets payment processors' requirements, and that pages will stay deindexed while the review is conducted.</p>

<p>Once the review is complete, new compliance measures will be introduced, including a checkbox creators must tick in order to "confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account". Some pages may also be permanently removed.</p>

Last week, Valve <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-pulls-adult-only-games-from-steam-as-it-tightens-rules-to-appease-payment-partners" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">began the process</a> of pulling dozens of sexually explicit games from Steam, citing concerns from its payment processors regarding the nature of said games.</p>

<p>It's been a weird twelve months for Itch.io; back in December, the site was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-offline-funko-phishing-brandshield" rel="nofollow">taken offline for several hours</a> following a phishing claim from the toy brand Funko, which site founder Leaf Corcoran called "bogus" (the claim, not Funko itself). Funko and its partner BrandShield <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funko-brandshield-itch-io-denial" rel="nofollow">denied causing the shutdown</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like this situation is going to be resolved quite as quickly as that one was, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Say what you like about Valve, they make the trains run on time. Eventually. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> got a small surprise update yesterday which changed the speed of a train in the 2004 shooter's driving sequence (the level called "Highway 17"). This change will let you once again beat said train in a game of chicken that it has been winning against most players for nearly two decades.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Restored speed of the train near the end of Highway 17 to better match the original shipped difficulty," the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/220/announcements/detail/507335122931941415?snr=2___">somewhat belated patch notes read</a>, alongside a couple of other fixes. 

</p><p>The train in question approaches the player head-on during a tense moment in the dune buggy level, and you hear its whistle through the fog before you even see it coming. In the original release, you could easily boost on towards the train, and nip out of its way just in time, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pXGl-exT8o">you can see here</a>. </p>
<p>But when the driving physics were updated alongside the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2-episode-two">Half-Life 2: Episode Two</a> back in 2007, that feat became <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/220/discussions/0/4629232489537269257/">much, much harder</a> (though not impossible). The strategy then became <a href="https://youtu.be/HU6duSquajs?feature=shared&amp;t=3998">reversing and waiting until the train passed</a>. It's likely if you've only played the shooter since then, you'll think of this as the only way to progress. But now we know: you were always meant to beat that train. </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>There were a couple of other corrections to the beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>. "Fixed missing collision that was allowing NPCs to shoot through some walls in Entanglement," the patch notes continue. "Fixed issue where Alyx could obstruct the player's path when boarding the teleporter near the end of Entanglement."</p>
<p>I don't know about wallhacking Combine soldiers, but the latter bug regarding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYlHX9-IxVY">a stubbornly unmoving Alyx</a> is not a long-standing bug, but a trickling hangover from Half-Life 2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-is-20-years-old-and-has-been-updated-with-steam-workshop-support-and-developer-commentary">big 20th anniversary re-jig</a> last year. While I like to imagine there is a lone caretaker employed solely to give the venerable manshoot laughably nitpicky tweaks and bugfixes long after its debut, it's more likely that these are just the last few tidy-up jobs following the anniversary update.</p>
<p>After all, it isn't the first time we've seen the game get re-tweaked because of its birthday makeover. We previously reported how one invisible wall in a sewer pipe was removed because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-added-an-invisible-wall-to-this-sewer-pipe-in-half-life-2-in-their-anniversary-update-but-it-only-annoyed-speedrunners">it annoyed speed runners</a>. I wonder how these latest fixes help or hinder such sprinters.</p>
<p>Still, it is fun to imagine that one dedicated person at Valve, whether they exist or not, who goes to work every day frustrated and disgusted at the missing collision walls of the tenth level in a shooter from 20 years ago, who daily boots up the Radiant level editor to fiddle with its Windows XP-era interface just to fix a problem few other souls care about. Godspeed the invisible Half-Life 2 caretaker.</p>

			<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-hands-on/">Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades</a> bring a slew of improvements that vastly enhance the experience, but the latter's upgrade also misses an important opportunity.</p>



<p>In a new in-depth analysis by Digital Foundry of the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades for the two open-world entries in the series, it's confirmed that Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom still uses AMD FSR 1 in the upgraded version. AMD's upscaler is mentioned in the game's Intellectual Properties page, and a deep look at the game's image quality confirms that it is still being used, leaving a lot of distracting flicker in view during gameplay. This is most definitely a missed opportunity, considering the Nintendo Switch 2 supports the superior NVIDIA DLSS upscaling solution that has already delivered impressive results in several launch titles.</p>



<p>Despite the above and a few other issues, such as issues with shadows not being completely fixed on Nintendo Switch 2, and a draw distance that's mostly identical to that of the original system, both Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are very solid upgrades. The higher dynamic resolution range in both docked and handheld mode returns a sharper image, which improves gameplay by making it easier to spot items on the ground from a distance, for example, and the new higher-quality environmental textures make both games more pleasing as a whole. The rock solid 60 FPS in both games, the faster load times and the implementation of the Zelda Notes round up two upgrades that are among the best we have seen to date.</p>

<p>Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are hardly the only games to have received significant improvements on Nintendo Switch 2. Splatoon 3, for example, sees an <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-increases-resolution-six-times-splatoon-3/">enormous resolution boost</a> on the system, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/">unpatched games</a> running at unlocked framerates often hit 60 FPS with no trouble.</p>

            <p>The director of the upcoming Resident Evil film has assured fans of the series this adaptation will "rip", and admits to not actually seeing any of the previous movie attempts as "the games are [his] thing".</p>
<p>Zach Cregger - whose previous work includes 2022's Barbarian, which our Matt describes as "wonderfully unpredictable" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">was first announced to be helming the next Resident Evil movie in March of this year</a>. Since then, the director has assured fans that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-be-unlike-any-of-the-previous-adaptations-says-director-as-euphoria-actor-eyed-for-starring-role">his adaptation will be "unlike any of the previous films" in the franchise</a>, which may not exactly be a bad thing.</p>

<p>Now, Cregger has shared a little bit more about what moviegoers can expect on the film's release, and it sounds like the director will be working with a deep knowledge of the source material.  "I love the games," Cregger told <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/resident-evil-reboot-movie-zach-cregger-tease-games/">Comic Book</a>. "I played all of the games. I played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> a hundred times through. I'm obsessed with it. And so, I just want to tell a story that feels like it's honouring the experience you get when you play the games."</p>
<p>Cregger added he hasn't "seen the movies", because "that's just not my thing". The game series, though, well "that's just a playground I just love," the director said. "I think the movie is going to rip. I think it's going to rip".</p>
<p>Cregger's latest comments on the Resident Evil film, which is set to star Euphoria actor Austin Abrams (pictured below), come as some plot points have leaked. <strong>This is your cue to head elsewhere if you want to keep your next Resident Evil cinema trip as spoiler-free as possible</strong>.</p>

<p>According to internet tipster <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/residnet-evil-134395521">Daniel RPK</a>, Cregger is working from the following synopsis: "Bryan, a laid-back organ courier, is sent on a late-night delivery to Raccoon City General Hospital. En route through a snowy mountain road, he accidentally hits a strange woman with his car</p>
<p>"She survives - but something is very wrong. As he tries to help, Bryan stumbles into a full-blown outbreak involving horrifying tentacle-based mutations and bio-engineered monstrosities" (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/resident-evil-movie-plot-leak-zach-cregger-3229632/">Dexerto</a>).</p>
<p>Bryan is reportedly the character Abrams will play. In terms of the game series, the only Brian that comes to mind is corrupt RPD Chief Brian Irons (pictured below), who is an antagonist in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>, but it doesn't sound like this is the same character. Unless this film will serve as some kind of prequel, backstory type set up for future adaptations, and change the spelling of Bryan's name.</p>
<p>Cregger's Resident Evil film is expected to be released on 18th September, 2026.</p>

<p>As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, we recently got news of the next mainline installment, known as Requiem. Anticipation for this release is already pretty high, as in June Capcom announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-already-looks-set-for-massive-success-as-it-hits-significant-wishlist-milestone">over a million of us had already added Resident Evil Requiem to our wishlists</a>.</p>
<p>We got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">in the end decided he was "actually quite a bad match for horror"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak]]></content:encoded>

"We understand this action is sudden and disruptive, and we are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change."</p><p>"Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted on itch.io", they go on to explain.

To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance.</p><p>This is a time critical moment for itch.io. The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Not every page, game or other work will be affected permanently; Itch say that they took everything down so that they could perform a "comprehensive audit", and that once this is done they'll introduce new “compliance measures”, which will "will include a new step where creators must confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account".</p><p>Those works that <em>are </em>affected permanently will be removed from the site entirely.</p><p>All of which sounds <em>incredibly</em> dystopian; the idea that faceless, unaccountable payment processors--which enjoy vast monopolies over the world's commerce, and by extension its marketplaces--can wield their power so swiftly, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aclu.org/post/3lu466bamb225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as they've increasingly been doing now for years</a>, is downright terrifying.</p><p>Itch's emergency deindexing comes only days after a similar effort by Valve, which<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> saw changes made to Steam's policies</a> and the<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> removal of a number of adult titles from the platform's marketplace</a>.
