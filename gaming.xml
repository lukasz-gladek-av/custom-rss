			<p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v31-20-stop-doctor-doom-in-day-of-doom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battle Royale v31.20</a>, players can participate in <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-able-to-run-on-ipad-out-of-the-eu-using-brute-force/">Fortnite</a>'s latest game mode, "Day of Doom." In this game mode, players can team up with Marvel's Avengers and work to halt Doctor Doom's conquest. This game mode is inspired by the Endgame LTM from Battle Royale Chapter 1 Season 8. For anyone wanting to participate in the Day of Doom game mode, it will be in Discover until October 4 at 9 AM ET / 6 AM PT / 2 PM BST.</p>
<p>Up to 32 players can participate in the Day of Doom Fortnite game mode, where players can split up into two teams: Doom's Henchmen and Allies of the Avengers. This allows you to decide whether to be the hero or the villain during your time in the event.</p>
<p>For those who play as Doom's henchmen, you have to work to collect six Arcane Artifacts. Once collected, the Avengers will no longer be able to respawn. The first henchman to collect an Arcane Artifact will then be transformed into Doom's Chosen, where the player becomes unstoppable, wears Doom's armor, and utilizes catastrophic abilities. Additionally, the rest of Doom's henchmen will join the match and immediately have access to strong weaponry, such as Doctor Doom's Arcane Gauntlets.</p>
<p>Those who want to save the day will be part of the Avengers and have to team up with the Island's strongest heroes to take down all of Doom's henchmen before they collect all six Arcane Artifacts. Compared to the Avengers, the henchmen have a big pool of respawns. To win as the Avengers, you must defeat Doom's henchmen, including Doom's chosen. Every respawn, the Avengers in the Day of Doom event will be given one of four randomly assigned loadouts based on a different Avenger.</p>
<p>Aside from the Day of Doom event in Fortnite, there are also the Stark Mobile Armories that fall from the sky in Battle Royale and Zero Build. The airborne armory comes in two designs: Iron Man or War Machine.</p>
<p>Once you have gone inside the armories, you can get yourself some futuristic gear by interacting with the Iron Man Armor Stand, which will either give you items pertaining to Iron Man's kit or War Machine's kit.</p>
<p>Additionally, Iron Man appears in the shop, with players able to get hold of cosmetics such as the Iron Man Mk 45 Outfit, the Energy Collector Back Bling, Mark 45 Bass, and more. Of course, there are also Iron Man cosmetics for the Fortnite Lego if that is more your style.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-financials-first-half-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team17-says-2024-releases-brought-in-less-than-10-of-revenue.983055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-financials-first-half-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Worms&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose&nbsp;</em>publisher Team17 has released its financial report for the six months ending June 30th, and it looks like the studio is pretty heavily reliant on its back catalog for income right now.</p>
<p>In Team17's <a href="https://www.team17groupplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/H124-Results-presentation-FINAL-ex-SR.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial results presentation</a>, the studio says that just 8% of its revenue in the first six months of 2024 came from new releases, constituting around £6 million (roughly $8 million).</p>
<p>By contrast, 92% of Team17's revenue, amounting to about £74 million (that's around $98 million), for this period came from back catalog releases, which essentially means any game released prior to January this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/team17-financials-classified-france-44.jpg?itok=d2MSbQzR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/team17-financials-classified-france-44.jpg?itok=JIS6OZy6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Team17's release slate this year includes the tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>Classified: France '44</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio puts this down to "a competitive market with a tough FY23 comparator", likely indicating that Team17's 2023 release schedule was stronger for the first half of the year; it did, after all, include cozy horror game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dredge"><em>Dredge</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trepang2-release-date-mails-love-letter-to-00s-shooters-in-june">2000s shooter tribute</a>&nbsp;<em>Trepang2</em>.</p>
<p>Team17's back catalog, however, "performed very well", according to the studio. Back catalog sales were up 30% in the first half of 2024, apparently driven by "excellent lifecycle management and consumer behavior", according to the presentation.</p>
<p>In fact,&nbsp;<em>Dredge&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Trepang2&nbsp;</em>both now constitute part of Team17's back catalog, as does last November's&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous 2</em>, which I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-second-verse">reviewed for this very site</a>. These games, as well as others, "delivered strong performances", Team17 says.</p>
<p>According to Team17, the first six months of 2024 evidenced "lower expensed development and marketing costs" for the studio, with a "significant reduction in expensed development costs" happening due to "studio cost restructuring and ongoing cost controls".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blasphemous-2-team17-financials.jpg?itok=S1Hh1FK_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blasphemous-2-team17-financials.jpg?itok=jieg__h0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Blasphemous 2&nbsp;</em>is now part of Team17's back catalog.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to its future, Team17 says it will "double down" on its "indie focus", and that it will also "prioritize evergreen franchises", which makes sense given the disproportionate sales impact of its back catalog so far this year.</p>
<p>You're also going to see <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-acquires-bus-simulator-21-developer-astragon">more mergers and acquisitions</a> from Team17, as well as a "sharpened greenlight process". We'll have to wait and see what all this means in practical terms, but in the meantime, you can read Team17's <a href="https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/team17/news/rns_widget/story/wv37z3r" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full half-year financial report here</a> if you wish.</p>

            <p>I started playing and enjoying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">battle royale</a> wizarding sim Spellbreak just in time for Spellbreak to get shut down. Developers Proletariat, Inc announced plans to yank the servers back in August 2022 in the course of being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-acquire-spellbreak-studio-to-focus-on-world-of-warcraft-expansions">acquired by Activision Blizzard</a>, bringing an end to many happy hours spent skating on conjured ice ramps and hurling boulders around like bunny rabbits. Yes, I am the kind of wizard who hurls a bunny rabbit, if there are no boulders to spare.</p>
<p>Happily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, <a href="https://sbcommunity.itch.io/spellbreak-community-version">available on Itch.io</a>. You’ll need to host your own server or join another group if you want to play multiplayer, but all the same, this is a lovely gift and one I’m delighted to transmit unto you, the active and efficient Magenauts of Rockus Paperus Shottegonne.</p><!--more-->

<p>This isn’t strictly speaking “news”, I'll grant you, inasmuch as it is not new. The Community Version released way back in December 2022, months before I joined RPS as a full-time Scuttlebutt Conjurer. I've only just stumbled on it <a href="https://x.com/DominicTarason/status/1835788217066328209">care of</a> former RPS Scuttlebutt Conjurer Dominic Tarason. You might accordingly accuse me of being “bad at my job”, but I would immediately retort that a wizard is never late, nor is he early – he arrives precisely when he means to, and also, if you don’t shaddap I’m going to sock you right in the kisser with an electric tornado.</p>
<p>If you’ve never played Spellbreak, here’s a quick summary: it’s got the usual battle royale premise of a large, multiple-biome map with people competing for power-ups and gear drops while racing to the centre, but it spices things up with, well, magic. As in Magicka – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/magicka">Magicka</a>! My beloved - you can combine spells of different elements to produce some properly apocalyptic whizbangs. It’s also very fast. These ain’t your classic octogenarian warlocks in heavy, star-spangled dressing gowns. They’re hot young people who zip about like ninjas.</p>
<p>If you’ve downloaded the Community Version, and you’re looking for opponents and advice, the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/elemental-fracture-1023813169124221009">Elemental Fracture discord</a> seems quite populous.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Efforts to preserve, spotlight, and celebrate important games of the past have been gaining steam in recent years. Consider, for instance, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/atari-50-game-history-adventure-centipede-2600-5200-1849841460&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/atari-50-game-history-adventure-centipede-2600-5200-1849841460">Digital Eclipse’s <em>Atari 50</em></a></span>, a compilation of games from across that company’s history that provides wonderful context in the form of interviews and archival materials, illuminating their colossal impact on gaming. Now, we have another such compilation: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>UF0 50</em></a></span>, a collection of 50 games from UFO Soft, the business-software-maker-turned-game-developer that, across the 1980s, was responsible for dozens of gems which simultaneously reflected the larger gaming trends of the time, while also innovating and pushing the medium forward in their own right. There’s just one small but crucial detail here, however, that sets <em>UFO 50 </em>apart from any other such compilations: UFO Soft never actually existed.<br></p><p>That’s right, <em>UFO 50 </em>is, for lack of a better term, a “fictional” game compilation, though the games are very real. Here, in their entirety, are 50 games–not minigames, mind you, not little playable demos, but full-length, complete gaming experiences–from a company that never existed. Developers Derek Yu (<em>Spelunky</em>), Jon Perry (<em>Air Land &amp; Sea</em>), and musician Eirik Suhrke (<em>Hotline Miami</em>) spearheaded the project, but they and the other devs actually responsible for the games here are fully committed to the bit. If you beat a game here, it’s the fictional devs of UFO Soft whose names you’ll see on the staff roll. Instead, Yu and the others responsible are listed in the compilation’s opening as “the UFO 50 Recovery Team.” In this sequence, we see them digging an old gaming computer out of someone’s storage unit and beginning the process of recovering these games for preservation in this collection. “Whenever possible,” we are told, “the integrity of the original software was preserved.”<br></p><p>The 50 games here present a picture of a company that, in 1982, took its tentative first step into game development with the challenging and mysterious adventure game, <em>Barbuta</em> (“Developed secretly on company time, it almost got Thorson Petter fired,” an in-game factoid tells us), and that, by 1989, was producing games like the vibrant, multi-genre <em>Cyber Owls</em>, “launched alongside an original comic book series.” At every step, UFO Soft was both responding to current gaming trends and establishing its own identity, producing games that tried to capitalize on popular new genres and tendencies in game design while also bearing their own distinctive authorship.<br></p><p>And this, in my view, is essential to what makes <em>UFO 50 </em>so fascinating. Often, modern retro games wear their references a little too proudly, containing winking references to games of the past as if to say to you, “We know you like Classic Game X! We like Classic Game X, too! See, we’re doing that thing you liked back when that game did it!” There’s none of that here in <em>UFO 50</em>. This game believably creates a kind of pocket dimension in which UFO Soft actually existed, creating games that capitalize on the rapidly improving game hardware of the 1980s but that aren’t beholden to what everyone else was doing.<br></p><p><em>Barbuta</em>, for instance, feels roughly on par with something you might see on the MSX in the early 80s, while <em>Cyber Owls </em>feels akin to an elaborate blockbuster that might have arrived on the NES in 1989, when developers were figuring out how to make the most of that console’s power. (Similarly, it doesn’t cheat with trends or genres, either. UFO Soft makes a beat-em-up, for instance, but not before beat-em-ups exist.) But this isn’t, thank goodness, a compilation in which you’ll find one-to-one clones of the era’s hits. There isn’t UFO Soft’s take on <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. here, though you’ll certainly see elements from games you know and love, which makes it feel as if UFO Soft was around at that time and in conversation with what the rest of the game development landscape was doing. Sometimes I’d dive into a game and say, “Oh, cool, this feels like it’s riffing on <em>Blaster Master</em>,” or “Okay, I can definitely see elements of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/cEcxgPvmQqU?si=jIjrcEV1yKl2UB0M&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/cEcxgPvmQqU?si=jIjrcEV1yKl2UB0M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Space Taxi</em></a></span><em> </em>here,” but these games also always felt distinctive, as if made by people with their own ideas, who wanted to make their own contribution to the medium.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="8bb412f191d26cbbec311fca2a312a42" data-recommend-id="image://8bb412f191d26cbbec311fca2a312a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hero recoils as struck by an orc’s club in a moment from Valbrace." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The hero recoils as struck by an orc’s club in a moment from Valbrace." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Who knows what mysteries are lurking in the depths of Valbrace’s dungeon?</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mossmouth</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8bb412f191d26cbbec311fca2a312a42" data-recommend-id="image://8bb412f191d26cbbec311fca2a312a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hero recoils as struck by an orc’s club in a moment from Valbrace." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To give you a quick sense of the breadth of what’s on offer here, I’m going to highlight five of the games that have stood out to me most in my time with <em>UFO 50</em>. (Remember, there are 50 games here. I’ve played about ten hours of <em>UFO 50 </em>in all, so to say that I’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s available here is an understatement.) The one that’s grabbed me the most right out of the gate is <em>Valbrace</em>, a tough action-RPG released, the game’s fiction would have it, in 1988. I haven’t made it very far yet, but its fusion of twitchy combat and first-person dungeon crawling is immediately appealing, and I’m determined to level up my intrepid adventurer and find out what awaits in the dungeon’s lower levels. It also reminded me of how, in the 1980s, it was always exciting if I equipped some new weapon or armor on a game character and their sprite changed. It’s a little thing but it went a long way toward making the visuals feel more immersive and responsive to me as a player. <em>Valbrace </em>has that, and I felt that same little thrill I felt as a kid when I spotted it for the first time.<br></p><p>Next, there’s <em>Rail Heist</em>, a fascinating hybrid of real-time and turn-based gameplay with destructible environments in which each stage is a kind of puzzle. Playing as a member of a train-robbing crew in the Old West, you must figure out how to get the money on the locomotive out from under the noses of the lawmen guarding it.

Ostensibly released in 1989 and the “final” game in this compilation, <em>Cyber Owls </em>shows the developers at UFO Soft pulling out all the stops to make an elaborate multi-genre hit. The rogue commando group H.A.W.K. has acquired a doomsday weapon, putting the whole world in danger, and naturally, the president calls upon the only heroes who are up to the task of thwarting their deadly plans: the Cyber Owls. Each of the four missions your cadre of elite avian agents must undertake is wholly distinct: one’s a beat-em-up, one’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmncTQi7Me0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmncTQi7Me0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cabal</em></a></span>-style shooter, one’s a <em>Metal Gear</em>-esque stealth mission, and one’s a side-scrolling vehicular shmup. What really makes it all work for me, though, is the way that it actually feels like it’s based on a Saturday morning cartoon or comic book. As you progress, you encounter an assortment of villains who easily could have belonged to the rogue’s gallery on a show that fused <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </em>with <em>G.I. Joe</em>, and it feels like the devs gave some real thought to fleshing out this fictional late-80s IP.<br></p><p>And yet, that very brief overview of five of the included games here–just one tenth of the entire library–is wholly inadequate at trying to convey the experience of actually playing <em>UFO 50</em>. For one, there are so many other types of experiences here. There’s a game with <em>Smash T.V.</em>-style arena shooting. There’s a first-person horror adventure game that plays similarly to <em>Shadowgate </em>or <em>Deja Vu</em>. There’s a Japanese-style RPG set in a Wild West world. There’s a strategic deckbuilder of sorts in which you try to have the right assortment of people in your Rolodex to ensure your parties are a rousing success. There’s a wonderfully strange puzzle platformer in which you deliberately sacrifice your character’s lives to create a path for the lives that follow. And so much more. The real point of <em>UFO 50</em>, if it can be said to have one, lies not in any individual game, as great as some of them are, but in the variety and richness of what they offer when collected here.<br></p><p>Playing <em>UFO 50 </em>feels something like being dropped off at your grandparents’ house as a kid and finding that they have an old console you’ve never heard of and a library of games you know nothing about. You’re probably not going to love all of them, but that’s actually good, I would argue. <em>UFO 50 </em>would probably be a much safer and more limited collection if it felt calibrated for maximum mainstream appeal; part of what makes it so great is that, while a number of games here may not quite click with you, they will all probably really click with <em>someone</em>, in a way games only can when they take chances and feel like the work of individuals rather than a committee. There’s joy and excitement in the act of exploration and discovery, in encountering something inscrutable and pushing up against it until it starts to click for you. (Pro tip: If you find a game particularly hard to penetrate, just let it sit on the title screen for a minute. There’s a chance that, like many actual games of the era, it will start a demo sequence that at least offers some clue as to how to approach it.)<br></p><p>And while some of these games might have been minor hits today on Steam if they were released independently, <em>UFO 50 </em>is so much more than the sum of its parts. Hopping around from game to game here, playing them alongside each other and in the context of each other, what emerges is not just a collection of fun, inventive, and incredibly varied games that could have been made in the 1980s, but weren’t. This is an ode to innovation and game design itself, a celebration of those visionaries who, in gaming’s early days, had fresh, original ideas and pushed a burgeoning art form to its limits in order to realize them. This is a tribute to the people behind one of the most exciting eras in game history, a time when new genres and new concepts were appearing all the time. And, in that way, it also feels to me like a statement about what matters most in game design. It’s not the biggest budgets or the most polish. It’s creativity and experimentation, a willingness to try new things and keep pushing a young medium forward. With any luck, we’re just getting started.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA announced that its DLSS 3 technology will be featured in four of the biggest PC game releases out this week.</p>
<p>Square Enix's Final Fantasy XVI, which will be launched in just a few hours on Steam, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation</a>, DLAA, and Reflex. If you're planning to play on your own PC, make sure to <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-released-supports-final-fantasy-xvi-god-of-war-ragnarok-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download the latest optimized Game Ready driver</a>. If you prefer the cloud, Final Fantasy XVI is also playable via GeForce NOW, and DLSS 3 is supported there for GFN Ultimate subscribers.</p>
<p>At 4K resolution and with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode, the GeForce RTX 4090 averages 173 frames per second in Final Fantasy XVI, while the RTX 4080 SUPER registered 134 FPS, the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER stops at 118 FPS, and the RTX 4070 SUPER at 105 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other major launch of the week is Sony Santa Monica's God of War: Ragnarok, due on Thursday, September 19. Once again, DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex are all supported. DLAA isn't there, but there are unofficial ways to add it. According to NVIDIA, DLSS 3 lets you play God of War: Ragnarok at nearly 200 frames per second (4K resolution with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode) with a 2X performance boost if you own a GeForce RTX 4090. The RTX 4080 SUPER gets nearly 160 FPS, the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is almost at 140 FPS, and the RTX 4070 SUPER is almost at 120.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Capcom's Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is also scheduled to be released on September 19. Powered by the RE Engine, the remaster offers the same NVIDIA feature set as God of War: Ragnarok.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Enotria: The Last Song, the Soulslike game developed by Jyamma Games and inspired by Italian folklore, also supports NVIDIA DLSS 3 and Reflex. The game described as 'Summer Souls' debuted yesterday <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102450/Enotria_The_Last_Song/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-fully-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pathea Games has fully revealed&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, the third game in the&nbsp;<em>My Time&nbsp;</em>series, and it comes complete with a new art style, city management elements, and more.</p>
<p><i>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</i>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-pathea-games">teased a couple of weeks ago</a>, but today, Pathea has revealed more information about what the game will actually be, and the studio says it's designed to "appeal to both life simulation fans and RPG enthusiasts".</p>
<p>The studio is promising a 40-hour storyline "brimming with exploration", as well as a "diverse cast of romanceable characters" and "revamped gameplay mechanics", so if you were expecting a low-effort sequel to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-sandrock"><em>My Time at Sandrock</em></a>, it looks like you'll be pleasantly surprised.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-reveal-combat.jpg?itok=8t9G11E0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-reveal-combat.jpg?itok=e8gcSMuy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>will feature "deep role-playing elements", according to Pathea.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike in&nbsp;<em>Sandrock&nbsp;</em>and its predecessor&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-portia"><em>My Time at Portia</em></a>, in which you played as a builder "tasked with completing essential jobs" to keep your town running,&nbsp;<em>Evershine&nbsp;</em>will cast you as the town's governor.</p>
<p>The game will take place in a new settlement "on the fringes of the Free Cities", and you'll be facing down the Duvos Empire, recruiting settlers and creating a stronghold from which to resist a "more defined antagonist" than in previous series installments.</p>
<p><em>Evershine</em>'s campaign will fully support co-op for up to four players, although you can, of course, still enjoy it solo if you want to. It'll also feature "town management" gameplay for the first time in the series.</p>
<p>If you want to get a look at&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>in motion, you can check out the game's announcement trailer right here.</p>

<p>As well as all the above, Pathea says&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>will also support modding for both single-player and multiplayer, so if you're the kind of person who likes to switch up their gameplay experience, you're in luck.</p>
<p><em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>is still "very early in development", according to Pathea, but the studio is launching a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign for the game</a> on September 24th, which is also when we'll get to learn more about it.</p>
<p>When it does eventually launch, you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">future Nintendo platforms yet to be announced</a>", Pathea says. Stay tuned for more.</p>

You’d be hard-pressed to find a “bad” film from the Studio Ghibli co-founder, so this piece is more about ranking from great to masterpiece rather than from good to bad. Miyazaki’s meticulously crafted, hand-drawn animations are colorful and imaginative spectacles with strong female characters, fascinating fantasy creatures, and strong takes on environmental justice.<br></p><p>Hayao Miyazaki’s films may be animated, but they explore mature coming-of-age themes such as developing compassion, individuality, strength, and independence. There’s a deep and thought-provoking wisdom beneath his exciting adventures and magical worlds, which makes his films resonate with audiences of all ages. Read on to see how I ranked each of Hayao Miyazaki’s masterpieces, and see if you agree. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-recommend-id="image://3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man sits on top of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man sits on top of a car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Toho Co., Ltd / Columbia Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-recommend-id="image://3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man sits on top of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s unfair to compare <em>Castle of Cagliostro</em> to Hayao Miyazaki’s other films because it was not only his feature film debut but also part of the <em>Lupin III </em>franchise, a popular manga and anime series about legendary thief Arsène Lupin going on daring heists around the world. This time, he wants to rescue Princess Clarisse from being forced to marry a count. This is not one of Miyazaki’s more personal and imaginative stories about environmental justice, coming of age, or resilient female leads, but it does have some enjoyable broad comedy.<br></p><p>The animation is not as intricate as in his later films, but you can certainly see Miyazaki’s flair for whimsy in the thrilling set pieces such as car chases, clock-tower fights, and villains getting trapped in a castle’s catacombs. <em>Castle of Cagliostro</em> is a romp, and though it doesn’t reach the heights of the rest of Miyazaki’s filmography, it’s exciting to see the kernels of what the legendary director would become known for. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cbb6bf774b8dc75785f364f5a25556e2" data-recommend-id="image://cbb6bf774b8dc75785f364f5a25556e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pig pilot gives a thumbs up.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Porco Rosso</em> is one of Hayao Miyazaki’s silliest films, telling a tale about a World War I fighter pilot who is turned into a pig. With his devil-may-care attitude and salty humor, the various hijinks he gets into are a delight to watch. As with most of Miyazaki’s films, the highlights are invigorating action scenes (in this case, aerial ones) that show off fast-paced, slick animation.<br></p><p>The surly Porco humorously contrasts with the strong-minded female characters like Fio, the plane repairwoman, and Gina, who is in love with him and unfazed by his pig-like appearance, and since Porco exudes so much confidence, her love seems perfectly believable. <em>Porco Rosso</em> is a playful adventure that lightly touches on much deeper themes of wartime trauma and fascism, in ways that only Miyazaki can.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-recommend-id="image://0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ponyo floats in front of a boy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ponyo floats in front of a boy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Walt Disney Pictures / Toho Co., Ltd.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-recommend-id="image://0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ponyo floats in front of a boy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Ponyo </em>is one of Hayao Miyazaki’s most light-hearted films and an adaptation of Hans Christen Andersen’s <em>The Little Mermaid</em>. A five-year-old boy named Sosuke discovers a goldfish that wants to be a human little girl—even though this upsets the balance of nature and is against the wishes of her father, a sorcerer who lives in the depths of the ocean. After she gains the ability to become human and chooses to stay on land, a giant tsunami wreaks havoc on Sosuke’s coastal town, satellites fall from the sky, and the moon spins out of orbit.<br></p><p>Despite this, there’s lots of adorable, family-friendly humor to be found in Ponyo’s misunderstanding of life on land, along with quirks like her obsession with ham and the gleeful wiggling of her new toes. The story is thin and predictable, not quite as profound as Hayao Miyazaki’s more original fantasies, but the visuals of Ponyo’s underwater world are truly stunning—the vibrant schools of sea creatures, the amoebas, and the fish-shaped waves that Ponyo skims across are all eye-popping.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-recommend-id="image://11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A girl looks up with an adorable fox-like creature perched on her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl looks up with an adorable fox-like creature perched on her shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Toei Company / Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-recommend-id="image://11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A girl looks up with an adorable fox-like creature perched on her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> is grand in scale and has powerful ecological messages, with a story of two nearby nations at war amidst an environmental wasteland. Nausicaä is the first of many of Miyazaki’s intelligent and brave heroines who must navigate a post-apocalyptic world. Her adventure takes her the Toxic Jungle, a thicket of giant plants, fungi, and huge, creepy-crawly insects, in search of hope and healing. </p><p>There’s a lot of visual variety in this film’s landscapes, from the rolling green hills and peaceful windmills of Nausicaä’s country home to ancient, magical ruins and dense, mysterious forests. But the highlights of <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind </em>are its action-packed flying scenes in which Nausicaä soars swiftly on her glider while warriors maneuver their giant bomber-like planes around her. It’s a rousing journey that is clearly in awe of both the beauty and mystery of nature, reminding us of our duty to protect our planet.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7d4a181bba1cb4ed348435a3c516e26" data-recommend-id="image://e7d4a181bba1cb4ed348435a3c516e26" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sheeta and Pazu stand with arms around each other.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The title itself, <em>Castle in the Sky</em>, brings to mind an otherworldly spectacle, and the film gives us one: Laputa is a magical kingdom hidden amongst puffy clouds and shadows and one of Miyazaki’s most visually stunning settings. The quest young Pazu and Sheeta embark on to reach the titular castle is filled with action, high stakes, and drama. Sheeta and Pazu share a heartwarming friendship that’s tinged with romance—Sheeta is bashful and withdrawn, while Pazu is more lively and exuberant.<br></p><p>Their contrasting personalities make them compelling characters. They are both equally protective of one another; Sheeta bravely wants to finish the mission on her own so that Pazu is not hurt, but he refuses to leave her side. <em>Castle in the Sky </em>also features some of Miyazaki’s most vibrant villains, including an old crone and her quirky group of sky pirate sons and the stoic, deceitful Colonel Muska, who relentlessly pursue Sheeta’s crystal amulet. <em>Castle in the Sky </em>is a soaring fairy tale with a classic good-versus-evil story. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e49ae4cdbf5444cbdca4306890ec48ea" data-recommend-id="image://e49ae4cdbf5444cbdca4306890ec48ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with a bandage on his head stands in front of a house.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Released a decade after his intended retirement, Hayao Miyazaki made <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> at 82 years old. The ambitious film treads familiar territory as a young boy goes on a journey to a brightly colored fantasy world where the living and the dead live in harmony (and there’s also an army of human-like parakeets). Set in 1940s Japan, the film centers 12-year-old Mahito, who has been mourning the death of his mother in a hospital fire after a Tokyo bombing raid by the Allies.<br></p><p>Miyazaki confronts this devastating event in a harrowing flashback sequence, set against a nearly black background, with huge balls of fire raining down on the city—it looks like hell on Earth. Miyazaki uses a hazy, sketch-like animation style to evoke the pain of Mahito’s memory. It’s a very visceral way to confront the audience with the pain and devastation of war, showing how trauma lives inside victims, especially the young ones, forever.<br></p><p>Mahito’s grief allows him to become easily swindled by a mysterious bird, voiced by a gravelly Robert Pattinson, who promises to reunite him with his mother. While <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> explores the ideas of grief, legacy, and family—which feel especially poignant coming from an older filmmaker—the story doesn’t quite come together as much as in Miyazaki’s other films, and the fantasy world is not as striking.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6a975579366955120ceb8a248fa14f4" data-recommend-id="image://a6a975579366955120ceb8a248fa14f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Howl embraces Sophie.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sophie is a quiet and insecure young woman who, after receiving attention from a handsome wizard named Howl, is cursed by an envious witch. Transformed into a short crone, Sophie volunteers to work as a cleaning lady in Howl’s castle, a steampunk patchwork of wood and metal that loudly lumbers through the countryside. Sophie is kind and hardworking, while Howl is vain and self-absorbed, often throwing tantrums if his hair dye doesn’t turn out right. Despite his flaws, though, he has a good heart. Their differences make the romance that develops between them an enchanting watch.<br></p><p>The castle is also home to other eccentric characters that add a lot of humor, like Calcifer, a fire demon voiced by Billy Crystal, and a cute scarecrow named Turnip Head. Miyazaki ties all of these whimsical elements together with a poignant anti-war message, as you’d expect. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-recommend-id="image://a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Princess Mononoke stands next to a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Mononoke stands next to a wolf." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Toho Co., Ltd. / Miramax</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-recommend-id="image://a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Princess Mononoke stands next to a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Princess Mononoke</em> takes a more biting, intense approach to environmentalism than some of Miyazaki’s other films. It’s a lengthy, sprawling epic about a young man involved in a war between the forest gods and a mining colony. He comes across the iron-willed Mononoke Hime, a young woman raised by the wolf god Moro. A nimble warrior and princess who wields a bone knife and spear, she’s not afraid do whatever it takes to protect the forest gods against the humans who have been systematically destroying their home. Princess Mononoke loves and fights fiercely, making her a bewitching heroine.<br></p><p>Unlike the fanciful creatures of Miyazaki’s other works, the animals in <em>Princess Mononoke</em> are more life-like, majestic, and hauntingly beautiful, and their detailed animation is breathtaking. There’s a towering elk with impressive antlers, a massive wolf, and the Forest Spirit—an awe-inspiring figure resembling both a stag and a mythical Kirin from Japanese folklore. <em>Princess Mononoke</em> does not hold back on the violence and suffering that comes standard with environmental destruction, making this high fantasy epic one of Miyazaki’s darkest and most powerful films.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4292f58267a27e02ab5d8eaa8cefa230" data-recommend-id="image://4292f58267a27e02ab5d8eaa8cefa230" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jiro Horikoshi looks up at a plane.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Aside from a continued fascination with flight, <em>The Wind Rises</em> stands apart from Hayao Miyazaki’s other films. There are no mythical realms with fantastical creatures; instead, it’s a sophisticated World War II biopic of Jiro Horikoshi, the Japanese engineer who designed the fighter jets used at Pearl Harbor. Taking some creative liberties with Horikoshi’s life, <em>The Wind Rises</em> explores complex ideas about the price of artistic creation.<br></p><p>Miyazaki contrasts the lovingly crafted details of Horikoshi’s sleek machines and the serene countryside where they were created with the destruction and havoc these machines cause in the world, an internal struggle Horikoshi grapples with throughout the film. These contemplative themes are complemented by Jiro Horikoshi’s touching romance with a woman named Nahako. They meet unexpectedly during an earthquake and never forget one another until they reunite years later. After quickly falling in love, they marry when Nahako is diagnosed with tuberculosis.<br></p><p>The final words on the screen, “The wind rises...We must try to live” are a poetic reminder that although we are constantly swept away by the difficult changes of life, we must adapt to them. The sensitive, humanistic approach to adapting the life of a real person whose passion had severe global repercussions makes <em>The Wind Rises</em> one of Miyazaki’s greatest works.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c54a119fcaf18cac5945096406d021a3" data-recommend-id="image://c54a119fcaf18cac5945096406d021a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kiki and her cat fly on a broomstick over the ocean.

At 13, all witches must live independently and discover their “special skill” and Kiki decides to explore flying, which she uses to start a delivery service for a bakery in a quaint coastal town. The gentle charm of <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service </em>lies in the various townsfolk she encounters—like a rambunctious little boy with a huge, sleepy dog, an artist who wants to paint her, and kindly elderly ladies Kiki helps with household chores.<br></p><p>We follow the small, everyday challenges she faces, from hauling packages up tall stairs to dealing with a mischievous gust of wind that makes her lose her first delivery. <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service </em>builds to a thrilling climax in which Kiki must rescue her friend from a burning blimp. It’s a sweet, cozy coming-of-age journey that beautifully captures the uncertainties and heightened emotions of growing up and going out on your own.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b02d88732f949c78ffef57a6ab16bbe1" data-recommend-id="image://b02d88732f949c78ffef57a6ab16bbe1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Totoro and kids sit on a tree branch over a river.

Not much happens in this simple tale about sisters adjusting to their new rural home while their mother recovers in the hospital, but it has so much imagination and heart. The lovely and uncomplicated narrative lets you focus on the magical forest spirit Totoro, a gentle giant with a fluffy, gray body and tall ears.<br></p><p><em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> is mostly composed of cute, breezy vignettes of Totoro and the sisters engaging in various activities: learning how to use an umbrella, making trees grow out of the ground with a dance, and flying through the air while hanging onto Totoro’s belly, overlooking the entire countryside. There are other enchanting creatures, too: dust bunnies, a giant cat bus with glowing eyes and mice for headlights, and tiny little Totoros that scurry through the forest. There’s a very emotional climax in which the 4-year-old Mei argues with her older sister Satsuki and gets lost, but for the most part <em>My Neighbor Totoro </em>is just a simple story about the magic of being a child. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c58d58ede18a18df6253ee7279799dc5" data-recommend-id="image://c58d58ede18a18df6253ee7279799dc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chihiro looks shocked.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Spirited Away</em> has all the elements that make Hayao Miyazaki’s films so unique, but with a darker, Grimms’-fairy-tale-esque edge. 10-year-old Chihiro gets  swept away to a dreamlike fantasy world, but not one of excitement and adventure—one of uncertainty and danger. She must face numerous trials to rescue her parents who have been transformed into pigs.<br></p><p>While working at a spirit bathhouse, Chihiro meets surreal creatures that really show off the power of Miyazaki’s designs: evil twin witches, a giant baby, and No-Face, a masked spirit who grows larger with everything and anything he consumes. There’s also the repulsive Stink Spirit, a huge puddle of sludge, and the Susuwatari, small fuzzballs whose entire existence revolves around endlessly putting coal in the bathhouse boiler. </p><p><em>Spirited Away </em>is Hayao Miyazaki’s most mesmerizing film, thanks to its inventive design, sensitive portrayal of childhood fears, and suspenseful story. It’s an absolute classic that transcends the genre. <br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Building on the overwhelming success of its predecessors, <em>My Time at Sandrock</em> and <em>My Time At Portia</em>, this new chapter innovates and redefines the life-<a title="Genres > Simulation [568 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> genre. Designed to appeal to both life-simulation fans and RPG enthusiasts, <em>My Time at Evershine</em> features deep <a title="Genres > RPG [16,614 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">role-playing</a> elements, from meaningful character progression to expansive exploration and quests. Pathea invites everyone to build a new home together.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The multi-million selling <em>My Time</em> series expands with a fresh and exciting formula that builds on everything players loved. Featuring a stunning new art direction, revamped gameplay mechanics, a diverse cast of romanceable characters, 40-plus hour narrative brimming with exploration and, new to the series, town <a title="Genres > Management [26 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>. RPG fans will find themselves right at home.</p><p>In <em>My Time at Portia</em> and <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, players embraced the role of the builder, tasked with completing essential jobs to keep the town running—often taking on work others avoided. <em>My Time at Evershine</em>, however, introduces a fresh dynamic, transforming the player’s role and elevating you from builder to Governor. As the city’s key figure, you’ll start with nothing more than a modest campfire, but your vision and leadership will drive the development of the entire city and its citizens. With other characters handling the smaller, routine tasks, your role as Governor feels more relaxed, giving you the freedom to focus on shaping the city’s future and dive into the dangers that await.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>All New Story-Driven Campaign</strong> – Be the Governor of a brand-new settlement on the fringes of the Free Cities, facing the almighty Duvos Empire. Recruit settlers, build infrastructure, tame the wilds, and lead your people to create a new idyllic stronghold for the Alliance filled with enchanting characters and memorable stories to enjoy. This new sequel will feature a more defined antagonist, bringing even more <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,755 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> and excitement than ever before.</li><li><strong>New Art Direction</strong> – <em>My Time At Evershine</em> is the most beautiful and realistic game in the franchise to date. Environments are more expansive and varied, characters look more realistic, and animations are motion-captured to create a more believable world.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Multiplayer [381 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> Cooperative Play</strong> – For the first time in the <em>My Time</em> series, the campaign can be enjoyed both solo and in <a title="Genres > Co-Op [201 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op</a> mode with up to four players, making it perfect for family and friends. The host controls the pace of the main story, while all players share resources and money, allowing everyone to collaborate and contribute to the adventure together.</li><li><strong>Build a Society</strong> – This ambitious sequel casts players as the all-powerful Governor, who can not only build new facilities, and explore but also command a team of recruitable and customizable NPCs. These NPCs handle the day-to-day tasks like construction and resource gathering, allowing the Governor to focus on more important decisions.</li><li><strong>Meaningful Relationships</strong> – Social play was a key part of <em>My Time at Sandrock</em> and <em>My Time at Portia</em>. In <em>My Time at Evershine</em>, Pathea Games is set to expand these systems even more. Players can recruit up to three followers to stay with them during day-to-day tasks or they can dispatch them to do their bidding across Northern Eufala. Pathea Games is targeting eight to 10 romanceable characters in the campaign with dozens of other characters spread throughout the game. Players will also have to take their followers’ needs and wants into account with tiredness and hunger impacting morale and performance. RPG players will love the deep character interactions and the ability to forge meaningful relationships, with romanceable characters integrated into the storyline and more opportunities to develop connections earlier in the campaign.</li><li><strong>Tame A Wild New Frontier</strong> – Three years after the events of <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, the Duvos Empire has taken over the Orzu Ruins which Ethea also claims as their own, leading to a tense situation just north of the Alliance of Free Cities border in the Northern Eufaula region. In response, the Alliance has launched the North Development Plan to move settlers into the area and establish a new City-State for better defense. Evershine is one of six major new settlements in the area and will prove pivotal in the ongoing hostilities.</li><li><strong>Mod Support</strong> – <em>My Time at Evershine</em> will include full mod support for both single-player and multiplayer modes, allowing players to customize and expand their RPG experience. Whether you’re playing solo or with friends, the possibilities for creativity and new content are endless.</li></ul></blockquote><p>More new features will be announced when the game’s Kickstarter campaign opens.</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

                <p dir="ltr">The kart racer Disney Speedstorm has already included a wide selection of racers from new and classic films across Disney animation, Pixar, and even live-action franchises. But so far the game has not invited Maleficent to join the competition, and we all know how she feels about being snubbed. Gameloft has announced Maleficent will join with a Limited-Time Event during Season 9, Part 2, and we have a first look at the trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">Maleficent is a Trickster racer, meaning her class specializes in disrupting other racers and has an enhanced speed boost ability. Her unique ability, Mistress of Evil, has two applications. The standard attack has her raise her staff to call down lightning on the track in front of her, and successful hits will gain her a flame. Under the charged version, collecting six flames will activate her Dragon form, transforming Maleficent and her kart into a dragon that flies (in autopilot) at increased speed, and takes out any racers in her way.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Though Gameloft has not announced the details of her LTE, these events generally run for about a week and let you unlock new racers through completing a series of objectives with your other, already-unlocked racers. Maleficent joins as the special unlockable character in this part of the season, joining Cruella who was added during the last part.</p><p dir="ltr">Disney Speedstorm is currently in Season 9, Part 2. Speedstorm's Golden Pass track was split into two parts per season recently, and all of Season 9 is themed after Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean. The Pirates franchise was already represented by Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann at launch, but the new season adds a new Pirates track along with four more Pirates characters: Davy Jones, Will Turner, Hector Barbossa, Tia Dalma.</p>

            <p>Sundance audience award-winning documentary The Remarkable Life of Ibelin - which tells the story of quadriplegic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> player Mats Steen - is set to debut on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> next month.</p>
<p>Norwegian gamer Steen battled the degenerative disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and passed away in 2014 aged 25. However, during his 25 years, he touched many lives via his World of Warcraft avatar, Ibelin.</p>
<p>"Unbeknownst to his relatives, Steen was able to form deep friendships across vast distances, because of his passion and pastime," reads a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/ibelin-release-date-trailer-news">Netflix feature</a> on the documentary.</p>

<p>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin has been brought together by filmmaker Benjamin Ree, and features interviews with Steen's friends and family.</p>
<p>In addition to using archival footage, Ree also worked with animators on the documentary. These animators "used models lifted directly from the game to show viewers exactly what [Steen] would have seen as he played the game between 2004 and 2014".</p>
<p>When Ree finished creating The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, the filmmaker asked World of Warcraft developer Blizzard would consider waiving its intellectual property rights so the film could find a release. After watching the documentary themselves, and hearing Ree had "no plan B", the company's executives acquiesced.</p>
<p>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin will be available to stream via Netflix from 25th October. You can check out a trailer for the upcoming documentary above.</p>
<p>"It's a huge honour that Ibelin will now be on Netflix," Ree said. "Mats Steen's story will be available to so many millions of people across the world.</p>
<p>"I couldn't be more excited."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-v-pc-finally-gets-anti-cheat-might-be-about-to-get-ray-tracing-too/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1835989031714169035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1835989031714169035%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Rockstar leaker Tez, the PC version of GTA V was updated earlier today to add the third-party anti-cheat system BattlEye, a popular software used in games like APB Reloaded, ARK, Arma, Battalion 1944, Conan Exiles, DayZ, Destiny 2, Escape from Tarkov, Fortnite, Insurgency, Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, PlanetSide 2, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, PUBG: Battlegrounds, Skull and Bones, The Crew, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, Watch Dogs: Legion, and XDefiant.</p>
<p>The lack of a proper anti-cheat system has long been the source of complaints among those who play GTA Online, the multiplayer mode of GTA V, on PC. BattlEye could certainly help improve the cheating situation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tez also looked into the new files released with the update and <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1836008467066147071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1836008467066147071%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noticed</a> a leftover metadata file that reportedly hints at Rockstar working on porting the next-generation update released on consoles to PC. GTA V on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X has included ray traced shadows and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-gets-ray-traced-reflections-on-ps5-and-xsx-still-no-word-for-pc-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ray traced reflections</a> for years now, so it might finally be time for PC players to get a visual upgrade.</p>
<p>Even with the bulk of Rockstar busy on GTA VI (currently slated to land in Fall 2025, barring any further delays), GTA Online is still being regularly updated with new content and events. The latest ongoing event is called 'Executive Bonuses':</p>
<p><em>Once you amass a stockpile of contraband inside your Warehouses, speak to Lupe and put your Staff to work sourcing Special Cargo at double the usual speed this week, and complete Special Cargo Sales to rake in 2X GTA$ and RP. Selling GTA$300,000 worth of Special Cargo throughout the week will complete the Weekly Challenge and land you GTA$100,000 as a reward. Pawning off extra crates in Export Mixed Goods will also dish out Double Rewards through September 18.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-game-store-and-fortnite-now-available-in-eu-on-ipad<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> fans still in the European Union can now play Epic Games' battle royale on iPad.
</p>
<p>
The Epic Games Store - and through it both Fortnite and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> - are now available on Apple's tablet, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">their relaunch on iPhone in the EU and on Android phones worldwide last month</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In a briefing to press attended by Eurogamer last month, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said he had "no regrets" over Fortnite's lengthy absence from mobile platforms as the company has waged legal battles to change app store policies. 
</p>
<p>
Four years of courtroom wrangling and an estimated $1bn in lost revenue later, Epic Games has now been able to launch its own mobile app store on Apple and Google devices - including now on iPad in mainland Europe.
</p>
<p>
Downloading the Epic Game Store requires you to load up Epic Games' website and download the storefront from there, navigating through a number of warnings by Apple - which would really rather you did not.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games previously said it would continue to push for iPhone and iPad launches of the Epic Game Store in more countries - including the UK and Japan - over the next year.
</p>
<p>
"We've probably lost a billion dollars not having Fortnite on iOS the past four years," Sweeney said. "But what's the price of freedom?"
</p>
<p>For those looking to catch up on Fortnite's current shenanigans, today's big mid-season update has added yet more Marvel to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-and-marvel-confirm-new-crossover-season-starring-doctor-doom-as-disney-integration-deepens">Absolute Doom season</a>. Iron Man has returned to the game - via a new skin you can buy from its Shop, rather than the one in its previous Marvel battle pass. There's also a new Marvel characters limited-time mode, with various superpowered abilities to wield.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-elden-ring-60-fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro game boost mode could make the system the only one capable of running FromSoftware's Elden Ring at locked 60 frames per second, according to a new analysis.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their Weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> attempted to get a first look at how the console's game boost mode could provide improvements to games that won't get PlayStation 5 Pro patches. The test was conducted using an RX 6800 GPU, as it is around 45% more powerful than the base PS5, just like the Pro, and features 60 compute units and possibly similar clock speeds.&nbsp; The test was focused on Elden Ring and was conducted using the same resolution as the game's Quality Mode on the base console and similar settings. Unfortunately, it was not possible to recreate the same identical settings on PC due to the lack of a dynamic resolution scaling option and settings quality adjustment on the fly that are available on console, and some console setting not having an equivalent in the PC version, being a mix between medium and high.</p>
<p>Even so, the test made it clear how the PlayStation 5 Pro game boost mode may not entirely deliver a locked 60 FPS experience in Quality Mode, as, in some instances, the game running on the RX 6800 GPU dropped to the 50 FPS range. However, in Performance Mode, with dynamic resolution scaling and settings quality adjustments on the fly, the console may very well run Elden Ring at 60 FPS with game boost if the feature really delivers the full power of the system's GPU. The FromSoftware game is obviously not going to be the only game that will see an improvement even without a dedicated PS5 Pro patch, as games using AMD FSR 2 and dynamic resolution scaling should see a significant image quality boost as well, as the higher the base pixel count, the better visuals AMD's upscaler delivers.</p>

<p>We won't have to wait much longer to see how unpatched games will take advantage of the PlayStation 5 Pro's power. The console will launch in less than two months, on November 7th, worldwide.</p>

<p>Rockstar Games has finally added anti-cheat to GTA 5 on PC 9 years after the game’s initial release.</p>



<p>TexFunz2 <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1835989031714169035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first spotted</a> the information on X (formerly Twitter), who posted a steamID patch notes screenshot of GTA 5 showing the update on PC. The patch notes reveal that Rockstar Games has opted for BattlEye for its anti-cheat.</p>



<p>As the community has rightfully pointed out, the news of anti-cheat in GTA 5 is welcome, but there are concerns as to whether it will impact the modding community. So far, Rockstar Games are yet to officially announce the implementation of anti-cheat, but an announcement is likely soon.</p>



<p>For those familiar with anit-cheat and the cheating community, cheaters have already said that BattlEye isn’t the best at preventing cheaters. Rainbow 6 Siege, which also used BattlEye, has been slammed by the community for its poor anti-cheat in recent years, with many of its games containing hackers. </p>



<p>As for whether it will prevent the cheating situation in GTA 5 on PC, it remains to be seen, but at the moment, it seems to be a welcome sign for those who are still playing the game. Despite being nine years old, GTA 5 on PC still achieves around 160,000 concurrent players in any given day.</p>



<p>What do you think of Rockstar Games’ decision to implement BattlEye anti-cheat into GTA 5 for PC? Let us know in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-6-will-reportedly-include-amd-chips-for-backwards-compatibility<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Backwards compatibility is a key reason AMD will be the chip manufacturer for Sony's PlayStation 6 console.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-intel-lost-sony-playstation-business-2024-09-16/">Reuters</a>, AMD and Intel were the final two contenders in a bidding war to manufacture the computer chip for Sony's next console.</p>
<p>However, AMD ultimately won the bid - with the need to provide backwards compatibility for previous consoles reportedly a major factor.</p>
<p>Both Sony's PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles feature custom AMD CPU and GPU chips, so it makes sense to maintain consistency to ensure compatibility with games from previous generations. This, and the rise of digital ownership, has helped the transition between these consoles.</p>

<p>Speaking to Reuters, sources said a swap to Intel would have risked backwards compatibility, by making it more costly to develop and requiring additional engineering resources.</p>
<p>Indeed, the unique IBM-developed "cell" processor of the PS3 caused problems with ports - it's why on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus games</a> from that console are only available via the cloud.</p>
<p>On the one hand, then, AMD's win suggests backwards compatibility will be part of Sony's next console, which is good news for players.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is a major loss for Intel, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/intel-says-painful-decision-to-cut-15000-jobs-is-one-of-the-most-consequential-changes-in-its-history">last month cut 15,000 jobs</a> as part of "significant actions to reduce costs" and save the company $10m next year.</p>
<p>Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the layoffs were "painful" as the company makes "some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history".</p>
<p>An Intel spokesperson told Reuters in response to its failure to win Sony's PS6 business: "We strongly disagree with this characterisation but are not going to comment about any current or potential customer conversations. We have a very healthy customer pipeline across both our product and foundry business, and we are squarely focused on innovating to meet their needs."</p>
<p>While the PlayStation 6 is still a long way off, last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">Sony revealed its long-expected PS5 Pro console</a>. It's digital-only and features an upgraded GPU among other features to provide higher fidelity graphics with a higher frame rate, all for the price of £700.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/max-payne-rtx-remix-path-tracing-new-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the Max Payne RTX Remix path tracing mod demo is now available for download, introducing further visual improvements.</p>
<p>Version 0.5, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/max-payne-rtx-on-demo-level/downloads/mp-demo-roscoe-v05">here</a>, removes the normal maps from the main character model's head, face, arms, and hands, as well as from surfaces to make them flat, improving how they look with path tracing. Additionally, the new version reworks lighting throughout to make everything brighter and introduces some experimental physical lighting to muzzle flashes and a few more changes over the previous version.</p>
<p>The Max Payne series is getting closer to its official revival with the remakes of the first and second entries in the series. Announced two years ago, Remedy Entertainment confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/">last month</a> that the remake combining the two games has finally entered full production, with the current goal being to have the game in an early functional state from beginning to end. As such, it may not be long before we finally see how Remedy will modernize two of the most popular games of all time. Besides working on this project, Remedy is also working on the second entry in the Control series and the second Alan Wake 2 DLC, the Lake House expansion.</p>
<p>The original Max Payne is available for purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/201330/Max_Payne/">Steam.</a></p>

			<p>A new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch is now live, introducing performance and stability improvements, as well as a Casual Mode and plenty of balance tweaks.</p>
<p>The September 17th patch introduces further fixes to issues around CPU overload in certain situations, which should lead to performance improvements in areas with a lot of NPCs, like town centers. The new patch also reduced the frequency of crashes, improving game stability.</p>
<p>All of the other changes the new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch introduces are related to gameplay. The patch brings a Casual Mode, which tweaks some aspects of the experience to make it easier, such as reducing inn fees and the price of Ferrystones, stamina consumption when dashing outside of battle, and more. In this mode, Pawns will also recover from the dragonsplague without triggering its most devastating effects, even when the symptoms progress to a terminal stage.</p>
<p>The new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch also introduces tons of Vocation changes for almost all Vocations, with the exception of the Trickster Vocation and other gameplay changes and fixes. You can find the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2054970/view/6976727636231899159?l=english">here.</a></p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about what is more of a reboot of the series, rather than an actual sequel, with Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review</a>.</p>

Similarly, if you can get together with two friends to create a full three-player group, you’re fine… <em>mostly</em>.</p><p>Things break down, though, when you’re trying to play with one other friend, and need another random to fill in the group. My experience doing this has been littered with wasted time and matchmaking woes, with Space Marine 2 stubbornly refusing to add another human player to our group. Instead, we get a random class bot to fill in the role.</p><p>Playing Operations mode on the harder difficulties, which you need to do to obtain the rewards that unlock the higher-tier weapons and perks, is almost impossible without three human players of the appropriate level all tearing through the mission. Space Marine 2 can be a brutally difficult game that throws loads of rock hard enemies at you. There’s no room for poor AI here.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Me when joining my friend's server on Space Marines 2: <a href="https://t.co/s2ObHkBOv1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/s2ObHkBOv1</a></p>— Jacky (Comms Closed) (@jackpesaurus) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackpesaurus/status/1835653811718775098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>My friend and I came up with an awkward solution to this problem this week: have one of us matchmake into a group of randoms and then vote to kick one of the other players. Once that player was kicked, it was a race to join the group and fill the spot before another random was brought in, brute forcing my friend and I into a three-person group. Not ideal, really, but it worked.</p><p>Even with this method in hand, there remains a constant fear that the ‘joining server’ bug will ruin all your hard work as victorious Space Marines load back into the Battle Barge hub area. We’ve had occasions where the game has essentially crashed doing this, casting out rewards to the warp in the process. When an Operation can run around 45 minutes, it is soul-destroying to suffer this bug.</p><p>Last week, publisher Focus Entertainment said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2s-first-update-detailed"><u>Space Marine 2’s first update would make server improvements and crash fixes</u></a>. Hopefully it sorts out these matchmaking problems, too.</p><p>IGN has reported on the upcoming addition of class matching for co-op, after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-having-awkward-pre-mission-standoffs-because-two-of-the-same-class-cant-play-together"><u>players found themselves locked in a class standoff ahead of Operations mode missions</u></a>.
