<p>Recently, it was revealed that the Call of Duty League’s minimum player salary requirement would be scrapped in favour of organisations simply aligning with their state’s minimum wage laws. As many have pointed out, this means that some players might be earning a woefully low amount to account for training, competing, and upholding a schedule to build and maintain a profile.</p>



<p>In response to the change, several key figures in the Call of Duty space surfaced on social media to make their opinions heard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-sacrifices-haven-t-been-worth-it">‘The Sacrifices… Haven’t Been Worth It’</h2>



<p>On Twitter, the CEO of OMiT pointed out that some players will earn as little as $7 an hour to play Call of Duty full-time. That’s not simply <strong>playing the game</strong> but also training with a team, following a schedule laid out by the development and coaching staff, competing all over North America, and constantly grinding to be best at their game.</p>



<p>For some, an entire season will pass by without a single win, which means the base salary of as little as $7 an hour will be the best it gets.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DREAL_JE/status/1839959207086264370" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a comment responding to that post</a>, DREAL, former head coach at the New York Subliners (now Cloud9), said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t a career that a lot of millennials will think it will be, the sacrifices, time and social investment haven’t been worth it, except for a select lucky / talented few. Collegiate and having a plan B, in case it doesn’t work out<strong><em> long term.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another post on his profile, DREAL pointed out the struggles and uncertainties that the wider industry is going through at present. He pointed out that many young people are sacrificing too much to pursue an esports career in a world that’s becoming fast oversaturated. In his words, ‘most people sacrifice a lot for it, including developing soft skills and education.’</p>



<p>Since parting ways with the New York Subliners (Cloud9), DREAL has focused on his education, finishing up an MSc in Biomedical Science. He has taken to educating youngsters through talks and has been actively posting motivational and development-focused articles through his blog.</p>



<p>While the biggest personalities in the Call of Duty space have content creation and streaming as a secondary source of income, many of the league’s players don’t have a big enough following to earn from that angle. If they can scrounge up sponsorships, they’re slightly better off, but the matter of the fact is that this adjustment is going to have a huge impact on many players.</p>

<p>The BLAST Premier: Fall Finals 2024 event has officially ended. Eight of the best Counter-Strike 2 teams faced off against each other in an intense few days of competition, with only one team being able to walk as the victor. That team: G2 Esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-g2-esports-win-blast-premier-fall-final-2-1-against-natus-vincere">G2 Esports Win BLAST Premier: Fall Final 2-1 Against Natus Vincere</h2>



<p>While G2 Esports may have swept the competition earlier on in the Fall Final (a 2-0 victory against Team Spirit in the Quarterfinals), the team had to put up quite the fight during the Semifinals and Grand Final. </p>



<p>After winning 2-1 against Team Vitality in the Semifinals, ultimately setting Vitality into fourth place, G2 knew that the Grand Final games would be no easy feat.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This perseverance, however, was enough to push the team into a heavy victory. With a 2-1 win against Natus Vincere, G2 Esports was awarded first place, walking away with $200,000 and qualifying for the BLAST World Final.</p>



<p>While Natus Vincere may not have won the tournament, their second place still awarded them $85,000.  </p>

<p>While Natus Vincere sat in second place at the end of the tournament, FaZe Esports was not so vigilant. The team ended up falling short of winning in the Semifinals, losing to Natus Vincere 2-1.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Still, both FaZe and Vitality were awarded $40,000 for third and fourth place, with Team Liquid coming in fifth place at the end of the tournament.</p>

The cushion is $299.99, and it’s available to buy now.</p><p>The Freyja is an extension of the vibration you get from gaming controllers — except instead of just jolting your hands, it buzzes several panels positioned behind and beneath you in response to things happening in a game. </p><p>The company says the cushion’s feedback comes from “multi-directional haptics powered by six advanced haptic motor actuators.” It connects via Bluetooth or through Razer’s HyperSpeed Wireless connection.</p><p>Most of the time, that vibration will just be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24134417/razer-kishi-ultra-gaming-controller-iphone-ipad-android-tablet-haptics">converted from the sound</a> in whatever game you’re playing, music you’re listening to, or movie you’re watching. Razer lists <em>Final Fantasy 16, Silent Hill 2, and Stalker 2 </em>as being among the games that integrate the Razer Sensa HD tech that drives the haptics.</p><p>Razer debuted a “Project Esther” version of the Freyja at CES, where it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031161/razers-project-esther-kicked-my-butt">kicked <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister’s butt</a> in a demo during the event. At the time, it wasn’t clear if it would actually become a real thing — yet, here it is. </p><p>The company also rolled out the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2FRazer-Kraken-V4-Pro%2FRZ04-05160100-R3U1">Kraken V4 Pro</a>, a version of its new Kraken V4 headphones that rattles your head with haptics. Like the cushion, the V4 Pro uses Razer HyperSpeed and Bluetooth, as well as USB or 3.5mm wired connections. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</p><div><figcaption><em>The Razer Kraken V4 Pro has haptics for your head.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div></div><p>The V4 Pro ships with a small box called the OLED Control Hub for tweaking its vibratory feedback, selecting your input, or adjusting effects (the headphones have RGB lights, naturally). The Razer V4 Pro costs $399.99 (or €449.99) and the first orders for it and the Freyja will deliver starting October 7th, according to their product pages.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Team Asobi says that while "almost 100%" of its most-wishlisted iconic Sony characters made it into Astro Bot, it finds it "difficult to comment" why <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> characters were missing.</p>
<p>Talking to journalist <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/astro-bot-playstation-icons-shadow-of-the-colossus">Stephen Totilo</a>, Team Asobi studio head Nicolas Doucet said that despite hoping that "maybe half" of the characters the team approached would be greenlit, most "partners just raised their hand and said, "Absolutely'".</p>

<p>However, not all characters on the list made it in. When asked why there was no <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>'s Cloud cameo, for instance - or indeed, anyone from Nier or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> - Doucet simply said it "really respect[s] the choice of each publisher".</p>
<p>"It's difficult to comment on [why Square Enix didn't approve any cameos]," Doucet explained. "We really respect the choice of each publisher."</p>
<p>Acknowledging the delicate balance between accessible characters that almost all players would recognise and "deep cuts" that fewer people may remember, Doucet said that the team accepted that "at that point, you're talking to less people", but wanted to include more obscure characters because the players that know them "may have the fondest memories".</p>
<p>Sony and Team Asobi recently gave us our first peek at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bots-free-dlc-adds-stellar-blades-eve-and-a-helldiver-to-save">Astro Bot's upcoming - and free - DLC add on</a>.</p>
<p>This DLC will include five new online speedrunning levels, as well as 10 new bots to rescue. While Team Asobi hasn't revealed all of them, we did get a look at the bot-version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>'s Eve (a bot we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-credits-hint-at-unseen-cameos-potentially-in-forthcoming-free-dlc">suspected would be making an appearance</a>) and a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> Helldiver in the new teaser trailer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-is-guerrillas-next-big-game-with-horizon-3-a-ways-off/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony continues to invest heavily in the Horizon franchise. While the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-is-in-the-works-by-the-umbrella-academys-showrunner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix TV series</a> has seemingly been stopped by the scandal involving showrunner Steve Blackman (The Umbrella Academy), last week's State of Play <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launching-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the rumored Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. It launches on October 31 for PlayStation 5 and PC with improved character models, shaders, and textures, new conversation mocap, enhanced cameras for dialogues, and more.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo will launch LEGO Horizon Adventures, a family-friendly spin-off that retells the story of the first installment in a way that's more palatable to a younger audience.</p>
<p>However, both of these are minor projects. The bulk of Guerrilla Games is working on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Online co-op game</a> and the third single-player installment, with the latter quietly confirmed alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guerrillas-co-studio-head-angie-smets-promoted-to-head-of-development-strategy-at-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studio's restructuring in April 2023</a>. Speaking on the <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0A0ZEJ8dYE&amp;t=3300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest Spawn Wave podcast</a>, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier revealed which one will be released first.</p>
<p><em>Guerrilla Games is in an interesting place because they're working on this Horizon Online game that I'm not sure how many people want that, and so they've got this remaster coming and then the LEGO&nbsp;game coming. Part of me feels like, I wonder what happens if neither of those hit, and it turns out there isn't a ton of interest in Horizon anymore. Are they still gonna be doing the online game? I don't know. There are a lot of questions around their strategy and around that online game that I certainly have.</em></p>
<p><em>Horizon Online is their next project, not whatever the third single player game looks like, so that one might be a ways off. Sony's PlayStation's live service initiative was no joke. Everybody was like, it's live service games all around, and Horizon is one of the few that hasn't been canceled or hasn't come out and flopped the way Concord did. So yeah, a lot of questions there, but a lot of people are working on that online project.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, as Schreier pointed out, following the cancellations of games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last of Us Online</a> and the urban fantasy game that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now-defunct London studio</a> was working on, not to mention <span>Concord's complete&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debacle</a>, Horizon Online is one of a few PlayStation live service projects still running. As such, it's not surprising that Sony is fast-tracking it compared to the third installment in the single-player</span>&nbsp;series.</p>
<p>However, it will indeed be a departure from the mainline entries, and not only because of the cooperative multiplayer. Guerrilla Games has already confirmed it will feature a new cast of characters and a 'stylized look' that didn't exactly inspire a lot of confidence in some early <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaks.</a></p>
<p>Is Sony making the wrong move by prioritizing this project? Let us know your opinion below.</p>

A new campaign began today, September 29, bringing back the character The Replacer, played by Peter Stormare. For anyone just catching up, the conceit of the ads is that The Replacer is the person sent in to replace the person who took a day off their job to play Call of Duty instead.</p><p>Stormare's The Replacer debuted in 2013 and has been a mainstay for Activision's Black Ops marketing campaigns over the years. The first in a series of commercials for Black Ops 6 featuring The Replacer went live today during Sunday's NFL game lineup.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 The Replacer Live Action Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is just the first of many commercials on the way, as Activision said it has put together almost 30 videos that will roll out now until the game releases. Activision teased that "some notable names" will be replaced during this latest ad campaign, but didn't offer any other specifics.</p><p dir="ltr">The new spot is pretty absurd, as The Replacer subs in for a firefighter saving a cat from a tree, a rideshare driver, and even a father at family dinner (along with a spicy conversation with the mom). Even the Pope plays Call of Duty, it seems, as The Replacer takes over his job as well for a day.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 launches on October 25, and unlike past years, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-have-campaign-early-access-activision-confirms/1100-6526378/" data-ref-id="1100-6526378">no early access to the campaign.</a> In another big change, Black Ops 6 will be available on Game Pass at launch, but only for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-not-a-day-one-game-pass-release-for-the-new-tier/1100-6524833/" data-ref-id="1100-6524833">most expensive tiers of the service.</a></p>

		<p>Over twenty minutes of footage from Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has been released from the Tokyo Game Show and it is, as you might expect, banana crackers.&nbsp; We get to meet Shioli Kutsuna’s Rainy and Elle Fanning’s Tomorrow, and they sing a nice duet while Normal Reedus’ Sam looks on with his sentient puppet pal swinging from his belt, who then joins in the song – and that’s just the first ninety seconds.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2 NEW Trailer 4K (2025) PS5 Pro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRvuCmbrjAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The footage then continues with the return of a familiar face and location,&nbsp; some casual tear collection and emoticons. We then skip to on board DHV Megellan and get explanation for why everyone is in shades of grey, plus another new character, Tarman, voiced by legendary director George Miller, and his pet devil tar cat.&nbsp; Lea Seydoux’s Fragile is also present,&nbsp; being as French as possible smoking a cigarette, and then the puppet is introduced (so the clips are clearly out of order) as Dollman, voiced by another director, Fatih Akin.</p>
<p>Fragile, Rainy, and Tomorrow then pose for a photoshoot with cuddly toy versions of the white grubs that were introduced as food in the first film.&nbsp; They then model some nice jackets and have dance on some of the vehicles from the game.</p>
<p>We’re still only seven minutes in and frankly if Bea Arthur turned up dressed as a ferret I wouldn’t bat an eyelid.</p>

<p>The video then continues with the footage from the trailer that was released in January before what appears to be a new trailer with Baby Lou (at a guess) and some sort of religious ceremony before skipping back to Fragile carrying Lou away from some sort of danger.&nbsp; Next is a shot of the DHV Megellan before we are told that a private company, APAC, is funding the project.</p>
<p>If that all seemed vaguely sensible the final shot is Baby Lou’s pod with octopus tentacles in it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/09/death-stranding-2-has-been-revealed-watch-the-trailer-here/">First confirmed back in 2022</a>, this sequel has now been fully titled as Death Stranding 2: On the Beach but the trailer does, thankfully, give it the snappier name of DS2.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> says he knows <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>'s release date, but "unforeseen circumstances" prevent him from sharing that date further.</p>
<p>Talking at Tokyo Game Show, Kojima said that while he and his team were working "in preparation" for the release date, he could not confirm it until "some point next year".</p>
<p>As yet, there's no official English-language versions of the presentation on TGS' Special Stage, but the Japanese livestream is embedded below:</p>

<p>"I haven't said the release date today, but the release date has already been decided, and I'm currently working on it in preparation for that," Kojima said, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/kojima-says-death-stranding-2s-release-date-is-decided-but-he-cant-reveal-it/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>"Since we are talking about 2025, it will be released next year, so we will announce it at some point next year. But, due to some unforeseen circumstances, we cannot announce it today."</p>
<p>Kojima did not expand on what those unforeseen circumstances were, or when we'll likely get confirmation of the release date, but he did unveil a further 20-minute gameplay demo of Death Stranding 2, which you can see above.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 - now officially now known as On the Beach (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-death-stranding-2-details-reportedly-being-revealed-in-next-15-days">as suspected</a>) - was announced back in 2022 during the Game Awards, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-revealed-by-hideo-kojima">bamboozling trailer</a> featuring Léa Seydoux and Norman Reedus.</p>
<p>Hideo Kojima has signed with talent agency WME to "traffic control all that [he does]" and "handle exchanges with all the actors" he wants to work with, hinting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojimas-next-project-could-be-a-game-anime-film-or-something-totally-different">his next project may not even be a video game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The crowd is a mix of high-profile streamers like Central Committee and KaceyTron, smaller Twitch affiliates, and fans—and all of them are <em>living</em> for the third annual TwitchCon Drag Showcase. JuiceBoxx, a streamer and one of the hosts this year, has her face plastered all over the convention center.<em> Ru Paul’s Drag Race </em>superstar Trixie Mattel has a makeup space on the show floor where employees are offering beauty tips and touch-ups, and at an off-site Capcom party, several drag queens mill about, their hair nearly grazing the ceiling of the bar.

<p>I don’t blame you if you want to spawn money in a Bethesda game. After spending countless hundreds or thousands of hours playing, I tend to follow suit. It’s easier when you can buy everything you need, and then you can focus on the adventure. So, without further ado, here’s how to use the Starfield money console command to prepare for Shattered Space!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-starfield-money-console-command">What is the Starfield Money Console Command?</h2>



<p>To access the Starfield console on PC, hit the tilde (~) on your keyboard to open up the menu. You’ll likely receive a warning that using console commands in the game will disable achievements, but if you have all of them or don’t care about unlocking 100% of the game’s achievements, you can ignore the warning. Then, start to type in the following command:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>player.additem f [value]</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll want to swap “[value]” with the number of credits you wish to spawn in your inventory. The game doesn’t seem to handle significant numbers too well, so consider spawning credits in increments of 10,000 or 100,000. You must repeatedly enter the console command to spawn credits until you’re filthy rich.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-to-buy-with-your-infinite-money-in-starfield">What to Buy With Your Infinite Money in Starfield</h2>



<p>Once you have a stock of credits, it’s time to go shopping!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ammunition</strong>: You’ll need copious amounts of ammo as you travel to Va’ruun’kai.</li>



<li><strong>Grenades</strong>: Shattered Space features new grenades and grenade crafting mechanics, so why not bring a few explosives along for the ride?</li>



<li><strong>Weapons</strong>: You will want a primary and secondary weapon to bring with you into the expansion. A few recommendations include Head Ranger or The Prime, which you can buy at Laredo Firearms, or Boom Boom and The Buzzcut from Neon Tactical.</li>



<li><strong>Health Items</strong>: Stock up on med kits and syringes beforehand to ensure you don’t run low. There’s no telling what or how much you can buy on Va’ruun’kai!</li>
</ul>



<p>What weapons do you recommend players buy with infinite credits in Starfield? Let us know in the comments, or visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a> to start the discussion!</p>
