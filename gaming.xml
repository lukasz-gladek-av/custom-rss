            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><figure><figcaption><span>RoseRodionova / Shutterstock / Visa / Mastercard / PayPal / Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure></p></div><div><p>If you work at a Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, or PayPal call center, your past few days might have taken on a recurring theme. Since last week’s sudden <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">de-indexing of almost all NSFW content</a> sent shockwaves through indie game storefront Itch.io, concerned creators and fans have been organizing to call the aforementioned reportedly-responsible companies and voice their displeasure en masse. Coordinating across BlueSky, Twitter, Discord, and Reddit, their rationale is simple: If Collective Shout, the activist group that has claimed responsibility for adult game removals on Itch <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Steam</a>, could move the needle with <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,067 emails to payment processors</a>, a much larger group can tug the needle right back.</p><p>Of course, this relies on some pretty big assumptions: 1) That Collective Shout, which claims to fight "against the objectification of women and the sexualization of girls" but which over the years has largely set its sights on <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/ban-prn-on-x?fbclid=IwY2xjawL2DW5leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFJcFJvcm1BVnUwRXZheW1TAR501XhzQorP36fB8s4Keaz5DdvdnQd0yg7qBpXK9MBJyXd3QylZOo3WCYJR6g_aem_CE1Moq-4XPj6QYrWKVQhcA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banning porn</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/mastercard-visa-backlash-adult-games-removed-online-stores-steam-itchio-ntwnfb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwear ads</a>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concert tours, and various video games</a>, can be taken at face value and is not exaggerating its involvement to boost its own profile (Collective Shout has mentioned Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, and Itch has named Stripe, PayPal, and Collective Shout, but none of those financial companies have directly indicated that Collective Shout’s pressure swayed them). And 2) that Collective Shout’s success was born of numbers and persistence, rather than a system rigged in its favor – propped up by squeamish, puritanical companies that were ready to take action the moment a semi-notable third-party tugged on their sleeve.</p><p>Still, those providing phone numbers, pre-written scripts, and entire websites to the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of thousands of people</a> opposed to censorship on Steam and Itch say they at least have to try.</p><p>“Outside of boosting posts and donating to causes via social media, I haven't been involved with something like this to this extent before,” Dieselbrain, a former artist who created <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dieselbrain.bsky.social/post/3luxwaqn4gs2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a resource-rich anti-censorship cheat sheet</a>, told Aftermath. “I decided to do this because seeing how quickly payment processors were moving to pressure platforms like Steam and Itch just made me realize that we need to start organizing more concretely. In many ways I'd rather be doing literally anything else, but livelihoods and expression are under fire from many different points of attack, so something had to be done.”</p><p>“I think an outrage like this was inevitable,” Cereza, an artist and developer who created a <a href="https://stop-paypros.neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">site called Stop-Paypros</a>, told Aftermath. “This was just the boiling point for a [lot of] people, me included. Itch.io is one of the most creator-friendly websites I've ever seen and a godsend for aspiring creatives like me. Watching itch.io being forced to delist all of these works felt like yet another opportunity closing in front of me. … If payment processors don't listen to the outrage right now, I think it'll only delay their troubles in the future.”</p><p>The pages community stewards like Dieselbrain and Cerza have put together advise trying to phone all four – and in some cases even more – targets each day and prepare those who’ve taken up the call for the long haul. "This is a marathon, not a race," reads Dieselbrain's cheat sheet. "Clogging their phone lines for an extended period, over a month at the absolute least, will almost guarantee that these companies will at least have to pay attention to the backlash."</p><p>Void, a Vtuber and artist who’s put together <a href="https://anti-censorship-campaign.carrd.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a website</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ms9GVmFD7K" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a> to aid the cause, concurs.</p><p>"The most important thing is to keep talking about this,” he told Aftermath. “We have momentum and we need to keep it. This can't just be something we all forget about by next week. Meaningful change only happens if we work together and don't give up!”</p><p>Different guides offer different approaches, starting with basic by-the-book talking points but in some cases getting craftier. For example, Cereza’s page includes an oblivious option (“I'm calling because a few days ago I wanted to buy a game that was a bit uh... on the adult side of things, but now I can't buy it anymore. I asked around and got told to call here, cause apparently you guys told [STEAM/ITCH.IO] that they couldn't sell adult games anymore?”) as well as some sterner alternatives for those with the stomach to get under customer service reps’ skin (“If these changes aren't made then I, along with many others will be forced to seek other options for processing payments. If [PAYMENT PROCESSOR] continues to impede on legitimate businesses, free speech and users' freedom to purchase legal goods, I will press as many opportunistic law firms as possible and kick off a class action lawsuit against your company.”)</p><figure><blockquote><p>[PayPal] put me on a 16.5 hour silent hold yesterday.</p></blockquote></figure><p>It’s difficult to say just how many people have spent the past several days tying up the lines of card companies and payment processors, but the movement has made itself visible enough to gain support from larger industry bodies like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/videogameworkers.bsky.social/post/3lv2foxkkac22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Communications Workers of America</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/igda-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-crackdown-on-nsfw-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the International Game Developers Association</a>. Additionally, its most vocal proponents have reported a shift in how representatives treat them. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brlka.com/post/3lut2e2mbl22g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Late last week</a>, callers say reps were already telling them that they weren’t alone in expressing their specific concern, but otherwise maintained a chill, professional demeanor. Now, midway through this week, Visa and Mastercard reps have apparently taken to shunting incensed Steam and Itch users down scripts of their own and, in some cases, expressing impatience or frustration.&nbsp;</p><p>“Visa was hit and miss – either respectful or defensive; it went from respectful to defensive with each passing day,” Trepe, a member of Void’s anti-censorship Discord who said that they’ve made over 20 calls in total, told Aftermath. “When they were defensive, they didn't bother answering my question. They did ‘promise me’ a callback, but I have a feeling they just lied.”</p><p>Trepe went on to say that during one call they got yelled at, and in others, reps immediately ended the call.&nbsp;</p><p>Another repeat caller, Henrick, told Aftermath that generally escalating the issue to a supervisor – rather than a rank-and-file rep – has required a specific ask and that, even then, that hasn’t fully worked; at best, they’ve received a confirmation number for their case. At worst, well…</p><p>“[PayPal] put me on a 16.5 hour silent hold yesterday,” Henrick said to Aftermath.</p><p>It’s not difficult to find similar <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dismalwether.bsky.social/post/3lv2vbve7ok2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anecdotes</a> on sites like BlueSky – <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/caraellison.bsky.social/post/3luzxqyotzk2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some supportive</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sammynona.bsky.social/post/3lv4onz727227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others less so</a> – suggesting that at least some of those on the front (phone) lines are starting to buckle under the pressure.</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Stripe for more information. The former three did not reply as of this publishing, while a spokesperson for the latter – who seemed exceedingly familiar with the Steam/Itch situation – pointed to the adult section of <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe’s prohibited businesses list</a>.</p><p>"Stripe has a policy against commenting on users,” the representative told Aftermath. “Generally speaking, we take action when we conclude that users violate our terms of service. We do not support adult content."&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastercard’s “illegal or brand-damaging transactions” policy</a> forbids “the sale of a product or service, including an image, which is patently offensive and lacks serious artistic value (such as, by way of example and not limitation, images of nonconsensual sexual behavior, sexual exploitation of a minor, nonconsensual mutilation of a person or body part, and bestiality), or any other material that the Corporation deems unacceptable to sell in connection with a Mark.”&nbsp;</p><p>These policies often lean on terms like “illegal,” but experts in payment processors and censorship say the reality of the situation is far less black and white.</p><p>"I think the reason that activist organizations tend to target payment companies is that they're seen as the weakest link in providing online content payment services,” Rainey Reitman, special advisor to the Electronic Frontier Foundation and author of forthcoming book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807019119?tag=bpress-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Transaction Denied: Big Finance's Power to Punish Speech</em></a>, told Aftermath. “They don't really care about most individual accounts, because they're not making that much money, in the grand scheme of things, off of any one account. So any hassle that's going to cause them, like a headache or bad publicity or potential scrutiny from regulators, they just wash their hands of it. There's no consequences for them in shutting off accounts in the United States; they don't have an obligation to provide services to people or even to provide an explanation when they choose to end a financial relationship, except in a very limited number of circumstances."</p><p>While beleaguered call center workers are an unintended casualty of this potentially ceaseless dustup between companies and campaigners, the real goal is to deprive companies of time and money. In an ideal world, those spearheading the anti-censorship movement hope, companies will eventually reverse course. This might sound like a pipe dream, but it’s not unprecedented: In 2021, following backlash from users, OnlyFans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-says-it-will-no-longer-ban-porn-after-backlash-from-users.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reversed a decision to ban porn</a> prompted by banks and payment companies. "Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard," OnlyFans <a href="https://x.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499277302816773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter at the time</a>. "We have secured assurances [from banking partners] necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change."&nbsp;</p><p>"I haven't seen backlash like this to this sort of censorship pressure since something similar happened with OnlyFans a few years back, and that backlash <em>was </em>able to turn that situation around," said Deiselbrain. "I think people are hitting a breaking point and they're sick of these kinds of draconian policies."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I haven't seen backlash like this to this sort of censorship pressure since something similar happened with OnlyFans a few years back.</p></blockquote></figure><p>According to Mike Stabile, director of policy at a trade association for the adult industry called the <a href="https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Free Speech Coalition</a>, the OnlyFans situation provides few surefire takeaways, but it does demonstrate a lack of legal and moral authority that companies like Visa and Mastercard disguise with official-sounding-but-vague terms of service.</p><p>"OnlyFans has been sort of tight-lipped about what actually happened [when it reversed its porn ban], but several days before OnlyFans made that decision, [Congresswoman Ann Wagner] had sent a letter to the Department of Justice saying that there was exploitation happening on OnlyFans,” Stabile told Aftermath. “The claims were really sort of without evidence, but it generated headlines and attention, which makes bankers nervous. ... They don't want to lose Visa and Mastercard, right? They don't want to be excluded from those networks. The threat of costly government investigations or bad PR can sometimes make them nervous enough where they were going to pull back from working with a specific platform."</p><p>"But the idea that it's just about what's legal is ridiculous,” he added. “It's not about what the law allows you to process. These are often very subjective rules around what falls outside the brand guidelines for Visa and Mastercard. And even if something doesn't fall outside the brand guidelines, it may just be something that is uncomfortable. ... [Questions of] 'Is this inside the bounds? Is this outside the bounds? Should we be processing that? Should we not be processing that?' are often incredibly subjective."</p><p>Stabile speculated that specific game removals on Steam and new rules on both Steam and Itch are meant to bring video games in line with what card companies and payment processors would be comfortable with in real-life porn. But that approach, he noted, doesn’t really stand up to prolonged scrutiny: "The difference is that you can't shoot anybody in real life, but there are plenty of games in which you can do that,” he said. “The stuff [companies] are talking about is entirely legal. It's legal to have in a book, it's legal to have in a game. They are making decisions based on their brand, based on public pressure from anti-porn groups, and that can be reversed."</p><p>Itch now finds itself waiting on the outcome of some of those subjective determinations to decide when, how, and which NSFW content will return to the store, according to site founder and owner Leaf Corcoran.</p><p>"The situation is evolving as we await final determinations from our current payment processors, Stripe and PayPal,” Corcoran wrote in <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an FAQ on Itch</a>. “There are still unknowns that prevent us from providing a fixed timeline."</p><p>Where Steam, a platform where every product page is reviewed before going live, was able to target specific games and issue new policies relatively quickly, Itch, an open platform, has been forced to conduct “a broader review.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Every payments platform is built on many layers of different partners, from banks to card networks,” Corcoran told Aftermath. “When we got a policy notice from Visa, it went up that chain before arriving in our inbox. Each layer has a team that decides if they are willing to continue doing business with us. When we received the notice, we were told that those teams were likely actively clicking around on our site to determine if itch.io is a business they can support. It was incredibly critical that we addressed problematic pages as fast as possible. The changes we are making to our platform have to convince them that we've taken the violation seriously and that we're committed to a solution that will avoid any future issues.”&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout this process, Itch has also been hit with backlash from creators who feel abandoned in the face of an outside incursion. Some have pointed out, though, that Itch’s relatively small team is at least keeping the public abreast of its progress and methodology – that it’s less walled-off than, say, Steam. Corcoran can see where the critics are coming from.</p><p>"Honestly, I feel like our communication has been lacking,” he said. “I've personally been prioritizing critical platform updates over communicating externally. We've done our initial audit and implemented product changes, so I had a moment [earlier this week] to update our users on what's going on. We owe it to our developers to keep them updated while pages are deindexed."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Reps at these companies are very much aware of what's going on. I can only hope that this can lead to a positive change for creators. The work the community is doing is incredibly impressive and should be celebrated.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Corcoran cheers the movement to get card companies and payment processors to reverse their decision, though if it’s causing them to waver, they’ve yet to communicate it to him: "No one at any of the companies we're in touch with has mentioned [all the calls and messages] to us yet. I do see on social media, though, that reps at these companies are very much aware of what's going on. I can only hope that this can lead to a positive change for creators. The work the community is doing is incredibly impressive and should be celebrated. I think it's important that these discussions are happening."</p><p>In the long run, Corcoran plans to “start working with more financial partners that are equipped to handle the kind of content we have.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It's our own fault for not having additional relationships with payment processors in place to avoid interruptions like this,” he said.</p><p>That will hopefully mean NSFW games can continue to flourish on the platform – that The Great Deindexing will be remembered as merely an interruption before a return to regularly scheduled programming. In the meantime, however, games that do not include content card companies and payment processors might find objectionable appear to have run afoul of the rules on both <a href="https://myosuki.itch.io/girls-girls-girls/comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Itch</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> – a nightmare scenario that some see as the beginning of a slippery slope. <em>VILE: Exhumed</em>, a deeply personal horror game that was recently banned from Steam, has game makers feeling especially on edge.</p><p>"I am extremely disappointed to let you know that <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> has been fully removed and banned for sale on Steam," wrote the game’s creator, Cara Cadaver, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on BlueSky</a>. "I want to be clear: <em>VILE: Exhumed</em> was not banned for its use of gore in storytelling or the violent themes. It was banned for 'sexual content with depictions of real people,' which, if you have played it, you know is all implied, making this all feel even worse."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="VILE: Exhumed | Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSbDTr-g_sE?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Other developers of games that explore adult themes, like <em>Tryhard</em>, <em>Zugzwang</em>, and <em>Hurt Me Plenty</em> creator Robert Yang – whose games were also deindexed on Itch – have found hope in the movement to push back against bank companies and payment processors but believe that this might be a sign that it’s time to think bigger.</p><p>“In the long run, maybe the only way to prevent payment processor censorship is to distribute games without payment, non-commercially,” Yang told Aftermath. “But obviously people need money to survive. Maybe we have to imagine other ways of supporting artists.”</p><p>At the heart of all of this is a question: What <em>are </em>the companies that handle our transactions? Are they merely utilities, like gas or electricity, or should they play a greater role in shaping society? It’s one that’s being asked in court right now, as part of a case focused on <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-tentatively-dismisses-visa-from-pornhub-sex-trafficking-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visa, Pornhub, and sex trafficking</a>.</p><p>“[The case] is trying to hold Visa accountable for sex trafficking by providing financial services to advertising on PornHub, which is a sweeping and mind-boggling accusation,” said Reitman. “Are you going to hold the water company accountable for sex trafficking, for providing water to PornHub? It just doesn't make any sense. With that said, it's still in the courts. We'll see how the courts sort that out, and it might be a long time before we get an answer about it, but it's possible that some of these financial companies are watching that case and wondering what might be in the future for them."</p><p>Naomi Clark, game designer and chair at the NYU Game Center, believes that the PornHub case is just one tendril of a much larger beast.</p><p>"These matters currently exist in a kind of legal and regulatory ambiguity where it's not entirely clear who could be held liable for some kind of vague ‘harm’ stemming from explicit content,” Clark told Aftermath. “Certainly the situation with [adult] content on Tumblr, on OnlyFans, and the lawsuit against PornHub's owner MindGeek show how varied these outcomes can be. In the case of MindGeek, you had one judge saying in 2022 that Visa could be named in that lawsuit as a defendant even though they were just processing payments, and another judge earlier this year saying the opposite in the same case, dismissing Visa as a defendant because in his view they're only a utility company."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Are you going to hold the water company accountable for sex trafficking, for providing water to PornHub? It just doesn't make any sense.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Then there’s FOSTA and SESTA, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/woodhull-freedom-foundation-et-al-v-united-states#take-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-sex work, pro-censorship laws</a> disguised as anti-trafficking bills that leave companies and online platforms vulnerable.</p><p>"Nobody really knows whether SESTA and FOSTA could be stretched to prohibit any kind of fictional content that could be perceived as ‘promoting sex trafficking’ or how broad that could get,” said Clark. “In many ways legal and government systems have abdicated setting guidelines, but we clearly have an incredibly litigious executive in the White House who favors abusing the law and lawsuits and regulatory power to prohibit speech he and cronies don't like, so that sets the tone."</p><p>The end result? Fear.</p><p>"We are in a time of fear, uncertainty, and doubt – even for top risk management, compliance, and legal executives in corporate settings,” said Clark. “There's been a lot of ‘We will just ignore this as long as we can look the other way,’ and Collective Shout pierced that bubble. But I don't think even the people at the top have a clear idea of what the safe or sensible thing to do is."</p><p>This is why Reitman believes that even if the movement to pressure bank companies and payment processors to stop meddling in Steam and Itch’s affairs does not succeed overnight – or ever – it’s still worthwhile.</p><p>“I think the more pressure the public can put on companies like Visa and Mastercard the better, because right now I fear that these financial companies only hear from people who are calling on them to engage in more censorship,” she said. “So these phone calls can be a powerful counter narrative.”</p><p>"There's this bigger societal question, which is, do we think that payment services and financial companies should ever be weighing in on online speech issues, or should just be neutral intermediaries that provide financial services?” she continued. “I would argue quite strongly for the latter. … There are any number of people who are closer to the content, who are better able to judge whether or not that content should exist. Financial companies are so far removed that they can't really weigh in on these issues."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clues-by-sam-wordle-daily-puzzle-game"><h3>Clues By Sam Is My Favorite Daily Puzzle Game</h3></a><p>It’s a nice little thing to do as my last thing before falling asleep.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/peak-multiplayer-streamers"><h3>Peak Is A Playground For Slapstick Comedy</h3></a><p>Peak creates space for players to really fuck around, punctuated by a swift emphasis on finding out</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/anime-manga-disney-jail-netflix-fragrant-flower"><h3>The World Is Conspiring Against Me Legally Experiencing The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity</h3></a><p>The enshittification of manga and anime have reached absurd new heights, courtesy of Netflix and Kodansha’s collective bullshit.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Analogue’s 4K remake of the Nintendo 64 has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">delayed again</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707586/analogue-3d-4k-n64-delay-august-2025">again</a> due to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/699681/trump-south-korea-japan-tariff-25-percent">US tariff situation</a>. But at least you can get 8BitDo’s updated take on the N64 controller, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">announced alongside the Analogue 3D</a>, while you wait. You can <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKX7JZQD?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">get one through Amazon</a> in white or black for $39.99 and while it’s one of 8BitDo’s more budget-friendly controllers, its functionality is limited.</p><p>The Nintendo 64, which launched in 1996, had an unusual three-prong controller design, with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643372/nintendo-64-controller-joystick-button-3d-gaming-control">single analog joystick</a> in the center of the gamepad above the middle grip. The 8BitDo 64 offers the same buttons as the N64’s controller in a more traditional layout, but while it’s easier to hold, the lack of a second joystick limits its compatibility with modern games, which generally expect two. The 8BitDo 64 is compatible with the Switch, Switch 2 (after updating the controller’s firmware), Windows, and Android devices and connects to consoles, PCs, and mobile devices using either a Bluetooth connection or a USB cable.</p><p>It also features more durable Hall effect joysticks and shoulder buttons which should help prevent it from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">developing stick drift</a> over time. But if you’re not planning to use it with the Analogue 3D (someday), the controller will potentially only be useful for playing classic N64 games through an emulator or the Nintendo Switch Online service but your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/25/23570607/goldeneye-007-xbox-release-remaster-nintendo-switch"><em>GoldenEye 007</em></a> muscle memory may not perfectly transfer over to the updated button layout. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728144/nintendo-64-sega-genesis-controllers-switch-online-expansion-pack-buy-order">Nintendo’s own wireless N64 controller</a> is a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-ca%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-64-controller%2F" rel="sponsored">more accurate reproduction</a>, but you still need to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber to buy one.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/716292/8bitdo-64-wireless-controller-nintendo-analogue-3d]]></content:encoded>

Players can now wall-run, grind off rails, and glance off mid-air objects to pick up extra speed boosts. </p><p>The most skilled players are thus effectively racing like they have a secret stash of Mushrooms. The new patch takes things even further, in particular increasing the speed boost after landing from ramp jumps and other mid-air tricks. “You get a ton of extra momentum,” YouTuber svcTyler said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeT-NV0hkXk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeT-NV0hkXk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video</a></span>. “So much momentum to the point that it’s completely trivialized every currently existing world record in the game.”</p><p>  The <em>Mario Kart World </em>records page shows exactly that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase has delved into the changes coming in the Season 3.5 update, showcasing the latest addition to the game's roster, Blade, changes to character team-ups, a new map, a new game mode, new features to help catch and penalize toxic players, and more.</p>



<p>Most of the new features, like Blade and NetEase's new monitoring of voice chat in matches and reviews of muted words, will arrive with the update on August 8, 2025. The new game mode, Resource Rumble, and the new map that it's introducing, Throne of Knull, won't arrive until a later update on August 22, 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the team-up changes, two are being removed from play entirely: Guardian Revival and Atlas Bond. Loki is the only character who is being removed from a team-up, as Ragnarok Rebirth will now be a Hela/Thor team-up. Two new team-ups are being introduced, Duality Dance, which includes Adam Warlock and Luna Snow, and Vibrant Vitality, which includes Mantis and Groot/Loki.</p>



<p>Iron Fist will join the Chilling Assault team-up, and Star-Lord will join the Rocket Network team-up. Blade, as the new kid on the block, will join the Lunar Force team-up with Moon Knight and Cloak &amp; Dagger.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Beyond NetEase monitoring voice chat more closely and a custom filter for text chat to filter out muted words, the studio is also introducing harsher penalties for players who leave competitive matches. Players who quit competitive matches early will receive longer bans and larger point deductions, while the players who have to stick it out with a handicap thanks to their former teammate quitting will be offered point compensation when the match is over. </p>



<p>If you get booted from the match through no fault of your own, like losing a connection or your system crashing, NetEase promises to review mistaken bans and appeals faster, so players aren't wrongly sidelined. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals was one of the biggest games at the top of the year, and while its active player base (on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#max">Steam</a>, at least) has declined from the heights it was hitting in January, it still has tens of thousands of players each day. As NetEase continues to update and add to the game, it'll be interesting to see if it is able to repeat, or even surpass its launch numbers, with future changes and updates.</p>



<p>After all, a strong launch for a free-to-play live service game is a great thing, but the sign of a healthy live-service game is being able to leapfrog those launch numbers with a new update, something Marvel Rivals has not yet done.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-standards-best-decks-can-survive-huge-rotation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-standards-best-decks-can-survive-a-huge-rotation.1257558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the release of Magic’s first ever space set in Edge of Eternities, another frontier was also crossed: that of the Standard rotation.</p>

<p>Standard is magic’s premiere tournament rotating format, and formerly its most played format. While the casual play of Commander has taken that crown, Standard is still played, especially online and it is the regional qualifier format come August. While the format was recently played at Pro Tour Final Fantasy, the decks from that event will need changing because of Wizards <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-june-30-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Banned and Restricted Announcement – June 30, 2025">banning 7 cards</a> after the event, and standard rotation happening with the release of&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>.</p>

<h2>What is MTG Standard Rotation?</h2>

<p>When a format rotates, certain sets stop being legal for the format. Generally speaking, a number of sets rotate at once, in a predefined pattern. Previously, Standard had been on a 2 year cycle, meaning that it would rotate a year worth of sets at the start of the Magic year (traditionally September), leaving behind 3 or 4 sets along with the newly released set.</p>

<p>However, in 2023 Wizards of the Coast announced that Standard was moving to a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/revitalizing-standard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Revitalizing Standard">3 year rotation schedule</a>. Thus sets will be legal for at least 3 years (<em>Foundations </em>stays legal through at least 2029), before rotating. They further refined it in 2024 with the release of <em>Foundations</em>, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aligning-the-universes-making-all-our-sets-legal-in-all-our-formats" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aligning the Universes: Making All Our Sets Legal in All Our Formats">announcing that following</a> the <em>Edge of Eternities </em>rotation, there will be no rotation until 2027 so that rotation is moved to happening at the start of the calendar year.</p>

<h2>What sets are rotating out of Standard with <em>Edge of Eternities</em>?</h2>

<p>The following sets will cease to be legal following the official release of <em>Edge of Eternities</em>:</p>

</ul><p>With that knowledge, we’re going to take a trip through some of the best decks in the format and how they are changing with having over 1100 cards leaving the format.</p>

<h3>Dimir Midrange&nbsp;</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimir-midrange.jpg?itok=wTNsteat 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimir-midrange.jpg?itok=eD5hXhb6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/dimir-midrange-decklist-by-forge-2568035" rel="nofollow">Dimir Midrange by _Forge_</a></figcaption></figure><p>One of the top-decks post-bannings, Dimir Midrange aims to set up small value creatures, often with evasion to hit your opponent and sneak in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/220/kaito-bane-of-nightmares" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kaito, Bane of Nightmares ">Kaito, Bane of Nightmares </a>to help create overwhelming card advantage along with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/51/enduring-curiosity" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Enduring Curiosity">Enduring Curiosity</a>, and then sit back and control the game as it pushes through.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/58/faerie-mastermind" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Faerie Mastermind"><u>Faerie Mastermind</u></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faerie-mastermind.jpg?itok=d-kN45Qz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faerie-mastermind.jpg?itok=x47sFBEt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Yuta Takahashi’s World Championship card had been a strong card in the deck as it helped provide an evasive threat that could be flashed in and was particularly good against cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/136/fear-of-missing-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fear of Missing Out">Fear of Missing Out</a> as it gained the deck free card advantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/107/sheoldred-the-apocalypse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sheoldred, the Apocalypse"><u>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</u></a></p>

<p>Some of the biggest and baddest black threats to walk the format are rotating out. While Sheoldred is no longer the monster it was early in its run in Standard, it would see play either main or board for these decks and was especially strong against Izzet Vivi Cauldron. This loss, and the next, also impact other black midrange decks like Demons.</p>

<p><u>Black Removal Spells </u>– <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/89/cut-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cut Down ">Cut Down</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/108/sheoldreds-edict" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sheoldred’s Edict">Sheoldred’s Edict</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/102/go-for-the-throat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Go For The Throat">Go For The Throat</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mat/12/blot-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Blot Out">Blot Out</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/81/anoint-with-affliction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Anoint with Affliction">Anoint with Affliction</a></p>

<p>The removal package Dimir Midrange decks were running is getting gutted with rotation. The biggest loss here is Cut Down for all the black decks, as this was the little 1 mana answer that could, answering a huge variety of threats up to about 3 mana at instant speed. It was particularly useful against Izzet Cauldron as it could kill all their threats.</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Faerie Mastermind</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/63/malcolm-alluring-scoundrel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Malcolm, Alluring Scoundrel">Malcolm, Alluring Scoundrel</a>: Perhaps the most straightforward switch is adding another 2 mana flier that provides some card quality advantage with its looting.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/102/deep-cavern-bat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Deep-Cavern Bat">Deep-Cavern Bat</a>: Some of the Dimir Midrange Decks had been cutting down on Bat counts, but the leaving of Faerie Mastermind seems like a good reason to up it again to keep having enough early evasive creatures.</p>

<p><u>For Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/big/9/harvester-of-misery" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Harvester of Misery">Harvester of Misery</a>: One way the black decks may try to fill two holes with one card is Harvester of Misery, who is a sizable 5 drop, but also can be discarded earlier in the game for some cheap spot removal of -2/-2.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/97/elegy-acolyte" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elegy Acolyte">Elegy Acolyte</a>: From <em>Edge of Eternities</em>, this acolyte is a 4/4 lifelink for 4 giving a passable body for this role, but importantly it can help you draw cards (also replacing <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/95/gix-yawgmoth-praetor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor">Gix</a> for those lists that ran it), and make tokens if a non-land left the battlefield.</p>

<p><u>For Black&nbsp; Removal</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/106/shoot-the-sheriff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shoot the Sheriff">Shoot the Sheriff</a>: While there are some creatures that this will randomly miss, Shoot the Sheriff hits most of the important creatures in Standard and is importantly a 2 mana instant.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shoot-the-sheriff.jpg?itok=3JbFk0vY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shoot-the-sheriff.jpg?itok=QaudHBd6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/122/tragic-trajectory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tragic Trajectory">Tragic Trajectory</a>: A general step down from Cut Down, Tragic Trajectory is the closest to the 1 mana kill an early creature with some flexibility that there is. The fact that it’s only -2/-2 with potential for more as well as a sorcery may doom it, as missing 3 toughness misses key creatures like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/136/fear-of-missing-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fear of Missing Out">Fear of Missing Out</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vivi Ornitier">Vivi</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/92/long-goodbye" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Long Goodbye">Long Goodbye</a>: If Tragic Trajectory can’t fill the hole, it’s possible Long Goodbye may as it is able to take out some of the cheap creatures that cost 3 mana or less that Trajectory can’t. It is also an instant, and it might occasionally matter that it can avoid counters from Izzet decks.</p>

<h3>Izzet Vivi Cauldron</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/izzet-cauldron.jpg?itok=IUpZN7ye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/izzet-cauldron.jpg?itok=k4ymErN1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/s-izzet-cauldron-decklist-by-thenerdysteve-2564171" rel="nofollow">Izzet Cauldron by TheNerdySteve</a></figcaption></figure><p>The other seeming top tier deck with Dimir Midrange is centered around everyone’s favorite little wizard. This is an aggro-combo deck aiming to win either by beating you down quickly with giant creatures, or do combo works with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/242/agathas-soul-cauldron" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Agatha’s Soul Cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a>.</p>

<p>Core to the deck are cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/67/profts-eidetic-memory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Proft’s Eidetic Memory">Proft’s Eidetic Memory</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/138/marauding-mako" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Marauding Mako">Marauding Mako</a> that take advantage of all the draw and discarding in the deck, which the core of cards are aimed at producing to let the deck punch face. If that plan gets stalled or stymied, it merely relies on it’s combo plan it is setting up of getting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vivi Ornitier ">Vivi Ornitier </a>on <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/242/agathas-soul-cauldron" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Agatha's Soul Cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a> and then using its creatures pumped with counters to generate mana. From there, drawing cards is generally easy for more, and the deck finishes with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/171/voldaren-thrillseeker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Voldaren Thrillseeker">Voldaran Thrillseeker</a> if huge creatures aren’t enough.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/171/voldaren-thrillseeker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Voldaren Thrillseeker">Voldaren Thrillseeker</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voldaren-thrillseeker.jpg?itok=IeeFQKWb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voldaren-thrillseeker.jpg?itok=tydPVXaH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Having dodged the post-PT bans, Vivi Cauldron also dodges losing almost anything to rotation, although it does lose its combo finisher of choice. Thrillseeker was an easy way to launch the deck’s giant creatures at an opponent, and also served as an enabler by handing out counters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/121/draconautics-engineer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Draconautics Engineer">Draconautics Engineer</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/draconautics-engineer.jpg?itok=2Pkyzgwd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/draconautics-engineer.jpg?itok=wKPo2_UR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Draconautics Engineer is nowhere as good as Voldaran Thrillseeker for Vivi, as it lacks the direct clean finish punch that Thrillseeker gave, and the additional counter synergy it functioned with, but the Engineer’s pair of abilities will work with him under Agatha’s Cauldron to let team Vivi make a bunch of dragons and haste them. It seems unlikely though that it will get the same 3of spot that Voldaren had before.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/50/geralf-the-fleshwright" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Geralf, the Fleshwright">Geralf, the Fleshwright</a></p>

<p>In part because the Vivi decks may choose to diversify their finisher options some, or seeking cards that can provide additional value. Geralf doesn’t work with the Cauldron himself, but instead the way the deck’s engine works with wanting tons of spells played on its key turn to make tons of tokens.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/246/gingerbrute" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gingerbrute">Gingerbrute</a></p>

<p>Our last option here is a little sneaky, but Gingerbrute’s use here would be that it could essentially grant unblockability to the creatures for 1 mana. This would serve as a way for them to get past things like token hordes from Mono White.</p>

<h3>White Based Control (Mono White, Azorious, Jeskai)</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/azorius-control.jpg?itok=39fOn_XR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/azorius-control.jpg?itok=qS782JIb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/azorius-control-decklist-by-ryuji-haga-2565267" rel="nofollow">Azorius Control by Ryuji Haga</a></figcaption></figure><p>Control decks containing white come in a lot of variety in Standard now, from the <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/mono-white-tokens-decklist-by-al-azif-2565284" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mono White Control">mono-white token control decks </a>making use of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blb/6/caretakers-talent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Caretaker’s Talent">Caretaker’s Talent</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/11/elspeth-storm-slayer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elspeth, Storm Slayer">Elspeth</a>, and a variety of similar token makers alongside removal, to decks that are based in blue and white (as pictured above), or going into <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/jeskai-control-decklist-by-mark-benedict-cabrera-2554462" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jeskai Control">Jeskai</a> with white, blue, and red.</p>

<p>All of these are losing some of the same cards, with Mono White losing an additional card that might cause the deck to abandon its previous mono-white status. That may cause these decks to homogenize, especially as the metagame stabilizes, into just two decks.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/11/lay-down-arms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lay Down Arms"><u>Lay Down Arms</u></a><br>
A loss only for Mono White Token Control, Lay Down Arms was a major reason for the deck staying in mono-white as it gave it a 1 mana removal option. The ability to exile creatures based on your land count, and gain 3 life for it was a significant advantage in a format with a pair of notable decks that care about graveyards.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/36/temporary-lockdown" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Temporary Lockdown"><u>Temporary Lockdown</u></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temporary-lockdown.jpg?itok=NSA9AhsT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temporary-lockdown.jpg?itok=2iZ19SG2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A loss also for the Orzhov/Esper Fairy Bounce decks, Temporary Lockdown has been a format staple. While not quite as prominent as it was a month ago when it was fighting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/103/cori-steel-cutter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cori-Steel Cutter">Cori-Steel Cutter</a>, Temporary Lockdown is still seeing a lot of play in white decks that don’t make tokens and want to exert some control over the game. It is an early game stopper and its ability to remove anything that costs 2 or less was highly prized.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/40/sunfall" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sunfall"><u>Sunfall</u></a></p>

<p>Previously the go-to top end mass wipe, Sunfall’s ability to exile creatures, and give a token back to the control player to hit back at the aggro player or block in the future. The key loss here is the exile portion for these decks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Lay Down Arms</u></p>

<p>There aren’t really any direct replacements for Lay Down Arms that would encourage the deck to stay mono-white. Instead you could see the deck merge some with Azorius or explore other options like black, but nothing matches the removal efficiency they got with Lay Down Arms.</p>

<p><u>For Temporary Lockdown</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/32/split-up" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Split Up">Split Up</a></p>

<p>Jeskai sometimes already prefers Split Up, but it seems like this may be the first replacement option for Temporary Lockdown. That said, Temporary Lockdown’s hitting of various permanent types would be missed by control decks.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/27/pinnacle-starcage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pinnacle Starcage">Pinnacle Starcage</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another major replacement option would be Pinnacle Starcage, which functions very similarly. It does miss enchantments however, and artifacts are more vulnerable to destruction generally, especially with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/188/abrade" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Abrade">Abrade</a> in the format.</p>

<p><u>For Sunfall</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/7/beyond-the-quiet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Beyond the Quiet">Beyond the Quiet</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/beyond-the-quiet.jpg?itok=0ejmoWwW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/beyond-the-quiet.jpg?itok=AQZZvgdY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If exiling is needed from a white sweeper, Beyond the Quiet is going to be the answer, as for 5 mana it exiles all creatures and spacecrafts, something else that no sweeper does at that cost.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/140/day-of-judgment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Day of Judgment">Day of Judgment</a></p>

<p>A mana cheaper, Day of Judgment though doesn’t exile creatures which is a significant difference. It also doesn’t give you a potentially large creature to rebound with, but it's a solid no questions asked board wipe.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/38/ultima" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ultima">Ultima</a></p>

<p>Ultima is already seeing some play, and it provides a way to avoid death triggers by ending the turn right there. However it also fails to exile creatures, though it does wipe out artifacts as well - so you don't want to run it alongside Pinnacle Starcage.</p>

<h3>Red Based Aggro</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gruul-delirium.jpg?itok=mKRzphCO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gruul-delirium.jpg?itok=PQumSNvQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/delirium-decklist-by-yeggybombs-2553687" rel="nofollow">Gruul Delirium decklist by YeggyBombs</a></figcaption></figure><p>I’m cheating here and combining the various red-based aggro decks together. First of all: Boros Convoke is dead, as convoke cards are gone. Second, Boros as a deck is still alive, as are Gruul, Lizards, and Mice as all various takes on getting small little red dudes down and backing them up with burn.</p>

<p>The biggest hits to red happened with the recent bannings, as losing <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/103/cori-steel-cutter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cori-Steel Cutter ">Cori-Steel Cutter </a>took red decks out of the top tier, especially when combined with the further bannings of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/142/monstrous-rage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Monstrous Rage">Monstrous Rage</a> and its best 1 drop <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blb/138/heartfire-hero" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Heartfire Hero">Heartfire Hero</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Seed%20of%20Hope" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/204/seed-of-hope"><u>Seed of Hope</u></a></p>

<p>Run by Gruul Delirium, Seed of Hope is a card used to quickly get some cards in the graveyard to help trigger their synergies and essentially cycles. Gruul Delirium needs to find a way to quickly stock its graveyard too.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/144/monastery-swiftspear" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Monastery Swiftspear"><u>Monastery Swiftspear</u></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monastery-swiftspear.jpg?itok=Svmd0v3Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monastery-swiftspear.jpg?itok=Oa30wQAJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Various red decks like Monastery Swiftspear as a good 1 drop that grows and has haste. It’s not irreplaceable, but the decks will need to adapt to losing this good creature.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/134/gleeful-demolition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gleeful Demolition"><u>Gleeful Demolition</u></a></p>

<p>For more go-wide options, especially the dying convoke decks, Gleeful Demolition was a go-to option as it could quickly make several tokens. Nothing matches Gleeful Demolition pure token ratio of 3 tokens for 1 mana, which was an explosive burst these decks relied on to power their aggressive push, and figuring out how to survive its loss is their biggest challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Seed of Hope</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/171/molt-tender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Molt Tender">Molt Tender</a></p>

<p>Run already by Insidious Roots, Molt Tender lacks the explosive graveyard loading of Seed of Hope, but provides a 1 drop who can help load the graveyard.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/178/cenote-scout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cenote Scout">Cenote Scout</a></p>

<p>Another 1 drop, Cenote Scout’s exploration can functionally mill at least one card sometimes, or help get through land draws.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/185/esper-origins-summon:-esper-maduin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Esper Origins">Esper Origins</a></p>

<p>While it costs 2 mana, the fact that Esper Origins can get 3 cards in the graveyard, and helps smooth draws makes it in some ways a closer fit for Seed of Hope. There is also the upside that in a longer running game, Esper Origins can be flashbacked to provide a body, and eventually an overrun option.</p>

<p><u>For Monastery Swiftspear</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/132/greasewrench-goblin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Greasewrench Goblin">Greasewrench Goblin</a></p>

<p>While lacking haste, this goblin provides 2 power for 1 mana and the ability to recharge by dumping excess lands for new cards and grow him up to 3 power later in the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/139/kavaron-harrier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kavaron Harrier">Kavaron Harrier</a></p>

<p>From <em>Edge of Eternities</em>, if your deck cares about artifacts at all, this 2 powered 1 drop is another good fill in, and it provides a mana outlet with an additional attacker come the midgame and keeping it relevant.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/91/kellan-planar-trailblazer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kellan, Planar Trailblazer">Kellan, Planar Trailblazer</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kellan-planar-trailblazer.jpg?itok=3kwun8JS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kellan-planar-trailblazer.jpg?itok=2M_kUCWt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another 2 powered 1 drop, Kellan here is a mana sink in the style of Figure of Destiny, and can over time help gain card advantage and eventually be a 3 powered double striker.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/632/stromkirk-noble" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stromkirk Noble">Stormkirk Noble</a></p>

<p>Remembering him from my days playing vampires, this guy was reprinted in Foundations, and more creatures are humans than you might think. With a single hit or two, he gets quite powerful and could be an option depending on how the metagame shakes out.</p>

<p><u>For Gleeful Demolition</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/186/frontline-rush" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Frontline Rush">Frontline Rush</a></p>

<p>While it’s twice as much mana, Frontline Rush only makes 2 tokens, but it also can double as a finisher spell. Some decks have already adopted it, but expect any decks wanting to lean on token strategies to pick it up more.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/122/stadium-headliner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stadium Headliner">Stadium Headliner</a></p>

<p>Nothing replaces the explosiveness or mana to token ratio of Gleeful Demolition, but Stadium Headliner provides a quick 1 drop who can make an additional token each turn it attacks, and essentially an extra <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/8/case-of-the-gateway-express" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Case of the Gateway Express">Case of the Getaway Express</a>.</p>

If you’ve played <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, you’re probably familiar with how this works: Die in a fight, and you’ll see a window asking you if you want to retry the battle. This is super helpful for getting straight back into the action without breaking any flow state you’re trying to lock into. It’s also good if you like to use a first run-in with a boss as a learning opportunity in which you expect to lose. Also, it’s not uncommon to hit difficulty spikes in <em>Expedition 33</em>, so this will make those hurt a little less.</p><figure id="" data-id="8731f5af7191de0413f243192b676356" data-recommend-id="image://8731f5af7191de0413f243192b676356" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Clair Obscur shows sound settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Clair Obscur shows sound settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8731f5af7191de0413f243192b676356" data-recommend-id="image://8731f5af7191de0413f243192b676356" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Clair Obscur shows sound settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That’s not all the reasonably sized 2.5GB update contains.

Now you can tweak how loud music, voices, and game sounds are with options specifically for levels in and out of combat. Gorgeous.</p><p>The Lumina Cost Display is another fantastic addition, making it so much easier to plan out builds. In <em>Expedition 33</em>, characters can equip “Pictos” to augment their existing abilities or learn new ones.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it's still the best-selling game in the U.S. year-to-date.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds got off to an incredible sales start when it launched in February. Unfortunately, it seems as though its success has fallen off one heck of a cliff since then - and Capcom appears to be trying to amend that by releasing an endgame content expansion much sooner than expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sales data comes from Capcom's quarterly earnings report, which includes <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a slide presentation showing sales data</a> for the company's top ten best-selling games from April 1 to June 30. The presentation shows that Monster Hunter Wilds sold 477k copies during that period, only just above the 389k copies sold of four-year-old game Monster Hunter Rise. Wilds was the 9th best-selling game of the quarter for Capcom, while Rise was the 10th.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, even though Rise is four years old, those aren't exactly gangbusters sales figures either. In Capcom's consolidated financial results, the company says, "Regarding catalog titles, although sales were soft for Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest title in the series released in February this year, Monster Hunter Rise, a previous title in the same series, continued to see sales growth." This is technically true, in that Rise continues to sell copies, but calling it "growth" is a bit strong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last quarter, Monster Hunter Rise only sold 384k copies. In fact, sales of the game slowed down significantly throughout last year after the game sold 725k in Q1, 640k in Q2, and 691k in Q3. That's not really shocking, especially once Wilds was announced - people were bound to hold off on buying Rise if there was a brand new game just around the corner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's more interesting here is how much better Rise was selling throughout most of last year, several years after its release, than Wilds is selling now. Just a few months out from its launch, Wilds saw a steep, steep sales dropoff. After releasing during the first quarter to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-breezes-past-10-million-sold-capcom-explains-why-its-done-so-incredibly-well">Capcom record-setting 10.108 million copies sold</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-surpasses-8-million-units-sold-in-3-days-and-is-the-fastest-capcom-game-to-do-so">8 million of which were in just three days</a>, Wilds shot up to become the best-selling game in the U.S. year-to-date according to Circana. And while it's still No.1 as of July 5 due to that initial spike, for the month of June, it didn't even crack the top 20 best-selling games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why is Wilds having such a bad time of things? Well, despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">reviewing well initially</a>, its endgame content is sorely lacking compared to past games, so the many fans who play Monster Hunter over time, with friends, are struggling. It's also suffering from severe performance issues on PC specifically that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-takes-aim-at-performance-woes-but-opinions-vary-on-whether-it-worked">have yet to be fully resolved</a>. Despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-heating-up-for-summer-with-its-next-season-event-heres-whats-new">new content and seasons</a>, fans remain unsatisfied with the state of the game, to the point where some players are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-backlash-highlights-how-death-threats-against-devs-are-becoming-a-major-issue-in-japan">taking things too far</a> and apparently harassing and threatening individual Capcom team members over it.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>An update on release date and content of update Ver.1.021</p><p>The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update. To accommodate this change, this update… <a href="https://t.co/aQF1oFMCFR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aQF1oFMCFR</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Which all perhaps explains why Capcom has <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bumped up a planned expansion of endgame content</a> from the end of September to August 13. The planned expansion will include a new level of quest difficulty, a new rewards system, weapon balance adjustments, and other improvements. It's unclear as of yet if this will solve the performance issues, but perhaps it will sate those frustrated at Wilds' weaker endgame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll have to wait for more details to see if this is the start of a turnaround or if Wilds will go down as one of the more disappointing Monster Hunter titles long-term. In the meantime, perhaps a Rise Renaissance is on the horizon if fans gravitate back to older games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<section><p>Despite taking the character and series in a fresh direction, Bananza retains a surprising number of elements from Rare's Donkey Kong titles.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong may have been Nintendo's first breakout star, but for decades, the character was more commonly associated with other developers than he was with his creators. While numerous studios have put out Donkey Kong titles over the years, the simian really came into his own under the stewardship of Rare, who reinvented the character with 1994's seminal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-country/" data-ref-id="5000-2887">Donkey Kong Country</a>. Though it hasn't been involved with the series since the early 2000s, Rare's work was so beloved that it effectively defined Donkey Kong for the next two decades--and that influence can still be felt throughout the newly released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's surprising how much of Rare's DK survived in Bananza. Despite some visual references to past Donkey Kong titles, everything Nintendo had shown off leading up to the game's launch suggested it would be a complete reboot of the series. Even beyond the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-raises-the-possibility-of-a-dk-multiverse/1100-6532529/">lore implications</a> of Donkey Kong teaming up with an inexplicably young Pauline, Bananza's freewheeling, destructive gameplay and subterranean setting are a marked departure from the Donkey Kong Country of old, giving the game a flavor and identity that's wholly distinct from every DK title before it.</p><p dir="ltr">This first impression is not entirely off the mark; right from the outset, Bananza feels like a new direction not just for the character, but the series as a whole. While the game boasts plenty of platforming challenges to overcome, its core loop revolves around smashing your way through dense environments, using DK's mighty strength to carve up the terrain and unearth hidden collectibles. It makes for a decidedly different gameplay experience than previous Donkey Kong titles. And yet, despite this stark change in direction, Bananza still retains a number of elements that Rare's Donkey Kong games pioneered.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540931-img_7006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540931" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540931-img_7006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540931"></a><figcaption>Some of Bananza's challenge stages are overt callbacks to iconic Donkey Kong Country levels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540931-img_7006.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can see vestiges of the studio's influence all over the game design. Many of the elements that have become hallmarks of Rare's Donkey Kong reappear in Bananza. Balloons, initially your life counter in the Donkey Kong Country series, return in a similar role, ferrying you back to safety when you plummet into a bottomless abyss. DKC mainstays like Cranky, Diddy, and Dixie Kong make recurring cameos throughout the adventure, cropping up in unexpected places as you make your way to the planet's core. Even the soundtrack pays homage to Rare's games, interspersing iconic songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPmW6eLX5fw&amp;list=PLbcFKfjvYToWpxtdblXwn7-Ct7_P5qr9i&amp;index=4">DK Island Swing</a> and the DK Rap amongst all the new tracks.</p><p dir="ltr">Rare's lingering influence is even more prominent in Bananza's challenge levels. Battle arenas, which task you with defeating a specific number of enemies against a time limit, take obvious inspiration from similar challenges in Donkey Kong 64, right down to their staging. Some of the platforming courses that DK encounters on his quest, like the fittingly named Nostalgia Country, are even more overt callbacks, playing out like traditional side-scrolling levels with iconic backdrops from DKC. These stages have the same impact as the 8-bit sections in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-odyssey/" data-ref-id="5000-458832">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, offering a pleasant, nostalgia-stirring surprise for longtime fans that lovingly harkens back to the series' roots.</p><p dir="ltr">Bananza shares many other similarities with Odyssey, having been developed by the same team, but both games' freeform structure was, in part, shaped by Rare. Though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-64/" data-ref-id="5000-2007">Super Mario 64</a> established the template that other 3D platformers would follow, Rare built upon it in novel ways with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/banjo-kazooie/" data-ref-id="5000-481">Banjo-Kazooie</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-64/" data-ref-id="5000-311">Donkey Kong 64</a>. Whereas Mario 64 divided up its courses into different "episodes" that each focused on a specific objective, the levels in Rare's games were proper sandboxes, with all of their collectibles available right from the outset. Not all of them were immediately obtainable; some could only be acquired after returning with the appropriate skill. But players had the freedom to explore a stage and pick up as many collectibles as they could without immediately being kicked back to the hub area, which fundamentally changed the experience--and became the approach Nintendo would eventually adopt with Odyssey and Bananza.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540932-img_7010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540932" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540932-img_7010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540932"></a><figcaption>Even Bananza's fossils reference characters and enemies from Rare's Donkey Kong titles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540932-img_7010.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even ideas that initially seem unique to Bananza can be traced back to Rare's Donkey Kong games. Bananza's emphasis on music in particular owes a debt to Donkey Kong 64, which likewise incorporated music as a core component of its gameplay. Partway through the Nintendo 64 adventure, each Kong would add a different musical instrument to their repertoire of skills; DK, for instance, would get his (soon-to-be signature) pair of bongos, while Diddy would acquire an electric guitar. When the Kongs played these instruments in the appropriate spot, they'd send out a devastating shockwave attack that would destroy nearby enemies and activate something around the stage, often leading to a Golden Banana.</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to draw a throughline from DK64's instruments to Pauline's powerful vocal cords, which similarly serve multiple purposes in Bananza. On top of triggering the Bananza transformations, Pauline's singing can disperse Void seals, opening up new parts of the level to explore. She can also launch powerful vocal blasts in co-op mode, which will destroy any terrain and enemies in their path.</p><p dir="ltr">For all the ways Bananza charts a fresh new direction for the series, the game is very much indebted to its past. In reclaiming the character, Nintendo could very well have wiped the slate clean and cast aside all traces of Rare's Donkey Kong, making the character wholly its own. But by preserving so many hallmarks from Rare's DK games, Nintendo has tacitly acknowledged that Bananza would not feel like a proper Donkey Kong title without them--that many of the elements Rare introduced have since become core to Donkey Kong's identity.</p><p>With a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/">rumored Donkey Kong movie</a> on the horizon, Nintendo will likely lean heavily on the series moving forward. But regardless of where DK goes from here, there will always be bits of Rare in his DNA.</p>

<figure><a title="Minecraft Super Mario and Animal Crossing: New Horizons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0e0873c6eb70/minecraft-super-mario-and-animal-crossing-new-horizons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new survey conducted by Japanese variety show <strong>Ariyoshiiieeeee! – Oh yeah! Wanna play games at your place now?</strong> has <a href="https://tver.jp/episodes/ep0lxbslkd">revealed Japan's favourite video games</a>, both overall and by age rating, and while the likes of Mario, Splatoon, Pokémon, Zelda, Animal Crossing, and Dragon Quest all make frequent appearances, none of them made the top spot. (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-top-100-ranking-of-japanese-peoples-favorite-games-dominated-by-domestic-classics-like-mario-and-pokemon-except-for-the-number-one-spot/">Automaton Media</a>!)</p>
<p>Nope, Japan's number one game — at least, according to a survey of 3,000 people conducted by the show — is none other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> landed at second overall, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> came in third. Everyone surveyed was asked to give their five favourite games, and then votes were tallied up to bring us the results.</p>
<p>Now, the above shouldn't be too surprising, as Minecraft is absolutely <em>massive</em> worldwide, and the hosts of the show make a very good point — Minecraft is not just a game, but a platform." And nowadays, as the announcer says, "it's become very normal for young people to experience games not just for the gameplay, but as a means of communication."</p>
<p>The top 100 includes <em>many</em> Nintendo, <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>, and <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> games, but here are a few stats that stood out to us. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> takes the overall number 5 spot, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/apex_legends">Apex Legends</a> at 18. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_diamond_and_pearl">Pokémon Diamond &amp; Pearl</a> is the highest-ranked Pokémon game at 14, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> is right behind it. No Final Fantasy game makes the top ten, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> is the closest at 16th (with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_x_x-2_hd_remaster">X</a> right on its tail).</p>
<p>Other interesting games making an appearance include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/yo-kai_watch_2_bony_spirits_and_fleshy_souls">Yo-kai Watch 2</a> at 25, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> at 46, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at 60, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/xevious">Xevious</a> at 93. Xevious!</p>
<p>Here's the overall top 10 — for the rest of the results, check out <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-top-100-ranking-of-japanese-peoples-favorite-games-dominated-by-domestic-classics-like-mario-and-pokemon-except-for-the-number-one-spot/">Automaton Media</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Minecraft</strong></li>
<li><strong>Super Mario Bros.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fortnite</strong></li>
<li><strong>Splatoon 3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Splatoon 2</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dragon Quest</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Breaking things down by age group, the show split these into five categories — gamers in their teens (10-19), 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s.</p>
<p>For teens, Minecraft is unequivocally the number one game, with Fortnite and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> rounding out the top three. Mojang's mammoth game also makes it into the top ten games for those in their 20s at number 8, where Diamond &amp; Pearl sits up top ahead of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Ultimate</a> and New Horizons.</p>
<p>For those of us in our 30s (like this author), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red &amp; Green</a> is number one, with Final Fantasy X and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_gold_and_silver">Gold &amp; Silver</a> right behind it. Not surprised at the early-gen Pokémon love here. For the 40s and 50s crowd, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior_iii">Dragon Quest III</a> and Super Mario Bros. are the one-two here (flipped for the older gamers), with another Dragon Quest game right behind them — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/dragon_quest_v_hand_of_the_heavenly_bride">V</a> for the 40-year-olds, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior">the original NES game</a> for the 50s.</p>
<p>We're not massively surprised at any of these results, but it's an interesting look at how trends in video games have shifted over time — and what people value in video games. And while the vast majority of games are from Japan, there are lots of Western titles making a dent in people's hearts — and consoles. You can watch the <a href="https://tver.jp/episodes/ep0lxbslkd">episode right here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it's only a small sample of people (3,000 isn't many!), but it's still an interesting capsule of consumer interests, and it pairs nicely with Nikkei's own survey, which shows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/gender-split-and-average-ages-of-japanese-nintendo-players-revealed-via-new-survey">gender splits and average ages for fans of particular series</a>.</p>

                <p>What do you make when you combine Scrabble, Wordle, and Balatro? It's Birdigo and it's out now. This single-player word and deckbuilding game combines elements from those games, guiding a flock of birds on a global migration by forming words from a deck of letter cards. Each word propels the flock forward, with longer or more strategic words generating more "flaps," which determine how far the birds travel.</p><p>Gameplay centers around building words using a hand of letter cards drawn from your evolving deck. Some cards come with special abilities and certain letter combinations that can dramatically increase your score. As the game progresses, you collect new cards, upgrades, and modifiers like enchanted feathers or bird songs that change the rules in your favor. The key is to balance word-building with careful deck management to keep your flock moving along.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540945-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540945" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540945-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540945"></a><figcaption>Help birds migrate using big words.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540945-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540946-ss_ae5a7ff153497701821ea9332d4d03d02a18ec8d.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540947-ss_fb34bcc3513402c5f410dfd028fca50c54d59c97.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540948-ss_901633dc00954ae3baa47e88ccb75ee1b650d0ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540949-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540950-ss_43597894232713328f5cc8912faad5934767560a.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540951-ss_24124968ba3fe08b721c7c19d80e5f9768982824.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540952-ss_ab7b041829f1db1b9ca5b9e81d23ba36d931fe74.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540953-ss_086011c00061d0db39d073095f76812810d15798.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540954-ss_c069226d24aefa2e82b9d66f3ac3caf7c125bf9e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540946,1300-4540947,1300-4540948,1300-4540949,1300-4540950,1300-4540951,1300-4540952,1300-4540953,1300-4540954" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540946-ss_ae5a7ff153497701821ea9332d4d03d02a18ec8d.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540947-ss_fb34bcc3513402c5f410dfd028fca50c54d59c97.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540948-ss_901633dc00954ae3baa47e88ccb75ee1b650d0ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540949-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540950-ss_43597894232713328f5cc8912faad5934767560a.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540951-ss_24124968ba3fe08b721c7c19d80e5f9768982824.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540952-ss_ab7b041829f1db1b9ca5b9e81d23ba36d931fe74.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540953-ss_086011c00061d0db39d073095f76812810d15798.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4540954-ss_c069226d24aefa2e82b9d66f3ac3caf7c125bf9e.1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540946-ss_ae5a7ff153497701821ea9332d4d03d02a18ec8d.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540947-ss_fb34bcc3513402c5f410dfd028fca50c54d59c97.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540948-ss_901633dc00954ae3baa47e88ccb75ee1b650d0ec.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540949-ss_bf707596f57b75d1b3bf19f77385952cb82ce3de.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540950-ss_43597894232713328f5cc8912faad5934767560a.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540951-ss_24124968ba3fe08b721c7c19d80e5f9768982824.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540952-ss_ab7b041829f1db1b9ca5b9e81d23ba36d931fe74.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540953-ss_086011c00061d0db39d073095f76812810d15798.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4540954-ss_c069226d24aefa2e82b9d66f3ac3caf7c125bf9e.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Birdigo uses roguelike mechanics, so each game is a fresh run with randomized elements, and the challenge increases the further you get.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/716209/pubg-2-0-fortnite-roblox-platform-krafton-earnings</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pubg%E2%80%99s-plan-to-beat-fortnite-roblox-and-every-other-game.1257486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox and <em>Fortnite</em> are two of the biggest games around, and a huge part of why is because they aren’t just one game: instead, they’re vast platforms where you can party up with your friends, dress up in ridiculous digital outfits, and quickly jump from one experience to another. Back in the day, <em>Fortnite</em> copied <em>PUBG</em> by making a battle royale, and now, <em>PUBG</em> is mimicking <em>Fortnite</em> by trying to become more of a platform than a game.</p><p>As part of a roadmap released earlier <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/8308">this year</a>, <em>PUBG</em> developer Krafton said that it would let players create their own modes as part of an alpha, and it revealed more details about the alpha <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/8865">this month</a>. This week, Krafton CFO Dongkeun Bae also discussed the company’s vision for “<em>PUBG</em> 2.0” in <a href="https://youtu.be/lghT4WUpgZQ?feature=shared">an earnings call</a>. “It will not just simply be a battle royale game per se,” he said through a translator.</p><p>The game will also be “a gameplay platform” and Krafton is developing “wide-ranging modes under that objective.” It seems like this approach will be a lot like <em>Fortnite</em>’s, which offers a mix of Epic Games-made modes and user-created experiences. Krafton also isn’t just doing user-generated content (UGC) because it’s “currently the mainstream,” Bae said. With UGC, if it’s opened up to the broader player base, players will be able to “create many different things” with <em>PUBG</em>.</p><p>The shift makes sense. By opening <em>PUBG</em> — which is still one of the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2Fmostplayed" rel="sponsored">most-played titles on Steam</a> — to different kinds of experiences, it could grow beyond just hardcore shooter fans. <em>Fortnite</em>’s battle royale modes are still quite popular, but you can also play lower-stakes modes themed around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316954/lego-fortnite-brick-life-social-roleplay-game">Lego</a><em>,</em> navigating obstacle courses, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/8/23993494/catch-some-air">racing</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340770/fortnite-festival-local-multiplayer">playing music together</a>. Epic has put a lot of effort behind expanding from just being a battle royale experience, even if some of them, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241414/fortnite-party-royale-ltm-mode">a combat-free party island</a>, haven’t been big hits. And Roblox’s user-made <em>Grow a Garden</em>, which is a farming simulator, has been <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/robloxs-grow-a-garden-hits-industry-record-213m-concurrent-users-surpassing-pubg-fortnite-and-more/">breaking concurrent player records</a>.</p><p>In some ways, adding user-generated content is a continuation of <em>PUBG</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> following similar tracks. Like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>PUBG</em> has <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/7408">big crossover events</a>, for example<em>. </em>But <em>PUBG</em>’s creator tools have a long way to go to catch up with what’s possible with <em>Fortnite</em> and Roblox, though. Roblox was first released <em>in 2006</em>, and the company offers the <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313860-Roblox-Studio">Roblox Studio</a> for making games and <a href="https://create.roblox.com/">extensive resources for Roblox developers</a>. And Epic is investing heavily in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/22/23645671/fortnite-unreal-editor-epic-games-state-of-gdc-2023-creative">Unreal Engine-level tools for making <em>Fortnite</em> experiences</a>. But like with Roblox and <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>PUBG</em> players may have already invested time and money that makes switching over to a new game that much more difficult. By letting players make their own experiences, Krafton can keep those players interested in the <em>PUBG</em> universe and potentially pull in new ones.</p><p>One thing Krafton may also learn from <em>Fortnite</em>: this kind of player-driven expansion can take a long time. Epic has been working and iterating for years to build up <em>Fortnite</em>’s ecosystem of user-made experiences, and even then, Epic’s own modes are usually the ones with the most players. It will probably take a while to know if Krafton’s <em>PUBG</em> 2.0 plan is a winner winner chicken dinner.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/716209/pubg-2-0-fortnite-roblox-platform-krafton-earnings]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To me and millions of other people who grew up listening to alternative rock in the early 2000s, Chester Bennington was a generation-defining voice of rock music. This month marks the eighth anniversary of his passing, and I still remember exactly where I was when I heard the news. I had never been truly affected by a celebrity’s death before, but when I saw <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2017/07/20/linkin-park-singer-chester-bennington-dead-commits-suicide/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2017/07/20/linkin-park-singer-chester-bennington-dead-commits-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the original TMZ report</a></span> while lying on my living room couch, it felt like the whole planet tilted on its axis. I was sick to my stomach and knew, at some point, word would get to someone in my family in the other room and they’d come to check on me, and I dreaded having to acknowledge it out loud. I locked myself in my room like I was barricading myself up in anticipation of an incoming attack. The battle I was preparing for was a seven-word exchange from the other side of my door:</p><div><p>“Kenneth, Linkin Park’s singer died,” my mother said through the door.</p><p>“I know,” I responded.</p><p>My mother knew well enough to leave me alone after that, but 17 years of my life were flashing before my eyes, so I wouldn’t have been fit for a conversation anyway. I remembered borrowing my childhood friend’s burned copy of <em>Meteora</em> for weeks and listening to it on loop so many times that even now, 20 years later, I still anticipate the “skip” in the third line of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYiU_JCYtU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYiU_JCYtU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Numb”</a></span> that came every time I listened to the scratched disc. I lamented that I’d only seen Linkin Park live once, during the 2012 Honda Civic Tour, and would never get to hear Bennington’s wailing through the speakers again. And oddly enough, one of the most pronounced memories I had was of all the (sometimes) poorly made AMVs I’d watched on YouTube, which had made use of the band’s songs.</p></div><p>For many kids growing up during the early 2000s, Linkin Park’s radio success with songs like “Numb” and “In The End” meant they were among our first exposures to heavier music. Before I knew who Linkin Park was, I would often only hear these songs in the dead of night on the pop radio station my family listened to. When I got my first personal radio that I kept in my bedroom, I kept it on late into the night in hopes that one of their songs would play. Hearing “In The End” at eight years old, a few times a week at most, was a musical awakening. I had never heard a voice like Chester’s, or considered lyrics like the band’s. I had been raised on a diet of mostly boy bands and country up to that point, and Linkin Park was coming into my life at a pretty formative moment.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Meanwhile, by the time I was midway through elementary school, I was watching more anime like <em>Dragon Ball </em>and playing more angsty, emotionally driven games like <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, and the 2000s-era <em>Sonic </em>games. Superheroes had also entered my field of view, but the <em>X-Men </em>films and <em>Evolution </em>animated series were my touchstones at that point. My media diet had been largely controlled by my parents, but the more time I spent with friends in elementary school, the more I was exposed to the kind of art that altered my younger self’s brain chemistry. I wasn’t quite an emo kid yet, but the seeds were being sown, and Linkin Park was a musical anchor for these changes. Right about this time, I was also getting access to the internet, and my earliest exposures to fandom and internet culture were set to rapper Mike Shinoda’s flow.</p><p>Before the days of Spotify and long before I had enough money to buy CDs or an iPod, one of my primary ways of listening to music I didn’t own yet was through YouTube. If a band hadn’t released a music video for a song, there was certainly a pre-teen with iMovie and a dream who had set hastily-clipped-together snippets of their favorite anime or movie to it. Linkin Park has sold millions of records and sold out stadiums, but one of their most enduring roles in pop culture is as <em>the</em> early 2000s AMV band. Almost anyone who was a fan of anime like <em>Dragon Ball Z </em>probably has core memories of fan videos set to Linkin Park’s music.</p><p>The association is still so strong that if you scroll down to the comment sections of some of these videos, you’ll find that fans flocked to them shortly after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/akira-toriyama-dragon-ball-dies-quest-chrono-trigger-1851318780&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/akira-toriyama-dragon-ball-dies-quest-chrono-trigger-1851318780"><em>Dragon Ball </em>creator Akira Toriyama passed in 2024</a></span>. Some of these edits have more views than the band’s actual music videos, like this <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOAyJPc3Nx4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOAyJPc3Nx4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Spider-Man </em>video</a></span> set to “What I’ve Done,” which has accumulated over 179 million views over the past 16 years, eclipsing quite a few of the band’s official works. Plenty of other outfits from this era, like Evanescence and Breaking Benjamin, share the distinction of being AMV bands, and while it’s partially because their mainstream success had made them each something of a household name, it’s also because each of these bands’ music is built upon intense emotion that blends seamlessly with the bursts of stylized action, angst, and agony so common in the works AMVs tend to celebrate.</p><p>When you’re young, you feel every emotion with a raw intensity you (hopefully) grow out of as you get older. Listening to Linkin Park now, I find that a lot of the band’s early nu metal efforts speak to that unbridled rage and hopelessness you might feel when you’re young but can’t neatly fold up and articulate in something more poetic. Bennington repeatedly screams “shut up when I’m talking to you” in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qlCC1GOwFw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qlCC1GOwFw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“One Step Closer,”</a></span> and yeah, a different band (and even Linkin Park itself on later records) would probably find a more eloquent way of expressing frustration with someone who has repeatedly berated you to the point of making you lose your cool. That’s not to say I view Linkin Park’s old records as “childish” or “immature,” but it does provide a context for why so many of those decade-old music videos of anime and video games we were playing in the early 2000s are set to Linkin Park’s music. They are as much a cultural artifact as the band’s music, emblematic of where the band and their fans were 25 years ago. Linkin Park’s legacy was written in the glow of CRTs playing Toonami and riffed on in early versions of Final Cut Pro.</p><p>These days, AMVs have taken a different form in TikTok edits, and newer bands like Sleep Token, Bring Me the Horizon, and Cafuné have become staples on the app. But Linkin Park’s influence persists, with “What I’ve Done” having <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-it-came-out-in-2007-directed-by-michael-bay&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-it-came-out-in-2007-directed-by-michael-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">become a meme</a></span> referencing its inclusion in the <em>Transformers</em> film. Even after Linkin Park’s heyday has come and gone, we still associate their music with a specific era of self-serious fan edits that still manage to hit. Apps like TikTok have made editing tools so widespread that these references become much more universally understood and recreated, to the point where decades later, younger audiences are extending that cultural footprint.</p><p>I saw Linkin Park for the third time at Barclays Center yesterday. It was my second time seeing them with new frontwoman Emily Armstrong, so I’ve now officially seen the band more times without Bennington than with him. While it was clear that the crowd skewed toward millennials, there were a lot of kids there, young enough that I wondered how cognizant they were of the band before Bennington died in 2017. Whenever they started listening, they were still singing along to songs older than they were. So perhaps even though they’re coming in hearing Armstrong perform everything from the back catalog, the kids are being raised on the old texts, and all that early 2000s angst isn’t being lost to the ether.</p><p>Armstrong has been under a lot of scrutiny since she joined Linkin Park in 2024, both for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/credy50z4j1o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/credy50z4j1o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some very valid reasons</a></span> having to do with her past support of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/arts/television/danny-masterson-rape-trial-sentencing.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/arts/television/danny-masterson-rape-trial-sentencing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny Masterson</a></span> and her ties to the Church of Scientology, and as a result of some fans seeing her take on the vocalist role as a betrayal of Bennington’s legacy. You can’t open up a video of her performing the old songs without someone making a comparison to Bennington’s vocals or spamming “karaoke night” as if she’s just covering someone else’s music. One of Bennington’s last songs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm8LGxTLtQk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm8LGxTLtQk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“One More Light,”</a></span> is about mourning someone who’s gone, and there’s a line that references having “one more chair than you need” at the dinner table when the person who typically sat there isn’t around any longer. When you grieve someone from the outside, like an actor or member of your favorite band, it becomes easy to project your scruples onto the world as it continues to spin. Sometimes, when an artist you deeply admire dies, they can become symbols of your own myopic relationship to them before they’re people, and that means we once again <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-anxiety-touch-controversy-1851787007&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-anxiety-touch-controversy-1851787007">start writing fan fiction in our head</a></span> about whatever comes after. To some, Linkin Park persisting after Bennington’s death has felt like letting someone else sit in that empty chair.</p><p>I understand the knee-jerk emotional reaction, and it certainly feels like the band anticipated the pushback they might receive. Linkin Park’s latest record, <em>From Zero</em>, is the first since Armstrong joined the band, and while it’s middle-of-the-road for them, in my opinion, it feels like a grand tour of each one of the band’s previous eras, but with a new singer. It pivots back and forth between the group’s explosive nu metal roots to its more experimental electronic work, almost as if they were trying to prove to everyone that, despite all the turmoil, Linkin Park can still be everything they once were. That includes a band that captures all the emotions our favorite show, movie, or game makes us feel. The empty chair is still there, and no one else is sitting in it. There are just a few new chairs at the table now, and nevertheless, millions of fans are gathering around it once more. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/linkin-park-edit-amv-chester-bennington-emily-armstrong-1851787368]]></content:encoded>

The lineup is headlined by the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F3QKLDLM,B0F3QDLZKG,B0F3QG16DN,B0FC1R9KRL,B0FC1NMTN5&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlackShark V3 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset</a></strong>. The $250 wireless headset is the only model in the lineup with active noise cancellation. It's available in Xbox, PlayStation, and PC versions, but it's worth noting the Xbox edition of all of the V3 models has universal compatibility. If the V3 Pro is a bit too expensive for your budget, Razer also released two substantially more affordable models--the $150 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDP42BTF,B0FH5T1RD1,B0FH5XX7GP,B0FDPJZQNY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>BlackShark V3</strong></a> and the $100 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDNTH3CV,B0FH5YWH7B,B0FDPM6DWH&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>BlackShark V3 X HyperSpeed</strong></a>. The V3 Pro releases August 4, while the other two models are available now.</p><p dir="ltr">While all three BlackShark V3 models share the same over-ear form factor and core features, there are, of course, some notable differences--one of the biggest being their wireless connection quality. The BlackShark V3 and V3 Pro are the first to use Razer’s HyperSpeed Wireless Gen-2 connectivity, which the company says offers playback latency as low as 10ms. The BlackShark V3 X HyperSpeed uses the previous version of the technology, which is still a solid low-latency 2.4GHz option. All models also support Bluetooth wireless pairing and wired connections via USB or 3.5mm.</p><p dir="ltr">The BlackShark V3 Pro is also the only of the three with ANC, and it uses Razer’s high-end Gen-2 TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm drivers. By contrast, the BlackShark V3 uses the Gen-2 TriForce Titanium 50mm drivers, while the V3 X HyperSpeed is equipped with TriForce 50mm drivers. The V3 Pro also features a detachable HyperClear full-band 12mm mic, while BlackShark V3 has a detachable HyperClear super-wideband 9.9mm mic, and the V3 X HyperSpeed uses a detachable HyperClear 9.9mm cardioid mic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540460-blacksharkv3s.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540460" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540460-blacksharkv3s.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540460"></a><figcaption>Razer's BlackShark V3 Pro PlayStation, PC, and Xbox models</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540460-blacksharkv3s.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One thing you’ll find across all three BlackShark V3 wireless headsets is virtual 7.1 surround sound. However, you’ll need to pay attention to which platforms the model is tuned for. The BlackShark V3, V3 Pro, and V3 X HyperSpeed all come in PC-, PlayStation-, and Xbox-specific models. While you can technically use each model on other platforms--the Xbox version is universal--they have specific surround-sound compatibility. The PC versions use either Windows 7.1 surround sound or THX Spatial Audio, which only works on specific versions of Windows. Meanwhile, the PlayStation models use Sony’s Tempest 3D Audio for PS5, and the Xbox models use Windows Sonic. Make sure you grab the appropriate model for your preferred platform if you plan on using virtual surround sound.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the differences in platform and spatial audio support, each platform-specific model of the BlackShark V3, V3 Pro, and V3 X HyperSpeed also features unique color schemes. For example, the PC models are all available in black or white, while the PlayStation models feature black with blue padding and accents, and the Xbox models come in black with green padding and accents.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the full rundown on each of the new BlackShark V3 wireless gaming headset models below.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3994" data-template="4"

<p dir="ltr">The Daywalker isn't the only new addition coming with the game's August 8 patch. As outlined in a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgMriWER-6E" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Vision video</a>, it will also add, remove, and adjust a number of team-up abilities. Guardian Revival, which saw Mantis and Star-Lord take advantage of Adam Warlock's regenerative abilities, is being removed, as is Luna Snow and Iron Fists's Atlas Bond.</p><p dir="ltr">In their place are two new team-ups. Duality Dance will be for Adam Warlock and Luna Snow and looks to power up Luna's attacks based on the damage she received. Another new team-up called Vibrant Vitality sees Mantis serve as the anchor. When partnered with Groot, Groot's walls will heal nearby allies. When she's paired with Loki, his healing fields will also give a damage boost.</p><p dir="ltr">Other team-up changes include Loki being removed from Ragnarok Rebirth, Iron Fist joining Luna Snow's Chilling Assault, Star-Lord joining Rocket Network, and Blade being added to Cloak and Dagger's Lunar Force.</p><p dir="ltr">As for changes to competitive play, the 3.5 update will increase penalties for those leaving competitive matches by enforcing longer bans and implementing larger point deductions for leavers. For those forced to endure the rest of a match after someone on their team leaves, NetEase will offer more point compensation and make it easier to surrender. It also notes that it will be speeding up its appeals process for those banned mistakenly, and will continue to review cases where players are forced to leave games due to "unavoidable system issues."</p><p dir="ltr">While it won't arrive at the same time as Blade and the team-up changes, NetEase also confirmed that new map the Throne of Knull and new mode Resource Rumble will be coming on August 22. Details on hero balance changes and team-up adjustments coming as part of the Season 3.5 update will be announced in the future, NetEase said.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 3 began July 11 and added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-3-adds-phoenix-and-blade-introduces-new-villain/1100-6532891/" data-ref-id="1100-6532891">the Phoenix</a>. The most recent update to the hero shooter added a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-new-fantastic-four-movie-inspired-ability-is-being-used-to-make-the-things-life-hell/1100-6533500/" data-ref-id="1100-6533500">Fantastic Four: First Steps-inspired team-up ability</a> for the Human Torch and The Thing that some players aren't exactly using as intended, while the cast of the film also recently tried their hand at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-the-fantastic-four-cast-play-as-their-characters-in-marvel-rivals/1100-6533446/" data-ref-id="1100-6533446">playing their respective characters in-game</a>.</p>

<p>Risk it all in August</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>WayForward has given us a Switch release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</a>, the once-cancelled GBA sequel to the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/shantae">Shantae</a> game.</p>
<p>Coming to Switch on <strong>19th August 2025</strong> — a few months after some fans got hold of a GBA cartridge with the game on it from Limited Run Games — Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution is also getting a Deluxe Edition, which comes with three extra costumes for the genie to dress up in.</p>
<p>These three exclusive costumes are the Relic Hunter, High Voltage, and Sizzle Armor, each giving Shantae unique powers. If you're getting the physical version of the game, the Deluxe Edition is already included on the cartridge. Pre-orders go live on 8th August 2025 at <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all-games/products/shantae-advance-risky-revolution-standard-edition-switch-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc?_pos=5&amp;_sid=1f19ab402&amp;_ss=r">Limited Run Games</a>, where the game costs $34.99.</p>

<p>Let's get a quick rundown of the game from developer WayForward, then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shantae is back in an adventure 20 years in the making! The nefarious pirate Risky Boots has a “groundbreaking” new plan that will leave Sequin Land spinning — by rotating the continent, she can move any town right to the coast for easy plundering! As Shantae, turn the tectonic tables on Risky by taking control of the land itself: shift, twist, navigate, and explore by swapping between mix-and-match multilayered levels! Hair-whip and belly-dance your way through scrambled lands, misplaced towns, monster-filled crypts, and daunting labyrinths. Six creature transformations, fierce boss battles, and a 4-player versus mode await!</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:<br>
-</strong> Discover the lost chapter of the Shantae saga, fully restored and released after 20 years!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Fight and explore using your hair-whipping ability, magic items, and belly-dance transformations (including monkey, elephant, crab, and more)!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Spin and shift Front Yard and Back Yard playfields to create new routes and solve puzzles!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Visit towns, battle through labyrinths, purchase upgrades, find collectables, and meet with friends like Rottytops, Sky, and Bolo!<br>
<strong>-</strong> For the first time ever in a Shantae game, four players can compete in Battle Mode!</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-playtest-material-transformation-image.jpg?itok=Bm16HyTY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-playtest-material-transformation-image.jpg?itok=22bfQkf2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Those players can then provide feedback to Darrington Press. Based on that feedback, the material may be adjusted and released in official supplements down the line.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the new transformation represents changes to a player's character in <em>Daggerheart</em>. These changes can be done for narrative purposes by the GM or can be used as a character creation option. The playtest material contains rules and cards for six transformations: Vampire, Werewolf, Demigod, Ghost, Reanimated, and Shapeshifter.</p>

<p>How the transformation <em>Daggerheart</em> playtest material works in-game is that your character adds the corresponding transformation card to their loadout, ignoring their domain card limit. A character can only have one transformation total. That transformation card then provides an appropriate benefit and drawback.</p>

<p>The playtest material encourages gaming tables to figure out the origin of this transformation alongside the implications of the power going wrong. For example, vampire and werewolf transformations are staples of pop culture; get bitten and be forever changed. But while a werewolf player benefits from a Wolf Form, sacrificing Stress for a damage boost, they can potentially massacre their party with the Frenzy drawback.</p>

<p>The more eclectic forms do encourage some more creativity. Reanimated and Ghost do contain potential for dark fantasy and horror adventures, and the Demigod does invite some intriguing worldbuilding and roleplay potential if done well.</p>

<p>The new transformation Daggerheart playtest material, which includes rules and the transformation cards, are free to download.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>With Fortnite OG existing as its own permanent mode now, we aren't expecting another throwback mini-season in the vein of last year's Chapter 2 Remix or the original OG season the year before. But with the upcoming Chapter 6 Season 4 starting on August 8, we're pretty much guaranteed a new mini-season in November, because Fortnite has never had a four-month season on purpose before. Instead, the hot rumor since the beginning of May is that we'll be getting another collaboration mini-season like Star Wars season in May, this time with <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1920270562812670238" rel="nofollow ">The Simpsons taking center stage</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When you consider Epic's cozy relationship with Disney, plus its long history of Fox Animation collabs--including three cartoon dads Fortnite dropped for Father's Day this past June--this rumor sounds pretty plausible. Indeed, there's been nearly no skepticism about it at all. November is still a long ways away, though, and a lot can happen between now and then. While we wait, let's see what exactly the rumor mill has said about this one.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When would the Simpsons mini-season start?</h2><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1950226569697362395" rel="nofollow ">next season's update schedule</a>, Chapter 6 Season 4 should end on Saturday, November 1, which indicates it'll have a live finale event to wrap things up during the day. If things work the way they did after the Death Star Sabotage event in June, the new mini-season would begin that same evening after 4-7 hours of maintenance. Otherwise, it would start the next morning, on November 2.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Is the Simpsons mini-season officially confirmed?</h2><p dir="ltr">Not at all. Every bit of info about the purported Simpsons season comes from leakers and dataminers, and it has all just been written descriptions--there's been no leaked art or anything tangible that might serve as some level of confirmation. There is, however, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1932068250143039720" rel="nofollow ">one poster in Utopia City</a> that could be hinting at a Simpsons collab, but that's not confirmation of any sort of takeover.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering the way Epic typically likes to hold back on promoting a new season until the current one is almost over, we've got a while before Epic will say anything about it at all. But prominent leakers have been harping on it so regularly that a lot of folks have taken it as read that a Simpsons season is coming. But until some real teasers start popping up, November's Simpsons mini-season remains an unconfirmed rumor.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What would a Simpsons mini-season entail?</h2><p dir="ltr">The rumors so far are vague and confusing, and so it's a little difficult to sift through it all right now. The full picture is not even remotely clear just yet. Keep that in mind as we lay out the fractured details that we currently have.</p><p dir="ltr">The most surprising detail among the rumors thus far is that the Simpsons will have an entire map modeled after the Simpsons' hometown of Springfield, but the claim is that it will be <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1931473086538531263" rel="nofollow ">the size of a Reload map and support only 40 players</a>. It's not out of the question that the main Battle Royale mode could go small for this since it only lasts a month--let's not forget that Epic made <em>everyone</em> play Zero Build for two weeks after it was introduced in early 2022. But there's also another fairly obvious possibility worth considering: that the Springfield map actually <em>will</em> be for Reload, rather than BR.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering Reload is Fortnite's clear no. 2 mode at this point, and it has no battle pass, it wouldn't be surprising if Epic looked for new ways to encourage folks to play it. Plus, it just got a Squid Game-themed map added to its rotation in June, so there's precedent. On the other hand, this part of the rumor could be completely wrong. Blortzen, the leaker who first spread the rumor about the Simpsons season, suggested in June that the rumor about a small map was <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1934688153606004804" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">actually about Blitz Royale</a>, which was announced a couple weeks after all these Simpsons rumors were spread around.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond that, everything else we've heard makes this rumored Simpsons season sounds like it will include most of the same stuff other mini-seasons have--a small battle pass, accompanying shop skins, and weekly changes to the map. But since we haven't heard any significant new details since the beginning of June, it's still hard to gauge what exactly Simpsons season will look like.</p>

This bonkers dating sim boasted a monster voice cast with portfolios spanning <strong>Final Fantasy</strong>, <strong>Persona</strong>, <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> and more, but it was let down by some heartbreaking performance issues. Fortunately, the latest Switch update — which developer Sassy Chap Games calls a "mega patch" — should clear some of that up.</p>
<p>The latest update bundles three previous hotfixes into one bug break-up package. Those bugs have clearly been the target of this one, with the "mega patch" fixing a lot of issues in the game's multiple endings, and adding an overall performance boost to the Switch version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Will Host An Open Beta for Battlefield 6 in August, Dates Revealed – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-closed-beta-august/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-will-host-an-open-beta-for-battlefield-6-in-august-dates-revealed-%E2%80%93-rumor.1257429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA will reportedly host an open beta for Battlefield 6 in August, potentially even two open betas, the first at the beginning of the month and the second one later in the month.</p>



<p>This claim comes from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta/">Insider-Gaming</a>, which claims from its sources that access to a closed beta can be gained through a promotion with several content creators who will be giving away codes on Twitch. Insider-Gaming also claims that following the closed beta on August 7-8, the beta will continue until August 10th in an "<em>open-beta phase</em>," though that is seemingly separate from an open beta later in the month from August 14-17.</p>



<p>Shortly after Insider-Gaming's report, however, in the official Battlefield Discord server, EA's global community manager denied the claim that there was a closed beta at all, confirming that only an open beta is planned. Perhaps Insider-Gaming's wires were crossed, and there are two open betas planned. Either way, we'll likely know for sure tomorrow.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We got our first official look at Battlefield 6 just <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/">last week</a>, with its debut trailer showing what looked more like cutscenes from various points of the game's campaign rather than gameplay. Last week's announcement also confirmed that we'll get a gameplay trailer for multiplayer tomorrow, July 31, 2025, which is likely where we'll find out if Insider-Gaming and its sources are correct about the beta dates. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Event" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_BRbvYxgOY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While there's definitely a lot riding on the campaign for Battlefield 6, its multiplayer is what will decide if the game lives or dies. It took EA months to undo the mistakes and damage it did to Battlefield 2042's multiplayer, which was unfortunately the only mode 2042 had since it lacked a campaign.</p>



<p>EA has a lot riding on Battlefield 6, with four of its core studios working on it and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">hundreds of millions reportedly invested </a>into its development. We'll see how players respond to tomorrow's gameplay trailer, and if Battlefield 6 will have the legs EA is expecting it to have.</p>

            <p>If the messy situation regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> and those ousted studio heads has led you to wonder if publishers Krafton might be mismanaging the development of their games, the company's chief financial officer reckons you're diving in the wrong sea. According to Dongkeun Bae, Subnautica 2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">delay from 2025 release to 2026</a> is proof that Krafton are doing a good job with that, actually.</p>
<p>The exec said as much via translator during a recent earnings call that, among many other things, featured the publishers' own version of the events surrounding Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis being parachuted in at Unknown Worlds to replace senior executives Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">last month</a>. Whether Subnautica 2 was genuinely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">ready to release in early access</a> this year is a key part of the whole fracas. Krafton say no, the three fired leads say yes, and now the latter are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">suing</a>. The complicating factor is that there was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-will-get-their-bonus-says-krafton-but-its-not-the-250-million-promised">big bonus for the studio's workers</a> tied to the game releasing this year.</p>

<p>All of that context brings us to Krafton's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lghT4WUpgZQ">latest quarterly earnings call</a>. During the Q&amp;A section that always follows the great number-filled presentationy bit of these things, CFO Dongkeun Bae was asked by one analyst whether Krafton are struggling to manage all their different game projects, given the disagreement over Subnautica 2's readiness for early access. That analyst also questioned whether the company's "internal standard is appropriate for different games and different initiatives, Subnautica 2 milestone included".</p>
<p>"I do fully understand that from the outside you may think that because there's talk of legal proceedings of Subnautica 2 and it being delayed, that could make you think that maybe within Krafton our milestone process is being mismanaged," Bae responded, continuing as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>There's a bit of I believe a reasoning leap or reasoning gap between those two points. I say that because the actions that we've taken on Subnautica 2 actually represent that things are effectively being managed inside Krafton when it comes to the milestone management. </p>
<p>I say that because...[the] Subnautica IP basically has this big follower base, this fandom base. So, as long as we market it and we release it into the market, people would say that there's [a] certain level of sales from this title [which] will be guaranteed. But what we are seeking to do is to make sure that we satisfy the highest level of satisfaction that the gamers have, their aspiration. And so because we've managed the whole milestone process very rigorously within the company, we were able to make the decision that we made regarding Subnautica 2 and because we felt that the game was not up to par, not up to the level that we had wished it to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's a fairly blunt way of saying that if they weren't managing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> properly, they'd have been cool essentially chucking out any old shite with the Subnautica name on it, because it'd probably make bank regardless.</p>
<p>In response to another question from the same person, Bae also talked a bit about how Krafton sees Subnautica 2 as worth approaching differently to life sim InZoi, despite both going the early access route. Basically, with the latter not being an established name and offering "a great level of freedom" that might leave players feeling a bit lost or overwhelmed, Krafton reckon getting live feedback on it ASAP is the key priority. By contrast, the publishers believe that as an established thing, Subnautica 2's facing "much higher" initial expectations from players, and will need to offer a "greater level of distinctive and differentiating fun factor". </p>
<p>So, there's a bit more of the company giving more of its view and arguably playing a bit of defense even to money types about the Subnautica 2 situation, which continues to rumble on as we wait to see what'll happen with the lawsuit brought by the former studio leads.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-delay-actually-proves-krafton-arent-mismanaging-their-games-says-exec]]></content:encoded>
