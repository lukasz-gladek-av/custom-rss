<p>There has been a fair bit of news in the world of Nintendo this week.

<p>Oh gosh, there is so much that I want to play and so little time to play it! Despite having a good time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> so far, I'm still only a couple of hours into it. I'm hoping to remedy that this weekend, but I'd also like to check out the Pokémon Legends: Z-A DLC, and finally wrap up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, which leaves time for... not much else.</p>
<p>Hey ho, back to the sofa we go!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>As is customary in the race to catch up with the year's games, I've distracted myself with something from eons ago that has zero relevance to 2025 GOTY discussions. The kids saw the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy REROLL</a> icon on my Switch menu, and that was that. Helluva game, and its compulsive mix of simple goals, absurdity, and awesome audio has been a salve in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm still playing the brilliant <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simogo_legacy_collection">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> (which managed to haul me from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit-nintendo-switch-2-edition">BALL x PIT</a>) and I'm enjoying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>. Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Okay, so how much did Leon’s gameplay in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> look like a cross between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">6</a>?! Wild. So of course that means I’m playing more RE this weekend. Specifically… yes, 4 and 6. Leon’s back baby, and I couldn’t be more thrilled.</p>
<p>I do, however, think it’s about time I actually play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> properly. It’s been sitting on my home screen since launch and I’ve played the tutorial battle about 10 times before something else comes along and distracts me. Maybe I need to stop playing so much Resident Evil…<br>
Nah.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>By the time you’re reading this, I will have completed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and that is my GOTY 2025. I will be feeling a great emptiness in my life, that joy of experiencing a great work for the first time forever gone, the eagerness to see what comes next, find a new upgrade, fight a new boss and conclude Samus' and her fellow stranded Federation soldiers' ordeal (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a> sequel when?). More time to wrap up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>'s proper ending and return to the streets of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>.</p>
<p>My game of the week is the much-delayed, much sublime Terminator 2D: No Fate. Bitmap Bureau took on a tall order by grabbing a franchise that is held dear in the hearts of gamers of my generation, but seems to have pulled it off. While <strong>Terminator 2</strong> is one of the finest movie sequels ever produced, it never got a 2D platform run’n’gun game it deserved until yesterday. Maybe the future is gonna be OK after all.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, my mother-in-law has come to stay! What kind of games do mothers of the in-law variety enjoy? Well, I know she likes Mr Bean, because we watched two hours of <strong>Mr Bean</strong> last night. Is there a Mr Bean game? I don't think I want to play it.</p>
<p>I'm still making my way through <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and I just discovered the radio, which is now my favourite thing about the game. And it never tells you about it! Imagine playing <strong>Fallout</strong> without the radio. It would be a very different game. TOW2 has a similar musical vibe, with lots of jazz and swing, except it turns out that it was all commissioned for the game from real jazz and swing bands, with lyrics that reference in-game brands. Yes! All the music is advertising jingles! And it RULES. The lyrics are very funny, especially when you're only half listening as you wander through space and you suddenly catch a line like "Come get your candyyyy (it's tobacco) delicious candyyyy (that's tobacco".</p>
<p>Since it's getting close to Christmas, me and my partner are also considering what our Christmas Time game will be! Right now, he's replaying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> (it's just as good as you remember it being!) but I've also got him the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_i-vi_pixel_remaster">Final Fantasy Collection</a> on Switch, because he expressed interest in wanting to watch me play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy 6</a>. He probably won't read this, so I'm pretty sure it's fine to say that here. But don't tell him, okay?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PUBG Black Budget Alpha—First Impressions and Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-budget-alpha-first-impressions-preview/</link>
            <guid>1382404</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>KRAFTON recently pushed out the first closed alpha for PUBG Black Budget, an all-new extraction shooter with some innovative mechanics and an accessible operating model. It’s aiming to disrupt a genre most recently dominated by the likes of Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders, but does it actually have a chance?</p>



<p>I’m a keen extraction fan (not extractor fan, that’s what lives in your bathroom) and have spent thousands of hours across the genre, so I was all too eager to leap head over heels into PUBG Black Budget, try out the alpha, and feed back my thoughts.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-pubg-black-budget-looking-good">Is PUBG Black Budget Looking Good?</h2>



<p>I’m happy to report that PUBG: Black Budget certainly is looking good. The game is designed to be more of an arcade-like extraction shooter than a borderline milsim title like Escape from Tarkov or Gray Zone Warfare, but it still has plenty of realism. It’s rooted in sci-fi, and players must explore the island of Coli, which is being crushed by the ever-growing anomaly, suffocating the map as the raid goes on.</p>



<p>This means you’re effectively getting a battle royale, extraction shooter hybrid, balancing the best of what PUBG does so well with the growing popularity of the extraction space.</p>



<p>What makes PUBG Black Budget different, though?</p>



<p>I was surprised to learn that a few things are setting PUBG: Black Budget apart from the stock of extraction shooters already on the market.</p>



<p>For instance, Black Budget’s core gameplay loop sees players pick where on the map they infil, giving them some semblance of control over their raid. They can place markers, navigate a dynamic map, and ultimately enjoy a simple, accessible introduction to the extraction shooter space.</p>



<p>It’s how ARC Raiders found so much success recently, by being welcoming rather than punishing.</p>



<p>The game’s anomaly mechanic is a welcome addition, as it ensures players need to adapt <strong>very quickly </strong>in some circumstances. The game’s extraction points are dynamic, and they pop up all over the map as the game unravels, but they’re more prevalent in the closing minutes of the round, which encourages you to stay around longer.</p>



<p>What I will say is that the map is <strong>enormous</strong>, especially for an extraction shooter. It’s going to take a very long time to explore it all, especially as the anomaly frequently eats entire portions of it right off the bat.</p>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-anomaly">Enter The Anomaly</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>PUBG: Black Budget is set on an island where a time-loop mechanic is employed. Every raid is different, but you’re effectively launching a skirmish into the same setting on repeat, because of the time-loop feature. You load up, load in, secure objectives, grab loot, kill other players, and get out alive.</p>



<p>That’s the bread and butter of the extraction space, but how PUBG: Black Budget is doing it is what impressed me.</p>



<p>The arcade approach means a wider audience will be attracted to this game right out of the gate. There are neat traversal mechanics, such as ziplines, vaulting, clambering, and so on, and the weapon mechanics and ballistics are about what you’d expect for an arcade-style shooter.</p>



<p>By that, I mean it’s point-and-shoot without worrying too much about intricate calculations.</p>



<p>The looting loop is attractive, and there’s plenty to find, and players are encouraged to explore the game’s more critical mechanics, such as inventory and health management. It’s pretty basic, but that’s what makes PUBG: Black Budget so good. Even the tutorial is masterfully crafted to give you the best introduction possible to the game’s core concepts.</p>



<p>The quality-of-life improvements over other extraction shooters, like proximity looting, uncomplicated healing mechanisms, and a faster pacing, are all top-notch. It’s also kind of a combination piece. The map feels like Gray Zone, the fundamentals feel like Escape from Tarkov, and the accessibility feels like ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>When your raid is over, and you’ve extracted through a submersible or a wormhole, you’ll find yourself in your hideout. This is a dynamic location that can be expanded and upgraded over time, but unlike Escape from Tarkov’s hideout function, it allows the player to pick and choose what they do and where they place upgrades and new benches.</p>



<p>As someone who loves base-building mechanics, this spoke to me quite nicely.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-pubg-black-budget-worth-it">Is PUBG Black Budget Worth It?</h2>



<p>PUBG: Black Budget is in closed alpha as I write this, with a second window set to take place <strong>next weekend</strong>. That means it costs nothing to get involved, but there’s a specific path you need to follow <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-black-budget-alpha-key-for-steam/">to get a Black Budget alpha key</a>.</p>



<p>If PUBG: Black Budget were to be released in the state it’s currently in, I’d certainly invest, but I would either hope it’s free to play, or that it has a price tag not exceeding $30. I would like to stress that there were no AI-based enemies when I played, beyond a little wildlife, and that’s strange for a PvPvE shooter.</p>



<p>The niggling issues aren’t really there, as I had no problems occur when I was playing. All the issues came from getting a key in the first place, and once I did, I was very happy with what I experienced in Black Budget.</p>



<p>With the backing of KRAFTON and the inevitable massive creator campaigns sitting on the horizon, I’m confident that Black Budget will at least enjoy a solid launch, if not a lengthy lifecycle in the extraction shooter space.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> have come and gone and Half-Life 3 was still nowhere to be seen, despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors of an imminent official announcement</a>. That was more than enough to send some of the fans who had truly believed into utter despair, but all is not lost.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/x7GRLcaZtgA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest episode of the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a>, journalist Mike Straw provided an update on the Half-Life 3 situation. According to his sources, Valve is holding back the announcement due to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/within-three-months-samsung-ddr5-5600-16-gb-module-price-rose-by-3x-in-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing RAM pricing issues</a> affecting the PC industry, which will inevitably impact the price of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>. Since the game is supposed to be the big launch title of the new hardware, it doesn't make sense to reveal it until they are ready to go forward with the Steam Machine. The original launch window was <strong>Spring 2026</strong> for both. </p>



<p><em>I wanted to just give an update on things. People have asked. I have been told a date. I wasn't going to report that date because they weren't 100% confident in that date. That date has sailed past. So, there's a reason I didn't report it. Every date from every journalist I've spoken with, every creator who follows it and has dug, every single date that they were told has passed. [...] Now, everything I have, everybody I talked to, is still adamant that Half-Life 3 will be a launch title for the Steam Machine. </em></p>



<p><em>There is a concern, however, that they haven't made a decision on price, which is holding back the announcement of anything else. The reason is because of PC RAM prices. They're up 200%, 300%, 500% of what they were in October, and it's only getting worse. The window that I was told was Spring 2026, for the Steam Machine, for the Steam Frame, for the Steam Controller, for Half-Life 3. [...] At the end of the day, the game is real. There's no denying it. It's just a when and not if at this point. All the signs pointed to it being announced in December. Then everything hit the fan, and I think it was a case of that concern. The Steam Machine was supposed to be Q1, like the end of Q1 2026, but I'm starting to wonder if that hardware's going to be pushed out. </em></p>



<p><em>I can tell you the people I spoke to about this game, they're not these run-of-the-mill sources that haven't gotten me information before. They're the same sources that have given me details on Madden. A couple of them are the same sources that have given me details on <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lord-of-the-rings-third-person-action-game-in-development-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings game that is in development that I reported on</a>. They're not random, like, one-off people, and they're still adamant that Half-Life 3 is coming in the Spring.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the pricing of the Steam Machine has already been a somewhat controversial topic, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following Valve's confirmation that it won't be subsidized like consoles</a>. That is to say, Valve isn't willing to lose money on unit sales to recoup with game sales via Steam and accessory sales, as Microsoft and Sony have done in the past with Xbox and PlayStation consoles. With the aforementioned RAM pricing issue, Valve may be forced to put a hefty price tag on the hardware, potentially hampering its sales from the start. It makes sense that they would rather wait and even delay its launch a bit if necessary.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, if you'd like to get a sense of how Half-Life 3 might play once it is finally released, <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-reportedly-getting-announced-soon-but-how-will-it-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out our dedicated article</a>, which includes all datamined information from Source 2 engine updates and more. </p>

<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 has almost reached its climax, with the semi-finals promising some of the most intense action of the season thus far. The $1.25 million tournament has already delivered some unforgettable clashes, but the best is yet ot come.</p>



<p>The first semi-final fixture will see Team Spirit face Team Vitality, while the second pits FaZe Clan against Natus Vincere. These stellar match-ups are almost impossible to predict, but that’s just what we’re doing below.</p>



<p>If you want to place a bet on the Budapest semi-finals, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet"></a></figure>











<h2 id="h-everything-to-play-for">Everything To Play For</h2>



<p>Vitality, led by the legendary ZywOo, remains one of the most consistent forces in Counter-Strike after a stunning season. Team Spirit, surfacing in the opener of the semi-finals, will need to pull off something remarkable to push Vitality out of the tournament, but it’s by no means impossible.</p>



<p>Faze Clan versus Natus Vincere is an interesting fixture. The former team has had a tough run through the tournament thus far, producing a rocky streak that has had many surprised they’ve made it this far. The team recently eliminated MOUZ to get into the semi-finals, and they’re mere steps away from that $500,000 grand prize.</p>



<p>In terms of honest predictions, GG.bet has Vitality in the best spot to win the Major, while Spirit follows close behind. If you’re playing the outright markets, this is a relatively safe route to follow. If you want a bigger return, back FaZe Clan, the outsider at this point in the tournament.</p>



<p>However, my prediction is that we’re looking at a Vitality vs. NAVI grand final, with Vitality taking the trophy this time around.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> who you think will win the StarLadder Budapest Major.</p>

It turns out this might be one of the final significant patches.</p>
<p>According to a roughly translated post on social media, the game's director Masahiro Sakurai said the Kirby Air Riders development team will be disbanding in the near future. As a result, there's only a short amount of time left to make balance adjustments.</p>
<p>He goes on to say how there may be one more round of adjustments, but after this, work on the racer is likely done.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adwxsyqu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Sakurai previously mentioned in October how there were no plans for DLC (or similar content) in Kirby Air Riders, stating "everything" was already in the game from the start.</p>

                <p>The cult-favorite survival horror series Fatal Frame returns next year when Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Remake launches for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 12, 2026.

The PS5 and Xbox Series X versions include the full game data on the disc, while the Switch 2 edition is a Game Key Card release. These do not contain the game data, and instead act as physical access keys to the digital version. This means that, despite coming in a physical box and cartridge, the full game still needs to be downloaded from the eShop--though you can lend or borrow Game Key Cards just like standard game carts.

Note that the Switch 2 edition is a Game Key-Card release--that means none of the game data is included on the cartridge. Instead, it acts as a physical DRM key that grants you access to the digital version of the game. You'll have to download the game to your Switch 2 before you can start playing. Pragmata will take up an estimated 17GB of storage space on your Switch 2's internal hard drive or microSD Express card.</p><p>Physical preorders are available at Amazon for $60, and we expect more retailers will have the game soon.

While Diana isn't a fighter, she can ride shotgun on Hugh's back and hack them so that their weak points can be exposed. Hugh can then finish them off, using his arsenal of weapons. Together, the duo will have to dodge the hostile machines and solve puzzles on the fly if they hope to return to Earth.</p><p>Before Pragmata comes out, the other big Capcom release will be Resident Evil: Requiem.

<p>As you might have already heard, this title (where you explore a lunar research station) adds a "unique hacking twist" to gameplay - combining basically puzzle solving, fire fights and more, as you take down robot enemies. To help illustrate what's going on, Capcom has now uploaded a new "hands-on" impressions video, featuring some of its "friends" who explain their own experiences with this new game.</p>
<p>Once again, the demo for Pragmata is available to try out now on Steam, and will be "coming later" to the Switch 2 and other console platforms. Here's a bit about what you can expect when it does arrive on Nintendo's hybrid system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The gameplay demo, known as Sketchbook, lets you try out the tactile combat system that fully engages both sides of your brain, while you also get to experience what it's like to traverse the lunar research station."</p>
<p>"You might discover new things as you replay the demo! Complete the demo to receive an illustration from Diana and don't forget to share it with #PRAGMATA on your socials."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pre-orders have also gone live in select locations. This title will set you back <strong>$59.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent), and there's an amiibo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-capcom-is-bringing-pragmata-to-switch-2-amiibo-and-demo-also-confirmed">Diana on the way</a>. Capcom will also be offering some DLC known as the 'Shelter Variety Pack'. This includes the following items:</p>

		<p>Cast your mind back to the days of PlayStation 3 and Xbox One and there was big kerfuffle when certain companies were found to be making CG render trailers of what was meant to be gameplay, and the game usually turned out looking nothing like the renders. These days every game gets announced with a CG trailer and that means you don’t need to have finished the game, or in the case of&nbsp; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>, maybe not even coded a single line.</p>
<p>It turns out the new studio that is making the game was formed just this year and given AAA games take at least four or five years to make these days, you probably won’t be seeing Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic until the next decade.&nbsp; That is if it ever gets made, Star Wars titles announced at events have a solid track of vanishing in development hell.</p>


<p>Star Wars: 1313 was announced at E3 2012 and was cancelled a year later. Star Wars: Eclipse was announced by Quantic Dream in 2021 and we have not seen a single thing about the game since then. Then we have Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic – Remake which was revealed during a PlayStation Showcase in 2021 with Aspyr developing the title. Since then it seems there have been studio troubles and rumours suggest the entire game was scrapped and now Mad Head Games are on the case.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a> was announced last night at The Game Awards 2025.</p>

<p>“Being set in the past gives us an immense amount of open space to tell new original Star Wars stories, while staying true to the spirit of the galaxy we all love. There are, quite literally, infinite stories to tell. While we will always honor and celebrate the core saga, it’s crucial to explore new territory, meet new characters, and see new parts of the galaxy,” said VP and GM of Lucasfilm Games Douglas Reilly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Friday evening in Budapest has proven to be chaos incarnate, with two favorites falling out of the StarLadder Major. In two fell swoops, MOUZ and FURIA were eliminated from the running by FaZe Clan and NAVI, respectively. These upsets have blown the Major wide open, and the handful of teams remaining will now prepare for a weekend that will end with a trophy being lifted.</p>



<p>Find out how today’s action unfolded below.</p>



<p>If you want to place a bet on what’s left of the playoffs, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025.

<h2 id="h-budapest-major-playoffs-are-electrifying">Budapest Major Playoffs Are Electrifying</h2>



<p>FURIA arrived in top form, but Natus Vincere managed to stay resilient, dismantling the top-tier pick in a three-map thriller. It was the only series thus far in the playoffs bracket to go beyond a two-map sweep, with FURIA at least doing <strong>something </strong>to try and stay in the running.</p>



<p>The fixture gave way to some stunning moments, such as a scenario that unfolded to allow w0nderful to secure a massive quad-kill accolade.</p>



<p>In the MOUZ vs. FaZe Clan space, a two-point sweep that wasn’t even close was all that was needed to eliminate MOUZ from the tournament. The second map, Inferno, was a whitewash, with FaZe producing a staggering 13-2 scoreline and drowning MOUZ out in a short series.</p>



<p>In the post-match coverage, FaZe Clan’s broky was praised for putting up some big numbers.</p>



<p>The bracket goes forward with two huge matches airing tomorrow:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit vs. Team Vitality</li>



<li>Natus Vincere vs. FaZe Clan</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steve Jackson Games has announced a revival of their Saturday morning cartoon TTRPG. The aptly named <em>Toon Second Edition</em> brings back an updated version of the 1984 original with some welcome modern touches, courtesy of an upcoming crowdfunding campaign.</p><h2>The <em>Toon Second Edition</em> Announcement</h2><p>According to its <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/a5976d11-0069-4119-acf2-4d16a54cf8db/landing" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Backerkit page</a>, <em>Toon Second Edition</em> is all about bringing the exaggerated, cartooonish, antics of classic <em>Looney Tunes</em> to a tabletop scenario. It's a game that runs on cartoon logic. No one dies, no matter how many times they are flattened by falling pianos and anvils; they're just temporarily taken out.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toon-rpg-classic-book-photo.jpg?itok=CknscOn9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="600" height="787">

  </picture><p>Naturally, the game is easy to learn and perfect for families looking for some old-school cartoon slapstick fun. The original release was notable for its tongue-in-cheek tone, parodying the rules and systems of more "serious" role-playing games on the market, like classic <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. The core design of the game even encouraged players to act with wild abandon, with advice like, "Act Before You Think."</p><p>Essentially, anything you can imagine happening during a <em>Looney Tunes</em> short is possible in Toon. The GM, or Animator, changing the environment to engineer cartoonish comeuppance. Characters breaking the fourth wall for the sake of a gag. All of it is here.</p><p><em>Toon Second Edition</em> will include new quality-of-life improvements. This includes simplified character designs, enabling faster play, over a dozen customizable cartoon adventures, and improved Silly Tables. For fans of the original, this new rulebook will feature full-color artwork by the original artist, Kyle Miller.</p><p><em>Toon Second Edition</em> is designed by Greg Costikyan (<em>Pax Britannica</em>), developed by Warren Spector (<em>Bullwinkle and Rocky Roleplaying Game</em>, <em>The Thing in the Darkness</em>), and revised by Steve Jackson (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/munchkin-big-box-brings-definitive-game-to-backerkit" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Munchkin</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fighting-fantasy-set-2-kickstarter-is-crowdfunding-critical-success" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Fighting Fantasy</em></a>).</p><p>The Backerkit campaign for <em>Toon Second Edition</em> will go live on December 17, 2025. The campaign will provide PDFs, softcover, and hardcover book options.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything We Know About Divinity, Larian’s Most Ambitious RPG Yet]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/divinity-larian-trailer-turn-based-rpg-release-date-2000653105</link>
            <guid>1382284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714"><em>Divinity</em></a> was one of the biggest reveals at <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">the Game Awards 2025</a>. Hell, there was an entire demonic statue sitting in the desert for over a week to get people hyped. Actors were paid to sit in the front row of the showcase and get lifted into the air on pulleys to introduce the game’s first trailer. But what is it and why should you care? Here’s the little we know so far about Larian Studios’ next major RPG.</p> <h2><strong>What is&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em>?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>It’s a new game from Larian Studios, most famous for the acclaimed 2023 hit RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;Like that one, <em>Divinity</em> is also an RPG. Unlike that one, <em>Divinity</em> takes place in Larian’s own made-up fantasy universe instead of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ Forgotten Realms. Larian’s land of Rivellon is still inhabited by humans, elves, dwarves, and so on, though it has some peoples you won’t find in <em>BG3 </em>too, and it still revolves around magic and demonic forces, but there are seven gods and more religious overtones. It started in 2002 with the studio’s first fantasy RPG, <i>Divine Divinity.&nbsp;</i></p>

 <p>“The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir.” That’s the tagline for the new <em>Divinity</em>, which Larian promises will be its “most ambitious title yet” and even larger than <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. It was <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">revealed at The Game Awards 2025</a> with a <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">massive statue</a> and a gnarly cinematic trailer that suggests the world of <em>Divinity</em> may be on the verge of succumbing to some truly wicked hellspawn.</p>

  <h2><strong>Wait, is this <em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em>?</strong></h2> <p>No, it ain’t. While fans of that turn-based sub-series would love to see Larian go back to that solid foundation, the company’s head of publishing was very clear that this isn’t a direct sequel. “There aren’t currently any plans for a new <em>Divinity Original Sin 3</em> game but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will,” Michael Douse wrote on X <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769">prior to <em>Divinity</em>‘s announcement</a>. But Larian did name-check both<em> Original Sin</em> games in its press release, saying fans of those will have a better understanding of this new game’s world.</p>

 <p>Here’s how director Swen Vincke put it in the announcement: “Despite our long history with the series, this is our first game entitled ‘Divinity.’ We’re ready to bring everything we’ve done previously into one place. This marks the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before. We’ve been building toward this moment ever since we took our fate into our own hands. This is the <em>Divinity</em> we’ve always wanted to make and you’re going to have loads of fun with it.”</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Divinity</em> be turn-based?</h2> <p>That’s one of the great debates raging among fans as <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1999108111789851024"><em>alleged</em> rumors</a> circulate that Divinity&nbsp;<em>might</em> not be turn-based. That would be a big departure from Larian’s last decade of projects which have all been that way. Back in the beginning, however, the <em>Divinity</em> franchise was a real-time action series that played like <em>Diablo</em>. It’s not hard to see Larian going back to that, especially if <em>Divinity</em> is operating on a grander scale than past projects. Maybe it’ll be third-person action more in the vein of modern <em>Dragon Age</em>? Still, the studio has a history of sticking to what works and iterating from there. If I had to bet money, I’d say it’s probably still turn-based.</p>

 <h2>Is that old guy getting <em>Wicker Man’</em>d in the trailer important?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653115"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653115">Larian Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>Probably! Fans on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/1pkhj33/they_commited_the_original_sin/">Divinity subreddit</a> have been debating who it might be. One theory is that it’s a character called <a href="https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Lucian">Lucian</a> who’s the canonical hero for the original <em>Divine Divinity</em>, eventually getting godly powers and being worshiped. He also adopts a child named <a href="https://divinity.fandom.com/wiki/Damian">Damian</a> who ends up being a vessel for demonic entities. Here’s one fan’s theory:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“The implication of this trailer seems to be that the people of Rivellon stopped worshipping the dead gods and committed, besides the seven deadly sins, the Original Sin of killing the powerless Lucian, which causes the Hellstone to spawn, as the last remnants of the gods and Source were destroyed that way.”</p></blockquote> <p>Much of this interpretation depends on where in the existing timeline the new <em>Divinity</em> takes place. Is it after <em>Original Sin 2</em> or a prequel to the entire franchise? Or maybe somewhere in the middle? Whoever is being tortured in the game’s first trailer, it seems clear that all is not well in Rivellon and the demons are coming to take over.</p> <h2>When is <em>Divinity</em> coming out?</h2> <p>There’s no release date yet. Not even a release window or a whisper of one. <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> was made in three years. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> took six. A lot will depend on whether this is the only game Larian has in production or it’s working on something else alongside it. Either way, we probably won’t see it out in the wild until 2027 or beyond.</p> <h2>What platforms will <em>Divinity</em> launch on?</h2> <p>PC seems like a safe bet. Maybe even an Early Access launch like Larian did with <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. It could be far enough away to be a cross-gen console release on both PlayStation 5 and PS6. Same for Xbox. Hopefully it runs well on PC handhelds and Valve’s Steam Machine. Maybe it’ll even come to Switch 2? Larian’s only other game to launch on a Nintendo platform was <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>.</p>

            <guid>1382281</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a> has officially been named Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2025, alongside multiple other wins. If that winning sweep has you jumping in for the first time (or returning for another playthrough), IGN has you covered with guides, explainers, and wikis to help you get started for your journey across The Continent.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33? Should You Play It?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG (it's kind of like Final Fantasy VII... <em>kind of</em>) set in the world of The Continent. It follows a group called Expedition 33 on a mission to destroy The Paintress, a mysterious figure who wipes out anyone over a certain age in a yearly ceremony called the "Gommage." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside extremely unique turn-based combat, which emphasizes various skills and parries to deal damage to bosses with "tells" and plenty of secret weak points, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Characters"><strong>you and your party</strong></a> explore various different areas, encountering enemies, finding treasure, and discovering what happened to other Expeditions that ventured out to beat the Paintress - and failed - before. You also can also build your team to deal ridiculous combo-based damage, something that hardcore players have come to love about Expedition 33. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're an RPG fan but don't have time to sink 100+ hours into them, Expedition 33 may be <em>perfect</em> for you. If you solely focus on the main story, you can expect to roll credits in around 28 hours. With side quests, this increases to 45 hours. If you're set on completing <em>everything</em>, it'll take roughly 65 hours. And if you want to beat a bunch of optional bosses with crazy builds, you can do that, too. Oh and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">we gave Expedition 33 a great score in our review </a>if you want a more in-depth take!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/23/doesnt-tell-you-site-1745450875713.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">How Combat Works in Expedition 33</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned previously, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 features turn-based combat, which means that everyone in battle, including enemies, attacks one at a time, rather than everyone at once - think classic Final Fantasy, Persona, or Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't just wait for enemy attacks to hit you, though. Here, one of the main selling points is the ability to parry, dodge, and jump to avoid and counter attacks. When an opponent uses a move, you're able to press a button that, when timed right, either dodges, jumps, or parries to avoid damage completely or deal damage back to them. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/expedition-33-combar-1765568222438.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to your own skills, these are powered by Pictos and Luminas. Pictos are special pieces of equipment that you equip to characters to grant special benefits and increase stats.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is a lengthy coda to the base game, riffing on every narrative and mechanical overhaul Game Freak brought to Lumiose City. It is essentially the postgame that </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> lacked when it launched in October, and while your mileage may vary on whether or not you want to spend an extra $30 to play it, what’s here is a compelling spin on everything that made the game one of </span><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> most compelling experiments.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is set after the events of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, so you’ll have to see the credits (the real ones, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>not the fake ones</span></a><span>) to dive in. A young girl named Ansha shows up in Lumiose City to ask for Team MZ’s help. She’s in search of a powerful legendary Pokémon to give to her mother as a present. Because we’re heroes who never turn away a person in need, we agree to help her find this mystery beast, but before we can really start looking, the city is overtaken by mysterious portals that lead to a bizarro version of Lumiose called Hyperspace. In this mirrored universe, we find Pokémon that aren’t native to the city and are more powerful than they’re supposed to be.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The only way we can face these powerful foes and investigate this odd phenomenon is by Ansha feeding her partner Pokémon Hoopa berry-filled Donuts that allow it to power up our Pokémon as we head into Hyperspace on short expeditions. All of this paves the way for an interesting, albeit slightly underbaked (ironic, considering the whole Donut gimmick) roguelike mode that puts all your battle knowledge to the test.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653108"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653108">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>doesn’t quite introduce a complete mechanical overhaul of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s real-time battle system, but it is far more demanding. Each time you head into Hyperspace, you’re on a timer whose length is determined by the quality of the Donut you make for Hoopa, which also increases your stats and raises your level beyond the typical cap of 100. You only have so much time to complete a few missions to gather intel points, and learning how best to make the most of your limited time can be the difference between a lucrative run or a wasted one.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>These trips into this mirrored version of Lumiose can last anywhere from a few minutes to almost 10, depending on the recipe Ansha cooks up, all determined by the Berries you bring her. Once you’re in Hyperspace, you’ve gotta make quick choices about what enemies you fight, which objectives you focus on, and the Pokémon you bring and use with you. Even your most powerful monster might waste some of your time because its moves take too long to charge up, and the clock won’t stop ticking as long as the game is unpaused.</span></p>

 <p><span>Getting a hang of the whole system can take some time, especially when the early expeditions you take into Hyperspace give you just a scant few minutes to acclimate yourself to the ways in which you must change how you carry yourself in this hostile new environment. By the time I was making Donuts that gave me more minutes on the clock, I had a strategy in place that I would adapt on the fly. I’d lead with a Pokémon equipped to handle a rift’s assigned element, barrel through the mini-quests I was assigned for that route, then head to high ground to find the Bonus Ball treasure chest that would spawn after I’d completed my tasks. I’d use my Salamence to search for this item, because his flight ability meant he could get to this golden ball from just about anywhere, helping me snag it within whatever precious seconds I had left in a run.</span></p>

 <p><span>These trips into Hyperspace made me more aware of some of the weaknesses of my party’s composition. I didn’t trade out Pokémon, but as the time limit ticked down in these sections, I became more aware of how slow my Houndoom’s Dark Pulse charge-up was and the time I could save by swapping it out for a faster Crunch attack. My Raichu is spec’d as a physical attacker, but only one of those attacks can reach targets in the air. By the time I was really trying to min-max every Hyperspace run, I had changed several of my go-to movesets just to accommodate the ever-present threat of being yanked out of Hyperspace. Fast attacks that could reach targets above eye level were more important than heavy-hitting ones that would take precious seconds to cast.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653109"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653109">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s roguelike elements are a bit shallow, with your success mostly determined by how far past the level cap you are when you enter Hyperspace, the time limit and focus on verticality do require you to rethink what efficiency looks like in a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game, and ideally, you think of those things before you head into the imaginary city with level 140 monsters.</span></p> <p><span>The trouble I expect some folks to have with the roguelike half of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is that it is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-hyperspace-donuts-tips-2000652670"><span>huge grind</span></a><span>. I hit the credits at about a dozen hours, and large chunks of that time were spent going in and out of Hyperspace to gather intel for folks back home to research the cause of this phenomenon before it engulfed the entire real city. I don’t mind it personally, as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s battle system has always felt more like a puzzle game to me than a grindy RPG. I like seeing a Pokémon in the distance, choosing who in my party can most likely take it out the fastest, and seeing if I can pull it off. The grind started to hit me hardest in the endgame as I tried to capture some of the major Legendary monsters in the DLC, and even as I chip away at some of the post-game stuff, I’m still feeling that. But I still enjoy </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s battle system enough that the grind’s not a detriment for me.</span></p> <p><span>If all </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>had to offer were the roguelike elements, however, I wouldn’t be that hot on it. Thankfully, there’s also a bevy of new quests full of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-npc-dialogue-funny-moments-lines-2000638295"><span>funny citizens saying silly things</span></a><span>, stories to hear, and monsters to catch. Over 100 returning Pokémon from regions far beyond Kalos appear in Hyperspace, and that includes a ton of new Mega Evolutions as well. As anyone who has paid attention to me yelling about it on </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>for months will know, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>added two Mega Evolutions to my favorite guy, Raichu. I was a mark ready to slap down $30 to finally see my boy get some love, and the X form’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Superman-like fighting style</span></a><span> makes him one of my favorite Mega Evolutions Game Freak has ever put out. But Raichu is just one of several Megas added in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, and there are some inspired choices. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s base-game Megas skewed a bit too silly for some folks’ liking, and </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>definitely tips the scales in the opposite direction with a ton of “cooler” designs. I won’t spoil some of the monsters Game Freak decided to give a new form to, but suffice it to say that I was really eager to see each new form when I finally came to face them.</span></p>

 <p><span>A lot of those Megas are especially memorable because </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>brings back the best part of the base game with Rogue Mega Evolution battles. These lengthy boss fights against rabid Mega Evolutions are still some of the most entertaining skill checks in probably any </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game, and they’re made all the more challenging because they take place in Hyperspace, thus having a time limit and broken level cap to deal with. These frantic fights are tough, require coordination between your player character and Pokémon, and still find ways to surprise me in how the different Rogue Megas behave.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000653107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653107"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653107">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One of the best things </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>adds is the ability to replay these fights, which wasn’t available in the base game. I’ve had a lot of fun going back to some of those fights with Mega Raichu in my party, so he can actually take them on. One of my biggest problems with </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was that its focus on Mega Evolution made its party compositions feel more limited, as it was much more difficult to handle some of these fights without Mega-Evolution-capable critters on your team. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>doesn’t change that, but at least it gives me a chance to play through these fights again with my favorite guy.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of this is tied up in a story that ties together multiple sides of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. Each of this series’ generations has been set in a different region, and as such, they can feel a bit disconnected from one another. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>makes a point to spotlight multiple sides of its mythology, so it surprisingly feels like a sequel to games you might not expect. Fans of </span><i><span>Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>’s Hoenn region will probably get a kick out of how much it factors into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, but there’s something here for fans of </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>’s Sinnoh legends, as well.</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Raichu flies around like he’s Superman, and if you don’t think that’s the tightest shit you’ve ever seen, I don’t know how to help you.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Game Freak</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Post-game expansion for Legends: Z-A with more monsters, Megas, and challenges</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Roguelike mode is a new challenge, interesting use of the series’ mythology, Mega Raichu.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>It’s a grind, roguelike elements could be a bit meatier.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Switch, Switch 2 (played on)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>December 10, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>~12 hours to credits, still chipping away at post game stuff.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>As much as I loved everything </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>gave me, I understand the $30 price tag is a big ask for folks. I try not to weigh in on the price of things in reviews because I don’t know every reader’s financial situation, and it feels disingenuous of me to try to make some sort of judgment call about whether or not something is “worth” a certain amount of money. Mega Raichu sold me on the expansion before I’d even played it, but looking at the DLC in the context of </span><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> long history, it does feel a little bit icky. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s post-game was practically non-existent, and </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>makes the post-game one of the most robust in the series, but it’s on top of an already pricey game in a world where video game prices are only getting more expensive.</span></p> <p><span>I can’t make the call for you on whether it’s “worth” the price, but I can tell you that I got a whole lot more of a game I loved and that spoke to the things I enjoy most about this series. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s greatest strengths are in its experimental battle system and its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>city-centric storytelling</span></a><span> that makes the most of its merry band of misfits. I got that in spades here, and I got to see it with a Mega Evolution of my favorite Pokémon by my side.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you didn’t already&nbsp; love </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, I would be surprised if anything here changed your mind. I’m having a great time, though. Raichu and I aren’t done scavenging every inch of Hyperspace for the Pokémon we haven’t met yet, and if this is the end of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s story, it’s still going to be one of my favorite games in the series. </span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Holy crap, <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">the Game Awards 2025</a> started off with a huge surprise: <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-rpr-kotor-fate-of-the-republic-2000652729">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>!</em> A spiritual successor to <em>KOTOR</em> from Casey Hudson and set in the Expanded Universe! Wowza, that’s exciting stuff. Here’s everything we know right now about this upcoming <em>Star Wars</em> game.</p> <h2><strong>What is <em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em>?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><em>Fate of the Old Republic,</em> or as all the cool kids call it, “<em>FOTOR</em>,” is a newly announced single-player<em> Star Wars</em> action RPG that is set in the same era as the beloved <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> games, the less-loved-but-still-good MMO spin-off, and all the various tie-in media. It was revealed during the Game Awards 2025. Here’s the awesome trailer:</p>

  <h2><strong>OMG! Is this <em>Knights of the Old Republic 3</em>?</strong></h2> <p>Nope! But <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer">Lucasfilm, Casey Hudson, and Arcanaut Studios have referred to <em>FOTOR</em> as a “spiritual successor”</a> to those games that take place in the same era of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise. It also isn’t a turn-based RPG, but it will feature many choices, and the people making it have hinted at players being able to play as either good or bad characters, something that was a big part of <em>KOTOR.</em></p>

 <h2><strong>Wait, who is Casey Hudson?</strong></h2> <p>Hudson was the director behind BioWare’s original <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> and would also help create and lead <em>Mass Effect</em> after <em>KOTOR</em>. His return to <em>Star Wars</em> and the<em> Old Republic</em> franchise is a big reason why people are super excited about this game, and also why so many people think it’s <em>KOTOR 3</em>. (It isn’t, as explained above.)</p>

 <h2><strong>When does<em> Fate of the Old Republic</em> take place?</strong></h2> <p>We don’t really know much about <em>FOTOR’s</em> setting and story yet. The trailer shows off some new characters who will likely be involved in the full game, but Hudson and Lucasfilm are being tight-lipped about any specific details. They did, however, confirm that this isn’t a direct sequel to <em>KOTOR </em>or <em>KOTOR 2.</em> Instead, it will feature a new story, new locations, new characters, and so on. But if I were a betting man, I’d wager some credits that elements, characters, and locations from those past games might show up in some form or another in <em>FOTOR.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <h2><strong>Is it canon? Or Legends?</strong></h2> <p>Again, we’ve not been given a clear answer to this question, but I’d be shocked if <em>FOTOR</em> was canon with the films. The<em> <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic#Continuity">Old Republic</a></em> games, books, and comics were all part of the old Expanded Universe, which was made non-canon after Disney bought<em> Star Wars</em> over a decade ago. While some elements of the <em>Old Republic</em> universe <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-rogue-one-easter-eggs-lore-luthen-1849774482">have been made canon</a>, like the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rakatan">Rakatan</a> species, the bulk of the <em>Old Republic</em> is no longer canon.</p>

 <p>But who cares?! The<em> Old Republic</em> MMO has been going strong for years now, telling new Legends stories. I think it’s great, actually, that Lucasfilm seems willing to let more projects be made that aren’t canon, but instead are part of the old EU. That’s a win for everyone in my book. And it lets <em>FOTOR</em> do its own thing without having to twist itself in narrative knots and retcons in order to fit in the canon timeline.</p>

 <h2>Who is making <em>FOTOR</em>?</h2> <p>As mentioned, Casey Hudson is directing, and <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> is being developed by Arcanaut Studios, a new company founded by Hudson earlier this year. That actually leads us perfectly into the next question…</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, a single player narrative-driven action RPG and spiritual successor to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.</p> <p>Working on KOTOR was a defining experience of my career. This is a dream come true for me and our team of incredible… <a href="https://t.co/unx3HvoyUG">pic.twitter.com/unx3HvoyUG</a></p> <p>— Casey Hudson (@CaseyDHudson) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999287887053955250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>When is it coming out?</h2> <p>Oh boy, I’ve got bad news for you: Probably not anytime soon. Remember, Arcanaut Studios was just created earlier this year. That means this game is likely still in pre-production or has just entered development. We are very, <em>very</em> early in the process here, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o">as pointed out by <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Jason Schreier</a>, <em>FOTOR</em> is almost certainly not a PS5 game and might not be released until 2030.</p> <p>AAA games take a long time to make, and the time to create them is getting longer as games get more complicated and visually impressive. This is also a new studio that is still figuring out its culture, its tools, and learning how to work together. So yeah, the earliest I’d expect <em>Fate of the Republic</em> to launch is late 2028, and that is being extremely hopeful and would likely involve a ton of crunch and support studios. The more reasonable option is 2030 or later. Which, yeah, could mean <em>FOTOR</em> is a late PlayStation 6 game and/or an early PlayStation 7 launch.</p> <h2>What platforms is <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> launching on?</h2> <p>PC almost for sure. Beyond that, no idea. Nothing confirmed, and based on how many years away it will be, likely not PS5, Xbox Series X/S, or Switch 2.</p> <h2>Will I get to use a lightsaber?</h2> <p>Yeah. The trailer basically confirmed that. You need to pay attention more.</p>

                <p>If you want to get your hands on nearly a dozen free Switch games this holiday season, now's your chance. Starting today, No Gravity Games is giving away one Switch title per day through December 19, on which day there will be three free games. However, there is a catch that works out in your favor.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mYUk82gN6g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5mYUk82gN6g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To claim a free game on Switch, players need to have claimed the previous day's title and maintained it in their library. You must also have at least one No Gravity title prior to claiming the first freebie, but there's a trick you can use to get that for free, too. Just <a href="https://nogravitygames.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visit No Gravity Games' official site</a> and sign up for the newsletter, and you'll receive a free game. If you do this first, it will count as a "purchased" game from No Gravity and you're able to then claim the other games for free.</p><p>If players do miss a day, they can rejoin the giveaway chain by purchasing the previous day's game, which will be available at a greatly reduced price. Each title becomes available for free at midnight PT and they will be available to claim on Nintendo's eShop until 11:59pm PT on the same day.</p><p>While most of the free games are currently unrevealed, the first one is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bullets-and-brains/" data-ref-id="5000-596624">Bullets &amp; Brains</a>, a top-down arcade-style 3D shooter that pits players against an endless army of the living dead. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wreckin-ball-adventure/" data-ref-id="5000-489454">Wreckin' Ball Adventure</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/creepy-tale/" data-ref-id="5000-507071">Creepy Tale</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alders-blood/" data-ref-id="5000-479584">Alder's Blood</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destropolis/" data-ref-id="5000-512315">Destropolis</a> are all glimpsed in the Switchmas Giveaway trailer above, but not yet confirmed as titles for this year's giveaway.</p>

              <p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> will star in Microsoft’s first gaming showcase of 2026. Rockstar is still claiming fired employees were leaking game secrets. And the anime studio behind <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> is officially no more. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture, which is even later than usual today because we’re all hung over from The Game Awards.</p> <p>I apologize. It was a late one. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> went home with almost everything. <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> went home with literally nothing. But who’s really keeping track? <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-3%C2%BD-hours-long-17-minutes-of-actual-awards.1381588/">Only 10 percent of the show</a> actually involved people winning awards and making speeches. But some players are still crashing out over <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pkhe5x/my_reaction_to_players_voice_i_find_it_funny/">a gacha game winning multiple trophies</a>, including “Player’s Voice.” At least they didn’t get murdered by the <em>Okami</em> social media account. Did Hideki Kamiya forget he was still logged in? Unfortunately for the person involved, it sounds like it was <a href="https://x.com/TheIshikawaRin/status/1999433036941918307">one big misunderstanding</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">is this more to your liking <a href="https://t.co/iCrcxbvqqc">pic.twitter.com/iCrcxbvqqc</a></p> <p>— Okami (@OkamiOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/OkamiOfficial/status/1999217730478907748?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Microsoft will hold its first Xbox showcase of 2026 in January</h2> <p>The company has a big raft of games due out next year and will kick things off next month with its first Developer Direct of 2026. It’ll include <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>. “I will tell you that Playground Games is going to be in the Dev Direct,” President of Microsoft gaming content Matt Booty <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/">told <em>Variety</em></a>. “But we’ll have more stuff next year to ship than we can fit into one Dev Direct show in January, which is a good place to be.” <em>Fable</em>, <em>Gears: E-Day</em>, <em>Halo Remastered</em>, and more are expected to launch during the 25th anniversary of Xbox.</p>

 <h2>Microsoft admits annualizing <em>Call of Duty</em> is “difficult”</h2> <p><em>Black Ops 7</em> has performed poorly enough that Activision hasn’t released any sales metrics and has promised never to release back-to-back franchise sequels again. But Matt Booty isn’t worried.</p> <p>“Shipping a major franchise like clockwork every year is a really difficult task, and I’m really proud of what the team did to move the franchise forward in that way,” he told <em>Variety</em>. “And the interesting thing about <em>Call of Duty</em> is, I think that as an IP, it is really well positioned to continue to deliver content for players going forward; the system of seasons. And it’s not just about the launch, but it’s kind of in its own unique category and ability in terms of how the team keeps delivering content throughout the year. So we’re real happy with where we’ve landed with that.”</p>

Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading,” the studio wrote <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">in a new statement to <em>IGN</em></a>.</p> <div> <p dir="ltr">The union representing the fired developers still claims this isn’t true. “Rockstar’s latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation-they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals,” the IWGB responded in a new statement of its own. “Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterize workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as ‘leaking information.'”</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Anime powerhouse Gainax officially shut down this week</h2> <p dir="ltr"><em>Evangelion</em> creator Hideaki Anno shared his thoughts about the studio’s troubled collapse. “As someone who has been with the company for over 20 years since its founding and has been involved as a shareholder until today, this is a truly disappointing end, but I am accepting it with a sense of urgency,” he <a href="https://www.khara.co.jp/2025/12/11/251211/">wrote</a>. The animation veteran described his view of the company’s demise which included a legal fight with its management, some of whom were once his close friends.</p> <p dir="ltr">Anno continued, “Specifically, upon learning about the various false statements made by former Fukushima Gainax representative Yoshinobu Asao, Hiroyuki Yamaga, and Yasuhiro Takeda, whom I considered friends since college, toward my company and myself, including instructions from then-President Yamaga [who was <a href="https://kotaku.com/gainax-president-arrested-after-taking-nude-photos-of-t-1840227841">arrested in 2019</a>] to Gainax employees to pretend he was hospitalized, statements that viewed our company as hostile, and schemes to unfairly avoid repayment, I have gone beyond anger to sadness.”</p> <div dir="ltr"> <h2>Xbox exclusive<em> South of Midnight</em> moves to Switch 2 and PS5 in the spring</h2> <p>That’s roughly a year <a href="https://x.com/CompulsionGames/status/1999265189204754913">after it launched</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you, like me, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">still have visions of last night's grotesque trailer for a new Divinity game</a> from Larian Studios burned into your head, then you'll be delighted to know there's already a whirl of fan theories as to what it all meant. Specifically, some fans think they've worked out who the man burned alive inside the wicker man is, or at least, who he's supposed to represent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm going to <strong>get into some spoilers for basically all the other Divinity games here</strong>, so if you intend to play through some of those in advance, read on at your own risk.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, there are a few possibilities being floated for who that guy in the fire is. The first, and most probably, is Lucian, the human player character of Divine Divinity and a recurring figure throughout the Divinity games. There's a <em>ton</em> of history behind Lucian, but what you probably need to know is that he was at one point worshipped as the "Divine", chosen by the Seven gods of Rivellon. He stands in opposition to a force known as Chaos, the source of Rivellon's demons which seeks to invade and consume Rivellon, but he also at one point adopted a baby named Damian who was known to serve as a vessel for the Lord of Chaos, which goes about as well as you can imagine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lucian is also the founder of The Divine Order. If you've played Original Sin 2, you'll remember those guys as the folks rounding up Source users, but also will recall that at the time of the game, Lucian had already passed away...or so everyone thought. The end of the game has you discover him hiding in his tomb, having faked his death and is quietly working to purge the Source from Rivellon entirely. Depending on your actions when you meet him, Lucian might end up dead, or alive and still Divine. Sort of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads to the theories that the guy in the fire is Lucian. In the ending of Original Sin 2 where you allow all the world's Source to be purged, Lucian is reinstalled as Divine ruler. However, unbeknownst to most, he doesn't possess Divine powers anymore. He's just a dude. One theory being floated is that somehow the people of Rivellon have figured out that Lucian is powerless and the gods are dead (you actually kill all seven of the world's gods in Original Sin 2) or otherwise gone. Lucian's committed a lot of pretty atrocious crimes over the years against a lot of people in the name of the greater good, so it's not shocking that folks would be pissed and turn on him as soon as it was clear he had no real power. But even just beyond the lore, look: the guy looks like Lucian!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/lucian-the-divine-1765559833901.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lucian in Divinity 2: Dragon Knight Saga.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/lucian-statue-1765559833901.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A statue of Lucian from Divinity: Original Sin 2.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He's the right age, he's got the beard and the bushy eyebrows. He's wearing a crown, suggesting royalty. And most importantly, check out the star-shaped scar on his chest. As pointed out in the Reddit post above, it matches the star on the end of Lucian's staff pretty well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it's not totally certain that this is Lucian. Some other possibilities floated are that this isn't Lucian himself, but an annual ritual where some other guy is tortured and killed as a stand-in for Lucian, who would already be long-dead at the time this is happening. There are other suggestions that this isn't Lucian, but Damian, the kid Lucian adopted. Damian is a vessel for Chaos, so him being executed for that reason and Chaos bursting out of him when he dies would make a lot of sense. And both the Lucian and the Damien theories work with the game's promo text shared yesterday: "The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then we've got folks elsewhere pointing out that the presence of a Blood Rose suggests ties to the former tyrannical Source King, Braccus Rex, who's also theoretically dead by this point but has come back from the dead twice now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that's all assuming this game takes place after all the other Divinity games. There are plenty of folks suggesting it takes place somewhere in the middle of the timeline, or even as a precursor (given its name), and others reminding us that Larian's Divinity lore hasn't always been consistent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a lot to unpack here and it's going to take some serious Divinity lore nerds to understand it all. Or, Larian might just tell us in a few months. Maybe they'll make it easy. If you still want to unpack it a little further, we have an explainer on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-divinity-larian-studios-baldurs-gate-3">what exactly we do know about this new Divinity game so far</a>, especially in relation to the kinds of games Larian Studios has made up til now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
