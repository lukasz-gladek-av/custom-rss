			<p>The Fall season is mere days away, which means GTA VI should launch around a year from now. Last we heard from Take-Two, Rockstar's highly anticipated game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated</a> to launch in Fall 2025, contributing to what could be a stellar year for the publisher:</p>
<p><em>Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of Calendar 2025 to Fall of Calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI. We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. Looking ahead, we believe that our Company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>GTA VI is, of course, the star of an amazing Take-Two lineup for 2025 that also includes the next mainline entries in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilization</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mafia</a> franchises, not to mention <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands 4</a> and possibly even <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judas</a>, the long-awaited new game from Ken Levine. In this article, though, we'll focus on why GTA VI is going to be absolutely critical not only for Rockstar and Take-Two but also for Sony, specifically with regard to the upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro console.</p>
<p>The anticipation for the next mainline installment in the Grand Theft Auto series can hardly be overstated. The previous entry, Grand Theft Auto V, can be considered the best-selling game of all time, with over 200 million units sold. Sure, technically Minecraft has sold even more, but there are numerous caveats: it launched two years before GTA V; it is cheaper; it is available on way more platforms, and it also targets a much broader audience that includes kids.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games has rightfully earned itself a massive fanbase thanks to masterpieces like GTA and Red Dead Redemption, and it's been a long time since we got a game of theirs. GTA V originally launched in September 2013, and Red Dead Redemption 2 was released in October 2018. It was, therefore, not very surprising to see the first GTA VI trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shattering YouTube records in terms of views</a>.</p>
<p>If we take a moment to dive into why Rockstar's titles are so popular, a big reason is that they move the needle forward when it comes to the open world genre. They've done that ever since Grand Theft Auto 3, which showed the way to the whole industry on what was possible with PlayStation 2 hardware, and the latest games are no different. Red Dead Redemption 2 itself is still unmatched in some areas, even when compared to more recent open world titles.</p>
<p>However, there's a flip side. Rockstar's games have historically struggled on the performance side precisely because the developer always attempts to cram as many technological advancements as possible onto the available hardware. Grand Theft Auto VI is unlikely to be different in this area.</p>
<p>As such, gamers will need the most powerful hardware to get the optimal experience when it comes to smoothness and definition. With Red Dead Redemption 2, the Xbox One X <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-xbox-one-x-best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered that</a> with a clear advantage in both rendering resolution and frame rate stability over the less powerful PS4 Pro. However, this time, Microsoft doesn't seem interested in delivering a mid-generation console refresh, betting everything on the next generation instead (which they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim</a> will offer&nbsp;the biggest performance leap ever).</p>
<p>With the PC version of GTA VI unlikely to materialize until at least a year and a half from the console debut, the best way to experience the story of Lucia and her partner will be on PlayStation 5 Pro. Even if it turns out to be true that Sony's $700 console <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannot deliver 60 frames per second</a>, it will most likely offer a performance mode of around 40-45 FPS that takes advantage of variable refresh rate technology (VRR) to offer a far smoother experience than 30 FPS.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro remains a niche console with its high pricing, but that niche will still spend what Sony is asking to get the best experience possible for the top games—starting with GTA VI. Sony is well aware of this and will likely push to make a Grand Theft Auto VI PS5 Pro bundle when the game finally launches next Fall.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/flappy-bird-crypto-scam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The mobile game community was abuzz earlier this week following reports from CNET that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/flappy-bird-returning-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flappy Bird is set to return after a decade-long hiatus</a>. However, fans of the original game were quick to point out that it wasn’t all that it seemed, with some suggesting that the game is a crypto scam.</p>



<p>Just a few days after the news surfaced, Dong Nguyen, the original creator of Flappy Bird, has spoken out on Twitter. <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nguyen said</a>, “No, I have no related with their game. I did not sell anything. I also don’t support crypto.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Dong%20Nguyen%20Ha%20%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">court documents</a>, Gametech Holdings LLC seized Nguyen’s trademark of Flappy Bird due to inactivity. This means that Gametech Holdings LLC can now essentially do what it pleases with the game. As for the game being a crypto scam, it’s been discovered that hidden pages on the Flappy Bird website suggest that there will be crypto involved when the game relaunches. </p>



<p>“The original Flappy Bird is back and will fly higher than ever on Solana as it soars into web 3.0,” and continues to say, “build, create, play, and stake to own.”</p>



<p>The now-new owners of Flappy Bird are yet to comment on any of the accusations officially, but following the announcement of the game’s return, a representative said, “We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come. We have big plans for our little Bird!”</p>



<p>What do you think of Flappy Bird potentially returning as a crypto scam? Let us know in the comments below or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-analysis-improvements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is going to bring visual and performance improvements to games even without patching, although some games will benefit more than others from the console's improved specs.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their Weekly podcast, which is currently only available to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> supporters, the tech experts at Digital Foundry analyzed a high-quality version of the console's announcement video, revealing some interesting details on each of the shown games, as reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/JMaine518" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@JMaine518</a>. First-party games such as The Last of Us Part 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart see increased image quality and more stable performance thanks to the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution scaler. Another first part game, Horizon Forbidden West, runs with higher detail, but the resolution didn't look 4K, so it was probably not using PSSR. Speaking about Gran Turismo 7, Digital Foundry revealed how the game runs at a lower resolution (1188p) than on the base model, upscaled to 4K with PSSR on PS5 Pro and at native 4K without ray tracing.</p>
<p>When it comes to third-party games running on PlayStation 5 Pro, it seems like the console's increased power isn't enough to address the low base resolution some of these games run at. Alan Wake 2, for example, at the two shown modes, targeting 60 and 30 FPS respectively, runs at the same resolutions it does on the base model, 846p and 1260p, although PSSR is presumably used in place of AMD FSR 2. The 30 FPS mode could also feature ray tracing, while the 60 FPS mode features screen-space reflections.</p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy is a step up over the base model, featuring ray-traced reflections and possibly even ray-traced shadows mixed with screen-space reflections. Interestingly, one game that could see a massive performance improvement on PlayStation 5 Pro is Dragon's Dogma 2, which looked to be running at 60 FPS, possibly with PSSR. Assassin's Creed Shadows also seemed to run at 60 FPS but at a low 846p resolution, presumably upscaled to a higher resolution using PSSR.</p>

<p>The Last of Part 2 - 1440p internal resolution at 60fps in this PS5 Pro Mode (same as PS5 Performance Mode) with improved image quality due to PSSR</p>

<p>Judging from this early analysis, it really seems like the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler will be the true <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing-pssr-game-changer/">game changer</a>&nbsp;Digital Foundry thinks it will be. The other two pillars of the PlayStation 5 Pro, while important, look like they won't be as impactful as the AI-driven upscaler.</p>

But while the group has been framing it as the triumphant return of a classic mobile game, <em>Flappy Bird’</em>s original developer, Dong Nguyen isn’t calling it a comeback — in fact, he says he’s not involved at all.</p><p>Nguyen posted as much on X (for the first time since 2017!) this morning, saying he didn’t “sell anything.” The Flappy Bird Foundation wrote in the announcement it shared with press last week that it had “acquired the rights from Gametech Holdings, LLC,” which had secured the trademark from Nguyen, but it doesn’t appear as though that was the result of any dealings between him and the group.</p><p>Gametech <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91287432&amp;pty=OPP">filed in opposition</a> of Nguyen’s <em>Flappy Bird</em> trademark in 2023, <a href="https://x.com/SamNChiet/status/1834246569857634352">spotted X user Samperson</a>. The filing came nearly a decade after Nguyen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5400488/flappy-bird-pulled-because-it-became-addictive">pulled the then-popular game</a> and never released another version, and the US Patent and Trademark Office determined his trademark to be abandoned, terminating his claim to it in January. </p><p>The Flappy Bird Foundation didn’t say in its announcement that Nguyen was involved, but it certainly leans on nostalgia as it promotes the game. More than half of the game’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXn6Yd-j8DeE">first trailer</a> lingers on the game’s rise in popularity and the disappointment of its abrupt disappearance in 2013, before declaring that “In 2024, Flappy Bird will fly again.”</p><p>As for the crypto piece of this puzzle, cybersecurity researcher <a href="https://varun.ch/flappy-bird">Varun Biniwale pointed out</a> hidden pages from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5400488/flappy-bird-pulled-because-it-became-addictive"><em>Flappy Bird</em> website</a> that indicate there may be such a component in the game’s launch. One page that seems to have been removed (and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240912185616/https://flappybird.org/web3-1/">archived here</a>) said <em>Flappy Bird</em> will “fly higher than ever on Solana as it soars into web 3.0,” and invited players to “build, create, play and stake to own.”</p><p>For now, <em>Flappy Bird</em> is listed as coming soon for iOS and Android. Just don’t expect it to be the <em>Flappy Bird</em> you knew — that, it seems, remains as gone as ever.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I recognize this isn’t indicative of much beyond my sentimentality, but I thought it was a crucial tidbit to underscore something else, something important about PlayStation’s excellent new platformer. It really <em>is</em>, more than anything else,<em> </em>a celebration of the consoles and games that shaped me, and likely many of you, too. It is so completely possessed with joy and teeming with the life of everything that PlayStation has meant to people over the years. It is also a brilliant platformer in its own right, stuffed full of ideas that make it seem like Asobi Team is just getting started in this utterly endearing franchise. For all its charms and wonders, however, there’s also a slightly melancholy feeling that <em>Astro Bot</em>, which secondarily serves as a kind of museum of PlayStation’s history, is putting that legacy and the spirit of innovation that defined it under glass to be gazed upon and appreciated as a relic of yesterday, rather than to infuse and electrify the games of today and tomorrow. — Moises Taveras</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-recommend-id="image://16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->PlayStation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-recommend-id="image://16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Remember when we all played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/in-the-console-wars-astros-playroom-is-extraordinarily-1845761531&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/in-the-console-wars-astros-playroom-is-extraordinarily-1845761531"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a></span><em>, </em>which came pre-installed on every PlayStation 5<em>,</em> and enjoyed a collective nostalgia trip through Sony’s video game history, coupled with a great deal of hope for the future of our shiny new consoles? The platformer pays tribute to PlayStation’s past with cute little robot cameos representing nearly every video game hero from every era remotely associated with the brand. It was more or less a guided tour through the legacy of one of the big three, and after the PS4 solidified Sony as top dog in the console landscape, I was certainly in the mood to look back at how we got here when the PS5 launched in 2020.

            <p>Just days after we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flappy-bird-makes-a-return-this-year-thanks-to-dedicated-fans">Flappy Bird is set to make a return later this year courtesy of the fan-made Flappy Bird Foundation</a>, the original developer says he has "no relat[ion]" to the game.</p>
<p>In a tweet posted to X/Twitter earlier today (15th September), original developer Doug Nguyen publicly distanced himself from the project and its leader, confirming he has played no role in the game's revival.</p>

<p>It's thought Nguyen is likely referring to the project's leader, Michael Roberts, who is connected to crypto firm 1208 Productions.</p>
<p>"Between generative AI scraping and stuff like this, this really has become the age of petty scumbag art thievery from legitimate creatives in order to generate unearned profit," <a href="https://x.com/TotoMimoTweets/status/1835317728120279521">commented</a> Halfway House's animator, Tommy Millar.</p>
<p>"It's a gross time to be a real artist, but a great time to be morally void human-shaped viruses."</p>
<p>Flappy Bird will return this autumn, followed by dedicated mobile apps coming to iOS and Android next year, as well as other platforms.</p>
<p>Flappy Bird grew to tremendous popularity with over 100 million people playing it, but in 2014, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flappy-bird-dev-is-removing-popular-app-for-some-reason">Nguyen removed the game from sale</a> despite it generating a reported $50,000 a day in advertising revenue.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> has reportedly earned Blizzard around $150 million from in-game microtransactions since it released in June 2023.</p>
<p>That's according to senior product manager, Harrison Froeschke, who stated in a since-nuked <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrison-froeschke/">LinkedIn account</a> that they had led the "monetisation strategy of the store cosmetics, pricing, bundle offers, personalised discounts, and roadmap planning which have driven over $150m [microtransaction] lifetime revenue".</p>

<p>Froeschke's LinkedIn account has now been removed from public view, but not before <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/blizzard-reveals-how-much-money-players-spent-on-microtransaction/z1726b">Game Pressure</a> managed to snap a screenshot purportedly taken from Froeschke's account, which also alleges the product manager has overseen game sales "resulting in over $1bn total lifetime revenue".</p>
<p>The numbers help us contextualise not only Diablo 4's success - Blizzard itself confirmed Diablo 4 had generated <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230612864402/en/Diablo%C2%AE-IV-Crosses-666-Mi%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dn-Five-Days-of-Launch-Setting-New-Blizzard-All-Time-Record">$666m in just five days</a> - but also the commercial impact of making the game available for no additional cost to Xbox Game Pass subscribers.</p>
<p>Back in July, of course, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">sweeping changes to Xbox Game Pass</a> that would see day-one releases being removed as a benefit to subscribers of the service's revised basic tier, including Diablo 4.</p>
<p>That new tier - known as Game Pass Standard - is now live, but it turns out subscribers are missing out on more than just new releases: Microsoft has pulled access to over 40 previously available games, including major titles like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review">Hellblade 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/whats-water-the-forever-winter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following a recent beta, in which a few content creators and players from the game’s Discord were able to test out a recent build of the game, a new mechanic came to light: Water. In the game, water proves vital. It’s a crucial resource you must collect in the wasteland to attract merchants and mercenaries to your base. But there’s cause for concern. Your water depletes. When it does, say goodbye to your progress. Here’s what you should know about water in The Forever Winter!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-water-work-in-the-forever-winter">How Does Water Work in The Forever Winter?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, alongside the loot you’ll find in the world to earn money, <strong>you’ll collect water from the wasteland to help sustain your home. As you bring back water, it collects in a reservoir, attracting merchants and mercenaries.</strong> The former will sell you better equipment, like rigs and weapons. If you choose to play the game solo, the latter will journey into the raid with you, fighting by your side as an AI companion. </p>



<p>But there’s a catch, unfortunately. <strong>Your water depletes over time</strong>. It’s not a problem if you’re actively playing the game, but it also depletes in<strong> real time </strong>when you’re not playing. If you take a break from The Forever Winter to check out another game, you’ll return to find your water completely gone. If your water is gone, then the merchants and mercenaries leave.</p>



<p>But even worse is, <strong>if your water depletes completely, you’ll lose your entire stash</strong>. All of the equipment and items you’ve looted are gone!</p>



<p>According to developer Fun Dog Studios, the goal is for players to “<strong>feel anxiety</strong>,” even when not playing the game.</p>



<p>With all that said, the mechanic is supposedly quite forgiving time-wise. <strong>Your reservoir is said to hold a month’s worth of water</strong>, which you can fill in a few raids. If you hop in on the weekends to play, you should be okay.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-the-devs-change-how-water-works">Will the Devs Change How Water Works?</h2>



<p>As of right now, no, they won’t. When criticized for the mechanic by playtesters and fans in the Discord, they doubled down and confirmed that they might change how much water you loot in-raid, but they won’t change the overall mechanic. It’s a core game component; they want you to play frequently or lose everything. </p>



<p>What do you think of the water mechanic in The Forever Winter? Is it too much, or is the one-month reservoir enough? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official forums</a>!</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s almost time to hop in-game. Here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-you-play-the-forever-winter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when you can play The Forever Winter</a> on PC!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24243908/shogun-showdown-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shogun Showdown</em> sometimes breaks my brain. The new deckbuilding roguelike is all about tactics, and a key part of the game is that you can always see what the enemies plan to do next. Every once in a while, that gets me in a quandary where I know I’ll lose. But when things click into place and I clear everyone out in one fell swoop, I feel like a strategic genius.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the game, which <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2084000%2FShogun_Showdown%2F">just left early access</a>, you’re constantly trying to position your character across a small level to either attack your foes or dodge their moves. As you play, you can upgrade your “tiles” (think: cards) to improve their damage, add perks like freezing ice, or lower their cooldown so that you can use them more frequently. You’re also able to stack up to three tiles so that, with one press of the attack button, you send off a salvo of moves to take out a bunch of bad guys at once.</p><div><figcaption><em>Since you can see everyone’s moves, there’s usually a lot of options to mull through.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Goblinz Publishing</cite></p></div><p>Since you can see what the enemies will do, you’re constantly strategizing about whether to move in to strike or if you need to back off to stay alive. It can get complex, and sometimes it feels like I have to galaxy brain each move to survive difficult rounds. The strategizing is all worth it when you pull off a series of attacks that clear the battlefield.</p><p>Here’s an example of how it comes together. Playing as the starter character, called the Wanderer, I start with a pair of swords that can simultaneously hit the spaces to my left and right as well as an arrow that can fire across the level. With some strategic maneuvering, I can set up the Wanderer so that she strikes a baddie that’s behind her and then shoots an arrow in front of her to eliminate all the dangers on the map.</p><p>During each run, you’ll have opportunities to improve your tiles, pick up new ones, and shop for upgrades. Sure, those are all familiar roguelike trappings, but with a little planning, you can make some extraordinarily powerful tiles. For my first winning run, I upgraded an arrow tile so it had high damage and no cooldown, meaning I was firing off arrows without breaking a sweat.</p><div><figcaption><em>Upgrades galore!</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Goblinz Publishing</cite></p></div><p>As you play, you’ll also collect skulls that can be used to unlock things like new tiles and more things to buy at item shops. Spending those skulls quickly adds variety to each run, and I don’t think I’ve doubled up on a build yet. Once, I went all in on a dragon punch move that sent enemies flying into each other, and while it didn’t get me a win, I loved punching bad guys across levels to open up space.</p><p>I’m still early in the game, and I’ve only unlocked one of four additional characters, so there’s still a lot for me to see. As you clear runs, you can also play through harder “days” with added challenges like tougher enemies or fewer item drops.</p><p>Even though I’m working through bigger games like <em>Astro Bot</em> and a long-in-the-works <em>Mass Effect</em> trilogy playthrough, I keep coming back to <em>Shogun Showdown</em>; it’s just too much fun to experiment with the game’s many weapons and strategies. Maybe it’s time for me to try that dragon punch build again — or stumble into something completely unexpected.</p><p><small>Shogun Showdown<em> is available now on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox</em>.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/following-ps5-pro-pricing-debate-sony-says-pc-setup-can-be-difficult-compared-to-consoles/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ever since Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifted the shroud of secrecy that surrounded the upcoming PS5 Pro console</a>, consumers and analysts alike have been debating the company's pricing choice. The mid-generation console refresh will cost nearly twice as much as the base PS5 in the United States and actually twice as much in Europe. Analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-at-700-is-for-superfans-could-sell-13-15-million-in-total-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe</a> it'll still be able to sell around the same as the PlayStation 4 Pro, which accounted for 20% of the total PS4 sales. Moreover, Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-like-pc-would-cost-a-fair-bit-more-says-df-rtx-4070-is-the-closest-gpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that building a comparable PC would probably cost even more than the $700 Sony is asking.</p>
<p>For its part, Sony pointed to what is, in all likelihood, the key selling point to its userbase: the simplicity of use of the PS5 Pro compared to the PC. Speaking to <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC105XT0Q4A910C2000000/?_gl=1*14lmqbw*_gcl_au*NTk2MjY2NzkwLjE3MjYzODkzODY.*_ga*NDg1OTM4MTczLjE3MjYzODkzODY.*_ga_PXS8451SBG*MTcyNjM4OTM4Ni4xLjEuMTcyNjM4OTY4MC41MC4wLjA." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikkei</a>, Hideaki Nishino (CEO of the Platform Business Group at Sony Interactive Entertainment) said:</p>
<p><em>I think that with mobile devices, there are a lot of games that show ads, and with PCs, the setup can be difficult. With PS, you can immediately enjoy the content you purchased as soon as you turn it on. Even in the stores where you buy software, the products are clearly displayed, making it an intuitive experience.</em></p>
<p>Nishino also confirmed that consoles like the PS5 Pro and the inevitable PlayStation 6 will remain central to the company's gaming business despite the expansion on PC.</p>
<p><em>We are trying to increase the overall game market pie by expanding our content to PCs as well. There is no doubt that our business will be centered on home consoles, but by offering titles for devices other than home consoles, we will reach a wider range of customers.</em></p>
<p>When asked whether the launch of the PS5 Pro would make it more of a challenge to create a successful PlayStation 6 in a few years, Nishino replied:</p>
<p><em>Technology is constantly evolving, so I think there's still more we can do. With the PS5, we've shortened loading times by switching from the hard disk drive (HDD) used in the PS4 era to a solid-state drive (SSD). The sound can now be heard more three-dimensionally through the PS5's controller's speakers, enhancing the sense of immersion. Visual accuracy is important, but we will also be updating other elements.</em></p>
<p>The PS5 Pro will launch globally on November 7. So far, the following games have been confirmed to be optimized for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alan Wake 2</li>
<li>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</li>
<li>Demon's Souls</li>
<li>Dragon's Dogma 2</li>
<li>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</li>
<li>Gran Turismo 7</li>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>
<li>Horizon Forbidden West</li>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li>
<li>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
<li>The First Descendant</li>
<li>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing-capabilities-may-not-be-very-transformative-pssr-has-the-potential-of-being-a-huge-game-changer.981411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing-pssr-game-changer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro comes with improved ray tracing capabilities over the base model, but they may not be very transformative. The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, on the other hand, could be a huge game changer.</p>
<p>The tech experts at Digital Foundry recently commented on the three pillars of the PlayStation 5 Pro in a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">video</a>, highlighting how the system's ray tracing capabilities may not be as transformative as, for example, those introduced by NVIDIA's Turing architecture which powered the RTX 2000 series GPUs. For starters, the technical presentation hosted by Mark Cerny was very vague on the matter and focused on games that already have some sort of ray tracing support, such as Hogwarts Legacy and Gran Turismo 7.</p>
<p>Earlier leaks also indicate smaller additions, and that seems to be what was shown during the technical showcase, although, in Gran Turismo 7's case, the addition of ray tracing during races could be a great showcase of the system's capabilities, as the ray-traced reflections the game already supports are very high-end. Hogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, wasn't a particularly great showcase, as the ray-traced reflections looked grainy, suggesting their low resolution even on PlayStation 5 Pro. The game also ran at 30 frames per second, which is definitely not good, although understandable, given it is an open-world game.</p>
<p>What could be truly game-changing of the three PlayStation 5 Pro pillars is the AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, especially for 4K displays, as similar upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS don't need a very high base resolution to upscale the image to higher resolutions with good image quality. The upscaler could also free some GPU time to allow it to do other things, including better ray tracing. Unfortunately, even PSSR wasn't showcased properly during the technical presentation, according to Digital Foundry, as Sony focused on its first-party titles, which generally sport great image quality even in Performance Mode on the base model. The real test will be with third-party titles, whose image quality is generally not great often due to AMD FSR 2 and Unreal Engine 5 games, which are upscaled from very low resolutions.</p>
<p>Even so, the PlayStation 5 Pro AI-driven upscaler already looks transformative. The upscaler can be retrofitted into existing games without having to upgrade SDK, and it likely requires the same inputs used for implementing AMD FSR 2, so most games should be able to benefit from it with minimal input from developers. With the increased GPU power allowing for games using dynamic resolution scaling to have a better range, which a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-leaked-benchmark-increased-resolution-max-settings/">leaked benchmark</a> also confirmed, the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler could be the system's best feature.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro's 'Big Three' - More GPU Power, AI Upscaling, RT - But Is It Enough?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3aU311e36Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Whether these improvements will entice players owning the base model to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 Pro remains to be seen, considering its steep price. According to analysts, the console should sell <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">as well as the PlayStation 4 Pro</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">did</a> despite its $699.99, €799.99 price</p>

				<main>

						<h5>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X Wireless</h5><p><span>May 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>SteelSeries headsets have long been among my favorite wireless gaming headsets. This is not only because of the good sound quality the brand offers but also because of the comfort and battery life these headpieces pack. Back in May of this year, SteelSeries released its Arctis Nova 5X wireless for consoles and PC, and I was happy to be able to get a sample for testing.</p>
<p>I've been testing quite a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-7x-arctis-9-wireless-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5-pc-headset-love-child-dual-wireless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few wireless outings</a> from SteelSeries over the past few years with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arctis Nova Pro Wireless being the most recent headpiece I reviewed</a>. In the same Nova line, SteelSeries now released the more cost-friendly Arctis Nova 5X wireless headsets. Don't, however, let the €139.99 retail price fool you - this might very well be one of the best wireless gaming headsets in this price range.</p>
<p><strong>Design and features</strong></p>
<p>The design of the Nova 5X wireless is similar to other offerings in the Nova series and comes with the brand's iconic ski goggle headband on a plastic headband. Unlike the Pro Nova models, however, the design of this headpiece is all-plastic, but luckily, the build quality feels sturdy. Being a plastic design, the Arctis Nova 5X is lighter than the Pro models, adding to the headset's comfort. The earpads on SteelSeries' mid-range headset are made of breathable fabric, which remains cool on the ears - even after longer gaming sessions. I prefer the fabric to the leatherette used on other headsets. The left and right earcups are easily recognizable via an "L" and "R" print on the mesh inside the earcups, which I prefer over the often tiny indicators on the hinges.</p>
<figure><figcaption>The earcups of the Nova 5X wireless</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the left earcup, we find a dedicated mute button for the microphone, the general volume wheel, and a retractable microphone. The right earcup offers the game/chat balance wheel, the power button, and a button to switch between 2.4 GHz mode and Bluetooth. The right cup also houses the USB-C charging port. In addition to powering the headset, the power button also serves as a multifunction button to play/pause music, move between tracks, and increase/decrease call volume. The quick switch button also allows users to answer and end voice calls as well as ignore calls.</p>
<figure><figcaption>The printed "R" inside the right earcup</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nova 5 connects wirelessly via 2.4 GHz through a supplied USB-C dongle. The dongle that comes with the Xbox version of the headset includes a switch that allows users to switch between use on Xbox and other platforms (USB). Interestingly, by picking USB mode, users can also use the headset on PlayStation platforms, whereas the PlayStation version of this headset doesn't allow players to use it on Xbox. As such, those who own both a PlayStation and Xbox might do well to pick the Xbox version of the Nova 5 wireless.</p>
<figure><figcaption>The ski-goggle headband can be adjusted with several notches</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Comfort</strong></p>
<p>Like other offerings from SteelSeries, the Arctis Nova 5 wireless is highly comfortable, partly due to the use of the brand's iconic suspension band but also due to its relatively low weight.&nbsp; Most users will be able to find a good fit, and the headset offers a good seal. Even after longer sessions, I felt no strain at the top of my head - something I, unfortunately, experience frequently, even on higher-priced headsets. As said, the earcups are made of breathable fabric, adding to the comfort when temperatures rise.</p>
<p><strong>Sound quality and battery life</strong></p>
<p>SteelSeries boasts that the Nova 5 Wireless will last 60 hours on a single charge. This is likely under optimal conditions, as I had to charge the headset after roughly 45 hours. Granted, this is when using both the 2.4Ghz connection and Bluetooth at normal volume, and we expect the headset to last longer than that when only using the 2.4Ghz connection. Still, 45+ hours of battery life is great and vastly more than other wireless offerings, including higher-priced ones.</p>
<p>Sound quality is great, especially for a headset in this price range, and I'm convinced you'll be hard-pressed to find a better-sounding headset in this segment. There's plenty of sound separation across the board, and sound effects come through clear enough. A nice addition that makes the sound experience even better is the use of the all-new Nova 5 companion app. This application allows for plenty of customization and packs over 140 EQ presets, including presets for many popular games.</p>
<p>The Nova 5X wireless microphone is easily among the best headset microphones I've used recently, possibly beating those of higher-end headsets. Sound distortion is minimal, and the microphone does a good job of blocking ambient noises.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>After reading this review, it won't come as a surprise that I'm quite fond of SteelSeries's latest wireless outing. Although it might not be as 'premium' as the brand's Nova Pro line, the Arctis Nova 5X 5 combines great comfort, good sound quality, and a solid microphone for a more than fair price. Multiplatform players looking for a solid wireless headset won't go wrong with this one.</p>

<p>The SteelSeries Nova 5X Wireless offers a great allround package, and might very well be the best in class wireless gaming headset in this price range. </p>

<p>The World Series of Warzone is unravelling, but one event champion has already been crowned. In a dominating display of talent, Toronto Ultra’s ‘Nickool’ claimed the $50,000 winner-takes-all prize, becoming the one player out of an entire lobby of pro competitors to walk away victorious.</p>



<p>While the prize pool for the SOLO YOLO tournament has dropped somewhat of late, it remains one of the most exciting moments of the World Series of Warzone event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-vegas-baby">Vegas, Baby</h2>



<p>The SOLO YOLO event at the World Series of Warzone is one of the most entertaining spots in the entire event. In 2021, the first major SOLO YOLO was claimed by Seth ‘Scump’ Abner, a former Call of Duty League competitor and one of the most legendary pro players in the world. Back then, the prize was worth $100,000.</p>



<p>In 2022, Fifakill claimed the $100,000 grand prize, and then last year, Skullface landed 10 kills in a single match to pick up the prize. This year, the prize was halved, but it’s still an exciting moment for Nickool, a relatively small content creator who is now $50,000 richer (after taxes, of course).</p>



<p>We’ve seen a little drama unfold at the World Series of Warzone, which is currently taking place in Las Vegas. Team Falcons’ Diaz Biffle was found to be playing on an inferior PC compared to the other competitors, running with a GPU that fell several steps short of what everyone else was using.</p>



<p>An investigation is ongoing to determine how this happened, but it hasn’t stopped Team Falcons from topping the standings on the first day. This is the same team that won the Warzone category of the Esports World Cup, and they’re expected to pull off a similar victory here at the World Series of Warzone.</p>
