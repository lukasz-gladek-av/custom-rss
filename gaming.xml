            <p>
Arkane Austin's ailing vampire shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a> has received its final update, as the developers themselves are purged by parent company Microsoft. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/redfall-will-receive-one-final-update-after-all-including-an-offline-mode">Announced a few weeks back</a>, Redfall game update 4 introduces a much-requested offline mode and single-player pausing, together with some new in-game progression features and activities: a Community Standing bar whereby Support currency can be spent on rewards from the Safehouse Skill tree, and Elder Nests, aka vampire nests with specially modified vampire bosses. That's in addition to new enemy encounters in Redfall Commons, improved AI and a new Unrivaled Weapon.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The new Elder Nests will appear around Redfall much like Heart Nests, and are distinguished by a purple glow. Slay the boss vampire lurking within, and you'll earn a temporary Heart Shard buff that scales to campaign difficulty.  As for the revamped Neighbourhood stuff, there are six ranks of Community Standing encompassing 39 permanent buffs, from cosmetics appearing on your map and compass to an Escape Plan buff that activates a salvaged Bellwether cloak for 10 seconds when your health is critical. 
</p>
<p>
"All the upgrades from the Community Standing Skill Tree are meant to provide you with a mixture of QoL and gameplay benefits," the developers note. "A few of the traits will even help collectors finish out their hunt for cosmetics and Grave Locks. You can read more about the patch on <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/57LBTGVNF2rYof6K3yMGLP/redfall-game-update-4-available-now?linkId=100000263752169">Bethesda's official site</a>.  
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced</a> that Arkane Austin together with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tango-gameworks-deserves-to-be-remembered-for-more-than-shinji-mikami">Hi-Fi Rush developers Tango Gameworks</a> would close on May 7th, in what Xbox's Matt Booty termed a "consolidation of our Bethesda studio teams, so that we can invest more deeply in our portfolio of games and new IP." 
</p>
<p>
Arkane Austin's other works include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remembering-prey-arkane-austins-masterpiece">the wonderful Prey</a>. Redfall isn't nearly as captivating, but I think even detractors would agree that it harboured the spark of something greater, with an engrossing setting and visual direction that were spoiled by bugs, a shortage of compelling activities and some rather scanty post-launch support during its first year.</p>
<p>
"The thing is, I actually quite like wandering around Redfall," Ed Thorn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/redfall-review">wrote in our review</a>. "Discounting the pop-in and the MMO-esque warring factions that don't actually damage one another, it's got some impressive buildings and occasional hints of Arkane magic, and even the jank can't pull me out of enjoying the lazy port town controlled by vampires. There's a nice ratio of imposing museums to auburn flora, coupled with moments of wonder as you notice the sea's been parted by supernatural forces, or as you're whisked into the warped halls of a vampire's brain during a big set piece. Interiors are also on point, too. Arkane know how to make rooms seem lived in and there's plenty of it here."</p>
<p>
While it'll never be the game it could have been, Arkane Austin managing to add offline support in the face of layoffs means that Redfall won't vanish as and when Microsoft turns off its servers. "So many people worked so hard to make this patch a reality, even after they learned Arkane was closing," lead narrative designer Steve Powers <a href="https://x.com/stevepowers/status/1796225006763942191">wrote on Xitter</a> as the patch went live last night. "I am so immensely proud of the Arkane team and will treasure my time with them forever."
</p>
<p>Best of luck to all of Arkane Austin's survivors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-until-dawn-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Sony has a plan. It doesn’t involve Tahiti, though. Its goal is to launch a few exclusives on PC, then keep the sequels to said games on its console ecosystem. In turn, the company expects fans to buy a PlayStation 5 or, in the future, a PlayStation 6 to continue playing a franchise. Little do they know, we’re patient players. But those games that are coming to PC now have a few caveats to consider for many. Namely, does Until Dawn require a PSN account on PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-a-psn-account-to-play-until-dawn-on-pc">Do You Need a PSN Account to Play Until Dawn on PC?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, right alongside God of War Ragnarok, Until Dawn requires a PSN account to play on PC. Despite being a single-player cinematic experience, Until Dawn features PlayStation Trophies and the new PlayStation Overlay, similar to the Xbox Overlay, requiring a constant play connection.</p>



<p>Even worse, over 120 countries worldwide cannot purchase or play any game with PSN requirements. PSN isn’t supported worldwide, only in approximately 70 countries. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-until-dawn">What is Until Dawn?</h2>



<p>Did you play The Quarry? If not, I recommend scooping it up on Steam, especially with the upcoming Steam Summer Sale dropping prices to ridiculous lows. In any case, it’s a cinematic horror experience in which you control a group of characters as they attempt to survive the night from untold horrors in the darkness. It’s not a direct sequel to Until Dawn, but they share many similarities in style and gameplay.</p>



<p>Until Dawn follows a group of friends as they venture into the wilderness, hoping for a camping getaway at an isolated lodge. Unfortunately, they’re not alone. You’ll control individual group members, making life-or-death decisions along the way and changing the tale’s outcome with every choice.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy 16 is on sale for only $35 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPMTJJ6D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1825606123847527313%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-16-is-on-sale-for-cheap-at-amazon-and-best-buy%2F1100-6519089%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>. This matches the best price yet for the latest (brand-new) mainline entry in the series.</p><p>While every Final Fantasy game is different, Final Fantasy 16 takes the RPG roots of the series and injects a healthy dose of action into its design. The result feels like a mix between the action-packed spectacle of Devil May Cry and the RPG elements of older Final Fantasy games as you use a combination of swords and sorcery to defeat powerful foes.</p><p>This is also one of the darkest Final Fantasy entries, a game that wastes no time in setting up its stale of warring kingdoms, bustling slave trades, and cutthroat politics. All of this is seen through the eyes of Clive Rosfield, the protagonist who players will guide across a story that spans decades and charts his quest to bring balance back to a world that is in disarray. Don't worry if that sounds too much like Game of Thrones, because unlike that HBO series, Final Fantasy 16 has stunning boss fights between the Godzilla-sized Eikons that you'll encounter.</p><p>"Having seen Final Fantasy 16 all the way through, I'm happy to include it alongside some of my all-time favorites in the series," Michael Higham wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/" data-ref-id="1900-6418081">Final Fantasy 16 review</a>. "It's heartening to see that this bold approach to both story and gameplay is now part of that legacy, expanding the definition of what a mainline entry could be. It may fall short in some respects, but it should be celebrated for its most stunning moments and the characters who embody them. FFXVI succeeds and earns its place within the Final Fantasy pantheon as one of the great entries, and does so on its own terms."</p><p>Final Fantasy 16 is just one of many PlayStation exclusives on sale right now during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-days-of-play-2024-ps5-deals/1100-6523751/" data-ref-id="1100-6523751">Days of Play</a>.

<p data-characters="209" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Toys for Bob has announced <a href="https://x.com/ToysForBob/status/1796556809660207498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Twitter</a> that they’ve teamed up with Microsoft for their next new game. There’s no word on what that next new game will be, but their choice of partner is… quite the choice.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Xbox</a> to publish our next new game. We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit – but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about! Can't wait to share more 💜 <a href="https://t.co/6EqrQbabpv">pic.twitter.com/6EqrQbabpv</a></p>— Toys For Bob (@ToysForBob) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToysForBob/status/1796556809660207498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Toys for Bob was originally a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard and, along with them, were <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/uk-regulators-give-consent-for-microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought up by Microsoft in 2023</a>. It was only a few months before Microsoft went to work laying of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-people-making-the-games-keep-paying-the-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,900 employees</a>, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/toys-for-bob-future-unclear-amid-studio-closure-and-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some that were at Toys for Bob</a>, leaving the developer’s survival in question. Subsequently, Toys for Bob was able to split from the newly acquired Activision and set out on their own.</p>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">Since then, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft has shuttered</a> Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, while absorbing Roundhouse Studios into ZeniMax Online.</p> <p data-characters="547" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">I consider myself to be a forgiving person, but I’m confused that the studio is so eager to partner with their former existential threat. I shouldn’t be too surprised because, at the time of their split, Toys for Bob said in a statement that they were looking into a possible partnership with Microsoft. It may have been a part of the deal that allowed them to separate. Or perhaps they are working on a property owned by Microsoft. Or maybe they feel it’s a safe partnership because Microsoft no longer has the power to lay off their staff.</p>
 <p data-characters="626" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="false">Toys For Bob most recently worked on the <em>Skylanders </em>series, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-spyro-reignited-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spyro Reignited T</a></em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>rilogy</em>, and <em>Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time</em></a>. It’s possible that the developer is looking to return to one of those licenses, which would necessitate a deal with Microsoft. However, that’s purely speculation trying to make sense of the matter. We won’t know until the project is revealed. According to the Tweet, “We’re still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit – but know that we’re working hard on an experience we’re so sooo inspired about! Can’t wait to share more.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ea-sports-college-football-25-wear-and-tear-feature-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ea-sports-college-football-25-wear-and-tear-feature-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="230" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> challenges players to pick their spots and protect their players from taking big hits at all costs. Here is everything you need to know about the wear and tear feature and how to best avoid injuries. </p> <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">Wear and tear is a new feature in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, which accurately tracks the impact of every hit and fall on your players. For example, if your quarterback throws the ball 40 times in a game and takes a few shots from sitting in the pocket for too long, he won’t operate at 100 percent the following week. Or, if a running back takes a huge shot to his knee or lower leg, they won’t have the same explosiveness on the following set of plays. </p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, there is a way to mitigate wear and tear and prevent your best players from taking unnecessary damage that might potentially keep them off the field when they’re needed most. Lets jump right into how this feature works. </p>  <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cfb25-wear-tear-4-screens.png.adapt_.768w.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">As seen in the image above, every limb and body part of a player is linked to a different color indicator. Yellow is slight, high is orange, and severe is red. Based on the hits or fatigue from that body part, the color will change, and a meter in the bottom left indicates how close a player is to becoming injured. Fortunately, their body parts will degrade slower based on the toughness rating, and players can regain health when they are not on the field, during timeouts, at halftime, and between weeks. </p>
 <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">To avoid injuries, users should regularly make substitutions to provide rest and prevent wear and tear. In addition, it’s always more fun to make an exciting spin move, juke, or hurdle over defenders, but you don’t always want to put your players in dangerous positions. So even though it’s not as flashy, sometimes running out of bounds or doing a safe catch might save your team for later in the season. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to check wear and tear</h2> <p data-characters="80" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false">Here is a list of ways to check wear and tear in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>. </p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li>Player reticle – Left side Wear and Tear bars, right side fatigue. Note, the bars depleting only represent the most hurt body part.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Depth chart – Here, you can see a Wear and Tear panel on the bottom right of the player card as well as the total an attribute is decreasing in the spreadsheet.&nbsp;</li> <li>Coach Vision – Hold LT+RS on Xbox or L2+R2 on PlayStation down to see the Wear and Tear status of your entire team.&nbsp;</li> <li>Picture in Picture (PIP) in the play call menu.&nbsp;</li> <li>We’ve added a ton of ‘Wear and Tear’ get-up animations. After a player is banged up, you’ll see a variety of animations for a given body part, depending on the severity.</li> <li>You can also manage your players’ Wear and Tear in the Dynasty player card.</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-steam-survival-crafter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've got room in your life for another indie open-world survival-crafter, you might want to take a look at&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>, which was released today on Early Access and which is climbing the Steam charts rapidly.</p>

<p>Earlier this week,&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>publisher Qooland Games <a href="https://mask.qoolandgames.com/index/detail/144" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that the game's release would be moved from June 18th to May 31st, and it looks like that's a move which has paid off.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2646460/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to SteamDB</a>,&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>'s 24-hour player count has already reached a whopping 16,665, which is pretty impressive considering the game has only been on release for a handful of hours at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-pyramid.jpg?itok=cWBtgnQS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-pyramid.jpg?itok=QxwcGdKR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>is taking the indie survival-crafter world by storm right now.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's numbers are even more impressive considering that the open-world survival-crafter market is arguably pretty saturated, with games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-finally-dethrones-baldurs-gate-3-as-most-played-game-on-steam-deck-in-february"><em>Palworld</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-ashlands-update-ptr-launch"><em>Valheim</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-enshrouded-update-hollow-halls"><em>Enshrouded</em></a>, and many others competing for players' time.</p>

<p>Qooland and developer CampFire Studio know that they need to keep people engaged if they want to build something sustainable, though, which is probably why the two studios delivered an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2646460/view/4191240933898301822" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Early Access roadmap</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>Said roadmap offers an "initial blueprint for the future" and promises a new map, new mounts and masks, and new gameplay features, plus lots more.&nbsp;<em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>has some pretty ambitious plans behind it, apparently.</p>

<p>Given that we're not even into the weekend yet, it's likely that&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>'s numbers will increase even further over the next couple of days, so we could have another bona fide indie crafter hit on our hands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-flying.jpg?itok=UCn8JXXg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soulmask-early-access-survival-crafter-flying.jpg?itok=Ii06FqyJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big things are in store for&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Soulmask&nbsp;</em>certainly talks a big game. Its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2646460/Soulmask/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Steam page</a> promises "more than 500 hours" of content in the Early Access version alone, spanning activities like farming, exploring, and, erm, "raising pigs". Hmm.</p>

<p>In any case, if you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Soulmask</em>, you can do so right now via Steam Early Access. Can it make enough of a name for itself to stand out in a very crowded field? We'll have to wait and see, but early signs are pretty positive.</p>

Microsoft and Qualcomm aren’t talking much about this yet, but both companies have been dropping hints about game compatibility.</p><p>Qualcomm said previously that most Windows games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24107331/qualcomm-gdc-2024-snapdragon-on-windows-games">should “just work”</a> on Snapdragon X Elite laptops, and Microsoft took the time to demo some more games onstage at Build last week. <em>Borderlands 3</em> was shown running around 60 percent faster than native 1440p resolution thanks to Microsoft’s Auto Super Resolution technology. This taps into the NPU to boost frame rates and resolution, much like how Nvidia’s DLSS utilizes its own GPUs to upscale games.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161936/windows-on-arm-ready-software-linaro-microsoft-qualcomm">Microsoft also revealed</a> a new “works on Windows on Arm” website that catalogs which games work on Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite laptops. Linaro built the website and claims to have tested more than 1,400 games on the new Surface Laptop and other Snapdragon X Elite devices. More than 700 games are listed as running at 1080p and 60fps, including titles like <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em>.</p><p>This all sounds rather promising for emulated games running on thin and lightweight laptops...</p><div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-reportedly-prepping-summer-game-fest-reveals-hot-on-the-heels-of-state-of-play.886521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-summer-game-fest-reveals-rumors/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday saw Sony roll out a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play</a>, and while opinions on such showcases always vary, it contained a fair number of announcements, including the ambitious new platformer <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a>, first gameplay and a release-date for the multiplayer FPS <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-first-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a>, as well as additional dates for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-new-2024-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launches-on-pc-in-september-with-dlss-3-7-and-fsr-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War Ragnarok PC port</a>, and more. So, is that it for Team Blue? Astro Bot, Concord, Silent Hill 2, and GoW Ragnarok on PC would make a solid lineup for the rest of the year, so maybe PlayStation returns to its cave to hibernate for the rest of the summer?</p>
<p>Well, apparently Sony isn’t done with the “E3 season” announcements just yet. According to reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midori</a>, we can look forward to info on “more titles from some SIE [Sony Interactive Entertainment] studios” at&nbsp; Summer Game Fest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">And more titles from some SIE studios too! 😊</p>
<p>— みどり (@MbKKssTBhz5) <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796320512081354980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt for now, but Midori has one of the better track records in the leaking game, so if she says something, you should pay attention. As for what Sony might show, that’s up in the air right now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/spider-man-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider-Man 2</a> DLC seems like a fairly safe bet, as the big Sony leak from late last year revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-2-3-free-dlcs-carnage-other-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insomniac has a bunch of plans for 2024 DLC</a> they haven’t officially revealed yet. Maybe we also get another little looky-loo at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/marvels-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wolverine</a>? Beyond the superhero stuff, perhaps we get another look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fairgame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairgame$</a>, and a first peek at <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstations-new-firesprite-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firesprite Studios’ horror title</a> or the rumored Lego Horizon Adventures (yes, a crossover between Aloy and Lego is a supposedly real thing that’s been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored by reliable sources</a>).</p>
<p>The Summer Game Fest kickoff show will stream live on Friday, June 7 at 2pm PT. What do you think Sony might bring to the big show? What are you <em>hoping </em>to see?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168728/return-to-silent-hill-2-movie-bts-look<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="UzOfoo">Silent Hill is coming back to the movies. Details on the upcoming new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23412809/silent-hill-movie-reboot-return-director">Silent Hill movie sequel</a> have been sparse since it was announced in 2022, but during Thursday’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166622/silent-hill-transmission-may-2024-konami-remake-movie">Silent Hill Transmission livestream</a>, a short behind-the-scenes video revealed some new details, and gave us our best look yet at director Christophe Gans’ take on adapting the story of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.  The livestream also featured an extended gameplay sequence from the upcoming video game remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p>
<p id="BNQgKy">The movie, called <em>Return to Silent Hill</em>, will closely mirror the story of the second Silent Hill game according to Gans. That means it will follow James Sunderland, played in the movie by <em>War Horse</em>’s Jeremy Irvine, as he ventures to the town of Silent Hill in search of his lost love, Mary. But when he gets there, he finds it transformed into something dark and terrible. Or as Gans puts it, “It’s become something like hell.”</p>
<p id="PHKIqU">The livestream video is mostly on-set footage narrated by Gans, but even without the benefits of post-production, <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> is already looking pretty great. Part of that is thanks to Gans’ insistence, once again, that every monster possible is by played by a human — more specifically, a dancer. Gans explains that this was his approach on the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23411610/silent-hill-movie-new-game-announcement">original movie from 2006 as well</a>, and that he finds that these performers give the monsters an otherworldly, inhuman style of movement that’s both beautiful and unsettling. And based on the footage of the dancers in Thursday’s video, even without the monster make up, he’s definitely right.</p>
<p id="3EsgRJ">In the past, Gans has also explained that <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> will not be a direct sequel to his original movie, <em>Silent Hill</em>, or its sequel, <em>Silent Hill: Revelation</em>, which was directed by M.J. Bassett. Instead, Gans says to think of these movies more like an anthology series, where each entry can tell its own unique story in the Silent Hill universe without worrying too much about the previous movies. In fact, Gans has explained that he drew quite a bit of inspiration for the film from concept art for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2018/10/18/17990768/pt-is-the-best-horror-game-hideo-kojima"><em>P.T.</em></a> as well as <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p>
<p id="3iVMbo">There’s no word yet on when <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> will hit movie theaters. The video game remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> will be released on Oct. 8.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167838/wildcat-ethan-maya-hawke-flannery-oconnor-short-stories<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="HVWoTY">I got most of my creative writing and literature education in Florida, so the works of Flannery O’Connor, the author at the center of Ethan Hawke’s new movie <em>Wildcat</em>, were heavily featured in my curriculum. Her Southern Gothic short stories, with their regionally specific character and settings and often violent scenarios, were staples of my classes from high school through college. <a href="https://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/selena.anderson/engl2307/readings/a-good-man-is-hard-to-find-by-flannery-oconnor/view">“A Good Man is Hard to Find”</a> shocked my classmates in AP English Literature with its bleak ending, but I was fascinated. My college creative writing workshops usually featured at least one O’Connor story in the curriculum, with a focus on how she conveys strong themes in the limited space of a short story, and on her sharp grasp of hypocritical human behavior. </p>
<p id="TDJ3PL">Many of my peers strove to emulate her unflinchingly brutal content and style, which directly led to them critiquing my work for not having the dark, gritty quality they associated with stories like “Greenleaf” or “A Circle in the Fire.” Personally, I love O’Connor’s short stories because of her strong characterization and the unflinching look at the American South. And I love to read dark stories, even though I don’t enjoy writing them myself. But as much as I love O’Connor’s prose, part of me still associates her with a sense of not being good enough as a writer — at least among my peers. </p>
<p id="YB32aZ">But <em>Wildcat</em> helped me recontextualize O’Connor and her work, and fully embrace my love for her writing as something separate from my own. The movie is about 80% biographical, with the rest drawing on O’Connor’s fiction. It finds the author (played by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23131219/stranger-things-4-review-part-1-season"><em>Stranger Things</em></a>’ Maya Hawke, Ethan Hawke’s daughter) in the days before and after her lupus diagnosis, interleaved with micro adaptations of her most famous short stories, like <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/olli/class-materials/Short_Story_By_Flannery_OConnor.pdf">“Everything That Rises Must Converge”</a> and “Good Country People.”</p>

<p id="GDagAZ">One key scene in the movie resonated with me most, because I’ve been in a variation of the same situation. A flashback scene shows O’Connor reading one of her stories in front of her creative writing class. Like the other stories weaving through this movie, <a href="https://jpcatholic.edu/NCUpdf/courses/HUMA122-ParkersBack.pdf">“Parker’s Back”</a> turns into a short film of its own, starring Maya Hawke as Parker’s wife, while she also narrates as O’Connor. When the scene transitions back to O’Connor reading in front of her class, her classmates (mostly men) stare at her, dumbfounded. No one seems to <em>get</em> her story, except for her professor. </p>
<p id="huouyp">But O’Connor doesn’t care. She knows why she wrote what she wrote, and she knows what she’s trying to say. And frankly, she’s not interested in listening to her small-minded peers explaining what she should be doing instead, like softening the language her characters use in order to make her work more commercially viable. </p>
<p id="R1m1ci">Hawke’s portrayal of O’Connor is stellar. She plays the author as sullen and stubborn, unwilling to let her classmates’ petty critiques get her down. At a department party, she lurks in the corner until she’s drawn into a debate about the Eucharist. She’s uncompromisingly herself in everything she does — from arguing with her publisher at the beginning of the movie to the moment she rearranges her office space after her lupus diagnosis.</p>

<p id="ainbDF">Ethan Hawke’s built-in short-story adaptations also emphasize O’Connor’s distinct perspective. For instance, a scene where O’Connor’s mother and her mother’s friend, two well-meaning but ultimately small-minded Southern women, drone on about updates in their small town, is interspersed with her short story “Revelation,” in which a prejudiced woman in a doctor’s waiting room makes racist and classist comments to the people around her. The short story is clearly informed by O’Connor’s environment and how she views the people around her. All her short stories come from the way she views the world, a fact repeatedly emphasized throughout the movie, though possibly at the cost of showing viewers more about her life.</p>
<p id="bwH78H">But that message was what I needed to hear, and why <em>Wildcat</em> lands better for me as an exploration of O’Connor’s works than an informative biopic. I shouldn’t be trying to write like Flannery O’Connor, because only she could do that. My former classmates who strove to be just as sardonic in their writing — and criticized me for not doing the same — should’ve taken away something entirely different from Flannery O’Connor. Her short stories are fantastic because she wasn’t trying to be like anyone else. She had a specific, unique perspective on the world, and that’s what she tried to convey in her works. No one else could write her stories. <em>Wildcat</em> helped me realize that was one of her greatest strengths.  </p>
<p id="oPe1T7"><small><em>Wildcat </em></small><small>is currently in limited theatrical release, with a wide release coming later this year.</small></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive-provides-first-look-at-campus-iq-wear-tear-system-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's our first look at College Football 25's gameplay.</h2></div><section><p>After properly revealing it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-first-trailer-revealed">a few weeks ago</a>, EA Sports has finally provided fans a first look at gameplay for the highly anticipated return of college football video games, giving us a first look at some new features coming to <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/college-football-25">College Football 25</a> such as Campus IQ, Wear &amp; Tear, and more. </p><p>College Football 25 introduces <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a slew of new changes</a> that aim to recapture the spirit of college football in a virtual capacity and provide more immersion to make players feel like they are a college football player and/or coaches. Among the new changes is Campus IQ, encompassing three fundamental pillars of College Football 25: All 22+, 134 Ways to Play, and Stories of Saturday. All provide things like differentiation, team variance and their different strategies, and momentum-based gameplay. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Some interesting tidbits the deep dive covers include confirmation there will be 80 abilities. These abilities are categorized by physical and mental and are further broken down into a four-tier system: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. Players can have up to five physical and three mental abilities. One example of an ability is "Pocket Shield," which makes the offensive line hold better blocks when executing a standard pass play, though EA says even if the lineman have the highest tier, they can still lose in a matchup. </p><p>Wear &amp; Tear, a new system previously teased in the formal reveal, is a physics-based damaged system. While it sounds like a fatigue system, EA Sports is trying to illustrate it more as a management system designed to replicate real-life scenarios like players' damage and fatigue from playing a game, displaying every limb and body part of a player, each tied to unique attributes. For example, suppose a QB has been throwing a lot in a game and taking many hits. In that case, he will likely have a decrease in throw power and accuracy, and those effects may carry over the following week if you are playing Road to Glory or Dynasty mode.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>College Football 25 - Gameplay Deep Dive Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Weather conditions will also play a bigger role in adding depth and challenge to College Football 25. If it is raining, for example, it can be harder to throw or handle a wet football. Heavy rain or snow can also impact the trajectory of your kick while on special teams.</p><p>College Football 25's first deep dive also digs into the Option game. EA notes it wanted to make the mechanic mirror an exchange that can occur between the quarterback and the running back. </p><p>Another feature EA introduces in College Football 25 is Confidence and Composure. This system will see how players can maintain both attributes in high-pressure situations to match the energy seen in college football. So, rivalry games will have more stakes in maintaining composure than standard games. </p><p>Alongside Confidence and Composure, EA is also cranking up the pressure for a visiting team to win on the road with a home-field advantage, making it harder for visiting teams to win on the road at the Division 1 level. EA confirmed this home-field advantage would bring back NCAA Football 06's classic Stadium Pulse Meter, which causes the screen to shake and allows players to tell the crowd to "Get Louder" by flicking the right stick (RS) up. </p><p>College Football 25's gameplay also includes adjustments to passing and kicking. The former has increased the variance of the left stick (LS) pass lead intent, in addition to the development team making a significant overhaul to throw power, which now impacts not only the distance of the throw but how hard one is throwing to their intended target. While the new kicking mechanic removes the ability to use a thumbstick to aim and power up, the ball will automatically move side to side and you have to first lock the ball and then hold the A/X button to achieve maximum power. </p><p>Beyond the overhauls to offense, one major tweak to defensive play is the introduction of the Switch Stick. This mechanic will allow players to incentivize more defensive switching. For example, players can flick the right stick to switch the direction of their coverage while lurking in pass coverage.</p><p>The entire deep dive covered a ton of the new mechanics and systems introduced to College Football 25. EA teased plans to do more deep dives of other aspects College Football 25, such as Dynasty Mode and Team Builder, in the future. </p><p>College Football 25 is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date">out on July 19 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.

<p data-characters="276" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Despite many protagonists lacking them entirely, there have been many great feet in first-person shooters. <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, <em>Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic</em>, <em>F.E.A.R.</em>; when the kickers come out, it’s often a spectacle. <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/anger-foot-might-devolver-digital-most-unhinged-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anger Foot</a></em> attempts to outdo all previous feats of feet.</p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false"><em>Anger Foot</em> comes to us from Free Lives, a developer whose work has brought us a varied portfolio that includes games like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-broforce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Broforce</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-genital-jousting/">Ge</a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-genital-jousting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">n</a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-genital-jousting/">ital Jousting</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-terra-nil-free-lives-devolver-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terra Nil</a></em>. It’s coming sometime later this year, but I got to plant my feet in it today. Or, recently, I guess. What day is it?</p> <figure data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"><em>Anger Foot</em> takes place in Shit City, a location that makes me grateful that I work for a publication that lets me swear. In Shit City, crime is the law. You heard me. If a person isn’t committing a crime, that’s a red flag. At that point, police step in to ensure that the person gets the help they need to, at the very least, participate in petty larceny.</p> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="739" data-injectable="true">The city is ruled by four gangs, and you play as the one person who is willing to stand up to them. But only so they can steal some new shoes. However, before you get a single moment to admire your now complete sneaker collection, it’s stolen from under them. There are only two weapons powerful enough to get that footwear back, and their names are “Left” and “Right.”</p>
 <p data-characters="95" data-current-count="95" data-injectable="false">Actually, there are also guns, but you’ll be getting a lot of mileage out of your two hooves.</p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false"><em>Anger Foot </em>is set up like a cross between <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mullet-madjack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mullet MadJack’s</a> </em>corridor killing and <em>Hotline Miami’s</em> die-and-retry formula. Your goal is simply to reach the level’s exit point in the map, and any man, woman, or door that gets in your way needs to be kicked to splinters. One man. Two feet. All anger.</p> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Anger Foot | Gameplay Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVkDc6u_4GQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false"><em>Anger Foot</em> puts its best foot forward with its art style. Its grotesque stylings and use of bright comic-book colors are incredibly striking. The odd proportions and puppet people provide a helpful buffer to some of its gross-out humor. It’s like the Garbage Pail Kids have grown up with a fondness for toilets and swearing.</p> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">The music is similarly captivating. It maintains a near-constant, pulsing beat, but when there’s a break in the action, it takes on a reverberating sound, like it’s being played at maximum volume next door.</p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">However, after emerging from the forest of its aesthetic, there’s much less impact. Kicking doors is great. It’s fun to watch them sail across the room before breaking on a thug’s face. And while the actual kicking will send foes flying, it strangely lacks force.</p> <p data-characters="585" data-current-count="854" data-injectable="true">Melee combat is something that first-person shooter games often have trouble with. In <em>Anger Foot</em> you slide about, and when your foot is raised in anger, it doesn’t feel like it connects. There’s only the sensation that there’s a danger zone in front of your character. If you misjudge your timing, you might just pass by your target and glide around the floor to get ready for the next approach. There’s no weight or force in play. Even the drop kick doesn’t feel good to use. A door reacts to your toes in a fun way, but everything else just falls victim to the danger zone.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="800" data-injectable="true">This is something that bothered me all throughout the sizeable chunk of gameplay I was served. I never felt powerful. It only takes a handful of shots to bring you down, and you’re not really given many options to avoid them in a crowded room. Keep moving, kite enemies, and keep kicking. You can pack yourself full of caffeine using cans of Thirst Fucker you find laying around, or get yourself drunk off of Brewforce if you feel like it, but it’s still just a couple of shots to bring you down.</p>
 <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">The safest way to get through a level becomes kicking a door open, backing up, then kicking the enemies as they appear through the choke point. Even when you’re not cheesing, any time you need to be careful about your actions, the all-important momentum dies. Without the momentum, you don’t feel powerful, and that’s something that is crucial to <em>Anger Foot </em>and entirely lacking.</p> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">There are guns, but that’s just another problem. Their ammo is so limited, and movement is so important that in the chaos of a firefight, your feet seem more useful. That’s certainly on message, but it doesn’t give a reprieve from its problems.</p>
 <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">On the other hand, optional objectives that provide stars give value to repeated playthroughs of levels (even if some are frustrating). More importantly, the stars are used to unlock new shoes, each of which comes with new buffs and abilities. I could see myself getting deeply into collecting new kicks if the gameplay was made more exciting.</p> <figure data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false"><em>Mullet MadJack</em> feels so similar in intention to <em>Anger Foot</em>: Momentum, corridors, movement. However, through the use of systems like dashing and the glory kills of recent <em>Doom</em> games, <em>MadJack</em> feels much more satisfying. It has a series of mechanics that ensure that you never have to stop moving and you’re constantly killing.</p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true"><em>Anger Foot</em> is missing something. More accurately, it’s missing a few somethings. There are quite a few approaches that can be taken to alleviate its issues, but it’s probably going to require a few changes. As it stands, the whole experience is just too shallow.</p>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">I’m hoping that before launch, Free Lives can implement something to bring everything together. The level design, aesthetic, and even framework are all outstanding. Everything except the core gameplay is exceptional. I love looking at it, but <em>Anger Foot</em> is going to need to do more than just put one foot in front of the other to really nail the landing.</p>

<p data-characters="233" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">CampusIQ will play a huge role in determining the realism and authenticity of <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>. It’s been a while since the series added a new entry, and it’s making its comeback with this brand new feature. </p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">With expectations high for EA Sports and its upcoming new college football franchise, it appears the developer is leaving no stone unturned. The new title will not only include all real-life schools, but CampusIQ will also introduce new functionality, adding depth and dynamic details to your team.</p>  <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">CampusIQ is a collection of gameplay features that will dictate the performance of <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>.

 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><strong>Player abilities:</strong> In <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, there will be physical and mental abilities.

Mental abilities will attach certain positive and negative traits, which will have a telling impact on gameplay.</p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"><strong>Homefield advantage:</strong> “Home Sweet Home” has never been more accurate, as playing in your home stadium will provide certain advantages. These advantages could benefit your players while providing certain negative perks for your opponents. There will be 134 stadiums for players to choose from.</p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"><strong>Unique playbooks:</strong> Each team will have a host of different options for you to choose from.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ToysForBob/status/1796556809660207498" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Toys for Bob says Xbox will publish its next project, which is "still very early in development". As such, it might be a while before we hear anything further from the studio.</p>

<p>The developer does, however, say that it's "so sooo inspired about" the game, and that it can't wait to share more. Sadly, it doesn't look like more will be coming in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-june-showcase-direct-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">next month's Xbox showcase</a>, at any rate.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toys-for-bob-xbox-publishing-spyro-reignited.jpg?itok=iPLWeom3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toys-for-bob-xbox-publishing-spyro-reignited.jpg?itok=KUxRHg1L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Toys for Bob and Xbox are teaming up for the developer's next project.</figcaption></figure><p>Rumors first began to swirl that Toys for Bob would team up with Xbox for its next game <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-has-reached-an-agreement-with-toys-for-bob-for-their-first-independent-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in March</a>, but today's announcement represents the first official confirmation that the partnership is going ahead.</p>

<p>Some might consider the team-up a little strange considering that Toys for Bob <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-developer-toys-for-bob-becoming-independent-considering-partnership">became independent from Microsoft in February</a>, but a studio going indie doesn't mean it can't team up with its former owners, after all.</p>

<p>Additionally, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">bizarre studio closure spree</a> on which Microsoft embarked recently, Toys for Bob is arguably in the best position when it comes to working with Microsoft and the Xbox brand.</p>

<p>Right now, we're not sure whether Toys for Bob's game will be Xbox-exclusive. Teaming up with Xbox as a publisher would seem to imply exclusivity, but after all, some of Xbox's games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-will-release-four-games-on-other-plaforms-teases-next-generation-hardware">are available on other systems</a>.</p>

<p>A partnership with Xbox could well provide some fuel for that fire; after all, those franchises are technically Microsoft-owned thanks to the Activision Blizzard merger.</p>

<p>Still, we'll just have to wait and see what Toys for Bob has on the cards. Stay tuned for more.</p>

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we look back on the start of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">this year's June hype cycle, the period formerly known as E3</a>, now a potpourri of other events and announcement livestreams. </p>
<p>PlayStation got the ball rolling last night with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-playstations-state-of-play-may-2024">latest State of Play broadcast</a>, which included a look ahead at its rather meagre first-party plans for the remainder of 2024: a moderately buffed-up port of Until Dawn, online shooter Concord, and the charming Astro Bot. But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">as our Ian wrote earlier, even the cute robot has got some people (VR fans) disgruntled</a>. Still, as a flat-screen game, surely more people will now play it?</p>
<p>And then there was Silent Hill Transmission or, this time around, basically just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">a longer look at the upcoming Silent Hill 2</a> and a chance for Konami to promote a load of tie-in tat. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Victoria Kennedy and Vikki Blake to discuss.</p>

            <p>
Spyro developer Toys for Bob has formally confirmed its next game will be published by Xbox, in a teasing statement that ends with a decidedly purple-coloured heart emoji. 
</p>
<p>
Toys for Bob was previously part of the now-Microsoft-owned Activision Blizzard, and made its name making Skylanders, then working on the Crash and Spyro trilogy releases. 
</p>
<p>
But more recent years saw it pulled into work on Call of Duty as a support developer, and earlier this year it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-layoffs-affect-86-staff-at-spyro-crash-bandicoot-studio">lost 89 staff members</a> as a part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's wider layoffs of 1900 staff</a>.

<p>
Things began to look more promising in February, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activisions-skylanders-crash-bandicoot-studio-toys-for-bob-going-independent">the studio announced it was going independent from Activision Blizzard</a> and - it was presumed - would be leaving its days working on Call of Duty behind. 
</p>
<p>
At the time, rumours swirled that its indie status was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spyro-studio-toys-for-bob-secures-deal-with-microsoft-for-its-first-independent-game">tied into some sort of new deal with Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toys-for-bob-website-update-leads-to-new-crash-bandicoot-or-spyro-speculation">one report claimed work on Spyro 4 was now</a>, quietly, underway.

"We're excited to announce that we'll be partnering with Xbox to publish our next new game," Toys for Bob wrote on social media platform X today. </p>
<p>
"We're still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit - but know that we're working hard on an experience we're so sooo inspired about! Can't wait to share more 💜"
</p>
<p>
The purple colour of the image shared with the statement and the purple heart emoji both strongly suggest Toys for Bob is indeed working on a return for the popular purple dragon.
</p>
<p>
While we may not hear more from Toys for Bob for a while, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Microsoft is primed to reveal what's next for Xbox</a> in just over a week, as part of its not-E3/Summer Game Fest June showcase.

            <p>I fear we may have swum the Rubicon of diminishing returns where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> games inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> are concerned. The recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> has sucked up all the remaining oxygen in the room, and oxygen is pretty important in Murky Divers, for reasons that are hopefully self-evident. Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It's got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine. </p>

<p>The submarine doesn't have a third-person cam or forward viewing ports - you'll need to pilot it using sonar and a big compass mounted in front of the steering wheel, doubtless while shrieking at tardy team-mates to close the airlock before that big green dot on the sonar screen gets within biting distance. What will you be piloting the submarine towards? "Abandoned" seafloor laboratories, of course. Your job in this latest co-op scarefest from Embers (creators of well-regarded "casual Soulslike" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2162020/Strayed_Lights/">Strayed Lights</a>) is to clear up the results of various experiments gone wrong, lugging any and all dead boffins (piece by piece, if needed) back to your submersible, which contains an all-purpose shredder.</p>
<p>Along the way, you must do your level best not to become a corpse yourself. There are hazards such as sparking sockets and "abyssal terrors" such as octopi with grinning demon faces. The curvy submersible aesthetics put me in mind of our number one <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, but the wrecks themselves (and the act of swimming around holding a ripped-off foot) also evoke <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/barotrauma">Barotrauma</a>, Subnautica's grimacing grindhouse cousin.</p>
<p>Expect proximity-based voice chat, immersive 3D audio and procedurally generated wrecks. It's definitely "Lethal Company plus [concept]" but again, you do get a submarine. Murky Divers was announced this week, and will <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963880/Murky_Divers/">release in Steam early access on 19th June 2024</a>. If you prefer to go up against demon-faced octopi on your lonesome, and you're mad keen on UIs full of unlabelled dials and levers, Nauticrawl is a good suspenseful play. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghames-with-ghoastus-nauticrawl">Ghoastus likes it</a> and he knows a thing or two about horror, on account of being a ghost.</p>

Also, if Senua has line of sight on a totem, you will see her head turn toward its location.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-narrator-replay-1851497118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-narrator-replay-1851497118">Playing <em>Hellblade II</em> Twice Is Essential</a></span><br></p><p>Also, consider using photo mode to move the camera around a bit to spot a totem.

Plus, <em>Hellblade II</em> is rather generous with how far you can extend the camera…not like some <em>other</em> games (looking at you, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>FF7 Rebirth</em></a></span>).</p><div><h4> You can listen to all of Grettir’s story in one sitting in the Extras menu  </h4><p> It can be a little hard to focus on the entirety of  Grettir’s story as it is scattered throughout Senua’s winding journey  through Iceland. You can listen to the whole story, however, by  navigating to Extras &gt; Lorestangir Stories once you’ve collected all  18 totems. This is an excellent way to simply focus on this actual tale  of Norse mythology. As Druth says, it will help “illuminate” Senua’s  journey in the north.

                <p>Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors has commented on the possibility of raising the price of major games from the industry standard of $70 to something above that. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracers-lars-wingefors-on-the-brutal-truth-of-the-aaa-market" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Wingefors said the video game industry is no different than other businesses in that inflation and production costs continue to rise.</p><p>Wingefors said it's been "hard" to increase price for premium games in the console and PC space, and due to this, "the margin to success is less." Prices beyond $70 for new game releases is not out of the realm of possibility, Wingefors said, and it might take one company being a first-mover and seeing how the market responds.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Alone in the Dark GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"The reality is no one has tried it. If you create an enormous RPG, for example, with 100 or 150 hours of gameplay, very polished and a unique experience, would the consumer be willing to pay more? If they would, they would have more products potentially coming to market. But no one tried it," he said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that Embracer has been "discussing" this very thing. However, for the time being at least, Embracer is following the wider industry and keeping its price ceiling at $70. Of course, many game companies charge more than $70 for new games when considering deluxe/special editions. Many games today, including single-player titles, also have microtransaction systems built into them that provide another revenue stream for the publisher beyond the initial purchase price.</p><p>"Would it be that one [company] one day that tries to increase pricing? That remains to be seen," he said.</p><p>Another possibility, Wingefors said, is that Embracer might consider making shorter games that could help lower costs and increase the upside potential. For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's best-selling game so far in the US, Helldivers II, is priced at $40 USD.</a></p><p>"I just believe there are consumers willing to engage in those amazing RPGs and other single-player games, and ultimately they are willing to spend money on them. Do you increase pricing, or do you make them shorter?" he said. "I think there are ways. I think it would be very sad if everything just became big multiplayer, in-game monetization titles. There are millions of consumers willing to engage more in classic games."</p><p>Some have theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> could launch at a price above $70 for its standard edition. After all, Take-Two was one of the first companies to raise prices from $60 to $70 for new release, and some believe the company might go up another $10 for GTA 6. That remains to be seen, but CEO Strauss Zelnick said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-gta-6-release-coming-up-take-two-boss-talks-about-setting-game-prices/1100-6523568/" data-ref-id="1100-6523568">the company's aim is to "over deliver" on value against cost.</a></p><p>As for Embracer, the company recently concluded a cost-cutting program that resulted in hundreds of layoffs, canceled games, studio closures, and more dramatic changes. The name Embracer is going away in the future, but Wingefors maintains <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracers-name-is-going-away-ceo-denies-its-due-to-backlash-and-controversy/1100-6522930/" data-ref-id="1100-6522930">the change is not due to bad press.</a></p>

      </div>
<p>Players voiced their concerns about the situation, questioning why a single-player game needs this requirement. One player even <a href="https://x.com/Drayden42/status/1796329211692740695" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">joked that they'll sign up for PSN</a> when Sony finally ports <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-2022-its-still-baffling-that-bloodborne-isnt-on-pc-yet/1100-6509218/" data-ref-id="1100-6509218">Bloodborne to PC</a>.</p><p>The PSN debacle began earlier this month when Sony announced that players would have to create a PSN account to continue playing Helldivers 2. However, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">reversed this particular decision</a> after fan backlash. Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut was released on PC earlier this month, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-on-pc-requires-psn-account-for-online-play/1100-6523195/" data-ref-id="1100-6523195">only the multiplayer aspect required a PSN account</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" data-ref-id="5000-519021">God of War Ragnarok for PC </a>will launch on September 19. It supports ultrawide monitor support and DLSS/FSR/XESS, as well as all post-launch updates such as new game plus and the Valhalla DLC. The Until Dawn remake will launch on PS5 and PC in Fall 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="249" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re looking to build up a strong party in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you’re going to need to ascend your party members and for this, you need certain materials. One such material, Wintry Bell, is required to ascend Aalto, Yangyang, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sanhua-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-teams/">Sanhua</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Ascending party members is vital as you progress and if you want to survive tougher fights, as it allows you to level up characters and increase their stats. Remember that, once you’ve ascended your party members and increased their maximum level, you’ll also need to make sure that their weapons are also leveled up.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-wintry-bell-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to find Wintry Bell in </strong><strong><em>Wuthering Waves</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking for Wintry Bell, you’ll need to head towards the Gorges of Spirits. This area is located in Tolling Stream, and it’s where you battle against the Calamity class Bell-Borne Geochelone.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">Wintry Bell are abundant in the area around the fight’s arena, so you won’t have too much of a hard time finding it. However, make sure you don’t venture too close to the giant bell in the middle, or you’ll inadvertently find yourself in battle with Bell-Borne Geochelone, which is unfortunate if you’re only there to pick some flowers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">There’s also a lot of groups of Tacet Discords in the area which may hinder your progress, but they’re not too easy to clear out and at least you could get some Echoes out of it.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-buy-wintry-bell-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to buy Wintry Bell in </strong><strong><em>Wuthering Waves</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="189" data-injectable="false">Wintry Bell can also be purchased by visiting Shifang Pharmacy in Jinzhou, however this can get pretty expensive, especially for something that can be found pretty easily in the wild.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">However, if you’re in a pinch, or find that you’re just a few short when it comes time to ascend, you can purchase a maximum of 15 Wintry Bell for 3,000 Shell Credits each.&nbsp;You’ll need to wait for a timer to reset to get more.</p>

<p data-characters="237" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re looking to build up a strong party in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you’re going to need to ascend your party members and for this, you need certain materials. If Yuanwu is part of your party, you’re going to need Terraspawn Fungus.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Ascending party members is vital as you progress and if you want to survive tougher fights, as it allows you to level up characters and increase their stats. Remember that, once you’ve ascended your party members and increased their maximum level, you’ll also need to make sure that their weapons are also leveled up.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-terraspawn-fungus-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to find Terraspawn Fungus in Wuthering Waves</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="185" data-injectable="false">Terraspawn Fungus is found only in the area around the Withering Frontline in Desorock Highland. It’s pretty common in the area, alongside Erodorchid, which look fairly similar.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true">Fair warning, this area is completely overrun with Tacet Discords and it’s unlikely you’ll be able to sneak around the area unnoticed. The TDs seem particularly prevalent in areas where there are clumps of Terraspawn Fungus, so you’ll need to be prepared to fight if you want to farm this material.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">On top of this, Terraspawn Fungus spawns in the area directly on top of the location where you fight the Overlord class <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-echoes-in-wuthering-waves/">Thundering Memphis</a>, so you’ll need to err on the side of caution if you don’t want to be dragged into a battle.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-buy-terraspawn-fungus-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>Where to buy Terraspawn Fungus in Wuthering Waves</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="192" data-injectable="false">Terraspawn Fungus can also be purchased by visiting Shifang Pharmacy in Jinzhou.

You’ll need to wait for a timer to reset to get more.</p>

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">At launch, all five assault rifles in <em>XDefiant</em> can hold their own and compete with any other weapon in the free-to-play title. So, it wasn’t an easy exercise to rank this loaded class, but here’s a list of the best AR’s in <em>XDefiant.</em></p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">Assault rifles can do a little bit of everything. This class has weapons capable of taking down enemies in short, medium, and long-range engagements. Being able to kill faster, having a manageable recoil pattern, and having good mobility separate these four choices. With that in mind, let’s jump right into the list. </p> <h2 id="h-every-xdefiant-assault-rifle-loadout-ranked" data-injectable="false">Every <em>XDefiant</em> assault rifle loadout ranked</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false">5. MDR</h3> <figure data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Barrel Extender</li> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong>&nbsp;Lightweight</li> <li><strong>Optics:</strong>&nbsp;Reflex</li> <li><strong>Front Rail</strong>: Small Vertical Grip</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong>&nbsp;Padded</li> </ul> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true"><em>Xdefiant’s</em> first Battle Pass weapon falls victim to landing in no man’s land. The MDR was designed to be a hybrid SMG, but it gets outclassed by the ACR 6.8 in short-range engagements and falls short of every other AR in medium and long-range engagements.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">4. M4A1 </h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid </figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Front Rail:&nbsp;</strong>Small Vertical Grip</li> <li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>Reflex Sight</li> <li><strong>Magazine:&nbsp;</strong>Quick Mag</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:&nbsp;</strong>Quick Draw Grip</li> <li><strong>Stock:&nbsp;</strong>Precision Stock</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">The M4A1 is a good first weapon to pick up and is easy to use, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better than other ARs. Players will have an issue going toe-to-toe regarding firepower with the M16A4 and AK-47, but the speed and accuracy make up for that deficiency, if you still enjoy using the M4A1.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">3. AK-47</h3> <figure data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid </figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel:&nbsp;</strong>Recon</li> <li><strong>Front Rail:&nbsp;</strong>Angled Grip</li> <li><strong>Optics:&nbsp;</strong>Reflex</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong>&nbsp;Heavy Grip</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong>&nbsp;Padded Stock</li> </ul> <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">If players want pure firepower, the AK-47 is the perfect AR. Thanks to its ability to shred through enemies almost instantly, we could easily put this weapon higher on the list. However, the M16A4 and ACR 6.8 slight edge</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">2. M16A4</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Barrel:&nbsp;</strong>Rapid Fire</li> <li><strong>Front Rail:&nbsp;</strong>Superlight Grip</li> <li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>Reflex Sight</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:&nbsp;</strong>Grip Tape</li> <li><strong>Stock:&nbsp;</strong>Padded Stock</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Ignore the time-to-kill stats because they don’t paint the full picture for a burst weapon. If you are accurate, the M16A4 takes down enemies consistently in two bursts and outclasses most other medium and long-range engagements. The only thing holding the M16A4 back from holding the top spot its, you will get punished with any missed shots to a fully automatic weapon.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">1. ACR 6.8</h3> <figure data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong>&nbsp;Lightweight</li> <li><strong>Front Rail:</strong>&nbsp;Leather Wrapped</li> <li><strong>Optic:</strong>&nbsp;Reflex</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:&nbsp;</strong>Quick Draw</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong>&nbsp;Lightweight</li> </ul> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="false">According to data provided by <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/xd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TrueGameData</a>, the ACR 6.8 has the fastest time-to-kill speed for ARs up to 25 meters. The AK-47 takes over as the fastest-killing AR from 25 to 35 meters, but that first-range difference is just enough to make the ACR 6.8 a better weapon and the best overall AR. </p>

            <p>John Romero's autobiography Doom Guy: Life in First Person is being adapted for screen in two different forms.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/doom-guy-life-in-first-person-documentary-drama-john-romero-quake-wolfenstein-1235944457/">Deadline</a>, the story of the id Software co-founder is being made into a documentary by Canadian filmmaker Rob McCallum.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a dramatised adaptation of the Doom creator's book is also in the pipeline. Both of these projects are going to be executive produced by Naomi Harvey of Golden Possum Productions.</p>

<p>"Talking with both Rob and Naomi, I knew they were the perfect team to bring Doom Guy to life," Romero said following the news. "Our backgrounds and aspirations have uncanny similarities, and I trust them to tell the story."</p>
<p>McCallum called Romero's journey "the missing antidote for all of us misfit toys looking for hope and kindred spirits in the darkness of the world", while Harvey added the video game icon's story is "one of triumph over trauma, filled with compassion and inspiration".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romero-is-releasing-a-memoir">Doom Guy: Life in First Person covers Romero's video game career</a>, as well as his childhood and family life. This includes recounts of his alcoholic father, racist grandfather who didn't approve of his parents' mixed-race coupling, and grandmother who ran a brothel in Mexico.</p>
<p>As well as Doom, Romero is also known for Quake and Wolfenstein. These games all pioneered the first person shooter genre, and at GDC last year, Romero was the recipient of a <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/legendary-game-designers-john-romero-and-mabel-addis-honored-gdca-2023">Lifetime Achievement Award</a> for his work.</p>

            <p>There is a time for perfect clarity in a shooter, for clean walls and clear-cut character silhouettes. But this is not it. Retro first-person gunwaltzer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/selaco">Selaco</a> is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage 'em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a>, promising both the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-fears-ai-is-still-the-best-in-first-person-shooters">fiendish AI enemies</a> of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it's out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.</p>

<p>You play the security captain of Selaco, a vast facility housing the last refugees from a fallen Earth. You're being invaded; time to shoot. The early access version includes the "entirety of the Base Campaign and covers the majority of the game" we're told in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4191240933893510804">a recent news update on Steam</a>. There are 11 weapons, plus a "Kit System" that lets you mix and match firearm attributes to create, let's say, a frightening nailgun with a shotgun's hefty spread. The big boasting point, however, is some clever F.E.A.R. style enemies, who shout out to each other, remark on your actions, and generally react to your behaviour in a challenging, pressurizing way. "The enemies will communicate, provide cover fire, flank, rush, defend and much more," say developers Altered Orbit Studios. A wonderful promise I hope it can keep.</p>
<p>The shooter has been designed using GZDoom, a source port of great-great-grandaddy shooter Doom, which is still enjoying the attention of modders and mappers to this day. But Altered Orbit have gone much farther than mere tinkering, pushing GZDoom to lunatic extremes. As a casual dabbler in Quake mapping I can only look at the disintegrating props and smoking rubble of Selaco with a kind of terrified awe. It is, in more ways than one, a hardcore FPS. For one thing, it's releasing with a bonus difficulty mode "designed to make Selaco nearly impossible." Gauntlet thrown, folks. </p>
<p>"There are still many ideas we want to explore, systems we want to flesh out, and game modes we want to add to make it even more replayable," say the devs, talking about the decision to launch into early access. "With our roots being in video game modding, we feel perfectly comfortable releasing something big and making it bigger over time at our own pace."</p>
<p>Heck. It's been a decent few months for boomer shooters. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phantom-fury-review">Phantom Fury</a> was another setpiece <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> inspired by Half-Life era blastin', and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mullet-mad-jack">Mullet Mad Jack</a> was and ultra-stylish corridor crash, according to Ed's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mullet-mad-jack-review">review</a>. We might be reaching a point of retroshoot saturation but, if I'm honest, one more homage to F.E.A.R. will not go amiss. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trepang-2">Trepang2</a> came out last year with the same love for the much-lauded 2005 psychological bulletdrama, and we quite liked that too. "Oh, I do enjoy shooting these faces!" wrote Alice O (RPS in peace) in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trepang2-review-its-an-indie-fear">review</a>. For fans of this type of game it truly has been good eatin'. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/">pick up Selaco on Steam for £21/$25</a>.</p>
