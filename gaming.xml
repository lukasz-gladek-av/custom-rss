Before founding Midsummer, the two worked on<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/1/10884590/xcom-2-review-pc"><em>XCOM</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/23/7044619/civilization-beyond-earth-review"><em>Civilization: Beyond Earth</em></a><em>, </em>and <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns.</em> Today, the new studio has announced its first game: a next-gen life sim game with former <em>The Sims</em> director Grant Rodiek leading the project as executive producer.</p><p>According to the studio’s press release, this debut project “emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” The project doesn’t currently have a title or release date.</p><p>This new game will face stiff competition in the life-sim genre, which has been dominated by big-budget games like <em>The Sims 4</em> and smaller, indie outfits like <em>Stardew Valley</em>. Midsummer’s developers wrote that they want to give players the tools to tell their own stories, reminiscent of the popular trend of players using avatars created in <em>The Sims</em> and similar games to act out soap opera-style stories that are recorded and uploaded to social media.</p><p>Meanwhile, EA is already working on its next iteration of <em>The Sims</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870172/project-rene-next-gen-sims-free">a free-to-play title</a> dubbed “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23579786/the-sims-project-rene-multiplayer-solo-cross-platform">Project Rene</a>,” and former <em>Sims</em> and <em>Second Life</em> developer Rod Humble set up a new studio to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23658650/life-by-you-interview-rod-humble-sims-gdc-2023">the life-sim <em>Life by You</em></a>, which is due out on June 4th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="mpFq0m">The Sims is about to get even more competition. A new studio co-founded by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/1/31/3928710/making-of-xcoms-jake-solomon-firaxis-sid-meier">Jake Solomon</a>, the veteran game designer behind <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/1/24/3754534/xcom-enemy-unknown-review-blinded-by-science"><em>XCOM</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23484477/marvels-midnight-suns-review-release-date-characters-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x"><em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em></a>, will challenge Maxis’ enduring and dominant life simulation game series with a new, still-untitled game that focuses on “the drama of modern life.”</p>
<p id="rQz5Te">Joining Solomon at his new game company Midsummer Studios are co-founder Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis) and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23580081/the-sims-project-rene-development-update-multiplayer-playtest">ex-The Sims producer-director Grant Rodiek</a> (aka “SimGuru Grant”). Rodiek was previously game director on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23404750/sims-5-project-rene-announcement"><em>Project Rene</em></a>, Maxis’ in-development follow-up to <em>The Sims 4</em>. At least a half dozen other former Firaxis game developers who worked on the XCOM games and <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> are also now at Midsummer Studios.</p>
<p id="EIDP9H">“The best stories in games are written by the players,” Solomon said in a news release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”</p>
<p id="dRZWpC"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23604027/xcom-midnight-suns-director-jake-solomon-firaxis">Solomon left Firaxis in 2023</a>, after more than two decades at the studio. Shortly after his departure, he <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23650607/xcom-director-jake-solomon-leaves-firaxis-new-studio">expressed his interest in making a life-simulation game</a>.</p>
<p id="DW7xOM">Midsummer’s game is entering an increasingly crowded field that has been mostly dominated by Electronic Arts’ The Sims franchise. Promising competitors include <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23657952/life-by-you-paradox-sim-game-rod-humble"><em>Life By You</em></a>, an upcoming life sim from Paradox Interactive that’s being helmed by Rod Humble (<em>Second Life</em>, <em>The Sims 3</em>); <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23433566/sims-5-project-rene-paralives-life-sim"><em>Paralives</em></a>, the highly customizable indie “doll house” life sim; and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23814842/palia-singularity-six-cozy-mmorpg-impressions"><em>Palia</em></a>, a cozy life sim with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24115870/stardew-valley-8-years-later-concernedape"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a> vibes that’s currently in beta. </p>
<p id="puOY0W">EA and Maxis’ <em>Project Rene</em> (aka <em>The Sims 5</em>) does not have a release window, as developers behind the game say they plan to show off their progress and factor in community input for several years. <em>The Sims 4</em> launched in 2014 and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23352758/sims-4-free-to-play-release-date-future-content-support">went free to play in 2022</a>, reaching more than 70 million players over the past decade.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24152760/kim-kardashian-hollywood-glu-mobile-game-legacy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vkBIwD">Kim Kardashian was already more than a household name in 2013. The Kardashian name (hers, specifically) was equivalent with “celebrity” — or “notoriety,” depending on who was saying it. But there was one more step toward international fame that she wasn’t so sure about: whether she wanted to become a video game character.</p>
<p id="fEoajG">Niccolo de Masi, the CEO of Glu Mobile at the time, first approached Kardashian in early 2013 with the idea of starring in a video game. Kardashian took several months to think through the idea. In their second meeting, de Masi showed Kardashian the game’s art — and that was it.</p>
<p id="rWnV1g">“Nothing grabbed or hooked her as much as seeing what she would look like as a real-life video game” character, he said. The concept he pitched was a good fit, too. The game that would become <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em> was all about giving players a chance to literally mimic Kardashian’s ascent to mega-fame. And it probably didn’t hurt that her new husband seemed just as fascinated by the idea. “As Kanye used to say to me, ‘Niccolo, my wife is a real-life video game character,’” de Masi said. </p>

<p id="O0avLO">Given the Kardashian notoriety, <em>KKH</em> was immediately thrust into the spotlight when it was released in June 2014. Mere months before its debut, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/519032/kim-kardashian-reaches-20-million-followers-on-twitter-uses-kanye-west-rap-lyric-to-express-her-excitement-obvs">Kardashian surpassed 20 million followers on Twitter</a>. Her tweets about <em>KKH</em> meant an instant rush of downloads, so much so that the game would suddenly go down for a few hours, according to Chris Akhavan, Glu Mobile’s chief revenue officer at the time. “It was the worst feeling, because you have this megahit and it literally just stops working,” he said. “The amount of stress that was created for the team was tremendous.”</p>
<p id="RWjIPt">That stress led to huge success. In its first two years, <em>KKH</em> generated $160 million in revenue for Glu Mobile. The game continued to receive updates over the years — all the way until April 8, 2024, when Glu Mobile took it offline for good. It’s now hidden away on some Electronic Arts server, unavailable to the public.</p>

<p id="8ANiMW">EA had acquired Glu Mobile in 2021 for $2.4 billion. Three years later, the publishing giant <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24086077/electronic-arts-ea-layoffs-february-2024">laid off hundreds of staff</a> and announced that it was shutting down several of its mobile titles, including <em>KKH</em>. (Neither Glu Mobile nor Electronic Arts responded to multiple requests for comment.) The early 2024 announcement allowed <em>KKH</em> players several months to prepare, and gave the team at Glu Mobile the same period to wind down a game that was 10 years in the making.</p>
<p id="V52OLy">Kardashian declined to be interviewed for this story, but a representative pointed Polygon <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/01/03/kim-kardashian-mobile-game-shutting-down-decade-hollywood-app/">toward a statement she made in January</a>. “I’m so grateful from the bottom of my heart to everyone who has loved and played <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em> in the past 10 years,” she wrote. “This journey has meant so much to me, but I’ve realized that it’s time to focus that energy into other passions. I want to thank the Glu team and the many people behind the scenes who have worked diligently on making it a success. I will be forever inspired by this community that we built together.”</p>
<h2 id="M6NzfV"><strong>From stardom to Hollywood</strong></h2>
<p id="kq4xjM">Before <em>KKH</em>, there was <em>Stardom: The A-List</em> and its sequel,<em> Stardom: Hollywood</em>. Released in 2011 and 2013, respectively, the two free-to-play games were modest successes, but Glu Mobile believed that it could push the idea further. <em>Stardom: Hollywood</em> is essentially the basis of what <em>KKH</em> was built upon; the developers pulled its art style, closet, and robust systems into the celebrity-backed project. Kardashian was an obvious pick for a star to lead the game: Not only was she mega-famous and continuing to rise, but her life revolved around media — on red carpets, social platforms, and her hit reality TV show, <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em>.</p>
<p id="BjAqUi">“If you really want to talk about where the essence of <em>KKH</em> comes from, you have to look at the first Stardom game, when we were Blammo Games,” said Danny Zabbal, one of several Glu Mobile employees who saw things through from the beginning. (<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110802007126/en/Glu-Announces-Two-Strategic-Acquisitions-of-Game-Developers">Blammo Games was acquired by Glu Mobile</a> in 2011.) Zabbal was brought on to Blammo Games to help build what would become <em>Stardom: The A-List</em> by Laura Zajacz, who was art director at the time, and later the creative director of Glu Mobile. </p>

<p id="u3lyqp">The pitch for <em>Stardom: The A-List</em> was that it was a fashion game that didn’t take itself too seriously. More importantly, it had a customizable avatar with <em>tons</em> of clothing and accessory options.</p>
<p id="KDd61q">“I don’t want to toot my own horn, but in 2011 it was kind of a big deal to have a character that was totally customizable,” Zabbal said. “I think <em>Skyrim</em> had just come out, and we were blown away by the options. In those days, it was a really big deal to have this character that could sing and dance and check her nails and do all this stuff. She could wear a hoodie or a pillbox hat or stilettos.”</p>
<p id="VxnTBG">Zabbal blasted out a prototype in roughly a week, a version of the rig that would later be integrated into <em>KKH</em>. “By the time I left the studio, it was version 67 or something like that. It had been iterated and modified and added to and expanded throughout the entire life cycle of the studio. I’m pretty proud of that. That’s really where my contribution begins: I made the damn rig.”</p>
<p id="BqIHY9">In the early stages of <em>KKH</em>, it was Zajacz, again, who pulled Zabbal in alongside another artist, Stephen Headley. “She pulled us into the parking lot, and I was a smoker at the time, so I immediately lit up a cigarette,” Zabbal said. “We did some logistics there in the parking lot, and she was like, ‘Go team, go.’”</p>
<p id="kssnOh">That afternoon, Zabbal said, they worked on concept art. Headley drew Kardashian, and Zabbal illustrated a background, like Beverly Hills — “a postcard for the location,” which he described as not necessarily accurate, but a “lovely broad impression with a tight, cool palette.” </p>
<p id="Z4PLNT">This early art — Headley’s depiction of Kardashian — was what hooked Kardashian herself. “Kim said many times, ‘I saw that they really got me when I saw how they drew me,’” de Masi said.</p>

<p id="JPQSnC">Kardashian, of course, did not have her own desk at the Glu Mobile offices, but she did stop by the San Francisco location occasionally — one visit of which was featured in <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em>’ 10th season. Several developers who worked on the game said the working relationship with the reality superstar was as smooth as it looked on the show. Kardashian understood, the developers said, that the people at Glu Mobile were the experts, and she let them work their magic, whether that was related to the sorts of shoes that in-game Kim wore or the systems in the game.</p>
<p id="Sv2YyS">Kardashian also recorded hours and hours of voice lines for the game. <em>KKH</em> sound designer Aaron Tsang said Kardashian didn’t actually go into a studio to do it; she recorded her lines in massive, hourslong takes using equipment sent from Glu Mobile. Tsang was responsible for cutting and labeling these lines so they could get added into the game. “It was an eye-watering amount of editing,” he said. The team just left the mic running; Kardashian recorded the prewritten lines, but also some improv, making sure she sounded enough like herself.</p>

<p id="F6Lslv">Di Dan, a senior systems designer on <em>KKH</em>, said Kardashian was <em>very</em> easy to work with compared to other creative partners he’d encountered. “I didn’t interact with her personally, but we’d send her builds, and she or her people would send feedback to us,” he said. Zabbal added that he encountered very little resistance on the art side, just “manageable” feedback.</p>
<p id="rLKj7G">The team working on <em>KKH</em> was small at the start, because the “blueprint” of the game — the Stardom series — was already there, Dan said. The team wasn’t necessarily invested in Kardashian’s show or life; many of them said that after starting on the project, they began watching a lot of <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em> to learn about her world. Though not everyone expressed fondness for the development period in interviews with Polygon, lots of people did. Sure, the game was based on a person who could be polarizing, but it was a legitimately good game.</p>

<p id="SOdYKO">“I’m not going to say we were ridiculed in the studio, but a lot of people — mostly men — don’t necessarily sign up to be a game developer on the Kim Kardashian game,” Zabbal said. “There were jabs at our expense.”</p>
<p id="ppepMA">Dan added that he saw his own distance from the subject as actually being a good thing for development. He might not have been the expected audience, but he and the team respected the audience that the game <em>was</em> meant for. “That maybe actually made it easier,” Dan said. “Because when you’re working on something you absolutely love — like, if I was working on<em> World of Warcraft</em> back in the day, I would have had stronger personal opinions, which would make it harder for me to see the broader player perspective.”</p>
<h2 id="2VjmhB"><strong>Kardashian-as-a-service</strong></h2>
<p id="lnvvDu"><em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em> was not the first game to operate under the games-as-a-service model, but it was nonetheless an early example — perhaps before the term had even been coined. Games like <em>World of Warcraft</em> had been providing meaningful content updates and live operations for some time, but mobile games of the era were focused on smaller updates and on microtransactions. </p>
<p id="0BTW8W">“Back then, there was a lot more to figure out, because it was much newer,” Dan said. Part of that was the pace of updates. Akhavan said he underestimated the speed at which players would blast through content. “We were like, <em>Oh my god, we’re going to have to figure out how to create content 100 times faster than we thought we would have to</em>,” Akhavan said. “From both the perspective of scalability and making sure the game was up and running and operational, and then from a live operations and content perspective, the game was totally transformative for us.”</p>

<p id="b3WGIO">Andrew den Hertog, a game server engineer at Glu Mobile, helped with <em>KKH</em>’s live operations and back-end services to keep the game up and running — a big task for his first video game industry gig, he said, where he had to regularly support 100,000 concurrent users. “[<em>KK:H</em>] shaped how LiveOps [were] deployed by other apps,” den Hertog said. “The ability to release content without releasing updates to the app store was quite powerful, and I believe<em> KK:H </em>was one of the first apps that really capitalized on this.”</p>
<p id="zM1QPy">The development team had already been supporting the Stardom games for a while, but <em>KKH</em>’s success meant the pace of updates had to increase. The game launched in 2014 with a considerable amount of content extended by time restrictions — if you weren’t spending money, <em>KKH</em> cost time. But the nature of the game meant that there wasn’t really an end. Sure, you could reach the A-list, but the game forced you to keep playing to maintain your status there. Glu Mobile added new content consistently; the general types of updates spanned storylines and quests, clothing options, and systems. It was often grueling for the team to keep up with the Kardashians. The Kardashian tie-in — the fact that <em>KKH</em> was a game based on a real person’s life — meant that Glu could take inspiration from the show or from Kardashian’s life for updates. You’d frequently see Kardashian wearing something in real life, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KardashianHollywood/comments/t1swwm/kims_wedding_dress_that_featured_in_the_game/">then see it added to the game</a>.</p>
<p id="zaG0fC">Donny Meloche is one of several artists on <em>KKH</em> who, when he first started at Glu Mobile, largely worked on the game’s clothing. “All the research started from Kim,” Meloche said. “When the game first started, the way she styled herself and dressed — even just pop culture in general — was very different. The game and our research reflected her own fashion evolution, in a sense.”</p>
<p id="HthuJx">Narrative designer Josh Labelle, who came onto the team ahead of <em>KKH</em>’s pandemic resurgence, told Polygon that the art, in all its locations and clothing, was a huge part of the game’s success. “We would have showcases to look at all of the new outfits that were added, and my eyes would be watery every time looking at the creativity that the team brought to it,” Labelle said. He pointed to the dress that the player’s in-game manager, the very serious Simon, wore when he debuted as a drag queen named Miss Managed. “When we first created that dress Simon wore, our lead artist [Meloche] spent, like, three days doing all the stoning on the dress.”</p>

<p id="F4Bx9f">The clothing options eventually expanded into branded collaborations with the likes of Karl Lagerfeld and Roberto Cavalli, not only with re-creations of their clothes and accessories, but by building their brands into the storyline, too. Alanna Anderson, Glu Mobile’s head of brand partnerships at the time, said that brands were excited to try something new with <em>KKH</em>. “[Roberto Cavalli] actually launched a Viper sneaker in Kim’s game first,” she said. “There were only 60 available worldwide, and we sold out of that in under three hours.”</p>
<p id="xSKIEv">“Even just pop culture references — I remember the day ‘The Dress,’ the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/26/8118825/white-gold-dress-blue-black-what-color">blue and gold dress</a>, went viral, and they immediately put it into the game,” said Lián Amaris, former Glu Mobile director of content and community, to Polygon. “A big part of the magic was that it felt like you were involved in something that was bigger than the game.”</p>

<p id="c7xad2">Some of these clothing options were available to players for free, by earning one of several different in-game currencies. Dan, who worked on the game’s economy, told Polygon that Glu Mobile was always eyeing what players wanted, trying to predict whether they’d be willing to pay for something. He pointed to one scenario in which the audience surprised him: “There are questions like, ‘We have an animated purse that has a chihuahua in it, and an animated purse that has a kitten in it. Which do players want more?’” he said. “I thought it was chihuahuas, because back in that time, Paris Hilton was more relevant, and she was walking around with chihuahuas all the time.” The answer, though, was that people wanted the cats.</p>
<p id="agp4N2">Even more remarkable is that the team had to work within a restrictive, outdated system that had been in place since the Stardom franchise. “[<em>KKH</em>] was so far beyond the point — we’re not going to put it in new software; we’ve just got to keep it as is,” Meloche said. “The whole team was really able to innovate using outdated technology and still make it look incredibly current and relevant and exciting for people, even though we were super limited with what we could change.”</p>
<p id="BzwiOq">Meloche and Glu Mobile user experience designer Ravi Aujla both brought up a lack of body diversity in <em>KKH</em>, something that was a pain point for the community at times. Even adding gloves or a more intricate hairstyle was difficult. “Anytime you had to do that, it could potentially break the game when adding layers into Flash,” Meloche said. Aujla said the Electronic Arts acquisition was helpful in figuring out certain problems, like how to add better, more diverse skin tones with makeup that worked correctly on different skin. <em>The Sims 4</em> improved its skin tone options, and Aujla said the <em>KKH</em> team could look to Maxis to figure it all out. That skill sharing happened in reverse, too, he said — that Maxis looked at <em>KKH</em>’s wardrobe for inspiration and ideation.</p>

<p id="YzqVPS">Narratively, Labelle said he looked at <em>KKH</em> as an evolution of the soap opera. Instead of doing huge drops with a bunch of content to blast through, Glu turned more to daily experiences meant to be played in small doses as <em>KKH</em> evolved. “We would bring a cliffhanger approach to it, where at the end of each day, there would be a ‘tune in tomorrow’ message,” said Labelle, speaking of the team’s pandemic-era strategy. “We were all in a similar situation to what everybody else in the world was, and there was really this feeling of, <em>Let’s bring people something exciting to look forward to every single day with a little piece of story</em>.”</p>
<h2 id="6NyA6g"><strong>The real star wasn’t Kim — it was the player</strong></h2>
<p id="f4yRuV">The free-to-play mobile game bore the name of a reality TV superstar and billionaire businesswoman, but <em>KKH</em> was actually more about the player: You started as an E-list nobody in Los Angeles, and you were befriended by Kardashian on your ascent to A-list stardom. To get there, you had to work — book modeling gigs and acting jobs, show your face at the clubs, and date around. You’d buy homes and businesses, adopt pets, get married, and even have kids, if you pleased. As in other mobile games, the gameplay mostly consisted of swiping and tapping: tap to talk to Kardashian, tap to fix your makeup, tap to pose for a photoshoot, tap to flirt with the bartender, and tap to collect money and points. It wasn’t necessarily groundbreaking for <em>KKH</em> to be designed around making the player feel like the real star. What did make the game unusual among other wildly popular games was who it presumed that player to be: a person who likes girly stuff.</p>

<p id="taD8PA">It may seem tempting to write off a game like <em>KKH</em>, one that’s seemingly centered on the frivolity of capitalistic celebrity culture. And at the time, a lot of mainstream media <em>did</em> write it off. Because of the Kardashian name, <em>KKH</em> was immediately thrust into the mainstream, something that was quite rare for a casual, free-to-play game, especially one targeted at the largely ignored female gaming market. </p>
<p id="VsGL75">“When it first came out, there was a weird mix of derision and obsession that seemed to be happening simultaneously,” Shira Chess, author and associate professor of entertainment and media studies at the University of Georgia, told Polygon. Stephen Colbert infamously parodied the app, its business model, and Kardashian (lots of <em>but what does she do?</em>s) with his own mock game called <em>Stephen Colbert: I’d Tap That!</em> Meanwhile, the mainstream business press <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/07/30/technology/kardashian-app-game/">balked at the $200 million</a> that <em>KKH</em> was expected to bring in during its first year — not necessarily questioning how a game could make that much money, but how <em>this</em> game could. </p>
<p id="jN0NJo">Yet plenty of people who actually played <em>KKH</em> found it to be “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/07/why-the-kim-kardashian-game-is-legitimately-good.html">legitimately good</a>.” Not only did it have a fun gameplay loop and an impressive character customization menu, but it was largely self-aware; the developers created a game that was an intentional parody of celebrity culture. It was complex and genuinely engaging while also trying to extract something from the player, be it money or time. <em>KKH </em>both pushed away from and engaged with stereotypes of women, at once proving there was a market for “girl games” while also being stereotypically girly and pushing a beauty ideal. </p>
<p id="J3riqU">“At its core, the idea of games starting to be designed for audiences that weren’t white dudes in the 2010s was itself a move towards trying to think about games that could be other,” Chess said. “I wouldn’t say it’s exactly feminist design, but it certainly changed how people were thinking about games.”</p>

<p id="xkV8Is">Chess continued: “On the other hand, bodies were very limited to specific shapes and sizes. We were playing these games that centered materialism as the core purpose of being.” Chess said that games designed for women typically have one of a few things: some sort of emotional labor, time as labor, a consumerist pull, or a way to customize an avatar. <em>KKH</em> had all of them — and it worked.</p>
<p id="t3cxpV">It all worked because every decision felt like it made sense, both in terms of gameplay and within the <em>KKH</em> world. For a game about a social media superstar, <em>KKH</em>’s implementation of tapping the screen felt like an obvious gameplay mechanic because of Kardashian’s social media fame and because the game often had you doing simple tasks in order to raise your clout. The time-based restrictions also made sense — yes, they were a play for player retention, but they often created some tension for the game, too. Early on, you were often waiting for your manager to give you a call with news: Did you get the gig? <em>KKH</em> actually made you wait for that call.</p>
<p id="qBpafo">Amaris, in charge of social media and community, added that <em>KKH</em>’s social media integration was intrinsic to the spirit of the game and its fan base. “It was a built-in viral mechanism,” she said, and one of the ways in which <em>KKH</em> influenced the industry. It may not have been the first game to incorporate concepts like letting players assemble scenes in a photo booth, but its overall design had a major impact. “The rebranding of oneself in the style of a fandom is something that the game really pioneered digitally,” said Amaris. “The ease of that digital avatar being shared, and being this other version of yourself, was an incredible driver of the community and its success.”</p>

<p id="suYiOk">There was a lot of <em>KKH</em> that was clunky, or a little haphazard, Chess said. But there was a magic to the game and its little moments. “It’s a little burst of play that you get to fit into your life,” Chess said. You could look at the way it was designed as sexist — based on an assumption that women don’t have the interest or time to play games — but you can also see it as designed for a greater variety of people, such as parents, who don’t have much time for play. “It’s opening a space where people are like, <em>Oh, actually, I think I do like video games</em>,” Chess added.</p>
<p id="tnX16J"><em>KKH</em> made investors take a more serious look at casual video games, which are often marketed toward women, because the genre was suddenly seen as a huge moneymaker. <em>KKH</em> wasn’t the only game that influenced this, but it was a major player in that movement. Indeed, the success of <em>KKH</em> and other casual titles was key in the rapid expansion of the mobile game industry; <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/video-game-industry-revenues-by-platform/">according to data from Pelham Smithers</a>, a market research firm, mobile gaming has kept growing each year, leading to its revenue making up more than half the overall gaming industry’s total since 2019. The mobile game market, despite being underrepresented in media coverage, <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/video-game-industry-revenues-by-platform/">dominates when it comes to money made</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Z5NmuF"><strong>A lasting legacy</strong></h2>
<p id="NZJaL3">As soon as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24024266/kim-kardashian-mobile-game-shutting-down-glu-mobile">the game’s shutdown was announced</a> in early 2024, <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em> players began to prepare. By the time the last day arrived, they had finished scouring their closets for their finest black clothing — after all, there was a funeral to be held. On forums and social media, and in Facebook groups, players took to the runway one last time. “Leave looking snatched,” one forum user wrote, commenting on a bedazzled black gown that cuts right in at the waist. “Slaying at the funeral, but mad about it,” another wrote, alongside a screenshot of her tattooed doll dressed in a Victorian-era dress overlaid with black lace. If the girls were going out, they were doing it in style — a dramatic, flowing veil on their heads; a bouquet of dried black roses in their hands; and thigh-high platform boots on their feet.</p>

<p id="7hG8DI">Though several <em>KKH</em> players on the forums attempted to manifest the continuation of the servers, the game did indeed go offline on April 8, ending its nearly 10-year lifespan. The breadth of style on display during the game’s “funeral” is a testament to that legacy; there were thousands of pieces of clothing and accessories that players had spent just shy of a decade acquiring. </p>
<p id="teBmi9">Interest in the game had died down as the years went on, but <em>KKH</em> saw a resurgence during the pandemic, when people started to revisit their favorite game experiences. But now it’s gone, except for the YouTube Let’s Plays and photobooth Twitter posts. It’s not an experience unique to <em>KKH</em>, either, and the industry is still grappling with how to preserve online experiences like this.</p>

<p id="8rckQs">“When something like <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em> shuts down, it only ever can live on in memory, because it’s not something that, 20 years later, people will play again,” Chess said. “It speaks to how the industry thinks of AAA games versus casuals — that it doesn’t matter, because there’ll be another casual [game] in a few weeks that takes over everybody’s hearts and minds. But it did once take over people’s hearts and minds. And now it’s nowhere.”</p>
<p id="weov2V">The shutdown of <em>KKH</em> feels like when your favorite TV show goes off the air, but almost worse: You can still watch reruns of the show, but that’s not the case with a game like <em>KKH</em>. For the community, it’s been hard to find something to replace the experience. There are plenty of other fashion games, but nothing that checks all of <em>KKH</em>’s boxes. Some players refuse to delete the app, hoping for a miracle that one day it’ll come back online.</p>
<p id="IbIJAm">That’s unlikely, and so, in forums and Facebook groups, players are relegated to reliving their memories. And the game’s developers still have that, too.</p>
<p id="CHeWUC">“Now I have this weird thing in my life where, when I die, at my funeral, someone is going to give a eulogy and they’re going to mention Kim Kardashian,” Zabbal said. “That’s going to be so bizarre.” </p>

Of course, this could all change soon as we rapidly approach the summer showcase season where exciting new reveals will undoubtedly steal the headlines. Sony will, presumably, want something shiny to show alongside a potential unveiling of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-tells-developers-to-prepare-game-for-ps5-pro-release">the heavily rumored PS5 Pro</a>. But how many of those fresh announcements will actually be playable within the next six months is another question, though. My guess is very few.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p>Beyond this year’s upcoming Silent Hill 2 Remake, Death Stranding 2 in 2025, Bungie’s Marathon, and a couple of other first-party releases we’ll cover shortly, PlayStation’s cupboard is looking relatively bare, especially when it comes to games from those keystone PlayStation Studios. It begs the question of what each of these teams – those that helped build the PlayStation library into the strong place to play it is today – are up to now, and how long before we get to both see and play them. So let’s take a look at what each of those developers (not including support studios) are doing, and when we can realistically expect to see new games from them.</p><h2><u><strong>Naughty Dog</strong></u></h2><p>Arguably the jewel in the PlayStations Studios crown, Naughty Dog’s last full release was 2020’s The Last of Us Part 2. The Uncharted developer hasn’t been completely quiet since then, releasing both remastered versions of The Last of Us Part 1 (in collaboration with Iron Galaxy) and Part 2 as recently as this January. But Naughty Dog’s most notable recent announcement wasn’t a new launch, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">the cancellation of a multiplayer entry in the series</a> that the studio had spent many years on before deciding to turn its attention back to where its proven skills lie: single-player adventures. </p><p>In March 2023, co-studio head Neil Druckmann stated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dog-has-chosen-its-next-game-but-doesnt-confirm-the-last-of-us-part-3">the developer had chosen its next project</a> but didn’t confirm if it was The Last of Us Part 3 or something else. In the 14 months since we’ve heard very little, aside from a small tease in The Last of Us Part 2 making-of documentary where <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-teases-concept-for-the-last-of-us-part-3-theres-probably-one-more-chapter-to-this-story">Druckmann stated he has a “concept” in mind</a> and that there's "probably one more chapter to this story."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Could we see a reveal of this new project soon? Whether it’s a continuation of Ellie’s story, a return to Nathan Drake’s adventures, or something completely new entirely, I wouldn’t be too surprised to see an announcement this year, even if playing it is still a way off. The relatively short two-to-three-year gaps between Uncharted and The Last of Us games are long gone, sadly, with four already having passed since Naughty Dog’s last.</p><h2><u><strong>Santa Monica Studio</strong></u></h2><p>Santa Monica Studio released God of War Ragnarok to huge success in late 2022 and followed up with the surprisingly lengthy free Valhalla DLC in December of last year. However, what’s next for the studio is a mystery, although we do know Cory Barlog – game director of 2018’s God of War – <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-new-director-cory-barlog-unannounced-projects">moved on to helm a new project in 2021</a> after leaving Eric Williams to fill Ragnarok’s director seat. Little to nothing is known about that new project, but given it’s been in development for a number of years already it wouldn’t be beyond belief to see it revealed this year.</p><p>As for a new God of War game, well, we likely can’t expect that as quickly. Despite the gap between Ragnarok and its predecessor being only four years, the end of Kratos’ Norse saga signals a new direction for the series which, naturally, means it’ll require a lot more work from the ground up. We can hope, of course, but don’t expect to see everyone’s favourite angry dad any time soon. That said, we wouldn’t say no to a remake of the original trilogy…</p><h2><u><strong>Insomniac Games</strong></u></h2><p>Insomniac is arguably Sony’s most prolific studio, releasing either a Spider-Man or Ratchet and Clank game every couple of years for almost a decade now, most recently last year with the hugely successful Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. But in a worrying sign of the fragile state of the games industry, even a game of that magnitude <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close">couldn’t prevent layoffs</a> from occurring this year in what turned out to be a doubly damaging couple of months for the developer, following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more">a huge data breach and subsequent theft</a>.</p><p>The data theft revealed that the highly anticipated Wolverine game is not expected until 2026 at the earliest, but also that a Venom game may arrive before it in 2025. Either way, it’s highly unlikely Insomniac will be springing any surprise games this year, and after all the studio has gone through recently I think it's fair to allow it as much of a break as anyone.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u><strong>Sucker Punch Productions</strong></u></h2><p>Sucker Punch has been very quiet since 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima. Work is presumably underway on its next game but, truth be told, we have little idea what exactly that is. Common wisdom would suggest a direct sequel would be the most logical move due to the success of the first game, and a 2022 job listing might be a small clue towards this notion.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sucker-punch-job-listing-ghost-of-tsushima-2">A posting on the studio’s career page</a> looking for an Encounter Designer noted that responsibilities would include delivering “interesting and varied encounters in an open-world game, with a particular focus on melee combat and stealth”. This certainly suggests a return to Japan, but could easily also suggest (to an admittedly lesser extent) a new Infamous or Sly Cooper game, or something altogether different. The truth is we have no real idea, but let’s just hope that silence is broken soon.</p><h2><u><strong>Guerrilla Games</strong></u></h2><p>Guerrilla followed up 2022’s Horizon: Forbidden West with last year’s Burning Shores DLC as it continued to build out Aloy’s story. With the West Coast-set sequel ending on a cliffhanger, it’s not a stretch to expect the Amsterdam-based studio to be working on the third part of the trilogy next. We wouldn’t expect any news on that one soon however – the development time between Zero Dawn and Forbidden West was five years so we’re likely a little while away from seeing Aloy and her metal dinosaur friends again soon.</p><p>We do know that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-multiplayer-game-confirmed-by-guerrilla">a multiplayer Horizon game is currently in the works</a>, though, starring “a new cast of characters and a unique stylized look”. Perhaps this is something we can hope to see more of sooner rather than later, although this year may be a stretch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u><strong>Housemarque</strong></u></h2><p>Returnal brought Housemarque a level of mainstream appeal that had previously evaded the Finnish studio, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it returned to that world. However, that seemingly won’t be the developer’s next game as back in 2022 it confirmed it had started work on a new project that was in the “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/housemarque-returnal-sequel">early days with us starting a new game, a new IP.</a>” It’s currently unclear how the departure of Returnal director Harry Krueger – who had been at Housemarque for 14 years – has affected the development though. For now, this new game remains a mystery but maybe we’ll hear something soon.</p><h2><u><strong>Firewalk Studios</strong></u></h2><p>Firewalk is the first studio listed here to actually have a game (albeit tentatively) listed for a 2024 release. Revealed last May, Concord is a PvP multiplayer shooter with a retro-futuristic sci-fi aesthetic that can be gleaned from its CGI announcement trailer. But, we’ve heard practically nothing since. We’re hoping to see some gameplay soon, otherwise that 2024 date might start to look a little shaky.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u><strong>Haven Studios</strong></u></h2><p>Fairgame$ is set to be the first game from Jade Raymond’s Haven Studios and is a competitive heist game we’ve seen little of beyond a stylish CGI trailer. With no release window as yet, we’d be surprised to see it drop later this year – last November, Sony president Hiroki Totoki said it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">reducing the number of live service games</a> due for release before March 2026 from 12 to six. </p><p>With the continuing success of Helldivers 2, PSN/Steam hiccups aside, I’m sure PlayStation will look to learn the positive lessons from its development and apply them to future projects such as Fairgame$. The next step will be seeing a gameplay reveal, which is something we can realistically hope for this year. </p><h2><u><strong>Bend Studio</strong></u></h2><p>Bend has been pretty quiet since the release of Days Gone way back in 2019 but in 2022 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bend-studio-unannounced-project-logo-reveal">a few slithers of detail were revealed</a> about what the Oregon studio is currently working on. It shared that its new game will “build upon the open-world systems of Days Gone” but won’t be announced until “the time is right”. Apart from knowing it won’t be a continuation of Deacon St. John’s story, we really know nothing. Enough time has passed, though, that hopefully new info isn’t too far away.</p><h2><u><strong>Media Molecule</strong></u></h2><p>Media Molecule spent most of the past decade working on Dreams, the game creation and curation project that was released in 2020. But as a result of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dreams-developer-media-molecule-reportedly-suffers-round-of-layoffs">significant layoffs at the studio earlier in 2024</a>, live support for the game will soon end as MM aims to ensure “Dreams transitions into a self-sustaining platform”. There has since been no news on what the developer’s next project will be.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u><strong>Team Asobi</strong></u></h2><p>Team Asobi has brought everyone’s favourite little robot, Astrobot, to both traditional and VR platformers for the entirety of its 12-year existence. Previously part of Japan Studio, in 2021 it became a standalone studio following the success of PS5 launch game, Astro’s Playroom. What’s next though is yet to be revealed, but in 2022 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-developer-is-working-on-its-biggest-ever-game">studio director Nicolas Doucet revealed</a> it would be Asobi’s “biggest to date."</p><p>This is one we could theoretically see soon as plenty of time has passed since the developer’s last release and we know development has been in the works for multiple years now. Hopefully, the long-rumored PS5 Pro would be a perfect place for Asobi to replicate the success of Astro’s Playroom as a technical showcase for a new console that was also incredibly fun. Fingers crossed we get a reveal this year at the very least.</p><h2><u><strong>Bluepoint Games</strong></u></h2><p>Following the success of both the Shadow of the Colossus and Demon’s Souls remakes, Sony acquired Bluepoint Games as a first-party studio in 2021. We don’t know what its first project since joining the PlayStation Studios family is, though, but we do know that the developer has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-bluepoint-next-game-playstation-exclusive">expressed its desire to create an original game</a>, rather than reimagining another classic. Perhaps we could see a reveal this year.</p><h2><u><strong>Polyphony Digital</strong></u></h2><p>Polyphony has been making Gran Turismo for 25 years now so it would certainly be a shock to see it veer from that path in the near future. Having only released GT7 less than two years ago, it’s unrealistic to expect anything new from the racing masters any time soon. Let’s come back to this when the PlayStation 6 arrives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><u><strong>San Diego Studio</strong></u></h2><p>Similarly, San Diego is well established as the MLB The Show studio. This year’s entry only dropped in March, so we can expect to see another next Spring if history is anything to go by.</p><h2><u><strong>Firesprite</strong></u></h2><p>Having recently focussed on VR games, Firesprite most recently developed Horizon: Call of the Mountain for PSVR 2. What’s next is anyone’s guess, however. A new VR game would be the educated guess, but given Sony’s lack of commitment to creating games for its second headset, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the UK studio pivot to something more traditional. </p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-owned-dev-firesprite-reportedly-suffered-from-a-toxic-culture-fresh-report-claims">With recent reports of layoffs and unrest</a> at the developer, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-cancels-twisted-metal-live-service-game-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">a live-service Twisted Metal game was reportedly canceled</a>, with the studio supposedly working on a new PlayStation game called Project Heartbreak. Details are thin on what this is though, and when we can expect to see it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That’s everything we know about upcoming first-party PlayStation games, and the truth is very few release dates look to be coming up quickly. Of course, this can and likely will change soon, and with GTA 6 looming on the horizon in 2025, it does make sense that many publishers are waiting for Rockstar to make the first move when picking a window. That said, that doesn’t prevent 2024 from still looking relatively empty when it comes to PS5 exclusives. Let’s hope that after a summer of reveals the outlook will look a lot brighter, not only for players waiting for new games to play, but for the developers who work so hard to deliver them to us.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy wouldn't love nothing more than another adventure with his little Astro Bot friend.

As a producer on <em>The Sims</em> myself nearly twenty years ago, I am well acquainted with the power that meaningful player-driven stories can unlock. I also have an abiding respect for how hard it is to deliver the alchemy of community, systems design, gameplay, and user generated content necessary to do so. The Midsummer founders are industry veterans with the rare experience and design artistry required to deliver against this massive opportunity. I am delighted to join the board and support their journey to redefine the life sim category.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>The game developers of X {formerly Twitter) have been purposefully introducing glitches into their games this week, just to see what would happen--and the results are hilarious. Challenged with multiplying a random value from their game files by 1,000, multiple game devs have posted varied results including giant enemies, floods of spawned items, and super-powerful attacks.</p><p>The trend was started by developer Tyler Glaiel, who is currently working on Mewgenics. Glaiel shared a GIF that showed the game with massively increased gore splatter, and then <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerGlaiel/status/1788362032699555985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenged other</a> developers to post similar results from their own games in development.</p><p>It's not uncommon for these kinds of bugs to happen unintentionally during game development, when a developer accidentally enters one too many or too few zeros in a data field, but making them happen on purpose can be just as fun.</p><p>We've gathered some of our favorite takes on the prompt, though the post's quotes are filled with many more examples of mostly indie developers' funniest intentional bugs. One popular approach was to increase the number of items spawning from a specific event, though not all the devs' machines appeared to keep up with the huge number of spawns.</p><p>Some devs increased the distance an ability could work from, while others went straight to giving characters super strength by multiplying the force of an attack.</p><p>Of course it's hard to go past making random characters and objects super big or super tiny, though my favorite take on the prompt has to be indie darling Cult of the Lamb's ultra-chaos mode.</p>

After that brief stint, PlayStation is tackling the CEO position with two figures, each with different focuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hulst has been appointed CEO of SIE's Studio Business Group while Nishino has been appointed CEO of SIE's Platform Business Group. Totoki, now through as interim CEO, will serve as a Chairman of SIE in addition to returning to his role as COO and CFO of Sony Group Corporation. Both Nishino and Hulst will report to Totoki.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCQMHjDAJZU" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"Sony Interactive Entertainment is a dynamic and growing business that delivers incredible entertainment experiences through the connection of content and technology," Totoki writes in a press release. "These two leaders will have clear responsibilities and will manage strategic direction to ensure the focus remains on deepening engagement with existing PlayStation users and expanding experiences to new audiences."</p>

<p>Nishino was the senior vice president of PlayStation's Platform Experience Group, "responsible for developing the experiences and technology with PlayStation products and services," including the PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR2, and PlayStation Network. Sony says in his new CEO position, he will continue to be responsible for technology, products, services, and platform experiences. He will also oversee third party publisher and developer relations and commercial operations, including sales and marketing of hardware, services, and peripherals, the press release reads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We will continue to connect players through world-class products, services, and technology," Nishino writes. "We always strive to grow our community even bigger with innovation in every area at Sony Interactive Entertainment. I am honored to be appointed such an important role alongside Hermen. By working more closely together, we will be positioned to build incredible experiences for an ever-expanding audience now and in the future."&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq4XNbH6mtk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Hulst was the senior vice president and PlayStation Studios head, responsible for "developing content across many devices including PlayStation consoles and PCs, and bringing video game IP to new mediums such as film and television through PlayStation Productions." As CEO, Hulst will be responsible for the development, publishing, and business operations of first party content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am thrilled to lead the studio business group and continue to build on our success with PlayStation 5, while preparing for the future," he writes in the press release. "The video game industry is one of the largest entertainment industries in the world and has been built on the marriage of content and technology, and I look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of play and entertainment."</p>

<p>Totoki says in a separate <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/a-message-from-hiroki-totoki-a-new-era-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/">blog post</a> that later this month, players will "learn more about the long-term vision for Sony Group and the essential role SIE plays in that vision," hinting that the company might have some kind of event happening in May. He adds, "[Fiscal Year 2024] marks the start of the Mid-Range Plan period for Sony Group in which we will set the course for sustainable growth."&nbsp;</p>

Here's my little writeup I put in the topic on the steam forum (where the bug was first reported):</p><p>The little mushroom boys won't talk to anyone from France.<br>The little mushroom boys will shout at anyone from Germany.<br>The little mushroom boys will shun anyone from Sweden.<br>The little mushroom boys will berate anyone from Spain.<br>And so on. Anyone have any guesses?</p><p>What happened was: in some places in the game, we have config settings stored as text. The trigger distance for the little mushroom boys is one of these config settings, one value per boy.</p><p>Unlike other places in the game, these distances are fractional values - "0.4" for example.</p><p>In the UK, we write our numbers like this: 1,234.56 (meaning one thousand, two hundred and thirty four point five six).</p><p>However in France, Sweden and others, they would write 1 234,56<br>In Germany, Spain and others, its 1.234,56</p><p>Under the hood, in the code that takes the mushroom boy trigger range text - "0.4" - and turns it into a number for the rest of the code to use, the default is to use the number style native to the computer the game is running on.</p><p>So on French computers, "0.4" turns into 0, since it doesn't know what to do with the "." or anything after it.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fallout 4 Next Gen Update Comparison</p>
      </div>
<p>The settings will now allow players to choose a frame-rate target no matter what mode they're in, selecting between 30fps, 60fps, or 40fps if their display supports 120hz. The game will try to maintain that frame-rate target whether players choose Visuals or Performance mode for graphics, though Bethesda strongly recommends selecting Performance mode for a target of 60fps. "Both modes may adjust internal resolution dynamically when scenes or action get heavier," the patch notes warn.</p><p>A number of bug fixes are shipping with the patch, including a fix for some UI issues in the PC's new ultrawide mode, Auto HDR being re-enabled on Xbox, and fixes to bugs that were causing crashes on some platforms. Some bugs still remain, however, and the update may have re-broken mods that were patched since the previous update.</p><p>The full patch notes can be found below:</p><h2>UPDATE VERSIONS</h2><ul><li>Xbox Series S|X: 1.10.765</li><li>PlayStation 5: 1.10.985</li><li>PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One: 1.10.984</li></ul><h2>PATCH HIGHLIGHTS</h2><h3><u>Xbox Series S|X and PlayStation 5 Display Settings</u></h3><p>Thanks to your feedback, we’ve been able to implement the ability to control your graphic fidelity and performance. We highly recommend you run with the default settings but now you can change your options to better fit your playstyle and display.</p><h3><u>Frame Rate Target</u></h3><p>Frame Rate Target allows you to choose between 30, 40, and 60 (default). It is important to note that to select 40, your display must be able to support 120hz.</p><h3><u>Visual and Performance Prioritization</u></h3><p>You can now choose between Visuals and Performance (default) while trying to maintain frame rate target. If you choose Frame Rate Target of 60, we recommend selecting Performance. Both modes may adjust internal resolution dynamically when scenes or action get heavier.Please note both modes can only be changed from the main menu.</p><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><ul><li>General stability improvements</li><li>Fixed visual issue with certain imagespaces</li><li>Auto HDR is re-enabled (Xbox Series S|X)</li><li>Fixed issue where reserved space was not displayed correctly in load order menu (Xbox Series S|X)</li><li>Fixed issue with character name field when in widescreen mode. (PC)</li><li>Fixed an issue that occasionally caused bundles to not fully download and could cause a crash</li><li>Fixed an issue with material swaps</li><li>Fixed an issue with load order that would break DLC until a restart after downloading mods (PlayStation 5)</li><li>Fixed an issue that would occasionally cause a crash if you returned to the Main Menu with queued mods still downloading (PlayStation 5)</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause the Creation Club menu to not appear (Microsoft Store)</li><li>Fixed a crash that could occur when connecting to the network after a suspend/resume with the network disabled (Xbox One)</li></ul><h2>CREATIONS FIXES</h2><ul><li>Fixed missing art issue with certain Creations</li></ul>

<p data-characters="201" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant </em>is Ubisoft’s answer to <em>Call of Duty</em>, but while the world’s biggest FPS is available on Steam, will the new challenger to the throne be on PC’s top gaming platform at launch? </p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">For console players, downloading a game is easy. There’s only one store to get them from, so you simply go to it, search for your desired title, and let it get to work. On PC, there are plenty of platforms for games to release on, including Steam, Epic Games Store, and many more. </p> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">While competition can be a good thing, it can be a little annoying if you can’t download the title you want on the platform you use most often. It can be especially frustrating if a game is released on a random app that you never use. Unfortunately, that’s the case with <em>XDefiant</em>. </p>

 <h2 data-injectable="false">What PC platform will <em>XDefiant</em> launch on?</h2> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false"><strong><em>XDefiant</em> will be exclusive to Ubisoft Connect on PC. </strong>This was the same for the open betas and server tests, but players had hoped that the full release would be on Steam, as that’s where most PC gamers can be found. </p> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any plans to bring the game to Valve’s client either, so I’d suggest downloading Ubisoft Connect now if you want to play the FPS. </p>

			<p>Crimson Desert might be nearing its release window at long last. The game was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by Pearl Abyss (the South Korean developer behind Black Desert) at G-Star 2019 alongside DokeV and PLAN 8.</p>
<p>At that time, Crimson Desert <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was meant to feature MMO elements</a>, but Pearl Abyss later <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched genre</a> to open world action/adventure with multiplayer support, focusing far more on the narrative. However, in July 2021, the game's development encountered yet another roadblock as the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">postponed it indefinitely</a> with the following statement:</p>
<p><em>We are currently hard at work developing Crimson Desert, which is rapidly evolving with new adventures and exciting experiences. However, we have decided that we need to dedicate more time to adding new ideas for an even deeper, more enriching game. Therefore, in order to create the best possible experience, all the while ensuring the health and safety of everyone involved in delivering the game, we have decided to delay Crimson Desert's release. We will provide an updated schedule in the future.</em></p>
<p>Pearl Abyss allowed the game to re-emerge with a gameplay trailer at Gamescom 2023. Now, <a href="https://twitter.com/ignusthewise/status/1790304672399376624?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to leaker Lunatic Ignus</a>, Crimson Desert will be playable at Gamescom 2024 and its full launch is slated for early 2025. This lines up with the latest Pearl Abyss financial report, where the company said it is now time to kick off marketing.</p>
<p>The leaker also claimed that the Pokémon-like DokeV will be released within a year of Crimson Desert. Even PLAN 8, the exosuit MMO shooter designed by Counter-Strike's Minh Le that has been missing in action since G-Star 2019, will be released shortly after DokeV.</p>
<p>Needless to say, these should be considered rumors for the time being. However, we likely won't have to wait long to see them confirmed or denied. Meanwhile, stay tuned on Wccftech.</p>

That’s more than any other financial year since the console went on sale in November 2020.</p><p>However, PS5 narrowly missed Sony’s sales target of 21 million, itself revised down from its initial, ultra aggressive sales target of 25 million. PS5 sold 4.5 million units in the fourth quarter of the financial year, down from 6.3 million during the same quarter the prior year.

Countering this, however, is the expected negative impact of a decrease in sales of first-party titles. Sony has indicated no new games from its major franchises will be released during the current financial year, ruling out new titles in the Spider-Man and God of War franchises.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p>However, the number of monthly active users across PlayStation in March 2024 "remained high" at 118 million accounts, up 9% year-on-year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ps5-barely-missed-its-sales-target-in-latest-earnings-report-and-sony-expects-to-sell-even-less-by-next-year/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ps5-barely-missed-its-sales-target-in-latest-earnings-report-and-sony-expects-to-sell-even-less-by-next-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="352" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As part of Sony’s financial earnings for the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2024, it was confirmed PlayStation 5 sales were up compared to the previous year, with lifetime sales even crossing the 59 million mark. Yet the console still wound up failing to meet Sony’s targets and it doesn’t seem they’re going to get any better.</p> <p data-characters="692" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">Sony <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared its earnings on May 14</a>, revealing the PS5 sold 20.8 million units from last April to March. The year before, it managed 19.1 million units so that is still an improvement. I personally find that pretty impressive considering Sony hasn’t had any major first-party exclusives in the past year aside from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-marvels-spider-man-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man 2</a></em> and the updated remaster of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part 2</a></em>. In terms of games, it’s had to rely on third-party fare like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-xvi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 16</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a></em>, though Sony has <em>Helldivers 2</em> to thank most of all. It’s easily been the company’s biggest success story in the last 12 months, even becoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever-made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fastest-selling PlayStation game ever</a>.</p>

Sony also predicts hardware sales to drop even further by next March, saying during a webcast it’s set a new sales target of 18 million units (via <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/sony-net-profit-dips-on-year-but-beats-estimate-3ef5a49a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Barrons</a>). While such a drop sounds scary, the PS5 is nearly four years old now and in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-says-the-ps5-is-entering-the-latter-stage-of-its-life-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latter half of its life-cycle</a>, so declining sales are to be expected. <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sony.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Elsewhere in the results</a>, Sony adds that reduced hardware sales should be partially off-set by “an expected increase in sales of non-first-party titles including add-on content.”</p>
 <p data-characters="529" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">Given Sony’s first-party output is once again looking awfully scarce, it’s no wonder it’s reliant on third-party titles to help it out. There is chatter of Sony holding a summer showcase, which could be home to some major game announcements to excite the user-base. Sony president Hiroki Totoki may have even hinted at such a showcase, writing in <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/a-message-from-hiroki-totoki-a-new-era-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a letter to employees</a>, “Later this month you will learn more about the long-term vision for Sony Group and the essential role SIE plays in that vision.”</p>
 <p data-characters="528" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="false">There are also rumours of a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ps5-pro-leaks-rumors-release-window-specs-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro</a>, which is expected to be even more powerful than the current model, though how profitable that could be remains to be seen. I can’t imagine such a console would be particularly affordable, and may only appeal to a particular sub-section of PlayStation fans. Regardless, with the only first-party title scheduled for 2024 being <em>Concord</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/shinobi602/status/1790282822957064226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Shinobi602 on Twitter</a>), which is yet another live-service game, I am very curious to see how things pan out for PlayStation in the coming months. </p>

			<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is among the few games whose visuals were not downgraded over its original reveal. On the contrary, they have been improved considerably.</p>
<p>A new early comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> highlights how much the visuals of the second entry in the series by Ninja Theory have improved since its original reveal back in 2021. While some of the changes may not have been for the better, such as the changes made to volumetric fog and lighting, it is undeniable how the game generally looks better now than it did in 2021, even in the compressed footage used for the comparison.</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua's Saga: Hellblade II - 2021 vs 2023 vs 2024 Early Graphics Comparison | PC | Xbox Series X" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAFlHYZakH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Great visuals come at a cost, and to enjoy Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II at 60 frames per second and above, players will need to get the PC version and have an appropriately powerful machine <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-pc-system-requirements/">capable</a> of pushing high framerates. The Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S versions will only run at "cinematic" 30 frames per second, although a 60 FPS mode may get implemented at a later time, as it happened with Redfall and will<a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-update-1-11-33-60fps-40fps-uncapped-xbox-series-x-improved-maps/"> soon happen with Starfield.</a></p>
<p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II launches on May 21st on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

As Arrowhead worked to fix these launch issues, player numbers continued to grow, with Helldivers 2 becoming one of the most-played games on Steam with a peak of 458,709 concurrents. Sony does not divulge PS5 concurrent player numbers.</p><p>Since then, Arrowhead has butted heads with Sony over the Helldivers 2 IP owner and publisher’s decision to force PC players to link their accounts to PlayStation Network in order to continue playing. Sony eventually backed down, although not before a Steam review bombing campaign that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review-bomb-cape-seemingly-teased-by-arrowhead-ceo">looks set to become the inspiration for a new in-game cape</a>.</p><p>Helldivers 2’s breakout success will no-doubt encourage Sony to release more of its multiplayer-focused video games on PC and PS5 at the same time. Currently, it continues to release its single-player games on PS5 first, before eventually making their way to PC. It may also encourage Sony to consider releasing more games at a budget price, given Helldivers 2’s success at $39.99. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> — a new PVP multiplayer FPS from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC in 2024 — may follow suit.</p><p>Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt reacted to the news in a post on X / Twitter, saying: “it’s crazy to think that there are more Helldivers than there are Swedes.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!</p><p>It's crazy to think that there are more Helldivers than there are Swedes 🤯</p><p>What a massive achievement from everyone involved in realizing <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Helldivers2</a>. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…</p></div>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1790300010401104124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Arrowhead is expected to be planning to add more content to Helldivers 2 over the course of 2024, with vehicles and a third enemy faction expected to arrive at some point.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/pokemon-go-is-adding-necrozma-and-fusions-but-some-players-just-want-their-old-avatars-back/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pokemon-go-is-adding-necrozma-and-fusions-but-some-players-just-want-their-old-avatars-back<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="336" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Niantic had already unsubtly teased it, but the legendary Necrozma is officially on its way to <em>Pokémon Go</em>, along with a new fusion mechanic. While there’s still excitement among players for Necrozma’s inclusion, a quick glance at fan responses shows some people would rather Niantic prioritise reverting its avatar changes.</p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">Niantic shared details on Necrozma via <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1790064551133589745" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a May 13 Twitter post</a>, and yet the very first response was a plea for the studio to “Revert the avatars.” Once you get past the first lot of reactions from blue check users, the replies turn into a barrage of similar demands requesting Niantic undo its big avatar update. Even after that initial wave of comments peters out, you can still catch other such replies in-between ones that are actually related to Necrozma’s inclusion.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Revert the avatars pls 🙏</p>— Bottle Cap Coins (@bottlecapcoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/bottlecapcoin/status/1790064919368335512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="644" data-current-count="944" data-injectable="true">Last month, Niantic rolled out an update to <em>Pokémon Go</em> players’ avatars, adding new and more detailed customisation options, such as adjustable body weights, eye colors, and skin tones. To call the update unpopular would be an understatement, with practically the entire player-base lambasting it for making their avatars uglier. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1c6k4oh/it_just_happened/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit thread</a> from April is chock full of harsh criticisms, with some calling it a late April Fools joke. Among the top comments are complaints of how pale avatars look, to the point where they’re described as “anemic,” as well as how everyone now sports a “baggy crotch.”</p>
 <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">Not long after the update’s arrival, fan site <a href="https://pokemongohub.net/post/news/niantic-has-acknowledged-your-and-our-feedback-on-the-new-avatar-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Go Hub</a> claimed to have been contacted by a Niantic representative who said the company was accepting feedback and “taking this seriously.” However, they added Niantic didn’t promise it would make any further changes or revert the update, and the company doesn’t seem to have commented on the avatars since then. Until it does, I expect any future <em>Pokémon Go</em> content announcements will continue to be met with cries for a U-turn on the avatar customisation.</p>
 <p data-characters="769" data-current-count="769" data-injectable="true">As for what Niantic is actually talking about, Necrozma will initially only be available in five-star raids during in-person <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pokemon-go-fest-tickets-dates-prices-and-how-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Pokémon Go</em> Fest 2024</a> events, though there will be a global event later in the summer anyone can participate in regardless of location. Necrozma is an especially unique Pokémon since it can fuse with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/which-cosmoem-evolution-is-better-in-pokemon-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">either Solgaleo or Lunala</a> to take on one of two forms: Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma. To do this, you need a certain amount of Necrozma and Cosmog Candy as well as one of two new resources: 1,000 Solar Energy for fusing with Solgaleo or 1,000 Lunar Energy for fusing with Lunala. Both resources will become available by completing certain research tasks, or by defeating Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma in raid battles.</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="false">You can find a more detailed breakdown on Necrozma and its forms on the <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/dusk-mane-dawn-wings-necrozma-fusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official <em>Pokémon Go</em> website</a>, but it’s not the only new addition coming to the game either. Three more of the Ultra Beasts—Naganadel, Stakataka, and Blacephalon—will become available for capture during an Ultra Space Wonders event. Said event will run from May 23 to May 28, and you can read more about it on <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/ultra-space-wonders-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Niantic’s website</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Getting new games to play is always exciting, but is there anything better than not having to pay for them? I don’t think so, and clearly neither do you, that’s why you’re wondering if <em>XDefiant</em> is free to play. The good news is that I have the answer you’re looking for. </p> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">After numerous <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-release-date-and-delays-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays</a>, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-release-date-and-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countdown to <em>XDefiant</em></a> is finally on, as we’ll finally get our hands on Ubisoft’s <em>Call of Duty</em> competitor on May 21. If you want to play the new <em>CoD</em> release every year, you’ll have to shell out some of your hard-earned cash for the experience, but over the years, we’ve seen free-to-play games like Fortnite and Apex Legends take a foothold in the shooter market. </p>

            <p>A while back Ubisoft revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-is-finally-heading-to-feudal-japan-plus-one-with-blair-witch-vibes">about a billion Assassin's Creed projects</a>. The first of these to leap into the carefully placed haystack of release was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage/">Mirage</a>, which I liked. Up next, it seems, is the artist formally known as Assassin's Creed: Codename Red. All we knew about red was that it would be set in feudal Japan, something fans have been clamouring for for literal years. Now we know that it's an AC game set in feudal Japan called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and it's getting an "official cinematic world premiere trailer" debut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovkzbtYBC8">on YouTube tomorrow</a>, at 5pm BST.</p>
<p>Also, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The text is gone now, but a couple of screencaps made their way into the wild (h/t <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-seemingly-leaked-by-ubisoft-in-its-own-trailer-placeholder/">GamesRadar</a>). Lending credence to this possible date are the facts that a) we already knew Shadows was supposed to come out before the end of the financial year - so, by March 2025, and b) every single main AC game has come out in November or October.</p>
<p>Shadows is supposedly going to be another full-sized AC game in the vein of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Valhalla</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Odyssey</a>'s massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open worlds</a>, which means you will probably see me screaming about it needing to be smaller and less full of busywork. Mirage was smaller but it was still big! And it was really fun!</p>
<p>Anyway. Personal bugbears aside, I wouldn't expect too much from the cinematic trailer, partly because it's a cinematic trailer, which means nothing for what the game will actually be like, but also because I'd predict bigger reveal-sauce will be saved to spray all over Geoff Keighley's eager face at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest</a> in June. I am actually excited for this game, by the way, I really like Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>Also worth keeping an eye on is any news about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-infinity">Assassin's Creed Infinity</a>, a sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-infinity-still-exists-is-still-a-confusing-assassins-creed-live-service-maybe">Assassin's Creed-specific hub... launcher... thing</a>. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">an interview with Eurogamer</a> in 2022, chief Assassin's Creed man Marc-Alexis Coté said the plan is for Infinity to arrive alongside Shadows. Is that still the plan? Who knows!</p>
<p>Remember to check back on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovkzbtYBC8">that YouTube video</a> after work tomorrow to see a dramatic trailer with all action music and silhouettes and that.</p>

            <p>Square Enix is reportedly preparing to lay off an unconfirmed number of workers as part of restructuring efforts.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/">VGC</a>, staff were said to have been informed during an internal meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>According to those in attendance, Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu said teams in America and Europe would be affected over the next month, mainly in its publishing, IT, and indie divisions.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Square Enix for further comment.</p>
<p>In the company's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-embarking-on-aggressive-multiplatform-strategy-as-profits-drop-70">quarterly financials published yesterday</a>, Square Enix announced its plans to implement a new strategy following a disappointing financial year after many titles "failed to live up to profit expectations, especially outsourced titles and some AAA titles."</p>
<p>This will involve "rebuild[ing] its overseas business divisions from the ground up" and "structural reforms" to optimise costs at its European and American offices.</p>

        <p>A Nordic publishing veteran is using a data-centric approach in a bid to re-invent video games publishing, and early results suggest he’s onto something</p>

            <p>One need only take to their social media platform of choice to gauge the popularity of publishers among modern gamers. Some are bemoaned for crippling previously successful studios with the imposition of unwanted live service models, while others are lamented for implementing unpopular matchmaking algorithms that prioritise retention over connection quality or fair team composition. Certainly, while most big studios can boast of healthy fan support (look at the devotion enjoyed by From Software or Larian Studios, for instance), you don’t come across many vocal EA or Ubisoft fanboys.</p>
<p>Of course, in reality publishers play a vital role in promoting both the success and therefore financial health of the creative forces that make the video game industry what it is. However, it is fair to argue that, at a time when the AAA model that has ruled the roost for decades is under more threat than ever opportunities await for those who strive to evolve.</p>
<p>Sebastian Bastani is a AAA publishing veterans, having left a successful career in food to pursue his love of games, eventually heading up Activision Blizzard’s Nordic sales operations. Following a further fruitful three years at Funcom, for the last year he and the Re-koup team have been going it alone in pursuit of what Bastani describes as what “publishing as it should be”.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The whole concept of Re-koup is to rethink the relationship between the publisher and the studio."</p></blockquote>
<p>Lamenting the trappings that come with working for a large company, the Re-koup founder explains: “I love to execute things. I love to be where it happens. I want to be there at the forefront negotiating good game deals, or evaluating partnerships, or making decisions that promote positive change.” Escaping the transatlantic bureaucracy of international publishing means he is finally free to make educated, data-led decisions that, instead of being imposed by a remote parent, are born from both many years of experience and an understanding of the surprisingly simple techniques studios of any size can exploit to improve the success of their new and back catalogues.</p>
<p>Of course, the best part of a decade at one of the world’s largest publishers does come with its perks. Not only does it provide a contacts book which opens more doors than most, but it also means your bar for success is a high one. “Working on those kinds of titles, you always have to think big,” Bastani adds. “The targets are so high and the impact has to be enormous every time. Even though we now work with smaller budgets, we maintain that ‘think big’ approach.”</p><figure>

<p>“Along with that passion for business is also a passion for change. The whole concept of Re-koup is to rethink the relationship between the publisher and studio. Look at the music industry, which has many synergies with games. The games industry is basically now on the same digital journey that changed music. How artists get their music out there and get paid has been a major discussion, but looking at games, we still essentially have traditional publishers doing the same thing they’ve always done. We need to change this; we need to do something totally different, something that puts the studio first. I mean, developers are our songwriters and performers. As an industry, we need to place the focus back on our creators.”</p>
<p>Re-koup was established with the ability to help studios at many points along the development process. The firm acts like an in-house publishing team, promoting both the IP and the studio.It is not only the IP that sell games it´s also the consumer perception of the studio’s brand and creditability</p>
<p>Its network of investment partners can help finance exciting concepts, while Bastani knows all there is to know about launching a game. But of course, it doesn’t end there – even if a game has shipped and its makers have long since moved onto to other things, a world of potential success remains for the taking if studios let the data guide their way.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We know for a fact that lifecycle management can have a huge impact."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“When seeking investment, you can go to a VC and give up a lot of equity, partly losing some control of your company, or you can go to a publisher that probably wants to take your IP and have a controlling stake in the game design,” Bastani argues. “So no matter what, you either lose part of your company or you lose a lot of creative freedom. Our private investors are thinking about just one thing – is this a good investment? Can I double or triple my money if I invest? The art of making games is not something they’d pretend to know about.”</p>
<p>This is Re-koup’s fundraising and self-publishing service, where they green light a pitch and the rest is up to the studio, giving the team 100% creative freedom while having Re-koup in the background as their own in-house publishing team.</p>
<p>Another service the firm offers is around long-tail revenue for a game that has already been released. For this, Re-koup will only take a share of the additional sales it generates. When a partnership is struck, an agreement of a title’s anticipated base sales is made, created from a thorough analysis of sales patterns and market conditions. Re-koup then takes its share of any additional revenue beyond this baseline. If for whatever reason it fails to increase sales as forecast, then Re-koup gets no money at all. The deal is essentially risk free for studios, who are only surrendering a small slice of sales that would otherwise not exist.</p>

<p>“Our long-tail revenue model makes sure nothing is ‘stolen’ from the studio – it’s important to us that the studio feels comfortable that we are not tapping into revenue they would have still got without our help,” Bastani elaborates. “By looking at historical data, it is quite easy to establish a natural yearly sales decay. Things become a bit more tricky if a studio plans to launch their first DLC during our partnership, as the potential sales uplift needs to be accurately predicted. We have, however, done this for many titles in the past and have a very good sense of what to expect. In the end, the studio has to agree with our sales estimations in order for us to enter a partnership.”</p>
<p>Re-koup’s modelling is flexible enough to account for both games that continue to be supported post-launch, as well as those that are not and even back catalogue releases. Adds Bastani: “One of the great things with this service is that ongoing title support from the studio is absolutely not required. We are able to maximize sales and revenue intake of their game even if the studio has already moved onto a new project.”</p>
<p>It looks good on paper, but digging down into some of Re-koup’s early numbers is equally as impressive.</p>
<p>Papa’s Quiz from Swedish studio Old Apes launched on Steam back in December 2020 and then on consoles throughout 2021. Re-koup came on board in late 2023 and immediately the game enjoyed its best ever month in terms of revenue. And by far, too, with numbers jumping 278 per cent year-on-year In the same period, units were up 415 per cent year-on-year. Bastani adds somewhat humbly that some of this was down to luck thanks to the game being picked up by a popular influencer, but of course it was Re-koup itself that initiated the influencer outreach program.</p>

<p>“Over the years we've met a lot of influencers, content creators and streamers and we've been smart about collecting their information,” he explains. “The first thing that we always do when we start working with a new studio and their game.</p>
<p>There’s more to it than that, of course.. Bastani emphasises that discoverability is, in his opinion, the single biggest challenge facing any new release, and much of the publisher’s work focuses on improving this.</p>
<p>In the case of Papa’s Quiz, Re-koup immediately addressed the game’s Steam tags to help get the right eyeballs on its Steam page, and adjusted the frequency of sales promotions, along with the amount of discount applied. As a result, the game’s impressions soon jumped from 86,000 per month to 235,000. The language on the Steam page was adjusted, too, to be more descriptive of the game experience and to appeal to fans of the appropriate genre.</p>
<p>Re-koup then increased the game’s base price from $9.99, which it felt was too low, to $12.99 without suffering any unit sale losses. It also tapped up its network of first and third party partners to garner the game additional exposure on digital storefronts.</p>
<p>“We got a lot of curated support from first and third parties by leveraging all of their different marketing and sales vehicles in a strategic and coordinated way,” Bastani says. “And the end result was that the studio was very happy. We've been working with them for five months now and the results have been really, really good.”</p>
<blockquote><p>"The deal is essentially risk free for studios, who are only surrendering a small slice of sales that would otherwise not exist"</p></blockquote>
<p>Inspector Schmidt: A Bavarian Tale, from German developer Active Fungus Studios, is another success story. Despite a fairly positive critical reception, sales of the title quickly fell off a cliff shortly after its launch in February 2023.</p>
<p>“The first thing that we did was to change the name of the game from the very German-facing A Bavarian Tale – Totgeschwiegen to ‘Inspector Schmidt: A Bavarian Tale’,” Bastani says. “We sent out influencer codes, although this time we also ran a small paid campaign costing $3k. Along with securing some renewed support from third-parties, we regained a lot of the game’s previous visibility.”</p>
<p>Unit sales jumped 663% year-on-year jump in March, while revenue increased 66% in February and 114% in March. Perhaps it’s no surprise then that, while Re-koup has clients with games that are still in early development or approaching release, this demonstrable success in managing the notoriously tricky long-tail is leading to a lot of demand.</p>
<p>“In games we talk a lot about pre-launch and a lot about launch, obsessing over Wishlists and the like. But we very seldom hear discussions about what happens afterwards,” Bastani observes. “For some reason, we only focus on the first two thirds of a game’s lifecycle. Having worked in the industry for 10 or 15 years now and across some 150 or so games, we know for a fact that lifecycle management can have a huge impact.</p>
<p>“Re-koup’s average revenue uplift across all its clients currently stands at 40 per cent. From a technical perspective there’s a ton you can do – maxing out the number of campaigns, being dynamic in the way you set discounts and ensuring you enter the right promotions with the right discounts. Make sure that you utilise partners, properly look at your Steam data and learn how to work with the algorithm a bit. Think about where your visitors are coming from. Identify where the problems are. Is it click-through? Is it conversion. The methodology works and every time we manage to increase sales.”</p>

            <p>Sony has released its full-year financial results, showing a solid twelve months for its PlayStation business ahead of a year in which it is forecasting declines.</p>
<p>The platform holder saw net sales for its Game &amp; Network Services division, which includes PlayStation, rise by 17% year-on-year to ¥4.3 trillion ($27.5 billion), while operating income rose 16% to ¥290.2 billion ($1.9 billion).</p>
<p>Sony also managed to ship 20.8 million PlayStation 5 units throughout the fiscal year. This was an improvement on the 19.1 million managed in the previous year, but fell slightly short of its 21 million target. This in itself was already reduced from an <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-aims-to-sell-25m-ps5-units-by-april-2024">initial target of 25 million</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside its financial results, Sony announced new leadership for PlayStation with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-names-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino-as-its-new-ceos">Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino taking over from Jim Ryan as joint CEOs</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know:</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<p><em>Full-year (12 months ended March 31, 2024)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥11.3 trillion ($72.2 billion, up 12% year-on-year)</li>
<li><strong>Operating income: </strong>¥1.04 trillion ($6.6 billion, up 5%)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services net sales: </strong>¥4.3 trillion ($27.5 billion, up 17%)</li>
<li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services operating income: </strong>¥290.2 billion ($1.9 billion, up 16%)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Q4 (3 months ended March 31, 2024)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>¥2.8 trillion ($17.9 billion, up 9%)</li>
<li><strong>Operating income: </strong>¥203.3 billion ($1.3 billion, up 115%)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services net sales: </strong>¥1.1 trillion ($7.03 billion, up 2.2%)</li>
<li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services operating income: </strong>¥135.8 billion ($868 million, up 172.5%)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<p>Breaking down the full-year results for its G&amp;NS division, Sony reported software sales of ¥2.2 trillion ($14.1 billion, up 24% year-on-year), of which digital software and add-ons accounted for ¥1.9 trillion ($12.1 billion, up 27%).</p>
<p>The platform holder said 286.4 million games were sold for PS5 during the course of the year, of which 39.7 million were first-party titles. By comparison, the previous fiscal year saw 264.2 million games sold, of which 43.5 million were first-party.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-hits-59m-as-helldivers-2-breaks-playstations-launch-sales-record/">VGC</a>, Sony announced during its earnings webcast that Helldivers 2 sold 12 million copies in 12 weeks across PC and PS5. The company said this was "far exceeding expectations" and makes it the fastest-selling PlayStation game launch to date.</p>
<p>Hardware revenues saw a 9% boost at ¥1.7 trillion ($10.9 billion), which there was decent growth in revenue from network services — including PlayStation Plus — at ¥545.5 billion ($3.5 million, up 17%).</p>
<p>There were 118 million active PSN users at the end of Q4 (three months ended March 31, 2024) — down from the 123 million reported at the end of Q3 but up from 108 million marked at the same time last year.</p>
<p>The success of the G&amp;NS division was cited as a key factor in Sony's overall results, as well as increases in its music, financial services, and imaging and sensing solutions segments.</p>
<p>PlayStation's forecast for the new financial year reaffirmed the company's previously stated expectation of a decrease in hardware sales, but this will also deliver a decrease in hardware losses.</p>
<p>The platform holder expects an increase in non-first-party sales and a decrease in first-party, due in no small part to the fact there will be <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-generates-93-billion-in-holiday-quarter-but-expects-hardware-decline-in-2024">no new entries from PlayStation's blockbuster franchises until the following fiscal year</a>.</p>
<p>The forecast also predicts an increase in sales from network services, mainly PlayStation Plus as Sony grows its subscription service.</p>
<h2>The forecast</h2>
<p><em>FY24 (12 months ended March 31, 2025)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales: </strong>¥11.4 trillion ($72.9 billion, up 1%)</li>
<li><strong>Operating income: </strong>¥1.13 trillion ($7.2 billion, up 9%)</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services net sales: </strong>¥4.2 trillion ($26.8 billion, down 1.5%)</li>
<li><strong>Game &amp; Network Services operating income: </strong>¥310 billion ($2 billion, up 6.8%)</li>
</ul>

            <p>
Square Enix has been hit by a round of layoffs, impacting employees in its US and European offices as part of "structural reforms".
</p>
<p>
It's unclear how many people are affected, but as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/">VGC</a> reports, staff were informed during an internal meeting on Monday. Eurogamer has contacted Square Enix for comment.
</p>
<p>
The layoffs will happen over the next month, with employees in publishing, IT, and the indie games division Square Enix Collective most affected.

<p>

UK employees will enter a one month consultancy period, as per local employment law. US employees could leave their positions even sooner.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, Square Enix released its latest financial report, in which the company stated it had "begun optimising costs at its European and American offices via structural reforms" as part of a plan to "rebuild overseas business divisions from the ground up".
</p>
<p>
As company president Takashi Kiryu has previously stated, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-reviewing-overall-game-development-to-improve-quality">Square Enix is undergoing a revision of its development system</a> to improve the quality of its games.

</p>
<p>
Yesterday's report provided further details on its medium-term business strategy, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">plans to "aggressively" pursue a multiplatform strategy</a> across Nintendo consoles, PlayStation, Xbox and PC.

</p>
<p>
It aims to be "bold" in creating new franchises as part of a shift from quantity to quality, balancing developer creativity with data from customers and the wider market.
</p>
<p>
However, following the release of the report, shares in Square Enix fell by 16 percent, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/square-enix-shares-tumble-by-most-in-13-years-on-weak-outlook-1.2072502">Bloomberg</a> reported, which is the company's biggest decline in 13 years.

</p>
<p>
Despite the release of big games like Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, profits have fallen due to high development costs, a decline in MMO and mobile games, and the write-off of £112m worth of in-development projects.
</p>
<p>
And while the company is streamlining its development efforts, it will take time for this to translate into sales, Kiryu said.
</p>
<p>
Layoffs at Square Enix follow the likes of Sony, Microsoft, Sega and more, as well as smaller companies. Check out our feature on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">video game layoffs across the industry</a>.

<p data-characters="296" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Everyone already knows <em>Helldivers 2</em> has been a smash success for publisher Sony, but there were never any hard sales figures for it. Now, Sony itself has confirmed the game has pushed over 12 million units across PlayStation 5 and PC, making it the fastest-selling PlayStation launch of all time.</p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">Sony shared this during a webcast to discuss its financial results for the company’s fiscal year ending in March 2024 (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-hits-59m-as-helldivers-2-breaks-playstations-launch-sales-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). It described <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s sales as “far exceeding expectations,” having sold 12 million units in its first 12 weeks. That means, on average, it was selling a million copies every week since its February 8 launch.</p> <figure data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/polar-warbond-helldivers-2-soldier.jpeg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="polar warbond helldivers 2 soldier" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/polar-warbond-helldivers-2-soldier.jpeg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/polar-warbond-helldivers-2-soldier.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/polar-warbond-helldivers-2-soldier.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/polar-warbond-helldivers-2-soldier.jpeg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot via PlayStation’s YouTube channel</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">This is extra impressive when you remember <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-marvels-spider-man-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man 2</a></em>, the big-budget PS5 exclusive starring one of the most popular superheroes in the world, only <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/marvels-spider-man-2-sales-zip-past-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed the 10 million sales mark this February</a>, four months after its launch. Not only that, but the previous record holder for fastest-selling PlayStation game was <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-god-of-war-ragnarok-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Ragnarök</a></em>, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks.</p> <p data-characters="632" data-current-count="1010" data-injectable="true">While <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s success was obvious even without exact figures (it was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-still-outselling-everything-else-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the UK’s best-selling game two months in a row</a>), it’s nice to actually put a number to it. As for how it achieved such a record, there’s no doubt multiple contributing factors. For starters, it launching on PS5 and PC the same day would have helped simply because it allowed more people to play it than if it had been PS5 only. Not to mention it quickly fostered a dedicated community of players and a strong social media presence, which combined would’ve helped to attract new players who otherwise may have missed out on it.</p>
 <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">Furthermore, Helldivers 2 is simply much cheaper than the likes of <em>Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>. Whereas those games were sold at $70 / £70, <em>Helldivers 2</em> is a far more affordable $40 / £35. Plus, <em>Helldivers 2</em> is enjoying continuous updates whilst <em>Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> are one and done single-player adventures. $40 for a game that’s frequently adding new content is arguably far more enticing than a $70 game you can complete from start to finish in a month or two.</p>
 <p data-characters="645" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="false">Sony will most likely want to keep supporting <em>Helldivers 2</em> in the long-term, though it’s already demonstrated that it’s quite easy to kneecap the game’s popularity. The decision to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-bringing-back-mandatory-playstation-accounts-for-pc-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">force everyone to get a PlayStation account for the game</a>, which would’ve resulted in it becoming unplayable in multiple countries, almost felt like the end-times for <em>Helldivers 2</em> and would’ve culled its playerbase <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-backpedals-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-plans-after-3-days-of-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had Sony not pulled a U-turn</a>. Going forward, Sony may be more careful with how it handles <em>Helldivers 2</em>. After all, it’s a golden goose for the company right now and the last thing it will want to do is squander it.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-official-title-for-assassins-creed-red-reveal-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release date leak</a>, Assassin's Creed Shadows also got its pricing and season pass/DLC plan leaked, although through another source.</p>
<p>This info was <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft_Frax/status/1790110727774130281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> on Twitter by Ubisoft leaker Frax, who wrote that Assassin's Creed Shadows will be priced at £59.99 (so, likely $69.99) for the base edition. Frax also revealed info on the Season Pass, which will include two expansions, and the currency packs purchasable in-game through microtransactions.</p>
<p><em>Season Pass - $/€40</em><br>
<em>Welcome Pack (4200 Helix) - $/€35</em><br>
<em>Expansion 1 - $/€25</em><br>
<em>Expansion 2 - $/€25</em></p>
<p><strong><em>—-Currency Packs—-</em></strong><br>
<em>500 Helix - $/€5</em><br>
<em>1050 Helix - $/€10</em><br>
<em>2300 Helix - $/€20</em><br>
<em>4200 Helix - $/€35</em><br>
<em>6600 Helix - $/€55</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows, formerly codenamed Assassin's Creed Red, was announced by Ubisoft during the September 2022 franchise showcase. At that time, Vice President and Brand Executive Producer Marc-Alexis Côté said:</p>
<p><em>This is Codename: Red, our next premium flagship title and the future of our open-world RPG games on Assassin's Creed. It is being developed by Ubisoft Québec, the studio behind Assassin's Creed Odyssey, under the creative direction of Jonathan Dumont.</em></p>
<p><em>It will let players explore one of their most awaited settings ever on the franchise, feudal Japan, and they'll live a very powerful shinobi fantasy.</em></p>
<p>Last year, Insider Gaming <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-red-to-feature-samurai-and-shinobi-as-main-characters-focus-on-stealth-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that there will be two playable characters in the game: a female samurai and an African refugee shinobi. The report also highlighted an increased focus on stealth, with mechanics borrowed from franchises like HITMAN and Splinter Cell. That would certainly fit a game titled Assassin's Creed Shadows. Later, we learned there would be some <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-red-early-2024-reveal-destructible-environments-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">destructible environments</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-reds-gameplay-inspired-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mechanics inspired by FromSoftware's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> (a posture bar that will have to be broken to get through the enemy's defenses).</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, players can <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-red-to-feature-ray-traced-global-illumination-and-virtual-geometry-stealth-to-be-expanded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look forward to</a> virtual geometry, ray traced global illumination, and improvements to the weather system and animations.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be released on November 15. While the official reveal is slated for tomorrow at 9 AM Pacific Time, it is likely that we'll get a lot more info during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forward-returns-on-june-10-with-the-latest-on-ubisoft-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft Forward event</a> scheduled to go live on June 10 from Los Angeles.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-12-million/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-has-sold-12-million-units-in-12-weeks.869985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-12-million/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Sony has announced during its financial report that Helldivers 2 has sold an impressive 12 million units in its first 12 weeks.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 has been a tremendous success for developer Arrowhead Game Studios and its publisher, PlayStation. The figure makes Helldivers 2 one of PlayStation’s fastest-selling first-party games of all time, up there with God of War Ragnarok, which sold 11 million units in 10 weeks.</p>



<p>The impressive figure comes following controversy earlier this month, which saw Helldivers 2 get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/negative-helldivers-2-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of thousands of negative Steam reviews</a> due to a PSN linking policy — A policy which PlayStation later reversed. </p>



<p>It’s unclear how many of the game’s sales were attributed to PC, but with an all-time concurrent player peak of 458,709, it’s not hard to imagine it in the millions. As such, the success of the game puts a huge question mark on Sony’s future strategy with its first-party titles, with the success of the game suggesting that it could be a strategy replicated moving forward.</p>



<p>Microsoft is already seemingly on board with the strategy of releasing its first-party games on other platforms. While the company hasn’t confirmed any other releases past its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-available-ps5-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original 4</a>, it’s likely only a matter of time before more announcements come.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-new-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix announced</a> that it will move away from console exclusivity and will take a multi-platform approach.</p>



<p>Despite Helldivers 2’s success, though, the company saw a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-sales-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">29% year-over-year decrease</a> in its hardware sales for the quarter, which could also imply a change in first-party strategy moving forward.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-sales-down/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-sales-drop-29-yoy-expects-a-continued-decline.869979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-sales-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Sony has reported that its PlayStation 5 sales dropped 29% YoY in its latest financial report, selling a total of 20.8 million units in FY23.</p>



<p>The number is slightly below Sony’s previously revised estimations that the company would sell 21 million units. The company also expects console sales to decline, which would be the first time that PlayStation 5 sales fall below the previous year. Sony expects 18 million units to be sold in FY24.</p>



<p>Last year, Sony announced that the PlayStation 5 is entering its “later stages” of this generation. While the company’s sales approximations are not surprising, they do pose a bigger question about console m market growth. As of June 2022, the PlayStation 4 sold 117 million units, whereas the PlayStation 5 has sold 52.6 million as of now. Even with 18 million units sold for the next three years (when the PlayStation 6 is expected to be released), the numbers suggest that the console market isn’t growing.</p>



<p>In April 2024, Microsoft also reported that its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xboxrevenue-up-and-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware sales were down by 31%</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PlayStation 5 sales and the console market as a whole? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

			<p>Today, alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its financial report</a>, Sony announced a new leadership structure for its PlayStation division (Sony Interactive Entertainment). Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-head-jim-ryan-retires-in-march-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">departure of Jim Ryan</a>, they had been looking for a new Chief Executive Officer; as it turns out, they found two.</p>
<p>Hermen Hulst, formerly Senior Vice President and Head of PlayStation Studios and, before that, Studio Head at Guerrilla Games, will be the new CEO of the Studio Business Group. He'll focus on the development, publishing, and business operations of all first-party PlayStation content.</p>
<p>Hulst said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>I am thrilled to lead the studio business group and continue to build on our success with PlayStation 5 while preparing for the future. The video game industry is one of the largest entertainment industries in the world and has been built on the marriage of content and technology, and I look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of play and entertainment.</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, Nishino, formerly Senior Vice President of the Platform Experience Group, will take the role of CEO of SIE's Platform Business Group, focusing on technology, products, services, the platform experience, and third-party operations.</p>
<p>Nishino stated:</p>
<p><em>We will continue to connect players and creators through world-class products, services, and technology. We always strive to grow our community even bigger with innovation in every area at Sony Interactive Entertainment. I am honored to be appointed such an important role alongside Hermen. By working more closely together, we will be positioned to build incredible experiences for an ever-expanding audience now and in the future.</em></p>
<p>For his part, Hiroki Totoki (Interim CEO at SIE and President, COO and CFO at Sony Group Corporation) added:</p>
<p><em>Sony Interactive Entertainment is a dynamic and growing business that delivers incredible entertainment experiences through the connection of content and technology. These two leaders will have clear responsibilities and will manage strategic direction to ensure the focus remains on deepening engagement with existing PlayStation users and expanding experiences to new audiences.</em></p>
<p>In other PlayStation news, several insiders including Jeff Grubb and <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1790172881009390006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dusk Golem</a> believe a PlayStation Showcase is inbound later this month. This would line up with last year's Showcase that took place on May 24.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mullet-madjack-review-nostalgia-fueled-frenzy.869967/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mullet-madjack-review-nostalgia-fueled-frenzy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The amount of quality indie titles that have launched in May is already overwhelmingly large, so I'm here to urge you to add another game to that list: <em>Mullet MadJack</em>. With a name as awesome as <em>"Mullet MadJack</em>," you're in for one wild, non-stop ride in this nostalgic, 90s anime-style first-person shooter.</p>
<p>Players take the role of the eponymous Mullet Mad Jack, a "moderator" that kills robobillionaires. You're also out to save a damsel in distress, but you're going to have to climb high into a skyscraper filled with those darn robobillionaires and drones -- and they're armed to the teeth. Thankfully, the gameplay itself is as fun as the premise behind the story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-cinematic.jpg?itok=DoA6zQ2I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-cinematic.jpg?itok=b1rsbMvX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="15fc4683-2351-45db-b94e-836a884077c4" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-cinematic.jpg?itok=b1rsbMvX" alt="A cutscene from Mullet Madjack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Time to get those hands dirty.</figcaption></figure><h2>Slay Robobillionaires in <em>Mullet MadJack</em></h2>
<p><em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a<em> </em>potent combination of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ghostrunner-review"><em>Ghostrunner </em></a>meets <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review-killed-dick">Bulletstorm</a>. </em>We have the fast and frenetic gameplay of <em>Ghostrunner</em>, combined with <em>Bulletstorm</em>'s stylish, FPS mayhem and lethal environmental hazards. Of course, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> has plenty of other tricks up its sleeve, making for one bombastic and fresh experience.</p>
<p><em>Ghostrunner</em> combines parkour and one-hit-kill gameplay, making for an extremely fast-paced adventure. Similarly, <em>Mullet MadJack</em>'s robobillionaire enemies can kill you fast, so you're constantly on the move and aiming to kill as many of them in a myriad of stylish ways.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-smg.jpg?itok=3Xa-YfE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-smg.jpg?itok=h7ssINJT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8651fee8-abd0-4aea-b81d-b32f60ce09d6" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-smg.jpg?itok=h7ssINJT" alt="A look at the SMG weapon from Mullet MadJack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Some glorious robobillionaire-slaying action!</figcaption></figure><p>The main thing you need to take into account is a 10-second limit to your life. Life is not measured by traditional means, but rather through this constant countdown. Seconds can only be replenished through slaying robobillionaires in different ways; conversely, you can <em>lose </em>seconds by succumbing to their attacks.</p>
<p><em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a giant race to the finish line as you climb floor by floor through increasingly difficult sections of a skyscraper. Each floor grants players an upgrade that'll help them survive and replenish those precious seconds of life, and by the end of it, you ought to be armed well enough to defeat the boss at the end of each chapter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-upgrades.jpg?itok=QW6t4to9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-upgrades.jpg?itok=c795P5Hg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="73f5805b-6eba-4452-a9ef-95b17f9b9f49" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-upgrades.jpg?itok=c795P5Hg" alt="A look at upgrades in Mullet MadJack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>I love the UI when choosing upgrades!</figcaption></figure><h2>Gear Up to Get the Job Done in <em>Mullet MadJack</em></h2>
<p>With these upgrades, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> has some roguelite elements to it. You get more and more powerful each floor, but if you die, you'll start at the beginning of the chapter and you'll have to gain these upgrades all over again. There's a reasonable amount to choose from, so your build is likely going to vary each chapter, though I did wish for a bit more variety.</p>
<p>Upgrades can range from new weapons like an uzi or fire katana, to environmental invulnerability and more. The most essential power-ups were the ones that granted extra seconds based on the way you killed certain enemies -- that's where those <em>Bulletstorm</em>, environmental kill elements come in.</p>
<p>The sprawling complex of rooms within the skyscraper is filled to the brim with ridiculous traps and hazards, like dangerous spinning fans, lasers, acid, and more. With certain upgrades, knocking an enemy into fans would grant more seconds. The best way to do that is with your kick, which is always a blast to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-parkour.jpg?itok=lERW4gf9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-parkour.jpg?itok=XPiohNa2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="df8232a3-b2ab-4732-a0de-473824269259" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-parkour.jpg?itok=XPiohNa2" alt="A look at some parkour action in Mullet MadJack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Ready for some parkour?</figcaption></figure><p>There's also one that gives you an extra second for shooting robobillionaires in the crotch or head, so cater to your playstyle. Again, though, there isn't a huge range of upgrades to choose from, which does lead to a feeling of repetition. Mainly, there are only a few weapons to choose from and you're more than likely to prefer one or two over the rest.</p>
<p>While weapons can be upgraded further,<em> Mullet MadJack</em> needed another two or three to really break up more of the repetitive moments. That's where this otherwise brilliant game suffers, is in its variety. Environments introduce more and more hazards as you go on, but does little to shake up the gameplay beyond its frantic rush to the finish.</p>
<p>Since I mentioned bosses, by the end of most chapters you'll have fight one. These are way easier than climbing the tower itself, though it's probably by design. Failing right at the boss and resetting your progress in that chapter would be really disappointing, so they feel more like a part of the story to experience rather than a challenge to overcome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-cutscene.jpg?itok=H_WxQxn3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-cutscene.jpg?itok=FQAw_aSV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a9951bf1-66c5-4943-b39d-859a498920f1" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-cutscene.jpg?itok=FQAw_aSV" alt="A look at a cutscene from Mullet MadJack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Locked and loaded.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Mullet MadJack</em> - A Visual Ode to 90s Anime</h2>
<p>The levels themselves also look pretty darn similar throughout, so you get a feeling of deja vu constantly. It's not a matter of getting lost -- you just run straight and get to the next floor -- but some visual diversity here and there would do some good for <em>Mullet MadJack</em>.</p>
<p>But despite that, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a very strong game in terms of visuals. It's deeply inspired by 90s anime and the vaporwave aesthetic, and the over-the-top colors and zaniness of the characters and story reflect that. It is undeniably one of the most stylish games I've played all year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-snipers.jpg?itok=ITGH8yTD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-snipers.jpg?itok=lIQeIOhe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7f6b6d92-6f46-4867-9306-063c8b0f13ba" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-snipers.jpg?itok=lIQeIOhe" alt="A look at a cutscene from Mullet Madjack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Cutscenes in this game, though few and far between, ooze with style.</figcaption></figure><p>So while I do love its overall art direction, things can get a little chaotic on screen and leads to some visibility issues. It's fast, there are explosions from fire extinguishers and vending machines and and enemies going on everywhere, and the UI will throw words in your face at any moment.</p>
<p>I can see this as being a bit overwhelming for some players as it was for me, but it also adds to the overall charm and personality of <em>Mullet MadJack</em>. I appreciate the way this game deviates from the norm and does something a bit different, even if it's at the expense of some visual clarity.</p>
<p>Complementing the visuals is an exceptional, nostalgic synthwave soundtrack. When you combine these tracks with some truly cinematic cutscenes, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> looks and sounds cool as hell, plain and simple.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mullet-madjack-unboxing.jpg?itok=yg3ja-ok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-unboxing.jpg?itok=RYpr8UV3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="96656b20-d818-47cc-8931-26d4449702bd" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mullet-madjack-unboxing.jpg?itok=RYpr8UV3" alt="A look at the unboxing mode in Mullet MadJack." typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>Remember the good ol' days?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Mullet MadJack | </em>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>It's a pretty short game when all is said and done, but there are a few extra bits that I appreciated nonetheless. First, there's an Endless Mode, so if you're trying to tackle the leaderboard, you can contend with other players and aim for the top. It's an appreciated feature, but again, it does suffer from some of that same feeling of repetition.</p>
<p>There's also a mode that goes through the "unboxing" of a fake physical copy of <em>Mullet MadJack</em>. Man, I remember loving physical PC copies with their fancy boxes and surprisingly robust booklets inside -- and this little segment was a nice way to vicariously relive that nostalgia once again.</p>
<p>It's quite evident that <em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a lovingly crafted game that comes from a place of love of the 90s and classic anime. Even though it's a shorter experience, each moment is full of non-stop action. Take this baby for a spin and you'll have the time of your life.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Combining elements from Ghostrunner and Bulletstorm in a 90s-anime inspired package, slaying robobillionaires is a blast in Mullet MadJack -- though, it is a bit short. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p data-characters="296" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re not really good at valuing ourselves or each other.

But do you know who loves numbers? Robots.</p> <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">Robots judge our worth today. If we’re not valuable in the eyes of a computer, we aren’t valuable at all. If we don’t create content or products that make numbers go up, we’re worthless.

As such, you have 10 seconds to live, but you can extend it by killing a robot live on stream.</p>

 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">The game itself generally follows the formula set by <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285670/Post_Void/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Post Void</a></em>. In fact, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> features so many similarities to that game it’s almost tempting to call it a rip-off. Even the way that the protagonist holds their time/health bar in their left hand and the garish neon colors feel as though they were lifted directly from <em>Post Void</em>.</p> <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">However, for as much as it takes from <em>Post Void</em>, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> runs with the formula. To be fair, <em>Post Void</em> didn’t go all that much farther than the core concept.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">So, <em>Mullet MadJack</em> features the same momentum-based corridor dash that <em>Post Void </em>had, but it also has you performing <em>Doom Eternal-</em>style glory kills and kicking robots into environmental hazards like giant fans and exposed wires. There are vending machines you can blast open to sup from their delicious juices. Between each floor, you’re provided a small selection of power-ups to choose from to make your next floor both more fun and survivable.</p>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">But it would be hugely amiss to claim that Hammer95 is simply cashing in on someone else’s success. So much of what I love about <em>Mullet MadJack</em> goes beyond its gameplay. From the moment you start the game, you’re blasted with visual overload. Animated cutscenes precede the main menu, showing shots of Mr. MadJack changing gears in his Toro GT in exceedingly lavish details. Every shot contains so much information that I could watch it all day.</p>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">This continues into gameplay where you wade through an everlasting stream of explosions, slide down ramps wallpapered with advertisements for fake but familiar products, and jam manga into a robot’s throat. Don’t spend too long looking at the cover of that manga, you only have a few seconds to grab it and ram it down the throat of a nearby robot.</p> <figure data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ11cropped.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Mullet MadJack sliding down a ramp." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ11cropped.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ11cropped.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ11cropped.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ11cropped.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true"><em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a lot of dumb fun, but it’s all in support of its central themes. It’s a game where you can look it over from a variety of angles, peel back its layers, and find something new in every crevice. At the surface level, it shows a depiction of the internet taken to an absurd but weirdly believable extreme. It’s a playground exclusively for robots while the rest of us go to great lengths to gain their approval.</p>
 <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false">Advertisers are the only humans of importance. They prop up influencers as people of importance, though they add nothing. The only person raging against the machine still has to play their game.</p> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">It’s excessive, it’s noisy, there’s too much going on at once. You just keep trying to get those likes and maybe you’ll eventually get a new pair of shoes.</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="697" data-injectable="true">Yet, despite the heaviness of its themes, the whole thing is presented in a mocking but amiable way. Mr. MadJack is a fun protagonist. He has a penchant for screaming out one-liners, which in less capable hands can be extremely annoying. But the way he mixes his venom and robocidal ravings with vapid affirmations is legitimately charming.</p>
 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">Among the random perks you can choose between levels is the useless option to make Mr. MadJack talk at every opportunity. It adds nothing from a gameplay perspective, but I found it amusing to listen to. Simultaneously sadistic and sympathetic, he’s either a caricature of a vapid internet personality or an eager and enthusiastic friend.</p> <figure data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ06cropped.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Mullet MadJack sniper scope" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ06cropped.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ06cropped.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ06cropped.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ06cropped.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">And between the one-liners is a game that is all about flow. If you’re not dashing between glorious robotic destruction, you’re probably on the verge of death. There’s very little time to stop and calculate. At best, you’ll be able to recognize a target and decide how to deal with it. Some enemies are persistent against everything except a headshot, while one can only be defeated by kicking it into an environmental hazard.</p>
 <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false"><em>Mullet MadJack </em>provides one of the few things that still relaxes me in these days of distraction: flow-state concentration. It doesn’t matter if most stages are just one randomly generated linear corridor, the action that goes on in between is constant and gripping. Shallow, perhaps, but in a way that supports the way it wants you to move.</p> <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="874" data-injectable="true">Occasionally, it does trip over itself. The wall running feels terrible. It’s hard to describe, but it feels less like parkour and more like you’re dragging your face against a wall. On a similar note, the bottomless pits are unwelcome. There’s one particular narrow walkway that I kept falling off of because the kickback of my gun would push me off. The abrupt end to my run always felt like a slap in the face. I would have preferred a way to recover at the expense of time off the clock. Instant death doesn’t fit here.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ01cropped.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Mullet MadJack AI Future" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ01cropped.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ01cropped.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ01cropped.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen_MulletMJ01cropped.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true">There are also some issues with menu navigation and English translation. However, the latter problem isn’t that intrusive, and considering that it utilizes the cyberpunk trope of pervasive Japanese text, awkward translation kind of fits.</p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">The flaws of <em>Mullet MadJack</em> are apparent. It’s a bit derivative, somewhat shallow, and sometimes uneven, but between the pulsing synth music, overload of visual information, and hatred of robots, I can readily say it’s my favorite game released this year. The first time I sat down with it was also when I completed it (about 3 hours), but I immediately jumped into endless mode and have been jumping back in occasionally ever since. I need those shoes.</p>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">The most important component, however, is that it’s obvious that Hammer95 obviously had immense fun with the project. From the in-game “unboxing” to the lavish animation and art, they went above and beyond with many small details that you might just wind up missing. And even that is incredibly on message. A robot can’t have fun creating a video game.</p> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">If you’ve ever had thoughts of throwing your phone away or abandoning the internet to its robotic rulers, <em>Mullet MadJack </em>taps into that frustration. The neon nostalgia of a better era is fertile ground for a game that feels like beating a microwave to death with a crowbar.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PS5 sales have surpassed 59.2 million units worldwide, Sony has <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveale</a>d.</p>
<p>Sony published its most recent financial earnings for the 4th quarter of its current fiscal year, announcing that it managed to sell 20.8 million PS5 consoles during the (fiscal) year. This is slightly below the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-fall-short-of-estimates-sony-confirms-no-major-franchise-release-in-next-fiscal-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revised sales target of 21 million</a> that the company set some months ago. As revealed in the <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supplemental information</a> that Sony has released, 4.5 million PS5 consoles were sold during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. For reference, Sony managed to sell 6.3 million consoles during the same quarter last year.</p>
<p>With global PS5 sales being down year-over-year, Sony now expects sales to decline to 18 million during its current fiscal year (FY24). Back in December of last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-50-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we wrote that the PS5 was tracking in on PS4 time-aligned sales</a>, but with PS5 sales now being down year-on-year, we wonder whether PS5 sales will ever surpass lifetime PS4 sales.</p>
<p>In other sales-related news - as revealed (<a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1790278247038562446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> Tom Warren) during Sony's conference call, Arrowhead's hit title Helldivers 2 has sold over 12 million copies across both PS5 and PC as of May 5th. This means that those copies were sold in 12 weeks. Interestingly enough - three weeks after the title's launch in early February, Arrowhead <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-has-sold-3-million-units-in-just-over-two-weeks-director-says-dlss-is-cool-but-not-necessary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported that over 3 million units were sol</a>d. This implies that around 9 million additional copies were sold in 9 weeks - roughly 1 million a week.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony says Helldivers 2 reached 12 million sales across PS5 and PC in the first 12 weeks since launch <a href="https://t.co/wpcwWBzBVT">pic.twitter.com/wpcwWBzBVT</a></p>
<p>— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1790278247038562446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p id="7e50o5">If you already have a shiny Abra (or its evolutions), you may have participated in Abra Community Day in April 2020. The first few evolutions have only a slight difference when shiny, but Alakazam and its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22447919/mega-evolution-list-candy-bonus-buddy-raids">Mega</a> form get more prominent pink accents, which rule.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Abra in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Abra is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck keeps <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

<p>It seemingly takes two people to replace one Jim Ryan. <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2024/new-leadership-structure-formed-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has announced</a> that both Hermen Hulst&nbsp;and Hideaki Nishino&nbsp;will take over as joint CEOs of PlayStation starting June 1, 2024.</p>



<p>Hulst moves on from his role as head of PlayStation Studios to the role of CEO of the newly formed Studio Business Group. Hulst’s group will be responsible for all of PlayStation’s first-party games as well as PlayStation IP in TV and film. He had been the head of PlayStation Studios since 2019 and is also known as a co-founder of Guerrilla&nbsp;Games, the studio behind the Killzone and Horizon franchises.</p>



<p>“It’s a true privilege to be asked to lead the new Studio Business Group for Sony Interactive,” Hulst said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/hermenhulst/status/1790157531555500085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement on Twitter</a>. “I’m excited to continue working with incredibly talented teams and studios to deliver unforgettable game and entertainment experiences.”</p>



<p>Regarding Nishino, he moves into the role of CEO of the Platform Business Group. In his new position, he will be responsible for PlayStation console hardware, accessories, technology, the PlayStation Network, and third-party relations for both major publishers and indie studios. Before the promotion, Nishino was SVP of Platform Experiences.</p>



<p>“I am honored to be appointed such an important role alongside Hermen,” Nishino said. “By working more closely together, we will be positioned to build incredible experiences for an ever-expanding audience now and in the future.”</p>



<p>Both Nishino and Hulst will report directly to Sony Interactive Entertainment chairman Hiroki Totoki. Totoki had been PlayStation’s interim CEO since Ryan’s departure.</p>



<p>“Sony Interactive Entertainment is a dynamic and growing business that delivers incredible entertainment experiences through the connection of content and technology,” Totoki said. “These two leaders will have clear responsibilities and will manage strategic direction to ensure the focus remains on deepening engagement with existing PlayStation users and expanding experiences to new audiences.”</p>

It contains the <em>Samurai Warriors 4</em> base game, as well as more than 150 pieces of previously released downloadable content.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A total of 55 different officers are featured in this rich depiction of the Warring States period. The new deluxe edition of <em>Samurai Warriors 4</em> contains more than 150 previously released downloadable content, including costumes, weapons, customization parts, scenarios, background music, and more.</p><p><strong>Interact With 55 Different Officers, Including Nobuyuki Sanada and Yoshitsugu Otani</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In response to popular demand, Nobuyuki Sanada and Yoshitsugu Otani are now among the many officers featured in this vivid portrayal of the Warring States period. Takatora Todo, Naotora Ii, and Munenori Yagyu, who previously appeared only in Japanese releases, also appear for the first time in the main <em>Samurai Warriors</em> series. In addition, character designs have been revamped and action elements have been enhanced for fan-favorite characters like Yukimura Sanada and Nobunaga Oda. The range of 55 unique officers, the greatest number of officers in a single game in the series, is a key component of <em>Samurai Warriors</em>.</p><p><strong>Journey Through the Colorful History of the Warring States Period</strong></p><p>In the main Story Mode, a tale based on historical events unfolds in two separate parts. While the regional stories focus on officers from regions across the land, such as Kyushu and Shikoku, the story of unification details the events leading up to the end of the Warring States period. Unlike previous <em>Samurai Warriors</em> titles, this game features battles between each faction, allowing for a more dramatic depiction of the relationships between officers. <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> firsthand the convictions, conflicts, and complex feelings of these officers.</p><p><strong>Experience the Most Exhilarating <a title="Genres > Action [1,831 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> in the Entire Series</strong></p><p>The true thrill of this series, mowing down hordes of enemies in battles of one-versus-1,000, has been made even more exhilarating with the addition of new elements, including Hyper Attacks, which allow players to quickly close in on their enemies and cut them down, and Rage mode, which powers up attacks when the Spirit Gauge is full and allows players to perform the ultimate finishing move: Musou Frenzy Attacks. In addition, characters’ attack types and the overall progression system have been revamped. These new elements offer an unprecedented variety of attacks, along with the strongest sense of exhilaration of any game in the series, all while maintaining the simple controls characteristic of the <em>Warriors</em> series.</p><p><strong>Travel Across the Land in Chronicle Mode</strong></p><p>Explore the world of <em>Samurai Warriors</em> in the new Chronicle Mode by completing various types of requests, meeting officers, and collecting items in regions across the land. Leave a lasting mark on the history of the Warring States period by customizing officers via Create Character in the upgraded editing mode.</p><p><strong>Switch Between Characters in Real Time During Battle</strong></p><p>Use the Switch Character feature to switch between two different characters on the battlefield in real time as they strive for victory. By switching characters, players can gain an advantage in battle, discover hidden objectives, and receive various benefits. They can also set a detailed plan of action for the character not currently being played.</p><p><strong>Utilize the Strong Connection Between Morale and Combat</strong></p><p>Enemy camps are made stronger by higher Morale levels, but completing objectives and defeating standard bearers lowers enemy Morale and makes it easier to claim victory. As such, the player’s actions have a drastic effect on battle conditions.</p></div><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
