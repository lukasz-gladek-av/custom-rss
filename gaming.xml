			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>In order to kick off Chapter 5 of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, you’ll need to find a way to recruit eventual party member Admiral Bobbery and sail to Keelhaul Key. This requires a few steps, but don’t worry, we have you covered…</p>
<p><em>Note: The following guide contains minor Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door SPOILERS.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd45.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After finishing up Chapter 4, you’ll note there is now a large ship at the dock in Rogueport, but nobody’s on board. The ship is owned by Flavio – the pirate-y looking merchant guy who hangs out at the Rogueport bar downstairs from the inn. Go talk to Flavio and tell him he needs more thrills in his life.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd46.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Flavio will now get aboard his ship, but… they don’t have a navigator. He’ll ask you to go find a Admiral Bobbery to help steer the ship.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd47.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Bobbery’s house is the unmarked one in Rogueport’s east side, next to Professor Frankly’s place. But the door is locked. So, how do you get in? Use the Yoshi kid to get across this gap, then climb up the boxes onto the nearby rooftops.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd48.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once on the roof of Bobbery’s place, roll into a tube so you can get into his chimney.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd49.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ah ha! You’ve found Bobbery! But he's in a bad mood and refuses to return to sea for some reason and requests you leave.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd50.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Head back to the bar, and talk to the barkeep, Podley. He’ll tell you about Bobbery’s tragic backstory and give you a long-lost letter from his wife. Take this letter to Bobbery and he’ll agree to set sail.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd51.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Head back to the ship and off you go to Keelhaul Key! You’ll be separated from Bobbery again before you get there, but don’t worry, that’s all part of the story.</p>
<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is available now on Nintendo Switch. You can check out all of&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech’s Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door guides here</a>.</p>

The DMCC helps regulate and expand digital competition on computers and phones. </p><p>The new law is similar to the European Union’s DMA, which in January gave Epic a path to bring <em>Fortnite </em>to iPhone owners in the EU. This newly passed DMCC bill is the UK’s equivalent of the DMA and was directly shouted out by Epic on Twitter.</p><p><em>Original story continues below</em></p><p>Over three years ago, in August 2020, Epic tried to add new ways for people to buy in-game items in <em>Fortnite’s </em>mobile ports. These new methods would be cheaper for users and would circumvent Google and Apple’s store cut that the tech giants usually collect on all in-app purchases on their respective devices. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store-1844717397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store-1844717397">Within hours, both Google and Apple had yanked <em>Fortnite</em></a></span><em> </em>from their digital stores and Epic began <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/everything-thats-happening-in-the-apple-vs-epic-case-1846856678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/everything-thats-happening-in-the-apple-vs-epic-case-1846856678">a legal fight with both companies</a></span> that is just now wrapping.

Apple will also have to allow sideloading, the ability for users to install their own apps directly onto their devices. These are both features of Android phones, but not the more locked-down iOS ecosystem. But thanks to the DMA, that’s changing in the EU and Epic wasted no time calling out Apple and announcing <em>Fortnite</em>’s<em> </em>return via its own third-party app, the Epic Games Store.<br></p><p>“Remember <em>Fortnite </em>on iOS? How bout we bring that back,”<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1750616130174234859&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1750616130174234859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> tweeted Epic earlier today</a></span>. The tweet was posted alongside a direct callout to Apple and a gif showing the famous <em>Fortnite </em>banana character, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/even-apple-knows-fortnites-peely-is-a-monster-1846860238&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/even-apple-knows-fortnites-peely-is-a-monster-1846860238">Peely</a></span>, giving a death stare. Presumably, at Apple.</p><p>“Later this year <em>Fortnite </em>will return in Europe on iOS through the Epic Games Store. (Shoutout DMA - an important new law in the EU making this possible). @Apple, the world is watching,” Epic tweeted.<br></p><h2 id="h40874"><a id=""></a>Epic’s CEO isn’t happy about Apple’s new rules</h2><p>Of course, Apple allowing sideloading and third-party apps isn’t as simple as it sounds. The tech giant has implemented <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050200/apple-third-party-app-stores-allowed-iphone-ios-europe-digital-markets-act&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050200/apple-third-party-app-stores-allowed-iphone-ios-europe-digital-markets-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a ton of rules and various restrictions</a></span> that could be costly for independent devs and limit just how useful third-party storefronts can be. Epic’s CEO, Tim Sweeney, isn’t happy about the iPhone maker’s restrictions and new policies, calling them “hot garbage.”<br></p><p>“Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1750589570880516402&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1750589570880516402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeney wrote in a lengthy tweet on January 25</a></span>. “They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing <em>Fortnite </em>through it, for example, or block Microsoft, Valve, Good Old Games, or new entrants.”<br></p><p>“There’s a lot more hot garbage in Apple’s announcement. It will take more time to parse both the written and unwritten parts of this new horror show, so stay tuned,” posted Sweeney.<br></p><p>For now, the plan seems to be—despite the terrible rules, according to Epic’s CEO—that the company will bring <em>Fortnite </em>and its store to iPhones in the EU, unless Apple tries to intervene. <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Larian Studios, the team behind the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, recently announced that those who purchased the game's physical deluxe edition for the PS5 in North America will now have to wait until July to receive the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The statement came from the studio's <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1794059975746105362?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" rel="nofollow ">official X/Twitter account</a>. The post reveals that the new delay is due to "production changes" outside the studio's control, and it "had to follow certain processes specifically set by production companies when manufacturing the PS5 discs."

It adds that the title has been in development for at least four years and judging by early details from last year, it may feature a medieval theme.</p><p>id’s next mainline Doom game has been rumored for years, though it has been called a different name in the past. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Leaked Microsoft court documents</u></a> from 2023 revealed something known as Doom: Year Zero. If Doom: The Dark Ages is real, it's likely the final name for that same project. While Bethesda has never officially confirmed that such a project exists, a recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-heavily-rumored-for-xbox-june-showcase-amid-bethesda-trademark-and-other-hints"><u>“IDKFA” trademark filing</u></a> from ZeniMax Media had many fans hoping an announcement could be on the horizon.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/doom-eternal-1716579323349.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>DOOM MAY SOON TAKE PLAYERS TO THE DARK AGES. IMAGE COURTESY OF BETHESDA.</figcaption></figure></output><p>It’s been four years since id unleashed its modern Doom sequel, Doom Eternal, for PC and consoles in March 2020. It’s not been completely quiet in the time since, though, as the studio also released The Ancient Gods Part One and Part Two in late 2020 and early 2021, respectively. Without confirmation that Doom: The Dark Ages is real, it’s probably best to keep expectations low. Either way, we won’t have to wait much longer to see if the rumors hold any weight.</p><p>For more on Doom, you can read <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-final-review"><u>our review of Doom Eternal</u></a>. We loved the way the follow-up brought the FPS franchise into the future, awarding it a 9/10 at the time. We said, “Whether you're a new Doom fan or a veteran one, Doom Eternal is bound to delight &amp; entertain you. It's gloriously fun.”</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

The company added that they're in talks with the manufacturer "to understand whether it is possible to hire extra temporary staff to reduce assembly times."</p><p>The good news is, this delay only seems to affect those PS5 North American copies. In <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1794060178196738449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a follow-up post</a>, Larian said Xbox copies are now shipping, while PS5 EU and Oceania have left their warehouse and should, at the very least, be with the relevant courier.</p><p>Still, Larian was wildly apologetic in its statement today, bemoaning that they had no desire to share "any further news of delay," and adding that they wanted to capture that "nostalgic" feeling of unboxing your newest game in the latest physical release of their Game of the Year winner.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/30/shadowheart-1688125651772.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Those who ordered the Baldur's Gate 3 Deluxe Edition on PS5 in North America have a little longer to wait. (Image courtesy of Larian Studios)</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Knowing that there are some of you still waiting to play Baldur’s Gate 3, despite the fact we are unable to substitute physical goods with digital versions, we can only deeply apologise that your preorders have again been delayed," the studio said.</p><p>As Larian alludes to, this is only the latest delay news in regards to the Deluxe Edition on console in particular. At the beginning of May, <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1786064234884862439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larian announced</a> it had to delay the shipping date of North American PS5 orders and all Xbox orders due to production issues, although PC editions had shipped by then. At the time, the studio said they hoped to ship all Deluxe Edition orders by the end of May. </p><p>This is the second physical release of Baldur's Gate 3, with the Collector's Edition launching alongside the game's initial release last August. That edition, however, has long been sold out. Larian has assured fans that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-no-need-to-buy-the-baldurs-gate-3-physical-deluxe-edition-from-scalpers-larian-says">there will be plenty of stock to go</a> around when it comes to the Deluxe Edition, advising against turning to scalpers. </p><p>Those who've been waiting for the Deluxe Edition to play Baldur's Gate 3 have plenty to look forward to, at least, as it was easily one of the most-lauded games of 2023. In addition to a bevy of Game of the Year awards, Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">also got a 10/10 from IGN</a>, with Leana Hafer calling it "the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p>Earlier this week, Hellblade 2 launched to shockingly divided reviews. While critics unanimously praised the game for its visual and audible presentation, they were torn on how engaging its gameplay was. It's a topic we touched on in our own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review-hell-and-high-water/1900-6418229/" data-ref-id="1900-6418229">Hellblade 2 review</a>, in which Jessica Cogswell wrote the game is "ultimately undermined by its emphasis on fidelity over story and gameplay."</p><p>In this week's episode of Spot On, Tam and Lucy dig even deeper into the subject and discuss if graphical prowess can ever truly make up for subpar gameplay, as well if there were misconceptions about what exactly Ninja Theory's latest action-adventure game set out to do. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvLWXzmCQto" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XvLWXzmCQto" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest game news. Given the massive video game industry's highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle, there's always something to talk about. Unlike most news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic instead of recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Not much is known about this new entry, but according to the report, it will take place in a "medieval inspired Doom world" and could potentially serve as a prequel of sorts to 2016's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom/" data-ref-id="5000-285543">Doom</a> and 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-eternal/" data-ref-id="5000-483372">Doom Eternal</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kids-on-bikes-second-edition-now-available<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in October 2022, Hunters Entertainment launched a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kids-on-bikes-second-edition-now-live-on-kickstarter">Kickstarter campaign</a> for <em>Kids on Bikes Second Edition</em>. This refinement of the popular urban fantasy TTRPG was a great success, raising <span>$182,049 on an initial funding goal of $20,000. Now, the newest edition is finally coming to retail.</span></p>

<h2><span>The K<em>ids on Bikes Second Edition</em> retail release</span></h2>

<p><span>According to an official press release, <em>Kids on Bikes Second Edition</em> is a TTRPG about everyday people grappling with strange and terrifying forces they can barely comprehend in their backyard. It draws heavy inspiration from similar works like Netflix's <em>Stranger Things</em> and various short stories by Stephen King.</span></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kids-on-bikes-second-edition-tropes-screenshot.jpg?itok=XkCw3QVN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kids-on-bikes-second-edition-tropes-screenshot.jpg?itok=MDVG9UkT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ready to grab your flashlights again?</figcaption></figure><p><span>Everything you need to play a game of <em>Kids on Bikes Second Edition</em> is contained within this single softcover book. It is meant for 2-6 players ages 13 and up.</span></p>

<p>The latest edition of this urban fantasy TTRPG includes streamlined rules and mechanics. These include refined Powered Character rules, collaborative storytelling sections complete with bike-ride-themed tools, and player-scaleable states for violence.</p>

<p>For Game Masters, <em>Kids on Bikes Second Edition</em> includes an extensive section on creating their unique creatures. If you're a new GM, the book contains a sample module titled "Point Pleasant, New Jersey."</p>

<p>If you have run <em>Kids on Bikes</em> before, some of your older material will work in this new edition. For example, if you own <em>Strange Adventures Vol. 1</em> <em>and 2, </em>they are compatible with the new rules.</p>

<p><em>Kids on Bikes</em> was created by Doug Levandowski and Jonathan Gilmour. The game has been featured on actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-gauntlet-at-garden-rolls-dice-at-madison-square-garden">Dimension20's</a> <em>Misfits and Magic</em>&nbsp;and HyperRPG's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/zac-lim-eubank-and-yellowspoongirl-discuss-strange-world-of-kollok"><em>KOLLOK</em></a>. It has spawned several spin-offs, including the magic school-themed <em>Kids on Brooms</em>, the space fantasy of <em>Teens In Space</em>, and the recently announced <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/kids-in-capes" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Kids In Capes</em></a>.</p>

<p>Kids on Bikes Second Edition is available <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/kids-on-bikes-core-rulebook-second-edition/?_kx=0vMXQ_-Jo-jAcQc31HOmfUJDKpV16mYMPjcGq2WzfBs.WUk6qc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right now</a>. It is currently being sold at an MSRP of $39.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24164022/george-miller-hideo-kojima-mad-max-metal-gear<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="23cgJh">According to a much-circulated red-carpet comment, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa</em></a> director George Miller would love <a href="https://x.com/hideo_kojima_en/status/1788859151319507304?s=46">his number one fan</a> Hideo Kojima to make a Mad Max video game. “You know, I’m one of those people that I’d rather not do something unless you can do it at the highest level,” Miller, who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24057164/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-state-of-play">has an acting role in Kojima’s forthcoming <em>Death Stranding 2</em></a>, told <a href="https://x.com/gamingbible/status/1792566156810756105">Gaming Bible</a>. “I’ve just been speaking to Kojima here [...] and he would take it on, but he’s got so much fantastic stuff in his own head that I wouldn’t ever ask him.” It’s a courteous professional compliment, from one auteur to another, that humbly assumes Kojima has better things to do.</p>
<p id="tULClF">My first thought was to agree. Whatever you think of Kojima and his games, he definitely has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22688402/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-ps5-changes">a distinctive vision</a>, and his work carries a strong personal imprint. Making a movie adaptation seems like a waste of his talents, even for such a movie-obsessed creator. You wouldn’t expect George Miller to make a Metal Gear Solid movie, would you?</p>
<p id="2cYeDf">My second thought was: Damn, a George Miller Metal Gear Solid movie would be <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p id="5Sd76W">My third thought was: Isn’t it a double standard, even a kind of snobbery, to consider Miller and Kojima above adapting each other’s work? Nobody would bat an eyelid at the prospect of a famous movie auteur (like, say, Paul Thomas Anderson) adapting a novel (like, say, Thomas Pynchon’s <em>Vineland</em>, which Anderson is <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/is-paul-thomas-andersons-mysterious-big-budget-new-leonardo-dicaprio-film-an-imax-thomas-pynchon-movie">rumored to be making</a> at the moment). An adaptation like that is seen as a conversation between two great artists, one bringing their own perspective to the other’s work. But we’ve been primed to think of movie-to-video-game crossovers (and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23669990/super-mario-bros-movie-review-references">the reverse</a>) as mere brand extensions — because they mostly are. (Including the not-bad-not-great <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/8/31/9190443/mad-max-review-ps4-playstion-4-xbox-one-pc-windows">2015 <em>Mad Max</em> game</a>, which Miller told Gaming Bible “wasn’t as good as [he] wanted it to be,” earning <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1793611234249482268">an annoyed response</a> from one of the developers.)</p>

<p id="ScvXSe">In his comments about Kojima, Miller dared to dream of something better. So let’s go along with that platonic ideal of adaptation and assume it’s possible, if only because it should be. Is Kojima really the right fit for Mad Max? I’m not sure. Miller’s world is famously one of few words. (Anya Taylor-Joy says she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/movies/anya-taylor-joy-furiosa.html">went months on <em>Furiosa</em>’s set without speaking</a>.) </p>
<p id="xBazVN">Kojima’s worlds… are not that. The Mad Max aesthetic is anarchic, rude, unapologetically metal. The Kojima aesthetic is techno-organic, militarized, sinister but tasteful. Kojima’s gameplay is painstaking and obsessed with detail; Miller’s action filmmaking is about big gestures on an empty canvas of desert. I think Kojima would smooth Mad Max out, flatten its pop iconography with too much world-building.</p>
<p id="LY5X4X">The other way around, though — imagine a Metal Gear movie with the dialogue stripped to the bone, the nuclear dread implied rather than spelled out in philosophizing monologues, the imagery punched up even further. Consider what it would look like if Miller’s talent for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161947/mad-max-fury-road-doof-warrior-origins-furiosa-george-miller">flamboyant introductions to outlandish characters</a> was applied to the great Metal Gear antagonists, like Psycho Mantis. Think of the crazed intensity he would get his actors to bring to Kojima’s operatic spy narrative. Realize that Miller would insist the prop department build an <em>actual working Metal Gear mech</em>.</p>
<p id="9Z5CWo">It could never work, of course. Apart from anything else, Miller would have to work with Konami rather than Kojima Productions on the project, and Konami, which has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/1/17067982/metal-gear-survive-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc">not shown a good grasp</a> of Metal Gear’s appeal since an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/12/16/10220356/hideo-kojima-konami-explainer-metal-gear-solid-silent-hills">acrimonious split with Kojima</a>, might not get it. I’m sure there are many reasons development of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/22153421/metal-gear-solid-movie-solid-snake-actor-oscar-isaac-jordan-vogt-roberts">the actual Metal Gear Solid movie</a> has stalled, but I bet Konami is one of them.</p>
<p id="CnhA8e">So no, I’m not seriously suggesting George Miller, who will be 80 years old next year, should spend his time making a Metal Gear Solid film. He, too, has got too much fantastic stuff in his own head. But just imagine. It would rule. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163194/dont-starve-board-game-preview-kickstarter-release-date-price<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vnaZ8n"><a href="https://glasscannonunplugged.com/">Glass Cannon Unplugged</a>, a publisher known for board game adaptations of video games such as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/25/17281672/frostpunk-steam-pc-impressions"><em>Frostpunk</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22913452/dying-light-2-review-techland"><em>Dying Light</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24062132/apex-legends-season-20-breakout-respawn"><em>Apex Legends</em></a>, has ambitious plans for its next crowdfunding project. This time the Polish studio is tackling <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/5/29/4362838/the-birth-and-re-birth-of-klei">Klei Entertainment</a>’s breakout hit from the 2010s with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/dont-starve-the-board-game/"><em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em></a>. But what does a roguelike survival game even look like on the tabletop? Polygon recently spoke with both teams of creatives about defining the board game’s relationship to the original and exploring the mechanics that will help bring this physical object to life.</p>
<p id="mCL6BH"><em>Don’t Starve </em>is a multi-platform, third-person video game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/26/4439118/dont-starve-review-eat-to-live">first published in 2013</a>. In it, players take on the role of a wild-haired scientist named Wilson who gets trapped in a dim, parallel dimension known as the Constant. They explore bizarre landscapes; craft weapons, tools, and structures; and make food in hopes of keeping Wilson alive and his sanity intact. Drawing from disparate influences such as<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23681749/minecraft-legends-review-action-strategy-army-overworld-piglins"><em>Minecraft</em></a> and Tim Burton films, the game has a steep learning curve spiced with permanent character death. But it developed a rabid following nonetheless, thanks in part to a rich narrative layer. </p>
<p id="Y7LQt8"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24112612/dont-starve-the-board-game-announcement-price-release-kickstarter"><em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em></a> is a highly modular design with many interlocking systems. The most basic is the map itself, which — like much of the game assets — will feature original art created by Klei. Players will explore that map hunting for resources, and eventually attempt to flee from it in the game’s final rounds. The current build uses rectangular playing cards to represent different biomes, which are then laid out onto a hexagonal grid to create the map. The result is a landmass with unique paths and chokepoints — the perfect environment for a tense exploration game.</p>
<p id="Q6PKJT">Players control their characters from a sideboard, which tracks their health, hunger, and sanity. They also have an inventory, which includes items worn on the body, items held in the hands, and items stuffed inside a small backpack. As in the video game, much of the gameplay revolves around scavenging biomes and fighting monsters, all in the hope of collecting the resources needed to complete ever more complex tasks and recipes.</p>
<p id="VqnZio">“The thing we wanted to focus on in <em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em> was actually the feeling of exploration,” explained lead designer Rafał Pieczyński. “Going into the unknown, exploring the areas, having fun with your friends as well, but sharing a little bit of knowledge, a little bit of discovery [between] the playthroughs. With every single game you learn something new, you go further into the story, or [discover] the things that might happen.”</p>

<p id="2m3QX2">One of Pieczyński’s innovations on this project is in combining both a linear campaign and a series of one-off scenarios. It’s not a legacy-style game, and nothing in the box is permanently altered or destroyed. But there can be carry-over from game to game.</p>
<p id="MVuJOf">“You will be able to play [it] as a campaign game, or as a scenario-based game, or both at the same time,” Pieczyński said. “It’s quite [a] unique construct in that way. And the progression from the campaign will be saved [between] playthroughs [allowing players to] affect the world permanently.”</p>
<p id="asg3dX">According to Glass Cannon CEO Jakub Wiśniewski, the tabletop adaptation began — as most board games do — as an unthemed prototype. The system was built by a young designer named Natanel Apfel, who’s now a visual effects artist at Riot Games. Apfel’s core design, as well as the revisions carried out by the current lead designer Pieczyński, who took over the project, eventually won out.</p>
<p id="FDyd6h">“Nate is an avid board game player,” Wiśniewski said. “He showed us a prototype, and we were like, ‘Holy smoke, this is really good survival! Maybe we should think about something like this!’” Before long, the team reached out to 11 bit studios, who they’d worked with previously on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/14/16146006/this-war-of-mine-the-board-game-review"><em>This War of Mine: The Board Game</em></a>. That studio, headquartered in Poland just like Glass Cannon is, played the good neighbor and was able to broker an introduction to Klei’s team in Canada.</p>
<p id="yXDkLl">“When we spoke,” Wiśniewski said, “[Klei] had already rejected a lot of prototypes, both internally and externally.” </p>
<p id="4zBYBi">“There was clearly a lot of love and care put into how the game both looked and played even in the early prototypes,” said Corey Rollins, head of marketing at Klei. “They also explained to us their process for designing a tabletop game and it was very similar to how Klei has been using Early Access as a core part of our DNA. [...] It seemed like a more natural fit to work with Glass Cannon.”</p>
<p id="HQfHx8">In a campaign, players can carry over the resources, recipes, and even some of the things that they’ve constructed from game to game. Just as in the video game, crafting options will unlock and expand over time to provide new short-term goals as well as enabling the larger narrative to unfold. But players must always pay close attention to those three core stats of health, hunger, and sanity (they may not start each game quite as healthy or sane as they might like to be).</p>

<p id="AektLi">Like any good survival game, hunger may be the most important stat of all. With a full stomach, players will receive more Focus Tokens, which allow you to re-roll dice. Focus Tokens can turn the tide in the game’s dice-based combat.</p>
<p id="6eeGER">All of this means that, like many other Glass Cannon projects, <em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em> is a fairly literal interpretation of the moment-to-moment action found in the video game. That design ethos has been both a boon and a burden for this team in the past. For instance, in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/14/16146006/this-war-of-mine-the-board-game-review">Polygon’s review of <em>This War of Mine: The Board Game</em></a>, a title co-designed by Glass Canon’s CEO Wiśniewski, we noted that it was a pretty tough sell for those who hadn’t already played the original — or for those who already owned the original and could play that instead. The same can be said of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/25/17281672/frostpunk-steam-pc-impressions"><em>Frostpunk: The Board Game</em></a>, although that title seems to have fared much better with consumers.</p>
<p id="nAM0nP">Wiśniewski says that this time around his team is designing <em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em> with board gamers, not video game players, more firmly in mind.</p>
<p id="g9Ev9P">“<em>Don’t Starve</em> is such an incredible work of art, because the game overlaps on so many levels,” Wiśniewski said. “Not only the art, the music, but also the design, the story, how it’s hidden, how they go about each peculiar detail. Getting rid of some aspects would [...] not do it enough justice. So we’d rather have extra work on our side thinking how to serve it on a more digestible platter than cut things and lose them as we go.”</p>
<p id="EmizCX">“The fun thing for me is that a lot of people that have seen the game, they feel like it’s a literal adaptation of the game, but it’s amazing that with all the streamlined rules that the game itself isn’t really that hard to play,” Pieczyński said.</p>
<p id="U6obUQ"><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/dont-starve-the-board-game/"><em>Don’t Starve: The Board Game</em></a> will come to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157232/kickstarter-wonders-of-the-first-forsaken-controversy">Kickstarter</a> for its initial round of funding this fall, with the current goal to ship the game by the fourth quarter of 2025. The team also tells Polygon that at least seven languages will be available at launch, including English, German, French, Polish, Spanish, Italian, and Czech. Pricing has not yet been determined. </p>

On one hand, its narrative and goals require that sometimes comically large numbers be hit in order to make progress. The game creates <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-liberated-1851379768&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-liberated-1851379768">incredible story beats</a></span> because it has been able to throw hundreds of thousands of players working in unison at fabricated problems, which has helped propagate word about the game. On the other hand, there once was an engaged player community that was more than happy to mobilize and try to meet the ludicrous demands, in part because roleplaying the whole affair made it a fun thing to do with other players. Now though, the recent kick-up, as well as several <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-warbond-battle-pass-weapon-bad-1851467213&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-warbond-battle-pass-weapon-bad-1851467213"><em>other </em>unfortunate missteps</a></span>, have soured a good deal of what’s left of the community.</p><p>There are some obvious solutions to this, like Arrowhead lowering the numbers for these major orders to adapt to the fluctuating player count. This’d be the easiest answer to <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s current situation and seems like a surefire way to ameliorate issues with the fanbase that’s ripping itself apart at the moment, and tearing the game a new one while they’re at it. It’d be unprecedented though, as <em>Helldivers 2 </em>doesn’t often throw its players a bone, and it risks signaling what the community has already become privy to: its numbers are going down. Had the studio been looser with some of its goals in the past, a tactic like this might go over without a word, but now it needs to hold onto the players who have stuck by it.</p><p>Players on the <em>Helldivers 2 </em>subreddit have been posting through some of their anguish. One user succinctly posted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cz9sgd/the_last_few_major_orders_in_a_nutshell/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cz9sgd/the_last_few_major_orders_in_a_nutshell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meme of a vicious cycle</a></span> where the studio locks new content behind major orders which are then failed which then leads to diminished player counts over less content and feeds back into the first point. In another subreddit, someone shared a post asking, “We’re really gonna fail back to back major orders??” These major orders are also simply the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Arrowhead’s ongoing issues, including the number of regions the game still has not returned to and its constantly shifting balance which has been upsetting players for months.</p><p>If the studio decides to hold, it isn’t impossible to imagine that the current major order won’t be completed, either. Though the playerbase does have the extended holiday weekend to complete it, so it’s just as likely that they come through with all that extra time, so it could really go either way. The completion or failure of this next major order could be a fortuitous sign of the times to come or a grim omen. At the end of the day, the numbers will spell out <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s future, and I really hope they bring some good news come next week. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 6 Will Be On Last-Gen Consoles]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-last-gen/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-will-be-on-last-gen-consoles.881022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-last-gen/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Information regarding Black Ops 6 has surfaced online—specifically, concerning the game’s pre-order status at GameStop. In an image shared online, it appears that GameStop is preparing to accept pre-orders for Black Ops 6 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X consoles.</p>



<p>That means it’ll be appearing on a console that many considered defunct almost four years ago, when the PlayStation 5 was released. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has been able to verify with multiple sources that the image is legitimate and that Black Ops 6 will be coming to past-generation consoles. As for why the image does not feature an Xbox One version, it’s understood that the Series S|X version is a cross-generation version, meaning it will also work on the Xbox One.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming first learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2024-past-generation-consoles/">Cerburus (Black Ops 6) was being developed for past-generation consoles in February 2023</a> but wasn’t able to confirm whether it was final. However, after speaking with several Gamestop employees and developers of the game, we can now confirm it’s real.</p>



<p>You can see the image below:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>NEW: GameStop has listings for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 preorders, and it mentions a PS4 version </p><p>Looks like BO6 will be on last-gen still </p><p>Source: Reddit | u/Oufp4 <a href="https://t.co/v5DtNcp3lV">pic.twitter.com/v5DtNcp3lV</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1794089299589132780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Last year’s Call of Duty title – Modern Warfare 3 – was released on last-gen consoles as well as the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC platforms. It was a general assumption that it would surely be the last Call of Duty title on old-gen consoles, but with Call of Duty essentially using the same engine moving forward, it’s hard to see why they would move away.</p>



<p>As for if the game will be coming to the Nintendo Switch (as Call of Duty will now come to Nintendo platforms for 10 years as a part of the Activision / Microsoft deal), Insider Gaming understands that this will begin with the Nintendo Switch 2, which is presumably set to launch next year.</p>



<p>The information will likely be confirmed when the Call of Duty showcase takes place on June 9.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As the community update continued, the team went on to explain how paid DLC will be handled:</p><p dir="ltr">"Hence, we're happy to confirm that there aren't any microtransactions in Space Marine 2. No in-game cash shop. All gameplay content and features will be free to all players. Any paid DLCs will be cosmetic only."</p><p dir="ltr">Sylvain Le Roux, a senior brand manager at Focus Entertainment, also echoed this statement <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/no-microtransactions" rel="nofollow ">in an interview with PCGamesN</a>. Le Roux went on to say that the team plans to implement season passes similar to other games, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>, where everything players earn is cosmetics only. They then continued by saying, "All of the gameplay additions, whether it's new missions or new enemies, all of that will come for free to all players."</p><p dir="ltr">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will launch on September 9 and be playable on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

<p data-characters="280" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are a lot of trophies available in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> and one of them, POWER! asks you to sit on the highest chair in Jinzhou. While this isn’t the most difficult to achieve, this chair can be hard to track down, but don’t worry, I’ve found it, and I can guide you there.</p> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">To find the chair, you’ll need to get up to the top of the tallest mountain in the area of Jinzhou, that much should be obvious, but this will require a lot of climbing, waiting for your stamina to refill, and then climbing all over again. There are a few different routes you can take, but I think I’ve found the easiest one.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-power-trophy-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to get the POWER! trophy in <em>Wuthering Waves</em></strong></h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/POWER-trophy.png&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">To begin your long journey to the chair, head to the Theater where the Liondance performance takes place and find the waterfall located behind it. Travel under the waterfall and follow the path there forwards and upwards as far as it will take you.&nbsp;Here’s the location of the waterfall on the map:</p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/waterfall-location.png&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">Once you reach the end of the path, you’ll need to start climbing upwards. It doesn’t necessarily matter where you climb upwards, it all leads to the same peak and once you’ve there, you’ll find yourself overlooking a chasm. On the other side, the opposite cliff face will have some broken wooden walkways.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">The easiest way to make this jump is to use your Glider and head slightly to the left, where the wooden walkway is hanging down. If you’re lucky, you can turn a sharp right and grab onto the hanging section of the walkway and begin to climb up. Even if you’re not lucky, you’ll be able to start climbing again from the platform just below.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">Follow the wooden walkway until you come to this seating area at the top. None of these chairs are the highest in Jinzhou, but you can take a rest and admire the view from here if you want. While you’re here, there’s a Resonance Beacon that you should activate and, on top of the canopy above the seating area, there’s a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-use-sonance-casket-in-wuthering-waves/">Sonace Casket</a> for you to pick up.&nbsp;</p>

Here, you’ll find a chair and a bull. The bull will run at you before disappearing, leaving you free to take a seat on the ‘chair with a daunting aura’. Once you’ve done this, you’ll unlock the POWER! trophy and receive five Astrite for your efforts.</p>

			<p><strong>Update:</strong> According to insider NateDrake/NateTheHate, Doom: The Dark Ages will be a multiplatform title with a PS5 release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">To expand upon the report with some additional information:</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages will be announced at the Xbox Games Showcase next month and will be revealed as a multiplatform release -- Yes; it's coming to PlayStation 5. <a href="https://t.co/7l0Zxb4vcN">https://t.co/7l0Zxb4vcN</a></p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1794109253856161986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Original story: There have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-franchise-announcement-hinted-at-by-bethesda-trademark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of clues recently</a> that the announcement of the next entry in the legendary <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom</a> series may be forthcoming, and now, a fresh set of rumors have potentially revealed more about what we can expect. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/41814-2doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to dependable insider Tom Henderson</a>, the next big entry in id Software’s franchise is indeed coming soon and will be known as Doom: The Dark Ages.</p>
<p>Per Henderson, Doom: The Dark Ages has been in development for roughly four years, which makes sense, as Doom Eternal came out in 2020. The game was developed under the codename “Year Zero,” and The Dark Ages subtitle is quite literal, as the game is said to feature a “medieval inspired Doom world.” Beyond that, we don’t know all that much – will the Doomslayer be doing some time traveling? Or, given the Year Zero codename, could this be a prequel, showing an earlier Doomslayer taking on demons in a historical setting? Regardless, it sounds like those who found 2016’s Doom and Doom Eternal perhaps a little samey are in for something a bit different.</p>
<p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt for now, but Henderson rarely misses, and again, multiple reliable sources are pointing toward a Doom reveal at the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> in June. Xbox has been facing quite a bit of blowback from once-loyal fans, as&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-flatlining-europe-publishers-questioning-support-ps5-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series X/S sales flatline</a>, they&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-ps5-xbox-exclusives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring former exclusives to other platforms</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close studios responsible for acclaimed games like Hi-Fi Rush and Prey</a>. The Xbox Showcase will provide a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first look at the next Call of Duty</a>, and possibly the next Gears title, so adding Doom to that lineup really would make it an exciting show for shooter fans.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase will be streamed on June 9. What do you think? Excited to go medieval on some demons? Or does the concept sound a bit strange?</p>

Throughout the game you’re quizzed by Thwomp twice on the goings on of the game. If you’re paying attention, they aren’t too difficult, but if you’re coming back from an absence or are simply absent-minded, here’s some help.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-chapter-1-thwomp-quiz-answers" data-injectable="false">Chapter 1 Thwomp Quiz answers</h2> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">Your first quiz in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> happens early.

  <p id="ZzcrR4">The <strong>best echoes</strong> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/24163081/wuthering-waves-codes-how-to-redeem-redemption"><em>Wuthering Waves</em></a> will not only make your team stronger, but also unlock new gameplay options for you, and even allow for different team compositions.</p>
<p id="Q83Gai">Echoes are essentially the armor system in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, and while they do offer a chance to unleash incredible powers, they’ll also have stats and passive buffs attached to them too. You’ll want to mix and match these to get the right Sonata Effects for your character’s abilities, like boosting Spectro damage on Rover, your main character, and things of that sort.</p>
<p id="gkpWLe">Below, we detail the <strong>best echoes in </strong><em><strong>Wuthering Waves</strong></em> and show you where to find them.</p>

<p id="T71MqF">For this guide, we’re going to focus on the raw power of echoes, which means we’re going to be talking about <strong>Overlord</strong> and <strong>Calamity</strong> echoes. At a glance, here are the best echoes in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="S4RC2z">Mourning Aix</li>
<li id="NOFZwd">Feilian Beringal</li>
<li id="VxNT28">Bell-Borne Geochelone</li>
<li id="znNmHX">Impermanence Heron </li>
<li id="Cnj5TW">Mech Abomination</li>
<li id="mbqKnw">Inferno Rider</li>
</ul>
<p id="06hoor">These echoes are the strongest in the game, with a four-cost associated with them — this also means you’ll need to be fairly strong to take them on in the first place, so keep that in mind. You’ll be able to get higher rarities as you level up your Data Bank too, which means they’ll come with bigger stat boosts. You can only have a total Echo cost on a character of 10 to begin with, so picking a strong main echo is essential.</p>
<p id="RBC9QG">Let’s break down why these echoes are the best, and where you can find them.</p>

<p id="WBxZU5">Mourning Aix is a powerful echo that will perform two heavy-hitting Spectro-infused attacks. After dealing damage, it’ll boost the current Resonator’s Spectro damage and Resonance Liberation damage by 12% for 15 seconds, which is a worthwhile buff. This makes this echo an excellent choice for the Spectro Rover, who can deal some pretty decent damage.</p>
<p id="wjqoFt">You can find this echo to the <strong>south of the map near Fallen Grave</strong>.</p>

<p id="u8EDBt">If you’ve gone for the five-star character Jiyan, then you’ll want an Aero echo worthy of them. Feilian Beringal is that echo, and strikes out at enemies when used, performing two hits if it connects. Along with that, it’ll boost your Resonator’s Aero damage and heavy attack damage by 12% for 15 seconds too.</p>
<p id="PLaqf6">You can find this echo to the <strong>south in the Dim Forest region</strong> among the trees there.</p>

<p id="j6jIss">In most gacha games, your main defensive options are healers and shielders. Bell-Borne Geochelone falls into the shielder category. It gets a big boost based on defense, which means it works well with characters like Taoqi who want a lot of defense already. Along with a big chunk of Glacio damage, it also grants a 15-second shield that provides a damage boost and substantial damage reduction.</p>
<p id="VTI10c">The Bell-Borne Geochelone is to the <strong>northwest of the map, just south of the Gorges of Spirits area</strong>. </p>

<p id="S9EUs4">Sometimes you just need to turn into a demonic bike rider, and that’s what Inferno Rider has covered. Inferno Rider transforms you into the demonic biker, but also allows you to launch up to three slashes, and will then boost Fusion damage and Basic Attack damage by 12% for 15 seconds.</p>
<p id="dWgWez">Inferno Rider is in the <strong>Sea of Flames, to the west of the map</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="7W0B3T"><strong>Best Echo Summon event choices in Wuthering Waves</strong></h2>
<p id="qHoCPD"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> has a <a href="https://wutheringwaves-echoes.kurogames-global.com/">special event</a> running through June 6 that’ll allow you to actually summon an echo into the game. Taking part in this event grants you some astrite, which is nice, but it also lets you pick an echo. Basically, you have to complete daily missions online to do some summons, and each time you do this you can unlock new echoes. </p>
<p id="uXfsFI">You can also share these with friends, so make sure you’re talking to your mates to share any good ones you all get. There are a lot of options here, and there are no really bad choices as long as you have a rough idea of what to go for. Generally speaking, you’ll want to go for a yellow-rarity echo, because that’ll actually benefit you in-game thanks to the Data Bank experience it gives you.  </p>
<p id="15QaFq">We recommend picking your favorite one from among any yellow-rarity options you’ve unlocked, but if you get lucky, that can still leave you with a lot of choices. Good general DPS choices are the <strong>Violet-Feathered Heron</strong> and <strong>Cyan-Feathered Heron</strong>, along with the <strong>Autopuupet Scout</strong>. For more supportive choices, <strong>Viridblaze Saurian</strong>, <strong>Chasm Guardian</strong>, and <strong>Spearback</strong> are all good options. </p>

As expected, some people are thrilled to see more digital nudity, while others are stamping their feet upset that Shift Up hasn’t given them what they wanted, which is uh, free speech and digital tits. Ya’ll know porn exists, right? (And the people there don’t wear <em>any</em> clothes.)</p><p><em>Anyway</em>, should you want to grab these revealing new outfits, or try on the other new ones which, in my opinion, are far more tasteful, cute, and sexy, read on.</p><h2 id="h4176"><a id=""></a>Buy the new outfits from Roxanne in Xion</h2><p>When you fire up <em>Stellar Blade </em>after updating to version 1.003, you’ll see a notice for two new outfits <em>and</em> a new feature that allows you to remain locked on to an enemy after firing at them with Eve’s drone gun thingamajig. </p><p>White Kunoichi and Black Kunoichi (which are some rather cute nano threads, honestly) simply need to be crafted at the Repair Console. </p><div><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shift Up / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><p>But the more revealing, and controversial, outfits you’ll have to buy with some Vitcoin. The info-dealing marketeer Roxanne has ‘em in her shop inventory. Midsummer Redhood and Midsummer Alice, outfits which leave very little to the imagination, can be purchased from Roxanne for 10 Vitcoin a piece. </p><figure id="" data-id="daf26df0cb46e6e2a9f97897fcbee7a5" data-recommend-id="image://daf26df0cb46e6e2a9f97897fcbee7a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eve wears a revealing outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eve wears a revealing outfit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Pictured: Midsummer Alice outfit.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shift Up / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="daf26df0cb46e6e2a9f97897fcbee7a5" data-recommend-id="image://daf26df0cb46e6e2a9f97897fcbee7a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eve wears a revealing outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve been playing <em>Stellar Blade</em> fairly regularly, you’ll likely have enough to grab these items. If not, simply grab some sidequests from NPCs in Xion and head out to finish ‘em. Not only will you get Vitcoin for completing the sidequests, but you’re also likely to come across Vitcoin from opening chests you come across. </p><p>The same is true of the materials you’ll need to craft these threads. The polymer materials can be found in crates scattered throughout the playable areas. Pulsing your drone by pressing the touchpad is an easy way to spot them as you traverse the environment. In general, you should be keeping your eyes peeled for resources and collectibles while playing <em>Stellar Blade</em> anyway.</p><h2 id="h4177"><a id=""></a>How to unlock the Neurolink Suit</h2><figure id="" data-id="c13b6592d756629fb1a2b543f908c9d7" data-recommend-id="image://c13b6592d756629fb1a2b543f908c9d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1975" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eve wears a shoulder-less outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eve wears a shoulder-less outfit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shift Up</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c13b6592d756629fb1a2b543f908c9d7" data-recommend-id="image://c13b6592d756629fb1a2b543f908c9d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1975" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eve wears a shoulder-less outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the best additions to <em>Stellar Blade</em> by way of the new update is the Boss Challenge mode. Not only is this a fun way to continue to play and get better at the game, but it’s another opportunity to unlock a new outfit for Eve. The Neurolink Suit, which just might be my new fav from Eve’s closet, will unlock after you kill each boss in Boss Challenge mode on Normal difficulty or higher.</p><hr><p>While the Free <em>Stellar Blade</em> movement is having its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/FMRi_dZ_sgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/FMRi_dZ_sgw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cute little spat</a></span> about whether or not they’ve actually accomplished anything with their impassioned digital efforts, it is nice to see <em>Stellar Blade</em> continue to get some updates well after release. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Possibly as early as next week.</p>

            <p>
A new entry in Sony's beloved Astro Bot series is reportedly in development and set to be officially unveiled very soon.
</p>
<p>
That's according to extremely reliable PlayStation leaker Billbil-kun, <a href="https://www-dealabs-com.translate.goog/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489">writing for Dealabs</a>. Word of a new Astro Bot game first surfaced earlier this year via journalist and prolific leaker Jeff Grub, but Billbil-kun says the project - in development at Astro Bot studio Team Asobi - is set to be formally unveiled within the next two weeks.
</p>
<p>
Details are limited but it's claimed the new Astro Bot - likely be called exactly that - is partly set in a desert environment and will feature a robot character resembling a fennec fox.

<p>
While Billbil-kun is hedging their bets by suggesting an official announcement will arrive within a fairly broad two weeks window, other reports - including <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1793156746976039017">one from XboxEra journalist Nick Baker</a> - have been more specific, pointing to a new PlayStation showcase of some description airing next Tuesday, 28th May.
</p>
<p>
Billbil-kun <a href="https://www-dealabs-com.translate.goog/magazine/du-nouveau-a-propos-de-concord-la-prochaine-exclusivite-de-playstation-51320">previously reported</a> Sony was readying to give PlayStation fans another look at FireWalk Studios' PvP live-service shooter Concord "very soon", suggesting that could be another showcase announcement if reports are true.
</p>
<p>
As for Astro Bot, the series has gained a bit of a following over the course of two well-liked games - 2018's PSVR title Astro Bot Rescue Mission and 2020 PS5 pack-in Astro's Playroom - so a return for the little robotic fella is well overdue.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163967/gamer-night-how-to-find-time-for-video-games-schedule<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="4833Z6">These days, anybody who talks to me about video games hears a key phrase in my lexicon. “Oh, I watched my friend playing that at Gamer Night.” “I have to install it in time for Gamer Night!” “I finally finished it during Gamer Night last night.” Since 2020, my Thursday night has been Gamer Night, and it has changed everything for me.</p>
<p id="lMm1sc">This is not just me bragging about having friends, although I am very grateful to have them. If you were a lonely kid growing up, like I was, you can probably relate to how amazed I feel to have consistent friendships, let alone a yearslong standing commitment to meet up (virtually) with the same group of people every week. You might be thinking, <em>I don’t have any friends who would want to do that.</em> Or you might be thinking, <em>We’re all too busy for that.</em></p>
<p id="oVs1DW">I thought all of those things, too, and not that long ago. Before it became enshrined in my life as a standing weekly commitment (albeit one that any of us can miss, since there are four of us, and Gamer Night is just as fun with three or two), the whole idea of Gamer Night seemed unnecessary and maybe even impossible, scheduling-wise. Before Gamer Night, I had more of a freewheeling approach to playing games. Every now and then, there’d be a cool multiplayer game I wanted to try, and I’d sometimes manage to convince a few friends to play it with me. That would always involve some irritating scheduling shenanigans, and it would almost never happen as often as any of us wanted it to. That was a perfectly fine way to live. But I had no idea how much <em>better </em>it could be.</p>
<p id="gVjTGi">Gamer Night was born in my own life as the result of organizing a player group for a multiplayer game. It started in the fall of 2019, when two friends and I got super into <em>Destiny 2</em>, which has a lot of three-player co-op activities. This led to us trying some raids, which are more high-intensity cooperative multiplayer activities in <em>Destiny 2</em> that require six people and therefore a lot of scheduling coordination. In the end, that was far too much of a lift for us all to maintain, but in the process, we landed on a weekly night for four of us who cared most about the idea of getting together consistently in a Discord voice call and gaming together. We chose to call it “Gamer Night” because it was funny. It stuck.</p>
<p id="6c1MDV">It didn’t take long for Gamer Night to evolve into an even more ideal format. It’s no longer a weekly event for multiplayer games — not necessarily, anyway. It’s still a night for playing games with friends, but that doesn’t necessarily mean all of us are playing the same game. We might be playing four totally different games. Two of us might be playing an <em>Overwatch 2</em> match together while somebody else watches the match and the fourth person plays <em>Elden Ring</em>. Three of us might watch a fourth person playing <em>Dark Souls</em>, offering advice as needed, or just shooting the breeze about our lives. All four of us might not even play a game at all and instead just watch a Twitch stream of a game and talk shit about it. All of these activities are Gamer Night.</p>
<p id="vdmIdP">Perhaps the most important part of this is that Gamer Night is only two hours, at least for me. I show up at 7:30 p.m. and I leave at 9:30 p.m. (Tragically, I have found that if I play a video game too late into the night, I can’t sleep — hence the early sign-off for the sake of my sleep hygiene.) Sometimes my friends start earlier or they end later, and as I said before, sometimes one of us can’t be there. But it almost always happens, because the results are rewarding. The point originally was to have a time to play games together, especially multiplayer games, without the scheduling hassle — but it’s ended up being something that has bonded the four of us together even more than when we started, which is impressive given that we all already liked each other quite a bit.</p>
<p id="HXILwE">And so I leave you with this directive: Schedule a weekly Gamer Night. It’s two hours — it starts when you’re done eating dinner, and it ends before you need to get ready for bed. You’re making the time to play video games, which is fun, but you’re <em>really </em>making the time to be with your friends, which is even better. You won’t regret it. </p>

The first, a deceptive Metroidvania from developer Billy Basso is an absolute shock. It’s not that anybody thought the game would be bad, it’s just that nobody realized the game hadn’t revealed its true self. While <em>Animal Well</em> is a typical Metroidvania requiring you to explore the map as you gain new abilities, there are additional gameplay layers that are more puzzle-focused—one is about hunting down hidden eggs across the map, and the other revolves around finding rabbits with the help of other players. </p><figure id="" data-id="1bc6f371c649576f20ee0ca39c04d857" data-recommend-id="image://1bc6f371c649576f20ee0ca39c04d857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bunch of eggs sit on a display case" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bunch of eggs sit on a display case" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bigmode</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1bc6f371c649576f20ee0ca39c04d857" data-recommend-id="image://1bc6f371c649576f20ee0ca39c04d857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bunch of eggs sit on a display case" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>SFB Games’s <em>Crow Country</em> isn’t as groundbreaking as <em>Animal Well</em>, but its loving ode to the puzzle-centric gameplay of the original <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-resident-evil-4-remake-re4-village-survival-horror-1850329503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-resident-evil-4-remake-re4-village-survival-horror-1850329503"><em>Resident Evil</em></a></span> offers a different variation on the same theme.<br></p><p>Cut to one week later and Simogo’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a></span> helped solidify that May would be a special month.

It’s a brain teaser that stretches your problem-solving just as much as it does your narrative comprehension. </p><p>This parade of releases closed out with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paper-trail-origami-puzzle-game-impressions-1851497194&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paper-trail-origami-puzzle-game-impressions-1851497194"><em>Paper Trail</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669"><em>Duck Detective: The Secret Salami</em></a></span> on May 21 and 23, respectively. <em>Paper Trail</em> is a straightforward rush through origami-inspired challenges that task you with folding the in-game map, while<em> Duck Detective </em>is a parody of the noir genre in the form of an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-the-kotaku-review-1829797772&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-the-kotaku-review-1829797772"><em>Obra Dinn</em></a></span>-like.

For those who like their puzzles a bit simpler and with a side of action, <em>Crow Country</em> is a passable <em>Resident Evil</em> clone. The beauty of <em>Duck Detective</em> is its comedic tone. Finally, <em>Paper Trail</em> is pure mechanical puzzle fodder. That’s a lot of options for fans of the genre itching to sink their teeth into something, and they are all different enough that you can enjoy them all without getting burnt out. And to top it all off, each title is relatively short compared to the dozens of hours-long RPGS that are so often the focus of the AAA scene. <em>Lorelei</em> and <em>Animal Well</em> are the longest and can take closer to 20 hours to finish but the likes of <em>Duck Detective</em> can be finished in an afternoon.</p><p>With June approaching it’s impressive to see how fantastic May’s releases were, especially considering all of these titles are indie games.

<p>Insider Gaming understands that the next game in the DOOM franchise is set to be revealed during this year’s Xbox Games Showcase on June 9. The game, which has been under the codename/placeholder title ‘Year Zero’ is understood to have the final name ‘DOOM: The Dark Ages’ and has been in development for at least four years.</p>



<p>Last year, I heard of early details of the next entry into the DOOM franchise, which was described to me as a ‘medieval inspired doom world’. While that doesn’t necessarily give much information to go on, ‘year zero’, ‘the dark ages’, and ‘medieval inspired’ starts to paint a vivid picture of where the series could be going next. Perhaps we’ll be taking more of an early look at the Doomslayer’s life during the medieval times? A prequel of sorts?</p>



<p>Earlier this year, rumors began to swirl again about a new DOOM game, following Bethesda’s newly <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/983/49/idkfa-98349237.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered trademark</a>, ‘IDKFA’, a well-known cheat code in the series. Last month, The Verge’s Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first teased</a> that DOOM would be making its way to the Xbox Games Showcase, a rumor that we can now independently verify.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The DOOM series has been a tremendous success for Xbox and ID Software. In 2020, a LinkedIn description from an ID Software employee claimed that the game made over $450 million in revenue.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on a new DOOM game? Are you looking forward to a Medieval setting with DOOM: The Dark Ages? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

From the beginning, Nintendo has been at the forefront of creativity and innovation in the home console space. Nintendo is known for its vast library of treasured IPs, with many offering the same charm dozens of years later. With so many <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">upcoming titles</a>, the company is showing no signs of slowing down. Below, we've rounded up every single console Nintendo has ever released. Journey through the ages and discover how Nintendo has continued to push the gaming medium forward!</p><p><em>Looking to save on a new Nintendo Switch or new titles for your system? Be sure to check out the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals"><em>best Nintendo deals</em></a><em> available today.</em></p><h2>How Many Nintendo Consoles Have There Been?</h2><p>In total, <strong>thirty-two Nintendo consoles</strong> have been released throughout Nintendo's history of releasing games. We've included revision models for both home and handheld consoles, which include brandings like XL and Mini. </p><h2>Every Nintendo Console in Order of Release</h2><h3>Color TV-Game - June 1, 1977</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/color-tv-game-15-cut-out-1716345449193.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Color TV-Game line of systems was Nintendo's first foray into gaming hardware and one that you might not necessarily be aware of. These devices were a joint venture by Nintendo and Mitsubishi Electronics, with the latter involved as Nintendo was inexperienced at developing hardware. These systems were a major success at the time and ultimately led Nintendo to divert its focus to developing more gaming hardware. Almost fifty years later, the Color TV-Game's legacy is still felt, with Nintendo invested more than ever in gaming.</p><h3>Game &amp; Watch - April 28, 1980</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/06/15/screenshot-19-1623775260430.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo's first foray into the handheld market was with its Game &amp; Watch devices, each loaded with a different game. While you might not think much of it, the Game &amp; Watch series sold over 40 million units worldwide. These devices brought many gaming revelations that are still utilized today, such as the D-Pad in the Donkey Kong Game &amp; Watch. These consoles made a comeback somewhat recently when Nintendo released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-and-watch-legend-of-zelda-edition-review">limited edition models</a> in 2020 and 2021 to celebrate the anniversaries of Mario and Zelda. </p><h3>Nintendo Entertainment System - October 18, 1985</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/03/15/nes-1552660016473.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Nintendo Entertainment System (<a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-nes-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NES</a>) is the first Nintendo home console to be released in North America. Known as the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan, this console implemented cartridges to allow users to purchase and play as many games as they'd like on the system. Almost all of the major Nintendo franchises we know and love got their starts here, with series like Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid. Overall, the NES is one of the most important consoles in video game history, as it established a pipeline for generations to come.</p><h3>Game Boy - July 31, 1989</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/game-boy-1600799758869.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The first true Nintendo handheld video game console is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-game-boy-games">Game Boy</a>, which released in North America during the Summer of 1989. Game Boy took a major step forward from the Game &amp; Watch, offering cartridges so you could play as many games as you'd like on the system. For many, the Game Boy's most well-known game is Tetris, which was bundled in with the system in every region with the exception of Japan.</p><h3>Super Nintendo Entertainment System - August 23, 1991</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/snes-1600799793659.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (<a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-snes-games/71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SNES</a>) brought 16-bit graphics to a Nintendo platform for the first time. This console was when Nintendo began crafting major evolutions for their biggest series, with games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-world">Super Mario World</a>, Donkey Kong Country, and more. Despite launching toward the latter part of this console generation, the SNES still managed to be the best-selling console of this time period with its profound software lineup and generational appeal.</p><h3>Virtual Boy - August 14, 1995</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/07/06/virtual-boy-1625611419819.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Virtual Boy is quite possibly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looking-back-at-the-virtual-boy-nintendos-most-famous-failure">Nintendo's weirdest console</a>. This portable device was the first ever video game console that could properly display 3D visuals. A mere 22 titles were ever released for the system, with games like Mario's Tennis, 3D Tetris, and Virtual Boy Wario Land among the most popular. Virtual Boy only lasted on the market for one year, with just under 800,000 units sold in its lifetime. </p><h3>Game Boy Pocket - September 3, 1996</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/game-boy-pocket-1716349909809.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Game Boy Pocket is a smaller version of the Game Boy, featuring a definitive black and white screen instead of the Game Boy's green tinted display. One of the biggest improvements of this release was the new hardware inside that improved the response time of the display on screen. However, with the smaller design, the Game Boy Pocket had a shorter battery life than the Game Boy.</p><h3>Nintendo 64 - September 29, 1996</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/07/21/nintendo-64-1500631268292.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo 64 brought 3D graphics to a Nintendo home console for the very first time. This revolutionary device offered two of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-n64-games">most influential titles ever</a> with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>. The N64 completely refreshed what the NES and SNES offered, with a bold new controller that featured an analog stick for the first time. N64 is one of the few consoles where Nintendo offered many iconic special editions, with multiple translucent variants available.</p><h3>Game Boy Light - April 14, 1998</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/game-boy-light-fl-1716350129414.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Game Boy Light is a console you might not be too familiar with, and a large part of that is likely due to it being exclusive to Japan. This Game Boy revision was bigger than the Game Boy Pocket, but added a new backlight so players could play in low-light areas. Ultimately, this change allowed for the Game Boy Light to feature longer battery life than the Game Boy Pocket, with around 20 hours in total.</p><h3>Game Boy Color - November 18, 1998</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/10/04/game-boy-color-1538683004317.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Game Boy Color finally brought color to Nintendo's handheld side, offering a new way to experience portable gaming. The device is backwards-compatible with all Game Boy games, so it was an easy upgrade for many. Some Game Boy games had support for color already, so titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/12/23/tetris-review">Tetris</a> could be experienced anew with bright and beatuiful colors. With the new hardware inside, hundreds of new games were also released exclusively for the system. </p><h3>Game Boy Advance - June 11, 2001</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/02/08/gameboyadvance-1-1675896557183.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-game-boy-advance-games">Game Boy Advance (GBA)</a> was the first massive technological leap forward in the Game Boy brand for Nintendo. In a major shakeup to the previous Game Boy models, GBA flipped the device orientation to a horizontal, rectangular shape versus the portrait-designed Game Boy. 16-bit graphics were now available portably, with a major upgrade from the Game Boy's 8-bit graphics support. Of course, Game Boy and Game Boy Color games were also supported via backwards compatibility. This opened the number of games available on GBA into the thousands. </p><h3>Pokémon mini - November 16, 2001</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/hxjrjcvqtrcpgbqm-large-1716352090482.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: GamesRadar</figcaption></figure></output><p>Pokémon mini released in 2001 with a major focus on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-pokemon-video-games">Pokémon games</a> (as the name implies). This device is so incredibly small that you can fit multiple in your pocket. Only 10 games were ever released for Pokémon mini, with just four in North America. Pokémon mini featured a built-in clock function, an infrared port for communication, and built-in rumble. </p><h3>Nintendo GameCube - November 18, 2001</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/11/11/gamecube-1636641945871.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-gamecube-games-of-all-time">Nintendo GameCube</a> built upon the success of the Nintendo 64 and followed up with sequels to many of the beloved titles found on the system. Super Mario Sunshine, The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate are all three titles that shined on the system. GameCube made a major departure from Nintendo's prior home consoles, as it utilized discs instead of cartridges. Additionally, the controller made major improvements from N64, with built-in rumble, analog/digital triggers, and a staggered design for the sticks. The legacy of the GameCube still lives on today, with many of the franchises that debuted on the title more popular than ever. Looking at you, Animal Crossing.</p><h3>Panasonic Q - December 14, 2001</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/10/04/panasonic-q-1538683004339.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/04/09/panasonic-q-review">Panasonic Q</a> is a collaborative console between Panasonic and Nintendo. This device combined a traditional GameCube with a DVD player, allowing for users to play GameCube titles, watch DVDs, and listen to CDs. Its design is striking, with a stainless steel exterior and a front LCD panel. Due to a steep price point and low sales, the console only lasted two years on the market. </p><h3>Game Boy Advance SP - March 23, 2003</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/game-boy-advance-sp-1716353293492.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Game Boy Advance SP (GBA SP) was the first revision of the Game Boy Advance. A major change from the previous model was the hinge design, which placed the screen on the top panel and the controls on the bottom panel. Additionally, the GBA SP featured a chargeable battery and a backlit screen (exclusive to later models), which were both major improvements from its predecessor. Nintendo opted to omit a headphone jack on this model but offered an adapter for players to listen to audio through headphones.</p><h3>Nintendo DS - November 21, 2004</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/nintendo-ds-1600799790019.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-ds-games">Nintendo DS</a> was the first unit in the DS line, which marked the start of Nintendo's best-selling console. The DS featured Wi-Fi support for the first time, with a standout clamshell design that expanded upon the Game Boy SP. With two screens, games on Nintendo DS were quite unique, with many developers creating experiences unlike anything on the market previously. The bottom screen was a touchscreen that players could use with the included stylus pen. </p><h3>Game Boy Micro - September 19, 2005</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/10/04/game-boy-micro-1538683004320.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Game Boy Micro was famously revealed by Reggie Fils-Aimé <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/17/e3-2005-meet-game-boy-micro">during E3 2005</a>, with many shocked at the small size of the system. The rectangular design featured a D-pad and two buttons on the front, with Start and Select buttons on the bottom side of the unit. Like previous GBA models, Game Boy Micro was backwards compatible with Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, in addition to playing Game Boy Advance titles. Game Boy Micro featured a backlit screen that allowed for adjustable brightness and even lighting across the screen. The system only sold 2.42 million units across 18 months, where production was then ended. </p><h3>Nintendo DS Lite - June 11, 2006</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/ds-lite-1600799752097.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo DS Lite was the first revision of the Nintendo DS. This model released just under a year and a half after the initial launch of the Nintendo DS, and it brought a few changes to the fold. First, the DS Lite is slimmer and lighter than its predecessor. The screens are also both noticeably brighter than the standard DS, which made games easier to see regardless of lighting conditions. Lastly, the battery life was much improved on Nintendo DS Lite to allow for more playtime without the need for a charge.</p><h3>Nintendo Wii - November 19, 2006</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/03/15/wii-1552660016484.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wii-games">Nintendo Wii</a> marked a huge resurgence for Nintendo's home console business, with a unique focus on motion controls that sold many on the system. The unique Wii Remote relied heavily on motion to control the system, utilizing both infrared and digital technology to input motion from all directions. Nintendo released all sorts of accessories for the system from the Nunchuk to the Wii MotionPlus. Wii was backwards compatible with both GameCube titles and controllers, since the Wii utilized optical discs once again. One of the defining software offerings of Wii was Virtual Console, which allowed players to purchase NES, SNES, and N64 titles for digital download.</p><h3>Nintendo DSi - November 1, 2008</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/dsi-1600799753983.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/04/06/nintendo-dsi-review">Nintendo DSi</a> made a few changes to the Nintendo DS, acting as the second major revision of the model. It added two cameras, one on the hinge inside and one on the outside panel, which were utilized in games and in certain software. An SD card slot was also added to provide additional storage for downloaded games. Unfortunately, the Nintendo DSi also removed the Game Boy Advance slot that was present on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS Lite.</p><h3>Nintendo DSi XL - November 21, 2009</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/23/dsi-xl-1600855226482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/26/nintendo-dsi-xl-review">Nintendo DSi XL</a> was a larger model of the DSi that launched a year after the main model. This device featured larger, wide-view screens that both sat at 4.2 inches. Two speakers were added to the top panel to provide better, clearer sound for players, and a bigger battery for longer playtime. With the larger screens, Nintendo DS games were brighter and easier to experience than ever.</p><h3>Nintendo 3DS - March 27, 2011</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/02/22/13-nintendo3ds-1487795926939.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/19/nintendo-3ds-review">Nintendo 3DS</a> was the successor to the Nintendo DS line, offering a wide variety of new features, games, and hardware capabilities. The key feature of 3DS was the 3D capabilities, which were powered by stereoscopy so no eyewear was required. Interestingly enough, this is the same technology that was used to power the Virtual Boy, which only lasted on the market for one year in 1995. 3DS was a massive upgrade from Nintendo DS, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-nintendo-3ds-games">many impressive titles</a> like The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, Fire Emblem: Awakening, and Super Mario 3D Land. </p><h3>Nintendo 3DS XL - August 19, 2012</h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/01/06/3ds-xljpg-886496.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo 3DS XL (known as Nintendo 3DS LL in Japan) featured a screen that was 90% larger than the original 3DS. This console retained every feature of the Nintendo 3DS and simply offered a larger screen. Many games were much easier to view with this model, especially with the bottom screen. </p><h3>Nintendo Wii U - November 18, 2012</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/18/wii-u-1600452641372.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/30/wii-u-review-2014">Nintendo Wii U</a> was the successor to Nintendo Wii, featuring an all-new GamePad controller. This controller featured a screen and could be used to play titles off of the TV. All previous Nintendo Wii games, accessories, and controllers were compatible with the system. Wii U was Nintendo's first-ever console to support HD, which was a major step up from the 480p capabilities of the Wii. There were some incredible titles released for the system, including Xenoblade Chronicles X, Super Mario 3D World, Splatoon, and Bayonetta 2 to name a few. Ultimately, a combination of poor marketing and confusion led to poor sales of the Wii U, which left Nintendo in a crucial state prior to the launch of Nintendo Switch.</p><h3>Nintendo Wii Mini - December 7, 2012</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/10/04/wii-mini-1538683004340.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Wii Mini was a smaller, lighter Wii unit that was released at the very tail end of the Wii's life cycle. Wii Mini featured a top-facing disc drive, which was a huge departure from the standard Wii. Additionally, it removed support for GameCube, Wi-Fi connectivity, 480p resolution, and SD cards. This console launched in Canada during December 2012, with releases in Europe and the United States in 2013.</p><h3>Nintendo 2DS - October 12, 2013</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2016/11/13/r2ds1jpg-f9b629.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nintendo 2DS offered exactly what it sounds like - fun, 2D content. This device removed the 3D capability present on 3DS models and instead flattened out the console to a square-like shape. All 3DS titles are playable on 2DS, with all features minus 3D intact. The console did lose considerable sound quality, as the speaker onboard was swapped for a mono speaker versus a stereo speaker. However, with the extremely low price point, Nintendo had to cut costs somewhere.</p><h3>New Nintendo 3DS - October 11, 2014</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/new-3ds-1600799785491.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>New Nintendo 3DS made significant upgrades to the standard 3DS, with new controls, features, and platform support. Nintendo added the C-Stick, ZR and ZL buttons, and NFC support for amiibo with this release. While the New Nintendo 3DS launched across Japan, Australia, and Europe in late 2014 to early 2015, North America did not receive this standard version until September 25, 2015. </p><h3>New Nintendo 3DS XL - February 13, 2015</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/09/22/new-3ds-xl-1600799787766.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Released before New Nintendo 3DS in North America, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/21/new-nintendo-3ds-3ds-xl-review">New Nintendo 3DS XL</a> was a larger version of the revised 3DS model. Although the standard model did feature bigger screens than the standard 3DS, the 3DS XL had even bigger displays, which allowed for more immersive games. The New 3DS XL made a major change from the smaller model as it removed the ability to change face plates. Many felt this limited customization, though Nintendo did offer mutliple special editions for players to purchase.</p><h3>Nintendo Switch - March 3, 2017</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/nintendo-switch-1716322594558.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-review-2018">Nintendo Switch</a> fully realized the vision of the Wii U and completely propelled Nintendo to the top of the industry once again. The Switch operates as both a home and portable console, with the ability to play games wherever you go. The same grand experiences you were used to on consoles can now be played in a park, on a plane, or in your bed. With arguably the best first party library of any Nintendo console, Switch has seen some of the greatest games of all time be released on it. There have also been quite a few <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-special-edition-nintendo-switches-you-can-buy">special edition Nintendo Switch consoles</a> that have been released throughout the years.</p><h3>New Nintendo 2DS XL - July 28, 2017</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/07/19/new-2ds-xl---button-1500486486400.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/14/new-nintendo-2ds-xl-review">New Nintendo 2DS XL</a> was a major update to the 2DS. Additions for this model included an analog stick, shoulder buttons, amiibo support, and more. 2DS XL also moved back to the signature clamshell-hinge design, which was a departure from the flat panel used for 2DS. This console was also able to play New 3DS titles, which included games like Xenoblade Chronicles 3D and Fire Emblem Warriors. </p><h3>Nintendo Switch Lite - September 20, 2019</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/07/10/screen-shot-2019-07-10-at-95455-am-1562770862571.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/nintendo-switch-lite-review">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> shrunk down the body of the Nintendo Switch, utilizing a 5.5 inch LCD screen. The major change with this model was the removal of Joy-Con, as the controllers are now built-in on the sides of the console. As a result of these changes, the Nintendo Switch Lite is only playable in handheld mode and cannot be docked to a TV. This allowed Nintendo to cut costs and charge $100 less for the Lite model. </p><h3>Nintendo Switch OLED model - October 8, 2021</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/02/01/nintendo-switch-button-2022-1643705916959.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> debuted alongside Metroid Dread in October 2021. This premium Switch increased the size of the screen to 7 inches, while also adding a new premium OLED panel. In addition to these features, the speakers and kickstand were also reworked for this device. The OLED model released alongside a new dock, featuring rounded corners and a built-in LAN port. </p><h2>Upcoming Nintendo Consoles</h2><p>With the Nintendo Switch in the midst of its seventh year on the market, Nintendo's next console is on the horizon. In fact, current Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-nintendo-switch-2-before-april-2025">confirmed</a> in May 2024 that Nintendo would reveal details on its next generation console sometime during Fiscal Year 2025. </p><p>This console, referred to by many as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, is expected to offer power somewhere between a PlayStation 4 Pro and an Xbox Series S. Additionally, backwards compatibility and 4K support through <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-nvidia-dlss-meaning">DLSS</a> are two major features expected to be available. Nintendo Switch 2 will likely release in early 2025 based on multiple reports from this Spring.</p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

Part of the unannounced title is said to take place in a desert area with a new character described as a “fennec fox in the form of a robot” that shares some similarities with Astro. IGN understands the rumor to be accurate.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/astros-playroom-1716570051780.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>ASTRO'S PLAYROOM LAUNCHED IN 2020. IMAGE COURTESY OF PLAYSTATION.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Dealabs report adds that the title may simply be named Astro Bot and expects it to be released exclusively for PS5 and not PSVR 2. Asobi's next game has been rumored for some time, as in 2021, the studio published <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-dev-team-asobi-launches-new-website-teases-most-ambitious-game-yet"><u>a job posting that teased its “most ambitious game yet.”</u></a> The studio later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-developer-is-working-on-its-biggest-ever-game"><u>doubled down on this</u></a>, saying that its next project will be its “biggest to date.” Asobi <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-asobi-official-playstation-studios-dev-new-logo"><u>cemented itself as a PlayStation studio in 2021</u></a>.</p><p>With Summer Game Fest set to kick off in the next few weeks, it’s no surprise to hear that PlayStation has some announcements in the cards. A PlayStation showcase of some kind has been rumored for weeks as well, with many believing that Sony will announce a summer presentation sooner rather than later. However, it’s probably best to keep expectations tempered until a PlayStation event is officially revealed.</p><p>Astro Bot has appeared only a handful of times in the last decade and is usually used to highlight PlayStation hardware features. Astro Bot Rescue Mission, a game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/05/astro-bot-rescue-mission-review"><u>we gave a 9/10</u></a>, wowed PSVR users upon its release in 2018. Then, with the launch of the PS5 in 2020, users were treated to Astro’s Playroom, a platformer that dived into PlayStation history while putting a spotlight on the DualSense controller’s features. We gave it an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-ps5-review"><u>8/10 in our review</u></a>, saying, “Astro's Playroom is a great showcase for the varied, impressive ways the DualSense can immerse you in next-gen games.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Astro's Playroom PS5 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>It's hard to say exactly how the next Astro game will build upon Asobi’s previous work, but the team seems to at least be confident in what it’s been working on for the last few years.

<p data-characters="205" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The World Series of <em>Warzone</em> returns for another year, featuring a $1 million prize pool, and hours of exhilarating matches for fans to tune into. Here is everything you need to know about the competition. </p> <p data-characters="557" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">In 2023, Activision hosted the first-ever global in-person tournament for <em>Warzone</em>, bringing together the 50 best teams in the world to compete for a chance at taking home a lion’s share of the $500,000 prize pool. The dynamic trio of Biffle, Sage, and Shifty emerged victorious yet have since <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/some-of-warzones-most-dominant-players-may-have-found-their-third-in-another-champion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disbanded</a>. Biffle and Shifty went on to pick up Hisoka, forming one the most exciting teams in competitive <em>Warzone</em> history. All eyes will be on the newly formed team, but there are plenty of other squads to keep an eye on heading into the qualifying stages. </p>
 <p data-characters="107" data-current-count="107" data-injectable="false">Without further ado, let’s jump right into what fans should expect from this year’s iteration. </p> <h2 id="h-world-series-of-warzone-2024-schedule-and-where-to-watch" data-injectable="false">World Series of <em>Warzone</em> 2024 schedule and where to watch </h2> <figure data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Starting on May 24 competitors from the NA and EMEA regions will compete in an Online Qualifier open to any trio who wants to compete. From<strong> 9 AM to 3 PM PT On May 24-26</strong>, the 10 best scores for each team will be counted toward their score. The top 68 teams from the two regions will advance to the next stage. </p> <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">As for APAC and LATAM teams, they have until <strong>June 13th </strong>to sign up for a 136 trio tournament featuring three rounds of custom lobby matchups. </p>
 <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="133" data-injectable="false">There will then be an extended online qualification pathway with a group stage, for which 68 trios will qualify, from&nbsp;<strong>June 4-12</strong>.</p> <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">Some streamers will be live during their own matches, but Activision will also have a broadcast on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Call of Duty </em>Twitch channel</a>. </p> <h2 id="h-wsow-2024-prize-pool" data-injectable="false">WSOW 2024 prize pool</h2> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true">There will be a <strong>$1 million prize pool</strong> for World Series of<em> Warzone </em>2024. Activision did not reveal how the prize pool will be divided throughout the tournament, but it was confirmed that the <strong>Solo YOLO Winner will get $50,000</strong>. </p>
 <p data-characters="127" data-current-count="127" data-injectable="false">In addition, Activision also confirmed that the Global Final prizing has been changed to shift more earnings to the top spots. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">WSOW 2024 format </h2> <figure data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Group play takes place over a two-week window with each group playing other groups once in a match featuring five different Warzone rounds. The top performance will be based on total points accumulated during the 15 group play drops. The top 34 teams from group play will play each other in the Upper Bracket, whereas the bottom 34 teams from group play will play each other in Round 1 of the Lower Bracket.</p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">From there, the top 17 teams will move on to the Quarter Finals. Meanwhile, the teams who didn’t advance will drop in a second round of bracket play. Out of 34 teams, 17 more teams will advance to the Quarter Finals and 10 teams will have one more chance in the Last Chance Qualifier. </p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">In the Quarter Finals, 10 teams move on to the finals, and the remaining 24 will drop down into the Last Chance Qualifier. In the Last Chance Qualifier, three out of 24 teams for each region advance, and there will be a sixth map offering up a Wildcard Map, where the winner will also move on to the Global Final. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">WSOW Global Final format</h3> <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="123" data-injectable="false">The World Series of <em>Warzone</em> Global format will use the match point format instead of the previous multiplier-based system. </p> <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">the match point format awards one point per elimination and a separate set amount of points based on placement. For example, squads earn 15 points for placing first or 10 for placing second.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">Eliminating the multiplier makes it easier for fans to track how many points their favorite team has. Once a team reaches 100 points, they must win an additional match to secure the victory officially. As a result, multiple teams can reach the 100-point threshold, and winning one final game becomes an intense finish. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-internet-should-not-scoff-at-genshin-impact-wuthering-waves-comparisons/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-internet-should-not-scoff-at-genshin-impact-wuthering-waves-comparisons<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="327" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re aware of <em>Genshin Impact</em>, chances are, you’ve heard about its recent competitor, <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. If so, in the next breath, you’ve probably heard <em>Wuthering Waves</em> cursed into oblivion for its obvious similarities to <em>Genshin Impact</em>. It’s an old gripe, given scale thanks to the nature of fandom.</p> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">Practically any time even a distant comparison is brought between the two games, the Internet turns into a firestorm of anger. It doesn’t matter what social platform you’re on, the unadulterated disdain for perceived knock-offs is everywhere, but it’s often unfair and unwarranted. There are formulaic inspirations in both; a traceable pattern of taking tried-and-true design decisions and successful service models and implementing them into something new. </p>
 <p data-characters="670" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">The reality is that both games <strong>are </strong>similar. I’ve played both. A lot. Genshin since release and <em>Wuthering Waves</em> for too many hours in its last CBT and into its launch. They are similar. This shouldn’t be seen in a negative light though. It is good for a monolithic game like <em>Genshin Impact</em> to have competition in the space, forcing excellence through a natural market shift. It is a positive thing that customers, the players, get to decide which of the two games is superior as they sustain those live service models. If the players decide that <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is the better of the two games, then <em>Genshin Impact<strong> </strong></em>will eventually be forced to make changes. <br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Genshin-Impact-Scenary.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="756" data-current-count="1056" data-injectable="true">Think about this. When multiple games vie for a player’s attention, developers are automatically incentivized to push boundaries and enhance gameplay experiences. This ultimately benefits us players as we get to enjoy more high-quality games. It benefits the developers too, because they are then given crucial feedback for gameplay elements, directly from their competitors without a word being uttered. It is crucial for all in the space to remember that <em>constructive</em> criticism and feedback help elevate developers to improve their games. Instead of resorting to hatred spawned from “High School Mentality” toward a perceived rivalry, an open dialogue can lead to positive changes and genuine advances in the gaming industry as a whole.</p>
 <p data-characters="676" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">When comparing these two games, players shouldn’t rush to take sides like they’re choosing teams in high school sports. I get it, with the Gacha system, it’s tough not to feel invested. Still, let’s pause and look at each with an open mind. Who cares if they’re similar? They still have enough differences to be their own thing, appealing to different parts of the same crowd in the end. There’s no need for all the hate when both games can learn from each other, especially since they’re live service titles. They can iterate on changes at any given moment based on the competition. Isn’t that what everyone wants in the end?<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wuthering-Waves-vs-Genshin-Add-1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <div data-characters="1235" data-current-count="1535" data-injectable="true"><p>We often see these perceived “copycats” in gaming because successful game mechanics and concepts tend to inspire other developers to create similar experiences. What determines the meaning of success? The players do. This phenomenon is driven by the desire to capitalize on proven formulas that have captivated audiences, reducing the risk associated with innovation. The iterative nature of game design encourages active refinement and evolution of popular ideas, leading to new titles that, while similar, often introduce unique twists and improvements. <em>Wuthering Waves </em>is he literal example of this concept. The competitive market further fuels this trend, as developers strive to meet player expectations and industry standards, which are often set by groundbreaking games, I.E: <em>Genshin Impact.</em></p><p>While it’s natural for fans to feel protective of their favorite games, fostering healthy competition and embracing diversity in the space benefits everyone involved, from developers to players. So instead of pooling up all this disgusting hatred, let’s celebrate the abundance of creativity, the freedom of game choice, and the innovations that come from consumer choices in the gaming industry as a whole. </p></div>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Regardless of your allegiance to either community, it’s time to abandon the notion of <em>Genshin Impact</em> or <em>Wuthering Waves</em> being adversaries. Instead, let’s embrace the competition between them, as it promises to enrich the gaming landscape for all involved. I’m committed to this mindset, and if someone as headstrong as myself can adopt it, surely you can too.</p>
