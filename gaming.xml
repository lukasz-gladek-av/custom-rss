			<p>Striking Distance, the studio behind The Callisto Protocol, has unfortunately been struck with more layoffs, as confirmed by parent company Krafton. The information began surfacing online earlier today, with former Director of Concept Art Jesse Lee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing a post</a> on Linkedin, saying "most of the devs were laid off."</p>
<p>It was then confirmed later in the day by Krafton, where they gave a statement to PC Gamer about what had happened. Krafton has declined to put a number on the amount of layoffs that had been made but said that they were done to keep the team "agile."</p>
<p>"<em>Striking Distance Studios has reduced the size of its team to remain agile, which creates a sustainable environment for the studio at its current stage of development. The studio remains operational, and these changes will not impact any planned ongoing support. No further changes are planned at this time,"&nbsp;</em>said a representative.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not the first round of layoffs that Striking Distance has experienced. Layoffs took place in August 2023, where 32 people lost their jobs. The Callisto Protocol was a mixed bag out of the gate, with a lot of people having <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-pc-experience-is-an-unacceptable-stutterfest/">issues with stuttering</a>, especially on PC. The game had some pretty high-end demands. However, the game was a significantly smoother experience on a console. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/">Kai Tatsumoto reviewed the game</a> two years ago and gave it a 7.2.</p>
<p>With the failure of The Callisto Protocol, <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-leaves-striking-distance-after-the-callisto-protocols-failure/">Glen Schofield</a> left Striking Distance in September 2023, which was just over a month after layoffs took place.</p>
<p>Striking Distance then made a top-down shooter after The Callisto Protocol, but that game also failed, with an all-time peak concurrent player count on Steam of 169. Considering how much money went into developing The Callisto Protocol, with the game costing over $<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-reportedly-cost-over-160-million-to-make/">160 million</a> to make and then not performing as well as they had hoped, this was devastating news for the company.</p>
<p>There is now news that the company is reportedly working on a new title that is being developed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-working-on-a-brand-new-unannounced-unreal-engine-5-title/">Unreal Engine 5</a>. Lead Gameplay Programmer of Striking Distance has on his LinkedIn profile that he is "leading a team of 12 gameplay engineers" to make this upcoming title.</p>
<p>So far, this year has already seen a devastating amount of layoffs across a number of companies, both big and small. Most recently, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/"> entire Marvel Rivals team</a> was laid off, as well as a significant number of staff at <a href="https://wccftech.com/bossa-games-scales-back-team-focusing-on-lost-skies-development/">Bossa Games</a>.</p>

But director Maho Aoki’s <em>Dragonite and the Special Delivery</em> also feels like a reminder to thank your mail carriers for all the hard work they do. Produced by CoMix Wave Films — the studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/15/23678724/makoto-shinkai-suzume-interview"><em>Suzume</em></a>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113522/weathering-with-you-review-climate-change-makoto-shinkai">Weathering With You</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/7/15209584/your-name-love">Your Name</a></em> — <em>Dragonite and the Special Delivery </em>tells the story of Hana (Riko Fukumoto), a young Paldean postal worker who dreams of becoming an expert deliveryperson.</p><p>While most deliverypeople get the chance to venture out into the world, as a letter sorter, Hana’s days are usually spent behind a desk with her partner Fuecoco. But when Hana happens to find an unaddressed letter from a young boy who is trying to wish his traveling father a happy birthday, she recognizes it as an opportunity to prove that she has what it takes to become one of the postal system’s greats like a certain friendly Dragonite.</p><p>The short spotlights how it takes all kinds of specialized human and pokémon labor to keep the inter-regional postal system running smoothly. Unsurprisingly, CoMix Wave’s take on the pokémon world is a visual delight that makes all of the short’s creatures look downright majestic regardless of whether they’re ordinary or legendary monsters. The short also features a sweeping shot of Kalos’ Lumiose City and quite a few pokémon capable of Mega Evolution.</p><div><p>Those details could be a nod to the location and mechanic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">both returning in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> (and Flygon<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/twzg0f/oc_why_did_flygons_mega_evolution_have_to_be/"> finally getting its due</a>), but we won’t know for sure until tomorrow morning.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s early 2015, right?</p><p><strong>Zack</strong>: Yeah, May 2015</p><p><strong>John Walker: </strong><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2.</em></p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> <em>Elden Ring </em>and <em>Bloodborne</em> are both contenders as well.</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Soulslikes aren’t RPGs, and I will die on this hill.</p><p><strong>Ken</strong>: Damn.</p><p><strong>Zack</strong>: I say it’s an RPG! Live your life.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Then<em> all games </em>are RPGs. They’re action-adventures.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I mean EVERYTHING is basically an RPG action-adventure game these days.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> If you include <em>Elden Ring </em>then you have to include <em>Horizon Zero Dawn,</em> and that way madness lies.</p><p><strong>Caro: </strong>Soulslikes are definitely RPGs. H<em>orizon Zero Dawn</em> is an action-adventure game. </p><p><strong>John:</strong> NOOOOOOOooooooooooo!</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I’m afraid so.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Welp, there you go. At least we figured this out.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> This is why every game has every tag on Steam now. [Sad face emoji]</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> What is an RPG is a blog, I think.</p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> A VGchat is happening before our eyes...</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> We should do two blogs.</p><p>-Of Course, <em>Elden Ring</em> Is An RPG</p><p>And then like an hour later:</p><p>-No, <em>Elden Ring</em> Isn’t An RPG</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong> Caro: </strong>Like, <em>Dark Souls/Elden Ring</em>, etc are not even subtle, they are RPG-ass RPGs, with all kinds of stat minutiae. </p><p><strong>Ethan Gach: </strong>You have levels and stats. D&amp;D has like five elements, anything with at least 2 of them qualifies. </p><p><strong>John:</strong> So <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> counts!</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> No.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I mean, personally, I gave up on trying to actually define RPGs as every definition either cut out games that are def RPGs or included everything.</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Dialogue choices, Quests, and XP. </p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Because, yes, <em>Horizon </em>would be an RPG by that definition. It has all of that.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> It’s very simple. Everyone just asks me, and I decide.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong><em>Call of Duty </em>only has XP.</p><p><strong>Zack: </strong>New <em>Call of Duty</em> games have dialogue options...</p><p><strong>John:</strong> But given this, should Kenneth’s list not include <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>?</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong> No, that’s definitely not an RPG, it’s an action-adventure.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>All adventures have action. Not all action is an adventure.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>Haha, I think Carolyn has already implemented the “You just ask me” rule, but is trying to hide it.</p><p><strong> Zack: </strong>That’s my rule with RPGs. I’ll know it when I see it, etc.</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit: </strong>Well to me an “adventure” game is <em>Monkey Island.</em></p><p><strong>John: </strong>Yes!</p><p><strong>Caro: </strong>Hence why I call these action adventures.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach: </strong>Adventure game = ZzzZzz</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Damn.</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="30865dc166199dd32cd86b610b4f08c3" data-recommend-id="image://30865dc166199dd32cd86b610b4f08c3" data-format="gif" data-width="474" data-height="379" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Columbia Pictures / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30865dc166199dd32cd86b610b4f08c3" data-recommend-id="image://30865dc166199dd32cd86b610b4f08c3" data-format="gif" data-width="474" data-height="379" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>John Walker: </strong>I was about to say that the death of “adventure” as a meaningful genre has devastated me. And now even “point and click” doesn’t mean anything, because every cunt on Steam thinks this means “game with cursor.”</p><p><strong> Caro: </strong>I think adventure games are okay these days. We got the <em>Crimson Diamond</em> last year, we’re getting <em>Kathy Rain 2</em> this year. </p><p><strong> John: </strong>Oh no, they’re great. But everyone calls EVERYTHING “adventure” now. To the point where it doesn’t mean anything.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> What would be an “action” game? Not action adventure, but just action.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> <em>Vanquish </em>is an action game.</p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> Damn what if I threw a curveball and said Pokemon Legends: Arceus, like an absolute mark.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>Remember when you clicked on things governed by arbitrary logic in order to get story pellets dispensed like a rat being jerked around a maze?</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Ethan, go to your room.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I love pixel hunts and mashing every item I have onto something in the desperate hopes of moving forward.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>Zack, join him.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Every genre has bad games in it.</p><p><strong>Zack: </strong>RPG has a lot of bad games in it as it has everything in it these days. As we’ve established concretely in this discussion.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>(Also, Carolyn, don’t forget <em>Old Skies</em> comes out soon!)</p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> Or what if I said <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>is one of the best RPGS of the decade like an equally huge mark.</p><p><strong>Zack: </strong>That’s an RPG!</p><p><strong>Carolyn: </strong>I mean you can make that argument! It’s not one I’d agree with but you can make it.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Oh I didn’t realize there was any debate about it.</p><p><strong>Caro: </strong>Oh I’m not saying it’s not an RPG, I’m saying it’s not a good one.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Ah, well, I agree with that. Lol. </p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>It’s an immersive open-world shooter.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> <em>Divinity Original Sin 2</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> are definitely the two best RPGs of the last decade.</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>Well until May the only answer is Witcher 3.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>Proper RPGs, not any of your bloody boss-fighting bullshit action games.</p><p><strong> Zack:</strong> CRPGS is the term you are looking for grumpy man.</p><p><strong> John:</strong> Oh, because these others aren’t running on computers? </p><p><strong>Ethan</strong>: <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is an RPG.</p><p><strong>Ken: </strong>Yeah, <em>Divinity Original Sin 2</em> is one of the best of the decade. </p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Nah, <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> is way better than <em>Divinity Original Sin 2. </em></p><p><strong>John:</strong> I forgot <em>Pillars</em>! I don’t think it’s way better, but it’s bloody wonderful.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> After all that lol I ask: What actually makes an RPG an RPG?</p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> It’s not an RPG if it doesn’t let me kiss a man or manage an inventory. Sometimes both.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>An RPG is a game in which I create a character by choosing class and skills (whether pre-named or otherwise) then explore a narrative by taking on quests, combating foes, and choosing my own path through the storyline. Also someone at some point says “forsooth.”</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> An RPG must do at least two of the following: let me make narrative choices, go on quests, customize my character, include some sort of skill checks, or make the numbers go up. <em>Elden Ring</em> nails all five. Also, it’s got dragons. </p><p><strong>Ken:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne </em>is on my list next to <em>Baldur’s Gate 3, Persona 5 Royal, and Disco Elysium. </em>As contentious as that game’s categorization sounds now lmao.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Live your truth. Genres are just another example of humanity trying to organize everything in its never-ending and futile struggle to control the universe.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Naturally, the personalities embodying these players are also larger-than-life warriors of the ring. The players are WWE Superstars Xavier Woods as the Julius Mortem, Kofi Kingston as Adonis Thanaformus, Bayley as Thea Kittleroo, and Chelsea Green as Tabatha.These wrestling giants will be guided by the host and Game Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan.</p>

So it’s just as useful whether you’re storing cards in the home or carrying them out to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the best thing about Quiver Time, though, is the stylish design and attention to detail. They come in a variety of colors to suit your preference and have all sorts of thoughtful little extras. There’s a sheath to keep the zip tabs closed, fully adjustable straps, some card sleeves and removable acrylic dividers and corner cushions to help keep your cards organized. And perhaps most thoughtful of all, 1% of the asking price goes to charity.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More TCG Accessories From Quiver Time: </h3><h2 data-cy="title2" id="bulk-collections">2. GameGenic Dungeon 1100</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best for Bulk Collections</h3><div id="197209" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gamegenic Dungeon Deck Box 1100+</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The Dungeon is ideal for housing a complete card collection and good for accessories too.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve got a bigger collection of cards and want a solid and well-designed stackable box to keep them in, then look no further. Each GameGenic Dungeon can hold a thousand double-sleeved cards, or a few more if you’re happy to box them up “naked”. There’s a middle divider to keep them better organized and make it easier to search through your collection when you need to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lid goes on via a convenient magnetic mechanism which makes it simple to pop on and off but holds strongly and securely when not in use. It also allows for complete removal, making it simple to access all your cards. There’s room above the cards to keep a game board, rules or accessories, and it’s a stylish solution with a smooth exterior and a soft microfibre lining to cushion your cards.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="portability">3. Quiver Time Bolt Card Case</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Case for Portability</h3><div id="197216" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Quiver Time The Bolt Card Case</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>With its roomy interior, handy dividers &amp; 2 carrying straps, the Bolt Card Case gives an easy way to organize &amp; transport your cards. Also comes with 100 Apollo transparent sleeves, sized for all standard game &amp; sports cards.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While Quivers are fantastic all-round cases, they’re a little on the bulky side if you carry your cards around a lot. If you’re just after a case to take out to clubs and tournaments then they make a smaller option, the Bolt, for that very purpose. It holds a little more than half the capacity of its bigger sibling, but that also means it has half the weight and size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In all other respects, it offers the same high quality build and styling of the Quiver, meaning your cards are just as well-packed and protected, only on a smaller scale. And you still get a free pack of card sleeves and 1% of the price to a children's orphan-based charity as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="binder">4. VaultX Exo-Tech Zip Binder</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Binder</h3><div id="197217" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Exo-Tec® Exo-Tec® Binder</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This Exo-Tec® binder is designed to fit a variety of cards and is compatible with all standard card protector sleeves, including Vault X Card Sleeves.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Boxes are not always the best option for storing your cards, not least because it’s difficult to flip through your collection and find the cards you need. Binders make a great alternative: although they hold fewer cards, they fit nicely onto shelves or cupboards and most options contain transparent pages with pockets into which to tuck your cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This binder from VaultX not only contains 20 such pages that hold 9 cards each, but boasts a protective padded cover and heavy-duty zip to keep your cards safe and secure. The standard version is standard black, but it comes in a variety of colors, sizes, and closures, so you can be sure to find one that fits your needs.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="protection">5. Casematix Graded Card Storage Box</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Protection</h3><div id="197218" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>CASEMATIX CASEMATIX Graded Card Storage Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This heavy-duty card carrying case features a hard shell plastic exterior to prevent valuable trading cards from being crushed.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on how valuable your cards are and where you take them, you might feel the need to have a super-secure option to keep them safe. And they don’t come much safer than this Casematix case, with extra-durable hard shell exterior and customisable foam inserts that you can tear to ensure a perfect fit for your most prized cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case closes with a secure mechanism that also ensures its waterproof and airtight for maximum protection. And if that’s not enough for you, it’s designed to take cards in their own protective plastic slabs and there’s also a padlock ring so you can lock things down even tighter with added layers of your own security.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="deck-box">6. VaultX Exo-Tech Side Loading Deck Box</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Deck Box</h3><div id="197219" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Exo-Tec® Exo-Tec® Side Loading Deck Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Comes in several color options! Holds 100 double-sleeved cards, or 120 single-sleeved cards, or 210 un-sleeved cards.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Often, it’s fine to keep your cards in whatever container or case you can rustle up at home, but what you really want is a small, sturdy, premium-build box that you can use when taking a single deck of your precious cards out and about to play. Many brands have starter packs that come with suitable deck boxes for free, but they’re often flimsy cardboard affairs, so it’s better to invest in something a bit more durable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter this excellent option from VaultX. It’s available in a variety of stylish single-color finished, made of water-resistant microfibre. The lid doesn’t clip or slide on and off, as is common, but is held in place with strong magnets, making opening and closing super convenient. And the lid also flips round and magnetizes to the bottom of the box, tidying it out of the way and offering a stable platform to access your cards. You can also mix and match lids and boxes of different colors if so desired.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="budget">7. Fageverld Trading Card Storage Box </h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Budget Option</h3><div id="197220" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fageverld Fageverld Cardboard Storage Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Each Box holds about 620 standard 20pt trading cards and contains 2 packs of 10 dividers each to help sort your trading card or sports card.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For all the fancy protective cases you can buy for trading cards, fundamentally all you actually need for them is a box of some kind. And a box can be as basic as a piece of packaging that came with some other order: four sides and a lid will keep your cards in order just as well as a golden chest. There’s no need to spend a fortune if you don’t want the style and features offered by premium brands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that doesn’t mean there’s not something to be gained by spending at least a little on a storage option. Rather than a discarded cardboard box, you could get a specialized option like this. It’s sized just right to protect trading cards, comes with some dividers to keep things organized and has a top-loading lid so it’s easy to peruse your cards. Multiples will also stack neatly on your shelves to keep your cards together. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">How to Pick the Right Storage Option for You</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone who has been a collector over the years knows binders may be the easiest and most convenient way to store cards, but can harm the cards over time. So, if you have any high-value cards or potentially high-value cards, it’s recommended to store them in sleeves or penny sleeves and put them in top loaders or boxes versus binders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on your budget, size of your collection, and value of your cards, you can start with a convenient option like a D-Ring binder, and work your way up from there. Based on the categories listed in the product options above, we're confident you'll find something affordable to get you started. What you choose will be based on many factors. For example, you may collect or play with Pokémon TCG cards and you just want to turn a stack of cards into an organized storage solution like using a cute, simple <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokmon-card-binder">Pokémon card binder.</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tip: look for 'Acid-Free' and 'Soft-Backed' in the descriptions while shopping around. Also, consider your preference on matte versus glossy pocket pages. According to a recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/xzkphi/should_i_buy_classicglossy_or_matte_sleeves_for/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit poll</a> on the subject, the majority of votes landed on glossy sleeves based on pros and cons of visibility, shuffling, quality and texture. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">What is the Rarest Trading Card in History?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Guinness World Records, the title of 'world's rarest trading card' is tied between the 1996 World Champion and MTG's Shichifukujin Dragon cards, in which only one specimen of each card exists.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Storage Recommendations</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a collector or gamer in organization mode currently (it seems like you might be!), you may want to browse our other storage and display guides.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance has been hit with more layoffs, parent company Krafton has confirmed, amid claims "most of" its developers have lost their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Word of job cuts at Striking Distance began surfacing earlier today as employees took to social media. Former director of concept art Jesse Lee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX/">wrote</a> that "most of the devs were laid off", while former cloud devops engineer Seth Spitkoski <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seth-spitkoski-b0316b68_opentowork-activity-7299777905088217091-fDCU/">said "many" had been impacted</a>.
</p>
<p>
Krafton later confirmed layoffs at the studio in a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-callisto-protocol-studio-lays-off-more-employees-but-remains-operational/">statement shared with PC Gamer</a>. "Striking Distance Studios has reduced the size of its team to remain agile," the company wrote, "which creates a sustainable environment for the studio at its current stage of development."
</p>
<p>
"The studio remains operational," the publisher added, "and these changes will not impact any planned ongoing support. No further changes are planned at this time." Krafton did not reveal the reveal the number of staff impacted by its job cuts.
</p>
<p>
Striking Distance was founded by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield in 2019, and the California-based studio would go on to release sci-fi horror game The Callisto Protocol in 2022. However, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">disappointing sales</a>, Schofield <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">parted ways with Krafton</a> in 2023, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-developer-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-32-employees">32 employees were laid off</a> amid efforts to "realign the studio's priorities".
</p>
<p>
Since then, Striking Distance has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-gets-a-roguelike-spin-off">announced a roguelike The Callisto Protocol spin-off</a>, codenamed Project Birdseye, but no further details have been shared following its reveal.
</p>
<p>
Confirmation of layoffs at Krafton comes as job cuts and studio closures continue across the games industry. February alone has seen seen the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, Warner Bros. Games San Diego</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Swords</a> shut their doors, with layoffs confirmed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">Marvel Rivals' US development team</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-suffers-more-layoffs-says-it-will-scale-back-operations">Surgeon Simulator studio Bossa Games</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-moba-shooter-deadlock-cuts-a-lane-spurring-reactions-from-its-playerbase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">One less line of minions.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>, the MOBA-meets-hero shooter mash-up from Valve, has been in a perpetual state of quiet build-up over the last year. But that hasn't stopped Valve from making massive, tectonic changes, like cutting down the number of lanes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, February 25, Valve published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422450/view/530965072572320687" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Map Rework Update for Deadlock</a>. Chief among the changes was a redesign of Deadlock's core map around three lanes, rather than four. For those who don't dabble in MOBAs, these "lanes" are the central focus of gameplay; minions spawn at each team's base and surge down them, attempting to push the battle lines into each other's territory. Players take up residence in the lanes, fighting over the killing blow on minions to accrue money and experience they can use to power up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's one big game of tug-of-war, and reducing the number of figurative ropes from four to three has pretty drastic implications. It cuts down on one source of resources and reduces the number of fronts in the ongoing battle. It also means, for the 6-on-6 battles of Deadlock, that previously "solo" lanes will more often be duo lanes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Definitely going to be missing four lanes," one commenter <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iy6ysk/map_rework_update/mes5m1t/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said on the Deadlock subreddit</a>. "I always thought that was one of the more unique aspects of Deadlock. Oh well, learn and adapt I guess."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite some of the worried hyperbole over map shifts, there is a degree of trust — though not absolute or unflinching — and voicing measured feedback. "It’s just a test guys chill," said <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iy78c1/lane_changes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one commenter</a>. "If it works well it stays, if it doesn’t work then it will go away like mid urn." (A former game mechanic.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A decent amount of this trust stems from the fact that IceFrog, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/13/valve-announces-dota-2">pseudonymous developer behind Dota 2</a>, is also working on Deadlock. Dota 2 is fairly infamous for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-aftermath-of-dota-2s-game-changing-update-ign-arena-podcast">massive overhauls and game-changing updates</a>, wiith patch notes that felt like getting whiplash from spreadsheets. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iyk163/some_of_yall_didnt_play_dota_and_it_shows/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old memes stretching back to the early days of Dota 2</a>, encouraging players to trust in IceFrog's changes, have already been resurfaced for modern Deadlock players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dota 2 has seen so many massive overhauls and changes and the game still thrives," a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iyk163/some_of_yall_didnt_play_dota_and_it_shows/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commenter said</a>. "As long as Deadlock's core gameplay doesn't drastically change (which definitely isn't a guarantee since its currently in development) then people will play the game regardless."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Map changes aside, Valve took the wrench to a lot of Deadlock with this recent update. Soul Orbs, which are released from enemies upon death and can be shot by players to either secure their rewards or partially deny them from the enemy team, also got a hefty rework. Sprinting has been tuned, flex slots and economic considerations have been made to adjust for the new three-lane set-up, and there's the usual slew of quality-of-life and hero changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some, especially the long-time Dota players, Deadlock's update feels par for the course. (Dota 2 even <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/737004388447420792" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got its own massive overhaul just last week</a>.) While it will certainly shift the way players approach the game, part of the long-term appeal of a MOBA like Deadlock is the ways the game shifts over time, in response to both developer changes and community reactions. If handled well, it can result in years of vibrant competition. If not, well, hopefully there's a rewind button somewhere. History has shown that not all major updates are made in stone, even for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy">huge games like Overwatch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With not even a week out yet in Deadlock, players will need to dig in and figure out just how the reduced lanes shifts the game, suss out the intended change, and find new ways to open up gameplay through it. On at least one positive note, players with solo lane anxiety can breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deadlock is still flagged as being in early development, and Valve warns players it's filled with "temporary art and experimental gameplay." Access is currently limited to friend invite via playtesters, and there's no release window announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

All three titles will be available to download for Essential, Extra, and Premium members starting March 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a notably strong month for PlayStation Plus subscribers of all tiers, but the main highlight here is EA and BioWare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard"><u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a>. The big-budget RPG launched October 31, only four months ago, and received strong reviews from critics (we gave it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review"><u>9/10 in our review</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed-to-resonate-with-a-broad-audience-gamers-increasingly-want-shared-world-features"><u>EA said</u></a> the latest Dragon Age title wasn’t able to “resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market,” and BioWare saw a restructure and layoffs.

This remaster of one of the more beloved entries in the Sonic franchise launched in 2021, adding more content to blaze through as players refamiliarized themselves with the Blue Blur’s sci-fi-inspired abilities and story. We gave it an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-colors-ultimate-review"><u>8/10 in our review</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the pack is a collection of 13 remasters of Konami’s classic TMNT spinoff games. It’s a bundle that includes new and improved versions of beat ‘em up titles like TMNT: Turtles in Time, the original TMNT arcade game, and more, all under one roof. Although it wasn’t without its issues, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection"><u>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</u></a> still provides PlayStation Plus subscribers with an easy way to experience old-school fan favorites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection is a treasure trove of Turtle games, but our online experience was barely functional when matchmaking,” we said in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-the-cowabunga-collection-review"><u>7/10 review</u></a>. “Couch co-op fares a lot better, but some may notice an increased input delay over the originals.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/heres-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days.1119882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/heres-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While onboarding with <em>Aftermath</em>, I went on a tangent, laying bare all my frustrations with manga-reading apps while pitching a blog. After spewing a word salad for what felt like a century, I was met with horrified expressions from my colleagues. The leading cause for concern <a href="https://aftermath.site/a-manga-about-transforming-into-a-plant-for-the-greater-good" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t my pitch</a> (thank god) but my casual comparison of the manga-reading ecosystem to streaming subscription services with the bonus of predatory practices rife in live service games. Reading the latest chapter of your favorite series involves jumping through a series of overcomplicated hoops that include microtransactions and earning points.</p><p>The source of my ire are Square Enix’s MangaUp and Kondansha’s K Manga. Like every good drug dealer, K Manga and Manga Up let you read the first couple chapters of a series for free. After that, you have to play ball with their respective ticketed and microtransaction coins to read new manga chapters. Similar to Hoyoverse’s umbrella of gacha games, K Manga and Manga Up gamify reading comic books through log-in bonuses, accruing bonus points for completing assigned chapters, and “paying to win” to give yourself a modicum of freedom from their respective bullshit.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>K Manga's premium ticket log-in calendar.<span></span><span>Kodansha </span></figcaption></figure><h2>Tickets and coins galore&nbsp;</h2><p>In K Manga’s case, completing dailies starts with logging in every day. Doing so greets you with a pop up window tracking your streak of logins on a calendar and rewarding you with five tickets each day, which expire a week after they’re claimed. You can rent a free chapter for three days by spending a ticket. Once you’ve progressed past the amount of free chapters in a series (which varies depending on their popularity), K Manga blockades readers by asking them to purchase points to read further.&nbsp;</p><p>K Manga’s points cost $1 for 100P, or 2580P (its highest point option) for $25. You’ll need 69P or 99P to respectively read the lead ups and newest chapters of a series piecemeal, or you can pony up the real cash for points to “buy chapters in bulk” and read the entire collection of paywalled chapters. For example, buying <em>Wind Breaker</em>’s 168 paywalled chapters in bulk cost 11622 points or $116.22. K Manga gamifies things even further with assigned reading, where completing the first chapter of a series nets you 5P. The only solace in K Manga’s points system is that they’re permanent, meaning you can reread to your heart’s content once you’ve spent points on a chapter.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure><figcaption>K Manga's in-app store.<span></span><span>Kodansha/K Manga</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Vinland Saga chapters on K Manga. <span></span><span>Kodansha/K Manga</span></figcaption></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>Manga Up gamifies its experience with a three-tiered system: Up points, XP, and Coin. (Writer’s note: I pinched my forehead a bunch trying to explain Manga Up’s microtransaction system in layman's terms, so we’ll be reading from its <a href="https://global.manga-up.com/webview/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ page</a> together from here on out until I recover).&nbsp;</p><p>Manga Up’s “Up items” are granted twice a day and let users read “normal chapters” (we’ll get to that later). XP is given as a reward for completing chapters, participating in in-app events like flash sales or reading the first chapter of a new series, or as a bonus for purchasing coin. Coin, like K Manga’s points, are purchase-only items you buy from its store to read chapters.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the hierarchy of how these items are consumed (yes, that’s how Square Enix words it) are separated depending on if something is considered a “normal” or “advanced” chapter. Normal chapters are early chapters in an ongoing series; advanced chapters are later chapters in a series. Normal chapters consume items like so: “UP→XP→Coin.” Advanced chapters only consume XP→Coin. The brass tacks of this whole charade breaks down to either accruing enough XP to read a chapter or paying up for points.&nbsp;</p><p>Manga Up’s point to cash conversion works like this:</p><figure><figure><figcaption>Manga Up's in-app store.<span></span><span>Square Enix/MangaUp</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Manga Up's Vault Pass subscription service. <span></span><span>Square Enix/MangaUp</span></figcaption></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>Should the circus of it all prove to be too much to handle, Manga Up has something called a “Vault Pass.” For $4.99 a month, users can read 200+ chapters, new or old, without ads at the butt-end of chapters. Manga Plus’ gamification of reading comic books has an extra layer of scummy added on to its offer of free chapters when you take into consideration that it splits first chapters (often 40-50 pages) into four parts and later chapters in half. In short, you’re spending points to read half chapters.&nbsp;</p><h2>How I finesse the system</h2><p>K Manga and Manga Up have the most complicated systems for what could otherwise be a library where you pick up a book and read it. Although these apps couch the incentive to buy into systems meant to trap you by signposting them as a means to support artists, it has actually led users like me to game the system. Instead of using K Manga’s log in incentive as intended by clocking into work, reading five chapters, going to sleep, and doing it all over again, I’ve opted to clock my log in bonuses every morning, close the app, and check back in at the end of the week to read chapters before my tickets expire. The corporate bigwigs can tout their daily user log ins (despite them being a curt hi-bye to claim tickets), and I can bank tickets to binge-read new series like <em>Gachiakuta </em>or whatever else catches my eye.&nbsp;</p><p>Manga Up gets less use and therefore love from me. On the rare occasion that I awaken the app from deep sleep on my phone, it’s sole purpose is to keep me up to date on new chapters of a series and new crops of titles before fleeing to my local bookstore (or take to the high seas) to check them out myself. K Manga and Manga Up playing by gacha system incentives to make manga reading a live service experience cheapens the pleasure of reading for fun. It turns it into something like a job, where users are expected to clock in and do menial tasks out of obligation instead of genuine love for a series. It sucks eggs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Alternatives that aren’t shit</h2><p>Not all manga reading services are the pits. Apps like Shonen Jump and Viz Manga are on the up-and-up, giving readers access to titles like <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, <em>Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</em>, and <em>Dandadan </em>for a flat rate of $2.99 a month (SJ) and $1.99 (VM). You can even download chapters for work commutes or what have you. The only real downside is that some series are backfilling chapters toward the middle half of their series with no date when they’ll be available. Another catch is that you are limited to reading 100 chapters a day, but if you exceed that generous limit, you should probably put your phone down.&nbsp;</p><p>Other services like Shuiesha’s MangaPlus offer two-tier price caps: a $1.99/mo standard subscription without ads giving you access to 90 ongoing titles, and a $4.99/mo deluxe subscription with access to 200+ ongoing and completed titles. Its biggest selling point is its more mature lineup of seinen series like <em>Fire Punch</em> and chapter comment sections for those longing for a sense of community. The light novel and fantasy series equivalent of this mess is Azuki manga, which also offers a $4.99 a month service for reading manga—the de facto price cap for manga services until someone breaks the mold by having the audacity to ask for more.</p><h2>The Crunchyroll chilling effect</h2><p>The manga reading pool looks to get fuller with Crunchyroll looking to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/crunchyroll-is-getting-back-into-the-manga-app-game-2000546950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get back into the manga app game</a> (after <a href="https://gizmodo.com/crunchyroll-manga-app-shut-down-december-1851014121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unceremoniously shuttering its service</a>) later this year. Y’know, the Sony-owned company, who’s already been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crunchyroll-funimation-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monopolizing anime with its merger with Funimation</a>. Sony plans on re-launching Crunchyroll Manga as a “new premium option for Crunchyroll members” with an app rollout on iOS and Android and later plans for a web browser version. Cruncyroll’s subscription prices are already some of the steepest in anime, with a three-tier system: Fan ($7.99 a month), Mega Fan ($11.99 a month), and Ultimate Fan ($15.99 a month), all of which eclipsing the ceiling price of the aforementioned manga reading apps. While Crunchyroll Manga hasn’t disclosed what series will be offered on the app, a cursory look over at Sony being the <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202412/24-1219E/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest share owner</a> of FromSoftware’s parent company, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/sonys-potential-kadokawa-acquisition-could-tighten-its-grip-on-anime-and-manga-2000526376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kadokawa</a>, spells it out, including series like <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>, <em>Re: Zero</em>, <em>Oshi no Ko</em>, and <em>Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation</em>. Big title incentives to buy in, sure, but there’s also a non-zero chance its premium price tag won’t trickle down to other companies.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, the practice of reading manga online is as needlessly complicated as digital ownership of video games. You’re better off checking out manga from your local library or buying them from brick-and-mortar stores than completing dailies to read new chapters of peak fiction.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos"><h3>Jeff Bezos Presents: The News</h3></a><p>Bezos' new vision for The Washington Post's opinion section will destroy the paper</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wheel-world-demo"><h3>I Need To Stop Playing The Wheel World Demo And Fix My Bike</h3></a><p>If only real-life wrenching were as fun as it is in the game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down"><h3>Fuck WB</h3></a><p>Another all-time great studio sacrificed at the altar of Line Go Up</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-march-dragon-age-the-veilguard-sonic-colors-ultimate-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the PS Plus lineup for the month of March, and the highlight is undoubtedly Dragon Age: The Veilguard. BioWare's game launched only four months ago. It is rare that a triple-A game of this importance joins a subscription service like PS Plus (or Xbox Game Pass) this early after the release.</p>
<p>However, as reported in previous coverage, the game didn't sell nearly as well as the publisher had hoped. By the end of 2024, it had sold 1.5 million copies, about half of what Electronic Arts had estimated before launch. That is despite positive critic reviews, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including mine</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPG with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>The underwhelming commercial performance of Dragon Age: The Veilguard definitely played a factor in EA's decision to sign a deal with Sony. BioWare itself was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject to some layoffs and other people were reassigned to different studios within EA</a>. As a result, the studio now has less than a hundred employees, though the plan is still to go forward with the new Mass Effect project.</p>
<p>Besides Dragon Age: The Veilguard, PlayStation Plus subscribers will also get the following games in March:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-colors-ultimate-new-sonic-team-game-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> (PlayStation 4)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a> (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5)</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of the games will be available for PS Plus subscribers to download and add to their collection between March 4 and March 31.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dark Deity 2 | Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Dark Deity 2 is a tactical turn-based RPG inspired by games like Fire Emblem. In particular, its combat is very reminiscent of the classic Fire Emblem games on Game Boy, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones/" data-ref-id="5000-21040">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a>. Combat units are scattered across the battlefield, and when they engage in battle with enemies, they're whisked away to a separate screen to duke it out.</p><p>There are a total of 20 playable characters across 45 different branching classes, each with unique abilities, passive effects, and tactical roles. The game also has a large degree of variability, which includes a built-in randomizer and campaign customization options that can shuffle up character recruitment order and difficulty level, as well as experience and gold sliders.</p><p>A demo is available on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446600/Dark_Deity_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Deity 2's Steam page</a>, which lets players experience the game's first four chapters. Neither the developer nor publisher has revealed whether Dark Deity 2 will come other platforms. The first game also received a Switch release, so it's possible that the sequel will too.</p>

            <p>
Tetris Forever, last year's excellent interactive history of the classic block-dropping puzzler, has added two more games plucked from the series' past as part of its "biggest-ever update".
</p>
<p>
Tetris Forever, if you're unfamiliar, follows the format of developer Digital Eclipse's previous (and consistently superb) interactive documentary experiences - Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/llamasoft-the-jeff-minter-story">Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</a>, and The Making of Karateka - combining archive material, new interviews, and playable games into one fascinating whole.
</p>
<p>
At launch, it featured 15 games - ranging from a recreation of the original Tetris on Electronika 60 to Digital Eclipse's new Tetris Time Warp - and additional versions, including Welltris, have been added since then. And now the roster is expanding further, this time adding MS-DOS versions of Spectrum Holobyte's 1991 Super Tetris and 1988's Tetris (AcademySoft) v. 3.12.
</p>

<p>
Super Tetris, Digital Eclipse notes, was an early attempt at creating a Tetris "sequel", requiring players to earn bombs and clear a Matrix already half full at the start. Tetris (AcademySoft) v. 3.12, meanwhile, is the final version of Tetris created within the Soviet Union, and includes a Phantom mode featuring invisible O-Tetriminos.
</p>
<p>
Alongside its two new games, Tetris Forever's latest update brings enhancements to Tetris Time Warp. Its single-player modes now run to Level 30 instead of the previous Level 15, for instance, while multiplayer mode's Time Warp Tetriminos have gained the new Shield power. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, its single-player 1989 Mode now lets players turn off "modern gameplay" for a more historically accurate experience (and its possible to reduce Matrix rows down from 20 to 18), and there's the new 40-Line Challenge, tasking players with clearing 40 lines as quickly as possible. That's on top of a much-expanded Tetris Time Warp options mode, enabling far greater customisation of visuals, sounds, and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there are adjustments to the Electronika 60 version of Tetris to make it "even more historically accurate", and "many other minor tweaks, bug fixes, and enhancements." All this is available now across all platforms as part of Tetris Forever's latest free update.
</p>
<p>
And if you've even a passing interest in the history and legacy of Tetris, Digital Eclipse's Tetris Forever is well worth your time. Christian Donlan called it a "gorgeous documentary compilation" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tetris-forever-review">four star review</a> last year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/more-esports-organizations-are-flocking-towards-marvel-rivals/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Marvel Rivals is very slowly and tentatively moving towards establishing an esports scene, but more and more organizations are already looking to set up shop. A handful of prestigious legacy organizations are in the process of signing rosters, and more could be on the way as bigger Marvel Rivals tournaments spring up.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-esports-organizations-are-in-marvel-rivals">Which Esports Organizations are in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>On February 26, Fnatic became the latest esports organization to <a href="https://x.com/FNATIC/status/1894796444390830146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enter</a> Marvel Rivals, signing a roster to compete in the upcoming EMEA Invitational. The six-person team consists of a handful of former Overwatch pros and a former Fortnite World Cup participant. Fnatic is a globally recognized esports organization, famous for its Swedish CS:GO dynasty and from earning over a half dozen trophies in European League of Legends.</p>



<p>Fnatic are by no means the only prestigious organization to jump right in to Marvel Rivals. OG, the European organization built on winning Dota 2’s The International twice, <a href="https://x.com/OGesports/status/1894792288699580668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> their Marvel Rivals roster hours before Fnatic did. Virtus.pro <a href="https://virtus.pro/en/articles/virtuspro-otkryvayut-sostav-po-marvel-rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed</a> a decorated roster of Overwatch League veterans on February 19. All three of those organizations, alongside Twisted Minds, Team Peps, Luminosity, DUSTY, and the ECSTATIC roster, have been invited to the EMEA Invitational.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Several other organizations are currently considering Marvel Rivals rosters. Sentinels, one of the most globally recognized and successful brands in VALORANT, <a href="https://x.com/robmooreEsports/status/1892336173928108123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> it would participate in Marvel Rivals. CEO Rob Moore said he sees “tremendous potential” in the competitive Marvel Rivals scene, and opened the gates for virtually anyone to try out. Sentinels will in all likelihood compete in North America. 100 Thieves, another prominent organization based in North America, has also <a href="https://x.com/100Thieves/status/1894809669660713006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> its interest. The invites for the North American Invitational have not been sent out yet.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has seemingly achieved sustainable popularity, maintaining a presence at the top of the Steam player charts since the game released. The team at NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has prioritized a “coexisting” between casual and competitive play</a>. Back in January, the game’s director said they are taking a lot of references from games that have thriving casual and competitive player pools.</p>

Like the recently announced Blade 16, the new 18-inch Razer laptop utilizes the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-Series GPUs. Both of Razer's new high-end gaming laptops are available to preorder now and expected to release on April 30. The Blade 18 starts at $3,200, while the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16%2FRZ09-05287EN3-R3U1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-new-razer-blade-18-has-a-unique-dual-mode-display-and-rtx-50-series-gpu%2F1100-6529726%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blade 16</a> retails for $2,800 and up.</p><hr><p>Preorders for the Blade 18 come with the Laptop Stand Chroma ($130 value) and the X-Ray Chroma Skin ($65 value). If you preorder the Blade 16, you'll get Razer's USB-C Dock ($120 value) and the X-Ray Chroma Skin ($60 value).</p><p>The Blade 18 has a unique dual-mode display that supports 3840 x 2400 UHD+ resolution with a 240Hz refresh rate. Alternatively, the screen can render images at 1920 x 1200 FHD+ resolution with a blistering 480Hz refresh rate.</p><h2>Razer Blade 18 (2025)</h2><h3>Starting at $3,200</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4450719" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4450719"></a><figcaption>Razer Blade 18 (2025)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg"></figure><p>With the option to customize the Razer Blade 18 with up to an RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, it should be ready to handle anything you throw at it. The RTX 5070 Ti comes standard, while upgrading to the RTX 5080 costs an extra $500 and the RTX 5090 costs $1,300. All GPUs are paired to an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX (5.4GHz) yet the chassis remains slim at just 21.99mm thick. You’ll also get to pick your SSD size, ranging from 1TB to 4TB. The same goes for memory, with options for 32GB or 64GB models.</p><p>Beyond all the power, one of the most intriguing features of the Blade 18 is its new display. Razer says it’s the “world’s first” 18-inch dual-mode display, allowing you to run games with a UHD+ resolution of 3840x2400 and 240Hz refresh rate or FHD+ resolution of 1920x1200 and 440Hz refresh rate. That gives you the flexibility to choose whichever option is best for your current needs (resolution or speed), making the Blade suitable for all sorts of tasks.</p><p>Cooling the unit is a three-fan system that should quickly dissipate any accumulated heat, while the keyboard has been redesigned with new scissor switches featuring a 35% increase in travel distance compared to the outgoing model. There’s also a 10-key numpad and dual-LED backlighting per key.</p><p>Combined with a six-speaker THX system and a 5MP webcam, it’s clear Razer has built the Blade 18 to battle with the most premium gaming laptops on the market.</p><p>If you prefer AMD processors, the Razer Blade 16 comes with the new Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU. You can pair AMD's high-end CPU with one of the RTX 50-Series graphics cards. The Blade 16 has a 1600p QHD+ OLED display capable of 240Hz refresh rates.
