			<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive success of games like <strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong></a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong hype for <strong>Phantom Blade: Zero</strong></a>, with the appetite for high-fidelity Chinese action games at an all-time high, <strong>GeniGods: Nezha</strong> is the latest project to be announced in this vein. Developed by <strong>GeniGods Lab</strong>, the studio behind the mobile game <strong>My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero</strong>, it aims to bring a 'Chinese God of War' experience. The game is a single player hardcore action RPG tentatively slated for a 2027 or 2028 launch on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

<li><a href="#roundtable-interview-devs">Roundtable Interview with Devs</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="genigods-nezha-preview">GeniGods: Nezha Preview</h2>



<p>Wccftech recently participated in a remote presentation and roundtable interview with two members of the development team, Producer <strong>Yan</strong> and Art Director <strong>Erdie</strong>, who explained that Genigods Lab, while not well known in Western countries, now employs <strong>over 70 veteran developers</strong> with <strong>more than 20 years of industry experience</strong>.</p>



<p>GeniGods: Nezha is their big bet, and they chose a Genesis myth from Chinese mythology. The titular character is one of the three most famous heroes in Chinese myths, alongside Wukong and Yang Jian. The backstory is that Nüwa, the God of Creation, was dying, but before that happened, she created Nezha from clay and water and empowered Nezha, also known as the <strong>Spirit Pearl</strong>, with her heart.</p>



<p>Basically, the developers said, you are a <strong>"Chinese Kratos"</strong>. By that, they meant a tragic, rebellious teen hero whose fate was sealed before birth. Nezha's path to redemption is brutal: you'll need to skin the dragon, take your own life, and then be reborn.</p>



<p>We also learned a few narrative tidbits. After <strong>Pangu</strong>, a primordial being and a figure of creation in Chinese mythology, died, his body formed the planet. Now his soul wants resurrection, which would, however, destroy the new world. As Nezha, the first human, <strong>players must stop Pangu's return</strong>. Nezha's journey takes place across the dead body of Pangu himself, and GeniGods Lab designed each part of his form (arms, neck, head, torso) as intricate, multi-level sandbox environments.</p>



<p>Nezha won't be alone. Other mythical heroes like <strong>Yi</strong> (the sun shooter who shot down nine of the ten suns) and <strong>Yu</strong> <strong>the Great</strong> (the flood stopper) will also be featured in the game. Nezha's heart is also filled with holy water, a powerful gift from Nüwa and an important companion for solving puzzles, overcoming challenges, and exploring the world.</p>



<p>The developers then showed us a comparison chart with the X-axis labeled speed (Slow to Fast) and the Y-axis labeled genre (RPG to Action). In this chart, GeniGods: Nezha sits very near <strong>Sony Santa Monica's God of War 3</strong>. According to GeniGods Lab, its gameplay is a balance of action and strategy; a fast game, but not as fast as Phantom Blade Zero or CAPCOM's <strong>Devil May Cry</strong>. </p>



<p>Advancing through the main story requires defeating powerful bosses. The game has four pillars:</p>



<ol start="1">
<li><strong>Aerial Soaring Combat:</strong> Inspired by fighting games, combat occurs on both the ground and in the air (dual stance). Bosses have dynamic AI that analyzes player tactics in real-time. The dual stance forms a complex offensive and defensive system. On the ground, you charge power to create opportunities for aerial combos. Once you break the enemy, you knock them into the sky to perform complex combos for huge damage.</li>



<li><strong>Relic Form:</strong> Nezha obtains relics to learn superpowers from other heroes, offering multiple tactical choices to the player. Relics and special forms can be combined: for example, pairing "Hot Wheels" with a "Six-Arm Form" enables powerful ranged suppression against flying enemies.</li>



<li><strong>Fluid Mystics:</strong> Since Nüwa is a water goddess, her body can turn into water. Fluid Mystics is based on <strong>Bruce Lee</strong>'s philosophy ("Be water, my friend"). By pressing <strong>R1</strong> on the controller, Nezha activates the holy water power, enchanting skills, and giving attacks fluid, water-like visuals. Her techniques adapt the essence of <strong>Jeet Kune Do</strong>. Players can condense water into a piercing One-Inch Flash for armor-breaking blows, or unleash water all at once with a sweeping Dragon's Kick to tackle crowds of enemies at once. This system encourages players to master a reactive combat style and requires perfect timing to parry and counter.</li>



<li><strong>Narrative:</strong> This is a world of colossal beings and wonders, like the Nine Suns in the sky. climb ancient gods towering like mountains and fight by traversing the contours of their bodies. With the help of the giant Kuafu, scale the Sun Tree that bridges mortal and celestial realms, then draw your bow to extinguish the Nine Suns and end the scorching catastrophe.</li>
</ol>

<iframe title="Genigods: Nezha Trailer - Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5mZseIFDmc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nezha has three primary ways to fight in this game: martial arts (fist fighting), swords (blade fighting), and a lance (spear fighting). Throughout GeniGods: Nezha, the main character will have to face <strong>over 60 different enemy types</strong>, choosing the most appropriate weapon each time. Structurally, it is not an open world game, favoring a rather linear structure centered around hubs, albeit with plenty of side content. The studio estimates <strong>the main story will last around 24 hours</strong>, but <strong>a completionist playthrough to earn the Platinum trophy could take up to 75 hours</strong>. There are also three different endings based on how you decide to solve the impending catastrophe.</p>



<p>The game is being developed <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the <span>latest version of&nbsp;<strong>Unreal Engine</strong></span></a><span>&nbsp;(5.7, </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/ue-5-7-is-close-to-a-magic-bullet-for-performance-says-ark-developer-though-it-wont-fully-eliminate-stutters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>which brought significant</span> performance improvements</a>). The team has crafted a dynamic day-and-night weather system to control environmental hues and synchronize weather effects, such as thunder, with combat mechanics. On the physics front, they built destructible environments (buildings, trees, rocks) to visualize Nezha's destructive power. They're using Epic's <strong>Metahuman</strong> technology for facial capture and motion matching to achieve, in their own words, <strong>The Last of Us Part II</strong> levels of emotional expression. Moreover, they implemented a high-mobility "3C" system (Camera, Character, Control) to enable soaring, jumping, and combat on colossal beings, as required by the game's premise.  </p>



<p>GeniGods: Nezha <strong>will support hardware ray tracing</strong>, upscalers like <strong>NVIDIA DLSS</strong> and <strong>AMD FSR</strong>, SSD optimization for seamless loading, DualSense controller features such as haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, and 3D audio on PlayStation 5 via the console's T<strong>empest Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>Following the presentation, <strong>we were able to ask a few questions</strong> alongside colleagues from other outlets. You can read the full transcript after the image gallery.</p>

<h2 id="roundtable-interview-devs">Roundtable Interview with Devs</h2>



<p><strong>Alessio Palumbo (WCCFTECH): How long has GeniGods: Nezha been in development, and can you share the estimated budget behind it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> We started the project in 2023, so it's been nearly three years. We spent that time building engines, pipelines, and tools. The total cost is <strong>$20 million</strong>. Most is supported by our studio, but we have a major global investor helping with promotion.</p>



<p><strong>Alejandro Pascual (3D Juegos): Is the mission system straightforward and linear, or are there secondary missions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> The main story is linear, like God of War 3, focusing on fighting bosses and solving problems. After that, you reach a "Hub World" (like a city). From the Hub, you access branching missions. Each mission rewards you with Relics or Superpowers, allowing you to build your combat strategy before challenging the next boss.</p>



<p><strong>Fran G. Matas (Vandal): Why is this type of Action RPG so popular in China right now, after Black Myth: Wukong and Phantom Blade Zero?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> Chinese games are getting popular because they offer a new experience. Western and Japanese cultures are familiar, but China has 5,000 years of history and myths that haven't been used much. Unlike boring games that reuse old ideas, we bring fresh stories and aesthetics. <strong>Our plan is to spend 10 years exploring Chinese creation myths</strong>. We plan to make a trilogy of "Genot" games to show something deep, not just surface-level culture.</p>



<p><strong>Giovanni Panzano (Everyeye): Can you tell us about the progression system? Skill tree? Equipment?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> We combine Relics, Equipment, and Skills. A "Skill" is a combination of a Relic and a Superpower. When you press R1, you enhance your power using the "Heart of Water." It is similar to a skill tree but structured differently; we will show more of this next time.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio Palumbo (WCCFTECH): You mentioned three different endings. How does the player reach them? Choices?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> Since the world is dying, <strong>people have built three different "Schools" of thought on how to save it</strong>. Nezha must choose which way is right. Based on your options, you get different powers, different fighting modes, and unlock unique levels. Each direction leads to a totally different ending. It is a bit like the "Word Tendency" in Demon's Souls.</p>



<p><strong>Alejandro Pascual (3D Juegos): Have you been in touch with other Chinese creators, such as Phantom Blade Zero or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>, to avoid overlapping themes?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> Yes, we are good friends with the Phantom Blade Zero team; we are both in Beijing. Black Myth: Wukong is a "superhero" boss rush game. Phantom Blade Zero focuses on Chinese swordsmanship and weaponry. Our game is rooted in the <strong>Genesis Myth</strong>: the story of creation, the first human, and the source of power. You fight colossal beings. Our gameplay focuses on collecting Relics to change your form (e.g., wearing wings vs. using fans). We are very distinct games.</p>



<p><strong>Fran G. Matas (Vandal): Is there any endgame content?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> Yes. Because there are three schools, when you reopen the game (New Game+), you can choose to collect goods from another school. On the third playthrough, you collect the final set. When you collect all of them, you become the "Premier" and truly finish the game.</p>



<p><strong>Giovanni Panzano (Everyeye): Can you beat the bosses in any order?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> In the Hub World, you need to collect five stones (keys) to open the end doors; you can choose your own order. Each boss has specific weaknesses and superpowers, so you can strategize which one to tackle first based on your build.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio Palumbo (WCCFTECH): How does side content work? Are there any personal missions or just boss fights?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> We have linear level design for the main story to keep it focused. Once you unlock a Hub World, you can access different areas with new enemies and Relics. There are myth-related Relics linked to side quests and player choices. This gives players freedom to explore without losing the narrative thread. All bosses are based on old Chinese gods and monsters; we care more about making them meaningful than just having a high number of them.</p>



<p><strong>Fran G. Matas (Vandal): How is Sony supporting this game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> Sony published our last mobile game (My Hero Academia) and helped us reach 10 million downloads. They introduced us to SIE China. We are discussing deep cooperation.</p>



<p><strong>Alejandro Pascual (3D Juegos): Are there difficulty levels?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> We want all users to be able to play. We have a "Modern Mode" (like Street Fighter 6) where pressing R1 + other buttons executes complex combos easily. For pro players, they can control everything manually. We will also add a harder difficulty mode upon release.</p>



<p><strong>Giovanni Panzano (Everyeye): Is there customization?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> Yes. The main character will have more than 20 different costumes. Some are based on legendary Chinese heroes; Nezha can "cosplay" as them, giving her a totally different look.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio Palumbo (WCCFTECH): Are you using AI tools? It's one of the big topics in the industry.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> We believe creativity comes from people. We use AI tools only to help artists generate ideas or reference materials faster and to do the boring, repetitive jobs. The final call and the assets in the game are all human-made. We use AI to improve creation, not replace it.</p>



<p><strong>Alejandro Pascual (3D Juegos): Is there a ranking system for combos?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Erdie:</strong> The enemies are smart. To make a real combo, you have to break the enemy's "Magic Bar" (a blue bar seen in the trailer). Breaking it knocks them into the sky or stuns them, allowing you to deal huge damage. It's not just a score; it's a mechanic to open up damage windows.</p>



<p><strong>Fran G. Matas (Vandal): How do you balance visual spectacle with gameplay clarity?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> We prioritize clarity. We use "Red Color Power" flashes to signal powerful enemy attacks, telling users exactly when to dodge or counter. We design effects to be flashy but clear, ensuring the visuals don't obscure the gameplay cues.</p>



<p><strong>Giovanni Panzano (Everyeye): Will the PS5 Pro version have multiple graphics modes? 60 FPS?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> Yes, we can play at 60 FPS. </p>



<p><strong>Giovanni Panzano (Everyeye): Is that only for Pro or the base PS5 too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yan:</strong> We propose to make the base PS5 version run at 60 FPS as well. We already have a version for SIE China running on the base PS5.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

You take on the role of the Spirit Pearl—the first life forged by Nuwa, the Goddess of Life, from earth, water and fire—who is reincarnated as Nezha. Immerse yourself in iconic tales of Chinese genesis mythology, battle against Colossal Gods, and master the one-of-a-kind combat of Chinese-style celestial showdowns.</p><p><strong>A World in Ruins, A Hero’s Call</strong></p><p>Pangu, the Genesis God, succumbed to an eternal slumber, plunging the realm into utter chaos: Ten suns sear the land, birthing a <a title="Companies > crim [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>son desert. Gods wage ceaseless wars that rend the sky asunder. With celestial pillars collapsed, ferocious monsters ascend from the abyss.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Nuwa gifts you the “Heart of the Spirit Pearl”—a heart infused with divine water that is both your constant companion and the wellspring of your power.</p><p>Your destiny is forged by three titanic quests: MEND the shattered sky with the Five-Colored Stones, UNCOVER the truth of your own origin, and DESCEND into the Abyss of Return to SEAL the spacetime rifts devouring the world.</p><p><strong>Celestial Combat: Dual Stances, Fluidmystic, Relic-Fusion</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [213 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the dynamic scale of Chinese mythic warfare, where battle flows seamlessly between heaven and earth:</p><ul><li><strong>Dual Stances</strong> – Switch seamlessly between ground and aerial combat. Wield Nezha’s iconic Fire-Tipped Spear for close-quarters combos and parries on land; take to the skies with Wind Fire Wheels for high-speed raids and aerial combos.</li><li><strong>Fluidmystic</strong> – Tap into the Spirit Pearl’s heart to awaken fleeting mythic abilities, like the Wind Fire Wheels’ devastating mid-air strike. Focus its power to imbue your weapons with sacred water, triggering potent EX effects.</li><li><strong>Relic: Fusion</strong> – Pair mythic treasures for unique skills: combine Hou Yi’s Bow with Three Heads and Six Arms for Rainbow-Piercing-the-Sun Archery, or match the Palm Leaf Fan with water prisons to trap and disable foes.</li></ul><p><strong>Colossal Gods and the Sun Tree</strong></p><p>Built with Unreal Engine 5 and optimized for PlayStation, the game delivers a one-of-a-kind Chinese-style colossal adventure: climb ancient gods towering like mountains and fight by leveraging the contours of their bodies.

Channel this flowing power, focusing it into your body or artifacts to surge your combat prowess. His techniques adapt the essence of Jeet Kune Do: condense water into a piercing One-Inch Flash for armor-breaking blows, or unleash it as a sweeping Dragon’s Kick for fluid crowd control. This system allows you to master a defensive, reactive style—parrying and countering with the adaptable precision of water itself.</p><p><strong>From Legend to Legacy</strong></p><p>We have not just admired Nezha—China’s iconic rebel—but have been haunted by him. Haunted by his tales, by the faded murals of Nuwa mending the sky and Hou Yi shooting down the suns. They were untouchable legends, sealed in ancient texts.</p><p>No longer.</p><p>In <em>Genigods: Nezha</em>, you do not watch the myth. You live it. You wield the heart of creation, soar between realms, awaken the three-headed, eight-armed form, and step onto the primordial battlefield to mend the shattered heavens. This is not about hearing a story; it is about etching your name into its very fabric.</p><p>Our mission is to ignite the epic celestial battles of Chinese mythology. Here, every skill you cast, every choice you make, writes a new line in an ancient epic—forged in your image.</p><p>We invite you to feel the divine fury, master the flowing combat, and claim your place in the myth. The legend awaits its newest author.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

As much as fans appreciated this early play test, it's also drawn some criticism.</p>
<p>Some players had been highlighting "graphical issues" and other problems and in response to this, RGG has now <a href="https://x.com/RGGStudio/status/2017040175180796074">shared an official message</a> on social media, mentioning how the "graphical quality" and other issues in the demo are not representative of the "final experience", with a patch to be made available at launch. Here's the message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have heard concerns from players regarding graphical issues and other problems present in the downloadable demo for Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties.</p>
<p>Rest assured the graphical quality of the demo does not represent the final experience. We plan to have a v1.11 patch available at launch which will address the lighting issue and other quality concerns in the full game.</p>
<p>One specific example is the visual and lighting issues around the Kubochi River area in the Downtown Ryukyu area, which many of you have already pointed out.</p>
<p>This patch will include not just fixes for the issues identified above, but many other improvements. We look forward to sharing the final version of Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties with our global audience on February 12th.</p>
<p>We appreciate your continued support of the Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza series.</p>
<p>RGG Studio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, the Version 1.11 patch will also include "many other improvements" although details about what exactly can be expected have not been revealed just yet. The rollout of this patch will also vary by platform. If you haven't already tried out this demo, it gives you access to both Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> features a much older Leon Kennedy. As such, the ninth mainline entry into the long-running horror video game series is set to explore how his past adventures have changed him, and in this case, made him cold and angry towards the world.</p>



<p>The game’s director, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom’s </a>Koshi Nakanishi, was recently interviewed by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/260127r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DenNicoFamiGamer</a>. In the interview, Nakanishi notes that Leon’s years fighting the undead have made him more cynical about the world, saying he exudes a “ruthless anger.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Leon is making a reappearance in this game, and this is the result of us digging deep into the idea of ‘what type of person would Leon grow into? What would he be thinking?” Nakanishi says (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/resident-evil-requiem-director-wants-you-to-think-whats-wrong-with-you-leon-when-you-see-the-hot-uncle-swinging-his-bloody-ax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">h/t: Games Radar+</a>).</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-leon-has-an-ax-to-grind-in-resident-evil-requiem">Leon Has An Ax to Grind in Resident Evil Requiem</h2>



<p>Furthermore, it’s noted that one key way Leon’s personality change is on display is in how he attacks the zombies. In the upcoming game, his main weapon will be an ax, which is said to symbolize how he has changed over the years.</p>



<p>Nakanishi says he wants players to question why Leon made this choice and why he is acting with such aggression and anger. He wants players to ponder what is wrong with the character they’ve known for over two decades.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This game’s Leon fights by swinging his bloody ax in a way where you might start thinking, ‘What’s wrong with you, Leon?’ while playing. That is what we’re aiming for.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Resident Evil Requiem will release on February 27 for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/pc/" id="4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/xbox-series-x/" id="28">Xbox Series</a>.

            <guid>1420507</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ted Timmins, the design director of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, has commented on players’ desires for new content, changes to the development team for the longstanding Battle Royale pillar, and teased some major updates to come in the next couple of months.</p>



<p>When a game reaches the level of success Fortnite has, listening to your audience is key. In the first season of its 7th chapter, Fortnite continues to draw interest through collaborations with popular IPs such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leak-reveals-the-office-collab-skins/" id="171628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>. However, core gameplay will always be a focal point.</p>



<p>In a tweet, Ted Timmins, responding to a video from SypherPK, noted that he understands the community is seeking new content. He also stated that there was always an understood risk when focusing on battle Royale mode and going back to basics with the first season of Chapter 7.</p>



<p>He then teased a fun update coming in February, possibly hinting at the inclusion of Self-Revives lives and Shockwaves, before noting that March would see the launch of season 2 for chapter 7.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey folks!</p><p>So, we need to talk 🙂 Seeing some of the responses from <a href="https://twitter.com/SypherPK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SypherPK</a>’s video (thank you for sharing your constructive feedback!), thought I'd jump in to join the conversation. </p><p>Totally hear the comments that the community is eager for new content.

<h2 id="h-fortnite-s-stability-was-also-addressed">Fortnite’s Stability Was Also Addressed</h2>



<p>After teasing fun updates, Timmins also revealed the creation of a “multi-discipline live-ops strike team.” This is a new addition to the development team, whose focus is on improving the player experience and general quality-of-life updates. He notes that this is a permanent addition to the development team.</p>



<p>The message concludes with a reminder to players that they can get a guaranteed Stick of Truth if they join this weekend’s Power Hour.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/no-rest-for-the-wicked/" id="2611">No Rest for the Wicked</a> is currently an action role-playing game in Early Access. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/moon-studios/" id="1402">Moon Studios</a>, known for the Ori series, plans to increase the game’s price from $40 to $60 after it leaves Steam Early Access and launches version 1.0.</p>



<p>The game is currently on sale at 40% off. Thomas Mahler, Creative Director of the game, <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/2016906516754808905?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted </a>to explain the sale and reiterate plans to move the game to $60 once it’s released in full.</p>



<p>“I’’m not trying to do any FOMO marketing here, but yes: when we hit 1.0, No Rest for the Wicked will move to $60, because it’s a premium title,” he said.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Since I’m getting a lot of messages about this, just to clarify:</p><p>The current 40% sale is a one-time promotion to celebrate and support No Rest for the Wicked Together.

<h2 id="h-mahler-compares-no-rest-for-the-wicked-to-baldur-s-gate-3">Mahler Compares No Rest for the Wicked to Baldur’s Gate 3</h2>



<p>Furthermore, he explained that the game launched in Early Access at $40 because he did not feel it was right to charge early supporters full price before it was properly ready. </p>



<p>He compared his strategy to that of Baldur’s Gate 3, which launched into Early Access at full price, explaining that he was never a fan of that approach.</p>



<p>“BG3 launched into Early Access at full price, and personally, I never loved that approach. If you support a game early, you should get some extra love,” he’d add.</p>



<p>Those interested can currently pick up the game on <a href="https://t.co/QiT6by7r2R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam </a>for $23.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="7bd695591b7e3"><a title="Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Hugh and Bubbles" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7bd695591b7e3/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-hugh-and-bubbles.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> Nintendo Direct has won over many hearts, with its bizarre humour, huge amount of freedom and flexibility with customisation, and even a a dramatic romantic storyline.</p>
<p>We fell in love with Hugh Morris, the clown-like character from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Nintendo of America presentation</a> (who doesn't want to talk about monster trucks, sadly). But when we announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-moves-in-on-switch-1-this-april">our love for him</a>, a lot of people were quick to ask, "wait, <em>who?</em> What about Bubbles?"</p>
<p>Many readers were then quick to point out that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNtYngxAs1k">Nintendo UK version</a> of the Direct had an entirely different set of characters and Miis, with slightly different storylines playing out between the cast.</p>
<p>Regional variants for Nintendo Directs are pretty common, but that's usually for general Directs. Japan often gets trailers for games we don't, and vice versa. And while the content in both the UK and US Directs is largely the same, the stars are sometimes very different.</p>

<p>Bubbles the Clown is one such example, but he's not the only UK-exclusive character: Rosa is your best friend instead of Jess in the UK stream, and Forian is a gym rat in Blighty while Patrick loves the guitar in the USA.</p>
<p>Hey, Carlo's in both of them! But he's presented a bit differently depending on what Direct you're watching: in the UK, he's very nosy and active, while the US version is a barista. And at least Mocha the Bear remains in tacts on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Other changes are a bit more subtle — the Hot Dog costume is featured in the American Direct, but a Wizard and Bee costume take centre stage in the UK. More grocery items are shown off in the US Direct, and different rooms and decors are highlighted in both versions. And instead of your best friend trying to get in on the romance in the ferris wheel, the UK version makes sure the alien is a part of the action.</p>
<p>Reader Suketoudara also pointed us towards <a href="https://youtu.be/xDKM6ygU1BE?si=J_4prQRZJMfn8yex">a video by rockheadHD</a>, comparing the localisation of both the US and UK versions of the game. And they're pretty different!</p>
<p>The most-obvious place is during the News Report segment where the newsreader talks about the stories on-air in slightly different ways, depending on which version you're watching. Whether this is the case in the full release, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Otherwise, of the European streams appear to use the UK version (with subtitles, of course), but as you're probably expecting at this point, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMgPZ0h3B4U">Japan's version</a> was also slightly different to ours.</p>
<p>Once again, the cast of characters are very different to the English-language streams — we picked up on Rika, Daisuke (who plays guitar like Patrick), and <em>another</em> variation of Carlo, this time a painter.</p>
<p>The grocery store was where many of the biggest differences were, with food items like pizza, coffee, and escargot replaced by octopus, juice, and rice bowls.</p>

<p>The content of all three Directs we've highlighted is otherwise the same, bar these examples we've pointed out. And they're all delightful and tonally weird in their own ways. We've only spotted a handful of small differences in all of them, and there's bound to be tons we've missed, so let us know if you've spotted anything that stands out to you!</p>
<p>You won't have to wait long to live the dream on Switch, as Tomodachi Life: living the Dream comes out on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>issues a statement on image-sharing features in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream/" id="3535">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo/" id="22">Nintendo </a>recently held a dedicated Nintendo Direct for the upcoming Tomodachi Life sequel headed to the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. In addition to announcing the game’s April 16 release, the presentation showcased how players could customize their Miis and the island they inhabit.</p>



<p>However, Nintendo has issued a statement regarding limitations to image sharing in the upcoming game.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-is-committed-to-creating-experiences-that-are-welcoming-for-everyone">Nintendo Is Committed to Creating Experiences That Are Welcoming for Everyone</h2>



<p>Following the Nintendo Direct, the official <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo blog</a> issued a statement saying that restrictions have been placed on certain image-sharing features to create a safe environment for all players.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nintendo did, however, decide to expand players’ ability to express their gender and sexuality through their Tomodachi Life Mii characters. Players can now choose to make characters non-binary and date anyone of any gender. This follows a 2014 statement promising that future efforts would aim to design a more inclusive gameplay experience after players questioned the omission of same-sex relationships in the original Tomodachi Life.</p>



<p>The trailer released on January 29 showed that certain characters will experience heartbreak multiple times in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, while others may find marriage after bonding over monster trucks. Truly different strokes for different folks.</p>

            <guid>1420471</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong>, a star of both the Broadway stage and the big screen, has been named as the latest addition to the cast of <strong>Amazon's God of War TV series</strong>. It's another casting choice that deviates from the original games, as Patinkin will play <strong>Odin</strong>, replacing <strong>Richard Schiff</strong>, who played the character in <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>.</p>



<p>It's the second casting announcement today, confirmed in a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/mandy-patinkin-cast-odin-god-of-war-tv-series-1236702507/">Deadline</a>, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong> was tapped to play <strong>Thor</strong></a>. Patinkin joins Ólafsson, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Ryan Hurst </strong>as <strong>Kratos</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer </strong>as <strong>Sif</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/"><strong>Max Parker </strong>as <strong>Heimdall</strong></a>, and is hopefully not the last casting announcement we see for a while, especially with <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">filming reportedly set to start in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It's also not the casting announcement we expected to see after Ólafsson, since <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">a recent rumour</a> that correctly identified Ólafsson, Palmer, and Parker's casting ahead of their actual confirmation pointed to <strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> reprising his role as <strong>Mimir</strong>. Hopefully, that casting is accurate, as Duncan's performance is beloved by fans of the <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> and <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> games.</p>



<p>Beyond Mimir, we're still waiting to find out casting choices for characters like <strong>Baldur, Freya, </strong>and most significantly, <strong>Atreus</strong>. We also don't know if characters like <strong>Brok</strong> and <strong>Sindri</strong> will be included, though hopefully we'll know soon as more concrete details about the plot are revealed, beyond the confirmation that this show will pull from the Norse-based games, rather than the original Greek-based games.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/haunted-chocolatier-stardew-valley-abandoned-release-date-2000664261</link>
            <guid>1420468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-dev-returns-with-a-cozy-rpg-about-haunte-1847912361"><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a> is the next game from the creator of <em>Stardew Valley</em>, one of the most successful and adored cozy RPGs ever made. Not surprisingly, fans are getting antsy to hear more about the upcoming release. But the wait is leading to <a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-concerenedape-haunted-chocolatier-update-1851778392">all sorts of speculation,</a> so developer Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone recently took to the game’s website to dispel the unfounded rumors in a new blog post.</p> <p>“Hey everyone, good news: I’ve been very productive lately on <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>,” he <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/">wrote this week</a>. “Yep, it’s taking a while to finish the game. That’s oaky. I know, I know, I shouldn’t have announced the game so early. But I had my reasons.” From there he went on to debunk some popular fan myths and set the record straight on<em> Haunted Chocolatier</em>‘s development.</p>

 <h2>1.<em> Haunted Chocolatier</em> will not be abandoned and added to <em>Stardew Valley</em> instead</h2> <p>He promised this wouldn’t happen, but said that even if he did end up abandoning his new game it would be absurd to think it would get added to the existing one. They were made in different engines and “you can’t just copy and paste <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> into <em>Stardew Valley</em>.”</p> <h2>2. Ideas for <em>Haunted Chocolatier </em>are not being tested inside <em>Stardew Valley</em></h2> <p>Barone once again reiterated that these are “separate” games even if they might share the same aesthetic. Furthermore, he said he doesn’t want to spoil anything being worked on in <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> by teasing it early in <em>Stardew Valley</em>.</p>

 <h2>3. He’s not working on <em>Stardew Valley</em> to avoid working on <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></h2> <p>Barone maintained that the only reason he keeps releasing new <em>Stardew Valley</em> updates is because it’s still an incredibly popular game, not because anything with <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> has gone awry.</p> <h2>4. <em>Haunted Chocolatier </em>doesn’t have a 2030 release date</h2> <p>The developer previously said he “hoped” that <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> would be out in the next five years. That was taken by some to mean it won’t be out before then. He re-confirmed there is no actual set release date and it will just be done when it’s done, like all good things worth waiting for.</p>

 <p>Welp, glad that’s all settled. The <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> subreddit can go to sleep now until the game is out, or better yet just keep playing <em>Stardew</em> Valley.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-2026-road-map-updates-cross-save-new-loot-dlc-level-cap-increase-2000664254</link>
            <guid>1420456</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched last year with many, myself included, praising the game’s combat and open world, but criticizing a myriad of technical problems and performance issues. Since then, Gearbox has continued to update the game, and the studio has a big roadmap planned for 2026 that includes level cap increases, cross saves, and more.</p> <p>On January 29, <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/update-notes/">Gearbox pushed out a new major update for <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. This update adds a new photo mode, something people have been asking about for a bit now. Finally, you can take gorgeous cinematic images of yourself blasting apart rippers and aliens with a four-barreled assault rifle. Alongside that new feature came a long list of various tweaks, changes, and fixes as you might expect from a big update for a modern game in 2026. The bigger news, however, is what’s coming to <em>Borderlands 4</em> over the next few months.</p>

 <p><a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/2026-roadmap/">In a blog post,</a> Gearbox outlined its roadmap for 2026, and it includes some previously teased features as well as some new additions that should make any<em> Borderlands 4</em> player happy. First, Gearbox <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708">reconfirmed that Pearlescents</a>, a higher loot rarity level seen in past games, would be added to <em>Borderlands 4</em> when the game’s first expansion, “Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned,” arrives in March. And you won’t have to buy the DLC to start finding these rarer pieces of loot once they’ve been added to the looter shooter in an upcoming update. This is also when the game’s first new Vault Hunter, C4SH, will be added.</p> <h2>The biggest news from<em> Borderlands 4</em>‘s 2026 roadmap</h2> <p>Meanwhile, Gearbox confirmed that it is working on three highly requested features for <em>Borderlands 4.</em> The studio didn’t share release dates or windows for when to expect these three features in its new roadmap, but they will arrive in 2026.</p>

 <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Level cap increases are coming in future updates for “all players.” Gearbox added that it looks “forward to seeing even more build variety and interactions made possible by the additional skill points!”</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Cross-platform saves will be added later this year, allowing players to bounce between platforms without having to restart a new character. Hopefully Gearbox has plans for people like me who have high-level characters on two different platforms.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Shared world progression between characters is also coming. Gearbox is going to add an option in a future patch that will let you share all your open-world progression, like extra backpack slots, discovered Vault Fragments, and vehicle unlocks, across all your characters. I do hope this is optional, as I’d like to return to <em>Borderlands 4</em> one day and be able to start all over with a new playthrough and not inherit all the upgrades I unlocked before.</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>Besides all that, Gearbox has also promised more free events. Though if they are anything like the <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-halloween-event-borderlands-4-sucks-bad-horrors-of-kairos-2000638842">not-so-great Halloween event from last year,</a> I’m not sure how excited I am about that. Also coming in 2026 to<em> Borderlands 4</em> is more endgame content, including a new raid boss and a super-hard-to-complete Takedown mission in Q2 2026. (<a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/2016921486435520663?">This was previously teased for a Q4 release</a>, so it appears to have been moved up, which is nice.) Gearbox says it’s working on “additional endgame activities that’ll add a new layer of challenge and mastery to existing content.”</p>

 <p>So <em>Borderlands 4</em> isn’t “dead” as so many on the internet like to claim. The real question is whether all this new content and free updates will arrive on time and be worth the wait. For now, I’m going to go take a cool screenshot of me shooting Claptrap with a rocket launcher using that new photo mode.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/</link>
            <guid>1420453</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The prices for all four editions of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26 </a>have leaked ahead of the official start of pre-orders on January 30.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 will be released in four versions, and according to a new report from billbil-kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/wwe-2k26-switch-2-plateformes-date-de-sortie-ce-que-lon-sait-60917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, the prices for the upcoming game have been released. The Standard Edition, which includes only the base game, will be priced at $69.99. The King of Kings Edition, the second-tier “Deluxe” edition, will be priced at $99.99.</p>



<p>Then, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" id="171784" rel="nofollow">Attitude Era Edition</a>, the “Premium” Edition of the game, will release for $129.99. Finally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" id="171836" rel="nofollow">Monday Night War Edition </a>will provide access to the most content throughout the game’s lifecycle and will be priced at $149.99.</p>



<p>In addition to providing players with more content at no additional cost, all higher-priced tiers will grant access to the game on March 6. Reportedly, this is 7 days earlier than when players who purchased only the standard tier will be able to play.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-leaves-last-gen-consoles-behind">WWE 2K26 Leaves Last-Gen Consoles Behind</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>After years of the current WWE game line releasing on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the ESRB rating for WWE 2K26 confirms that this year’s release will be limited to current-gen consoles.</p>



<p>Ironically, while WWE 2K26 leaves the past behind with its console releases, much of the game’s marketing has been rooted in WWE’s past. The Attitude Era and Monday Night War Editions focus heavily on the peak of WWE popularity in the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>



<p>Also, all three covers for the higher-priced tiers feature WWE Legends, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-king-of-kings-edition-cover-features-triple-h/" id="171834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one legend in particular on all three covers: Triple H.</a></p>







<h2>WWE 2K26’s Showcase Focuses on CM Punk</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As first reported by Insider Gaming, this year’s 2K Showcase campaign focuses on CM Punk. Players will get to relive some of CM Punk’s greatest moments from his WWE career.</p>



<p>Also, fans can experience fantasy scenarios that may have occurred if CM Punk not left WWE in 2014 before returning in 2023. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Rest For The Wicked Will Cost As Much As Baldur’s Gate 3 When It Leaves Early Access: ‘I’m Not Trying To Do Any FOMO Marketing Here’]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, Moon Studios boss Thomas Mahler was threatening that his company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ori-moon-studios-no-rest-for-the-wicked-review-mahler-1851780166">might have to shut down</a> if players didn’t stop review-bombing his new action-RPG&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> on Steam. Now his team is celebrating a major turnaround after a recent update brought multiplayer co-op to the top-down Soulslike. With a fresh spotlight on the Early Access project, Mahler took the opportunity to confirm that while the game is currently steeply discounted, it’ll cost as much as<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> once it’s fully released.</p> <p>“I’m not trying to do any FOMO marketing here, but yes: when we hit 1.0, <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> will move to <span>$60</span>, because it’s a premium title,” he <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/2016906516754808905">wrote on X</a> on Thursday. “We’ve announced this a long time ago and repeated it several times.” He compared it to the hit <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-based CRPG which remained full-price throughout Early Access. Unlike that, <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> is typically $40 in its own Early Access period. At the moment, it’s even cheaper than that thanks to an ongoing Steam Sale. It’ll be 40 percent off until February 5.</p>

 <p>“The reason the game launched at <span>$40</span> was simple: <span>Early Access players should get a discount</span>,” Mahler wrote. “<em>BG3</em> launched into Early Access at full price, and personally I never loved that approach. If you support a game early, you should get some extra love. I’m only saying this now so nobody’s surprised or upset later. If you’ve been on the fence about <em>Wicked</em>, the current sale is genuinely a good time to jump in.”</p> <h2>A free-to-play Steam weekend coup</h2> <p>And a bunch of players clearly have been. <a tabindex="0" role="button" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/518610613985871419"><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>‘s Together update</a> went live just last week on January 22. In addition to the usual bevy of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and re-balancing, it brought full, shared-world co-op to the game that transformed the otherwise grim and solemn affair into something much more social. In addition to fighting through a brutal and bloody fantasy setting together, players can also fish, forage, and partake in other, more chill distractions.</p>

 <p>New players have been flocking to the game ever since with an major influx of positive Steam reviews over the weekend when the game was briefly free-to-play. It peaked at over 60,000 concurrents and was temporarily the best-selling game on Steam. Mahler said the game’s been selling tens of thousands of new copies every day since.</p>

 <p>It’s a far cry from last summer’s ominous warnings that the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/ori-blind-forest-will-wisps-sexism-toxic-moon-studios-m-1848673622">Ori and the Blind Forest</a></em> maker might not be “around in a couple of months to do anything anymore” if existing players kept complaining about the direction of the game. The game is currently slated to arrive on PlayStation 5 when it hits 1.0, but so far there’s no set timeline for when that will happen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“AI is Theft, I Have to Use It, Otherwise I’ll Get Fired”: GDC Reports One-Third of Game Workers Are Using GenAI for Daily Tasks]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ai-is-theft-i-have-to-use-it-otherwise-ill-get-fired-gdc-reports-one-third-of-game-workers-are-using-genai-for-daily-tasks/</link>
            <guid>1420423</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>GDC State of the Game Industry Report 2026</strong> is <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">officially out</a>, offering insights into the video game industry based on responses from over <strong>2,300 game industry workers</strong>. Respondents answered questions about everything from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/i-cant-fully-trust-anywhere-now-gdc-reports-1-in-4-devs-have-been-laid-off-in-last-2-years/">industry layoffs</a></strong> to popular game engines and platforms, and the current, longstanding hot-button industry topic, <strong>Generative AI (GenAI).</strong></p>



<p>For some people in the video game industry, GenAI tools are the latest technological innovation that will revolutionize the game development process. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/"><strong>Everyone will use them if they aren't already</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">they'll be as commonplace as anything else</a>. Others think <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/"><strong>there is absolutely no place for them</strong></a> in game development, not even if you're trying to ride that middle lane where you think <a href="https://wccftech.com/probablymonsters-interview-ethical-ai-storm-lancers-switch-2/">it'll be helpful for some things</a>, but nothing can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/">replicate or replace the <strong>"<em>human</em>"</strong> element in creation</a>.</p>



<p>While <strong>one-third (35%)</strong> of respondents said they don't personally use GenAI for their jobs, a <strong>majority (52%) said GenAI tools are used</strong> at their studios, which has also resulted in more studios creating policies around its use. Only <strong>15% of respondents</strong> said their company did not have a policy on the use of GenAI tools, with <strong>78% confirming that there is policy language</strong> of some kind at their studio. The remaining <strong>7%</strong> said they were unsure.</p>



<p>Policies are also getting more specific, with <strong>22%</strong> of respondents saying that only specific tools are allowed and not others. Most are using LLMs like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-healths-integration-with-chatgpt-health-reportedly-allows-for-fallacious-and-inconsistent-diagnoses/">ChatGPT</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/apples-gemini-siri-deal-is-worth-at-least-5-billion-for-google-indicating-that-the-deal-would-last-through-2030/">Google Gemini</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-gaming-copilot-ai-controversy/">Microsoft Copilot</a></strong>, which lines up for what they're using these tools for. "<em>Research or brainstorming</em>" was the most common response, with second going to daily tasks, including writing emails, code assistance, and prototyping. Only <strong>5% of respondents</strong> said they used GenAI tools for "<em>player-facing features</em>," <strong>10%</strong> for procedural generation, and <strong>19%</strong> for asset generation. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GDC-State-of-the-Game-Industry-2026-Report-GenAI-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: GDC</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For some respondents, it's clear that these tools are essential, more for their efficiency than anything else. "<em>We are a small team, so it is making us capable of achieving more than we would without it</em>," said one respondent who is an executive working at an indie studio.</p>



<p>But even with this increased use and necessity, as the report reads, "<em>it appears the more the game industry professionals know about Generative AI, the less they like it</em>."  <strong>52% of respondents</strong> believe GenAI tech is having<strong> a negative impact on the video game industry</strong>. It's a <strong>30% bump</strong> compared to last year's GDC survey, but even within the negative majority are people who use it because they have to, or feel like they have to for their work. "<em>AI is theft</em>," begins one response from a developer in Ukraine. "<em>I have to use it, otherwise I'm gonna get fired</em>."</p>



<p>What's more interesting than looking at the percentages, though, are some of the quotes from individual developers who answered positively, negatively, or with mixed reactions about GenAI tools and tech.</p>

<p>Again, it should be noted that this annual survey is just a sample size; it's not a complete picture of the industry, and there's still a lot to be figured out with where GenAI tech lands not just in video games and video game development, but in other industries around the world.</p>



<p>At least with its increased use, more studios are writing guidelines as to how it should be used, and most of its use doesn't seem to make it to our actual monitors when we sit down for a night of gaming. That will likely continue to be what players care about the most, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamers-not-opposed-to-ai-exploitation-slop-bobium-brawlers/"><strong>Studio Atelico</strong> told Wccftech in a recent interview,</a> "<em></em><em><strong>I strongly believe that what players and people in general are opposed to is not actually AI, but rather the exploitation of people and 'slop.'"</strong></em> </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Save Kittens And Blast Away Demons In This New $15 FPS]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/meowgun-review-boomer-shooter-retro-fps-cats-quake-2000664236</link>
            <guid>1420414</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are many, many, <em>many</em> retro-themed first-person shooters, aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/cruel-boomer-shooter-retro-fps-pc-steam-2025-review-1851737479">boomer shooters</a>, on the market. Some might say there are too many. I’m inclined to agree with that, if only because there’s a lot of crap and slop out there pretending to be solid throwbacks to fast-paced FPS action. <em>MeowGun: Hell Denizen, </em>out now on Steam, isn’t one of those disappointing games.</p> <p><em>MeowGun’</em>s biggest strength is that, like some other <a href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-morrowind-doom-engine-mohtra-review-pc-steam-fps-boomer-shooter-2000647667">great retro shooters</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/wrath-is-a-retro-shooter-done-right-1841067258">including <em>Wrath</em></a>, it is built using an open-source version of a classic FPS engine. In this case, <em>MeowGun</em> uses FTEQW, which is an excellent open-source version of the original <em>Quake</em> engine. And as is usually the case with these boomer shooters built on the tech of the past, it helps make <em>MeowGun</em> feel fantastic.</p>

  <p>Every gun in <em>MeowGun</em> is snappy, loud, and deadly. You move fast, but always feel in control. And blowing away demons with pistols, shotguns, bombs, and grenade launchers is a joy. It helps that <em>MeowGun’s</em> developers understand that people play boomer shooters to blow shit up and kill lots of enemies while sprinting through various levels that should never be too big. I also appreciate that <em>MeowGun’s</em> starting pistol is quite powerful and proves useful in fights for picking off enemies or saving ammo. This ain’t a peashooter you’ll never use after you get a new weapon.</p> <p><em>MeowGun’s</em> voice acting is at times distracting, especially as the main character–a half cat/half demon woman named MeowMeow–speaks almost entirely in movie quotes and pop culture references. And they start to repeat pretty quickly. Thankfully, I was often blowing up so much shit that I rarely could hear these lines. But if a talking protagonist is too much for you, <em>MeowGun</em> might be a grating experience. On the other hand, if you love cats, there are small and very adorable kittens to find and save. Yes, before you ask, you can pet the cats you save. Oh, and there’s a dedicated button to make your character meow. I’ll let you decide how that makes you feel.</p>

 <p>To be clear: <em>MeowGun: Hell Denizen</em> isn’t some revolutionary first-person shooter that I’m going to come back to year after year to enjoy. But it is a damn good retro FPS that understands what people want out of these kinds of games: Lots of enemies to kill, fast music, satisfying guns, and short load times. And <em>MeowGun</em> delivers on all of that and costs less than $15. In 2026, I can’t ask for much more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has teased a potential <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> expansion. The tabletop studio's most recent social media posts hint at new horrors to overcome in the cooperative board game. Horrors that may come straight from the cursed lands of Ravenloft.</p><h2>The <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Expansion Tease</h2><p>Ravensburger's tease of the next <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> expansion came from a social media post <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ravensburgerglobal/p/DUDpTJ_DPZz/?hl=en" rel="nofollow">on Instagram</a>. The post is enigmatic, showing the board game's logo, the tagline, "something new is coming in Fall 2026" and artwork of a creepy jester puppet holding a needle.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>It is an interesting choice of monster to showcase. The original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-details-on-horrified-dungeons-dragons-emerge-from-dungeons-deep" rel="nofollow"><em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> game already featured monsters so iconic they are pop culture staples. The Beholder. The Mimic. The Red Dragon. By contrast, this figure is more obscure.</p><p>However, based on the appearance, artwork, and weapon, it is clear this monster is from Ravenloft, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons'</em> gothic horror setting. The creature is a Carrionette, first featured in the fifth edition supplement, <em>Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft</em>. Carrionettes are toys gifted sentience by the loving craft of their maker.&nbsp;</p><p>The horrifying twist is they crave a mortal life. So much so they will ambush unsuspecting people, pull out their soul with a golden needle, and then take over their body. If you can imagine a creepy Pinocchio or a fantasy version of the serial killing doll Chucky, you have an idea to the danger the Carionette holds.</p><p>With this in mind, it's a strong possibility other Ravenloft residents may show up in this Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons expansion. A mummy lord from the deserts of Har'Akir. The life-force stealing Jiangshi from the liminal city of I'Cath. Bluetspur's resident Vampire Mindflayers.</p><p>For <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> diehards, there is the possibility the expansion may include it's most iconic monster: the First Vampire, Strahd Von Zarovich. That may be wishful thinking for two reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>One, if Strahd was in the expansion, he would be on the box. It would just be savvy marketing given his long storied history with the fantasy RPG. Second, the Horrified series centers on regular people escaping monsters, and the Dark Lord of Barovia has been slaughtering larger-than-life heroes for centuries. It would be a bit much.</p><p>At the time of writing, further information on the <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> expansion is minimal. Since the release isn't until Fall, there is plenty of time for Ravensburger to provide more info.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two more castings have been made in the upcoming God of War series on Prime Video. One is a star of Severance. The other is a legendary actor.</p>



<p>As the Prime Video <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106">God of War</a> series continues to take shape, two additional casting decisions have been announced. <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/mandy-patinkin-cast-odin-god-of-war-tv-series-1236702507/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline </a>reports that the legendary Mandy Patinkin, known for playing Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride, will be in the upcoming series playing Odin. Odin is known as the “All-Father.” The Ruler of the Norse Pantheon is also the father of Thor and Heimdall. It was previously confirmed that Max Parker will play Heimdall. However, we now know who will play Thor.</p>



<h2>Thor Will Be Portrayed by a Severance Star in the Forthcoming God of War Series</h2>



<p>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, known for his role as the stern and violent, when necessary, Mr. Drummond on the Apple TV series Severance, will portray the God of Thunder, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. Furthermore, the series will portray Thor as a former soldier of Asgard and Odin’s former right-hand man. He is dealing with some confidence issues and is struggling with alcohol as a means of coping.</p>



<p>Ryan Hurst, the series’ Kratos, previously voiced Thor in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/" id="107">God of War: Ragnarök</a> video game. It has also been confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-has-reportedly-secured-another-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teresa Palmer will play Thor’s wife, Sif,</a> in the series.</p>







<h2 id="h-prime-video-s-god-of-war-is-already-renewed-for-season-2">Prime Video’s God of War is Already Renewed for Season 2</h2>



<p>Without even having filmed a single episode, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon renewed the series for a second season</a>. Production is expected to begin in February 2026. The first two episodes are to be directed by Frederick E. O. Toye, who previously directed the video game–to–TV adaptation Fallout.</p>



<p>As of now, there’s no word on when the series will premiere. Insider Gaming will continue to monitor the story and report any and all updates.</p>

<p>Get ready to kid the kids to the vacant lot. A new Backyard Baseball game is coming this year.</p>



<p>Playground Productions has officially announced a new Backyard Baseball game will launch in Summer 2026. It’s the first new game in the Backyard Sports series since Backyard Sports Baseball 2015 for iOS and Android. With a likely release for console, it would be the first for major platforms since Backyard Sports: Rookie Rush in 2010.</p>







<p>Details on the game itself weren’t revealed, but Playground Productions says that information will come in the near future.</p>



<p>To hold over until more news comes, Playground has released Backyard Sports: The Animated Special on YouTube. The nearly 12-minute show features an all-star cast of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Ego Nwodim, Donald Faison, Adam Pally, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“In a high-energy new animated special from Playground Productions, the beloved 90’s video game franchise “Backyard Sports” returns as superstar Stephanie “Bubbles” Morgan is in crisis after losing her gotta-have-it, never-play-without-it lucky bubble gum,”</strong> the show’s description reads. <strong>“With just 30 minutes until game time, the Backyard kids embark on a wild, time-sensitive mission to track it down and save their season.”&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Straight to the End of the Line.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is 22 years old, which as you can imagine means that people have cracked that game wide open with weird glitches, skips, and tricks. Over the years, speedrunners have found ways to break San Andreas that got an any% speedrun of it down to a little under three hours, but recently an absolutely buckwild bug was found that cut that time down even further, to under an hour. Buckle up, folks, because this is one heck of a wacky speedrun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some context. San Andreas has been broken and rebroken many times over the years across its multiple versions, and there's one specific "trick" that's upended the speedrunning landscape multiple times. It actually originated in GTA: Vice City, where a <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/gtavc/guides/0h9mr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trick known as Script Stack Underflow</a> (SSU) was found that chopped an any% run down to around eight minutes. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-speedrunning-trick-sh-1838953554" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Way back in 2019</a>, San Andreas runners found something similar that they called "Arbitrary Jump in Script", or AJS, specifically in the Window Store remaster of the game. This overly-complex trick essentially let speedrunners jump straight to the end of the game by doing a long series of very specific things such as killing a drug dealer, parking a bike in a very specific place, answering the phone at very specific times, and diligently avoiding vending machines at all costs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While involved, it demonstrably worked, with the end result being the game executing a "JUMP" command to the start of End of the Line Part 3, the final mission. Ever since then the speedrunning community has had to split the category into any% and any% no AJS, because watching a run with AJS is fun exactly once and then you really just want to watch a proper, action-packed, multi-hour San Andreas speedrun. For a long time, this skip was limited to the Windows Store version of the game, though it was later found in the Definitive Edition remaster with some significant setup differences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well now, speedrunners have figured out how to do AJS in the original PC version of San Andreas. It is <em>also</em> completely different in how it's set up, and is somehow even wackier than any of the versions that have come before. u/Vitosi4ek on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1qpv1ji/a_skip_the_whole_game_strat_has_been_found_in_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has a really nice breakdown of all the steps involved</a> (though some runners have already found ways to smooth out certain bits of it). These include: winning $10,000 on horse betting, making a clone of yourself, doing stunt jumps on a superbike, betting in the casino with negative money, changing your clothes, doing a dance minigame, running two Mission at the exact same time, and a lot more. All of this will hopefully, if the game doesn't crash, send you to the start of End of the Line Part 3, and let you finish the game right there.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every GTA Game Ranked</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This glitch was literally just discovered, and in that time the world record run for an any% of GTA: San Andreas has dropped down to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zll2qkggyCU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">53 minutes and 46 seconds by creezyful</a>. It's very likely that this time will get even more shaved off in the coming days and weeks as speedrunners continue to optimize. This has also resulted in the community splitting any% off from any% no AJS, so audiences can still enjoy a roughly three-hour run of San Andreas and all the hyjinks involved in that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's wildly impressive to me that people are still managing to crack games this old open even more than they've already been, and make their guts do ridiculous things. Just this past AGDQ, I watched someone run arbitrary code execution in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, something I'm pretty sure they didn't know how to do the last time the game was at the show. Video games, man!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, that does mean it'll probably be a long time before we get a run of GTA 6 that goes that fast. And that's if we can even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">make it to launch day this November</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 is getting a major update today, including, among other things, the addition of the long-awaited Photo Mode that was announced prior to the game's launch, but was allegedly held due to the need to prioritize polishing other elements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The update <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was announced via the official Borderlands 4 website</a>, and it isn't just a Photo Mode being added. Harlowe's Zero-Point Action skill is getting a rework, and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode levels will now increase dedicated loot drop levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Photo Mode is the crown jewel here, and it's available now by restarting your game and downloading the update. Once the update is installed, you can find Photo Mode in the Pause menu while you're playing. It'll let you adjust the camera and apply a variety of visual effects including Field of View and Depth of Field adjustments, filters, changing the time of day, and even toggling visibility of elements such as characters or even damage numbers. Entering Photo Mode will also pause the game entirely in single-player mode (sorry multiplayer folks, just doesn't work that way). There's a full guide to how to <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/photo-mode/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use the Photo Mode and all its settings right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Photo Mode was promised for Borderlands 4 way back in June of 2025, with creative director Graeme Timmins saying on social media that while it was planned, the team was prioritizing polishing other core elements, and Photo Mode thus wouldn't be around at launch.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I had us prioritize polishing some other elements, more core to the moment-to-moment experience. We've always planned for it, and had it tasked up, we just needed to spend a bit more time on things that would directly impact QoL of playing the game.</p>— Graeme Timmins (@ProdigyXL) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProdigyXL/status/1937542875434074376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Below we've pasted the full patch notes, including all the other updates to Harlowe and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode:</p><h2 data-cy="title1">Progression and Rewards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Contract Missions:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Patrol: Order troops: Now progresses when killing enemies</li><li>Trace: Scrap Core: The scrap core object is able to be interacted with consistently and the contract from Dominion can now be completed</li><li>Convinced the Intrusive Thoughts Vile Ripper, Deep State Phalanx, and Breaux Chambeaux Phalanx bounties to show up when a player has taken their contracts</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Vault Card Challenges:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>“Loot or Purchase 10/15 legendaries” Vault Card weekly challenge will no longer reset with a save/load</li><li>“Loot or Purchase Ordnance” will now increase when conditions are met</li><li>“Kill enemies with Torgue guns and gear” will now progress when using Torgue legendary grenade Firepot</li><li>“Kill X enemies with Maliwan guns and gears” and the Maliwan Challenge “Last Wan Standing” will now progress as intended</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Challenges: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Legendary Forsaken Chaos and Legendary Midnight Defiance have been removed from the Collect All Phosphene Challenge</li><li>Updated Maliwan status effects to better identify what triggered the status effects, leading to better tracking on challenges</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Progression and rewards</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed a reported issue that was causing travel to Dominion to be locked by a player leaving a transition area in multiplayer</li><li>“Potty Mouth” Mission: Objectives are no longer blocked when exiting to the main menu</li><li>Addressed an issue causing unlocked DLC content to be unavailable while offline</li><li>True Mode is now able to be consistently enabled for newly created level 30 UVHM characters</li><li>Added a tutorial for True Mode when the campaign is completed</li><li>Players creating a new character in multiplayer will now receive all intended rewards</li><li>Addressed a reported issue causing all equipment to be lost when quitting to the main menu during a countdown in multiplayer when switching to solo play</li><li>Addressed issues with the “Gourd Your Loins” cosmetic reward not being awarded with SHiFT code<ul data-cy="list"><li>If you were impacted by this issue the first time around, or you missed these <em>gourd-geous</em> heads during the Horrors of Kairos event, this SHiFT code will redeem your missing cosmetic!

Because we're changing the fundamental behavior of Zero-Point to include the old Inertia Augment behavior in the base skill, we want to see how these changes balance out before doing more work in the rest of the tree. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have our eye on a few other passives that may be candidates for some buffs, but between the recent passive buffs that were implemented several weeks ago, combined with today’s changes, we’ll revisit those in the future once we’ve gathered adequate feedback on the current changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Long term, we want to ensure that each Vault Hunter has plenty of build diversity, with each Action Skill having its own pros and cons. If and when we see one falling behind, we’ll continue to explore changes like today’s.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Zero-Point (Base Skill):</strong> Now includes the benefits of the previous "Inertia" Augment. Killing an enemy in Stasis now resets the duration, searches for a new target, and makes the duration decrease faster</li><li><strong>Inertia Augment (Changed): </strong>Updated to increase Harlowe’s Slam Damage.
