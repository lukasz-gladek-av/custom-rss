			<p><a href="https://x.com/leaks_infinite/status/1983941972311339311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to leaker leaks_infinite</a>, Halo: Campaign Evolved is just the beginning of a series of remakes already in the works. Allegedly, the campaigns of the second and third game are also being remade and will support optional sprint, just like the remake of the first installment.</p>



<p>The reason for all these games to cut multiplayer from their respective remakes is that Halo Studios does not want to split the fan base across several multiplayer experiences. Because of this, Halo 7, which is also reportedly in development, will be the only one to offer multiplayer. The leaker wrote:</p>



<p><em>Halo Studios wants everyone to play Halo 7's MP, they don't want to create separate multiplayer experiences competing with each other. Which is why they aren't being remade individually. This is a big factor, especially because all these games will be launching on Playstation.</em></p>



<p>The leaker also clarified that the seventh mainline entry will have its own campaign, a sort of sequel to Infinite, but it's possible the multiplayer and campaign won't launch at the same time. They may even be separate, as already seen with Infinite, which offered a premium campaign and a free-to-play multiplayer.</p>



<p>Later, leaks_infinite wrote that it is unlikely Halo 7 will be the actual title, as it doesn't appear that the developers are inclined to return to numbered games. Allegedly, the development team formerly known as 343 Industries has more than four projects currently in the works.</p>



<p>It all starts with <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Campaign Evolved</a>, though. Due next year on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5 for the first time, it'll offer an Unreal Engine 5-powered remake of the series debut, not to mention optional sprint mechanics, new weapons, updated mechanics taken from the later games, and three new missions that will take place before the beginning of the original Halo: Combat Evolved.</p>



<p>A former designer of the 2001 original, Jaime Griesemer, has since <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-designer-likens-remake-to-dance-remix-classic-song-straight-to-chorus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavily criticized some of the planned</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-designer-likens-remake-to-dance-remix-classic-song-straight-to-chorus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-call-of-duty-skins/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-is-the-latest-game-to-turn-its-back-on-%E2%80%98call-of-duty-skins%E2%80%99.1340092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has been released and is being enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of gamers worldwide. It’s a gritty, post-apocalyptic extraction shooter with a beautiful aesthetic, rooted in retro-futurism and boasting sumptuous, semi-open-world environments. It also has extensive customization options, including skin bundles and outfits.</p>



<p>That opens the door to potentially introducing some bizarre costumes, but Embark Studios has firmly shut down that suggestion. Following the reluctance of EA DICE to add kooky skins to Battlefield 6, Embark has stressed that ‘Call of Duty’ style skins won’t find their way into ARC Raiders.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-ridiculous-skin-packs-for-arc-raiders">No Ridiculous Skin Packs for ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>Call of Duty faces regular ridicule for the skins and outfit bundles it offers players everywhere. From Nicki Minaj to a literal pigeon, and from Beavis and Butthead to Wubz, Call of Duty has featured some borderline bizarre skins over the years.</p>



<p>One of the leading concerns from fans of Battlefield 6 was that EA DICE (and associated studios) would follow a similar monetization path in the newly released first-person shooter. For now, the team is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-skins-are-being-adjusted-after-community-backlash/">keeping the creativity confined</a> to mostly realistic outfits, but fans are skeptical whether it’ll stay that way forever.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/skins-cosmetics-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a>, Embark Studios confirmed that ARC Raiders will follow a similar operating model, with the team avoiding the addition of inane skins that don’t match the game’s vibe.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have. It will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction.</p>



<p>I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting that we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit, but we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes a Santa Claus. That’s not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that’s kind of the line you can draw.</p>



<p>I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don’t know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly – <strong>I don’t think the novelty is worth the trade</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Black Ops 7 will be released in just two weeks, and the stranger skins have already started stacking up for the game. It’s part and parcel of the Call of Duty ecosystem these days, but that doesn’t mean fans aren’t actively complaining about all the silly skins being added to the games.</p>



<p>Hopefully, games like Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders will steer clear of irrelevant crossovers and celebrity skins.</p>



<p>Do you want ARC Raiders to have any insane skin collaborations? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Triarchy Is an Open World Co-Op Action RPG with a Focus on Boss Fights and Sailing, and It’s Out in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/triarchy-open-world-coop-action-rpg-boss-fights-sailing-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/triarchy-is-an-open-world-co-op-action-rpg-with-a-focus-on-boss-fights-and-sailing-and-it%E2%80%99s-out-in-2026.1340089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Independent studio Digital Confectioners has unveiled Triarchy, an upcoming open world co-op (up to three players) action RPG. Like most games in the genre, it will focus on boss fights, but it also supports sailing.</p>



<p>That makes sense after learning that the setting is a 'drowned world'. Players will hunt deadly bosses across the Isles, and the developers promise that each boss fight will feature unique attack patterns, multiple phases, and arena hazards that require precise timing, positioning, and teamwork to overcome.</p>



<p>Upon defeating a boss, you'll get rewards such as unique upgrade materials and boss-exclusive gear. Moreover, Triarchy not only allows boss 'rematches'; players may also find secret triggers to unlock more challenging difficulties. Challenge Mode bosses feature new abilities, attack patterns, and balance tuning. As you would expect, killing these bosses will provide even better rewards.</p>



<p>Defeating foes will also yield experience to level up and then unlock powerful abilities in the talent tree. That way, players can define their own unique playstyle. Triarchy does concentrate mostly on 'intentional' melee combat, at any rate. Fights hinge on stamina, poise breaks, and carefully timed dodges. Parry windows reward precision, but over-committing leaves the character vulnerable to counterattacks. A vast array of weapons, each with its own unique style and feel, will be available. Players can even mix them thanks to the freeform dual-wield system.</p>

Co-Op Action RPG — Triarchy" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jktHoTDguW8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The ship will function as a fully customizable and upgradeable floating base. Over time, players can upgrade their ship's hulls, sails, and other components to enhance speed and durability. The ship also houses the workbench and supplies for crafting, and there's even a map table to help with navigation.</p>



<p>The co-op functionality supports no tethering (players aren't forced to be close to one another), shared progress, scaling, and drop-in/drop-out. Triarchy is targeting a 2026 launch, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708040/Triarchy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Steam page</a> already includes the minimum requirements:</p>



<ul>
<li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>



<li>OS: Windows 10</li>



<li>Processor: Intel Core i3 8100 / AMD Ryzen 3 2300X</li>



<li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li>Graphics: Nvidia GTX1060 6GB / AMD Radeon RX580 8GB</li>



<li>DirectX: Version 12</li>



<li>Storage: 25 GB available space</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Halo 2 and 3 Campaign Remakes in Development, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/halo-2-and-3-campaign-remakes-development-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-2-and-3-campaign-remakes-in-development-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1340080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by a Halo leaker that both Halo 2 and Halo 3 are getting the remake treatment after Halo: Campaign Evolved drops. In a post on social media, ‘leaks_infinite’ claimed that a source informed them that both games are being remade and that they ‘will have sprint’.</p>



<p>It was also noted that the next Halo game to feature multiplayer will be Halo 7, but nothing more was shared on that front, aside from a note that the campaign and multiplayer will launch separately, as they did in Halo Infinite.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-halo-remakes-could-be-coming">More Halo Remakes Could Be Coming</h2>



<p>It was recently revealed by Halo Studios that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> is on the way. The news dropped as the Halo Championship Series came to a close for 2025, marking the end of Halo Infinite’s competitive lifecycle.</p>



<p>The team also revealed that, for the first time, Halo will come to PlayStation, with Campaign Evolved being released on PS5.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, a Halo leaker has made a fresh claim that both Halo 2 and Halo 3 are being remade, but neither will have multiplayer. It’s a claim that has been met with disappointment by some, as Halo 3’s multiplayer is where many gamers were introduced to the series, being as it was one of the most popular games on Xbox 360.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Halo 2 &amp; Halo 3 are being remade, yes they will have sprint. No multiplayer, only campaign. Full remakes.<br>Multiplayer is going to be Halo 7. <a href="https://t.co/gD8DNKLT3V">pic.twitter.com/gD8DNKLT3V</a></p>— Halo Leaks (@leaks_infinite) <a href="https://twitter.com/leaks_infinite/status/1983941972311339311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The leaker then threw in a little conjecture, suggesting that Halo Studios will use the performance of Halo: Campaign Evolved to ‘judge whether a Halo 2 and 3 remake would be viable’, which is a fair comment.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that all planned remakes will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>



<p>Do you think Halo 2 and Halo 3 should be remade <strong>with </strong>multiplayer? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Spending $250 on AirPods Pro makes sense for some people, but plenty of situations call for something more affordable and practical. Anker earns enough trust from Apple to sell its products directly in Apple Stores which speaks volumes about build quality and reliability from a brand that consistently delivers excellent audio gear at prices that seem almost too good.</p>
<p>The <strong>Soundcore V20i open-ear headphones</strong> normally retail at $49 (already reasonable compared to premium alternatives) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5182/">but Amazon just slashed the price to $23 for early Black Friday</a>. This represents <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5182/">an all-time low and a 53% discount</a> on earbuds that solve a specific problem: giving you audio without blocking out the world around you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5182/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The open-ear design <strong>positions the 16mm drivers just outside your ear canal</strong> rather than sealing inside it, and creates a fundamentally different listening experience that<strong> prioritizes environmental awareness over total immersion</strong>. This matters immensely during activities like running, cycling, or walking in urban environments where hearing approaching vehicles, other pedestrians, or important announcements keeps you safe.</p>
<p>The titanium-coated diaphragms in those 16mm drivers deliver surprisingly robust bass response through Soundcore’s BassUp technology which analyzes your audio in real time and enhances low frequencies without distortion. The adjustable ear hooks rotate through four distinct positions and lets you find the exact angle that balances comfort with secure fit based on your unique ear shape.</p>



<h2>All-Day Comfort</h2>
<p>Traditional earbuds cause pressure points and can be very uncomfortable after a few hours of wear, especially for individuals with small ear canals or sensitivities to in-ear designs. The V20i solves this through its non-intrusive architecture and rests against your ear rather than inserting into it, hence <strong>banishing that plugged-up feeling and letting your ears breathe during extended listening sessions</strong>. The lightweight construction adds minimal weight to your head, making these genuinely comfortable for all-day wear during work, commutes, or marathon study sessions. With <strong>an IP55 certificate</strong>, it provides protection from sweat, light rain, and dust exposure, so you can wear these during workouts or outdoor activities without concern about moisture damage.</p>



<p>When you factor in the charging case, <strong>this goes up to a total of 36 hours of playtime</strong> or about a week of regular daily use until you have to plug in. Bluetooth 5.4 is the latest wireless standard, featuring improved connection stability, lower latency for video and better power efficiency compared to previous versions. The added multipoint connection allows you to <strong>connect these earbuds to two devices at once</strong> so you can seamlessly go from listening to tunes on your laptop to taking calls on your phone without having to manually reconnect.</p>
<p>At $23 down from $49, these Soundcore V20i earbuds cost less than most wired headphones but offer wireless convenience, situational awareness, and real audio quality. Anker’s reputation for durability and the massive customer review count suggest these earbuds will survive daily use far longer than the bargain price implies. That makes this early Black Friday deal one of those rare times where cheap really does mean value, not compromise.</p>

<p>The timing...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a> made its debut on the Switch earlier this year, and if you've been hanging out for a Switch 2 Edition, it seems you might be in luck.</p>
<p>A new classification for <strong>Hello Kitty Island Adventure - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</strong> has recently been spotted on the Entertainment Software Rating Board. It's received 'E' for 'Everyone' and includes the attached rating summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hello Kitting Island Adventure Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is rated E for Everyone by the ESRB. Also includes Users Interact. This is an adventure in which players help Hello Kitty and friends restore a mysterious island. Players explore the island, interact with friends, complete quests, and engage in various activities (e.g. cooking, fishing, gardening)."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Although we mentioned in our review how this cute social sim shares a lot of similarities with Nintendo's game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, it also draws inspiration from other series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>. You can find out more about this in our review. Hello Kitty's island adventure also got some DLC in September, adding a whole new map, new residents, recipes, minigames and much more.</p>
<p>If we get an official update about Hello Kitty Island Adventure coming to the Switch 2 in the future, we'll let you know.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-monster-laptop-64-gb-ram-2-tb-ssd-hits-mid-range-pricing-after-amazons-massive-2300-price-cut-2000640236</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-monster-laptop-64-gb-ram-2-tb-ssd-hits-mid-range-pricing-after-amazon%E2%80%99s-massive-2-300-price-cut.1339963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops rarely drop more than $2000, especially ones packing the kind of specs that make power users drool. The Hp 17 Business Laptop just crashed to $999 on Amazon, down from its typical $3,299 price tag, and this represents an all-time low that catches attention. Hp kicked off its Black Friday deals early on Amazon though the company’s official site hasn’t followed suit yet, and this configuration with 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD delivers professional-grade performance at a price that usually buys mid-range machines with half the memory and storage. You’re looking at a laptop that handles heavy multitasking, video editing, and data-intensive work without breaking a sweat or your budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5134/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Power Behind Those Numbers Makes Sense</h2>
<p>The hybrid architecture 13th Generation <strong>Intel Core i5-1334U processor handles work intelligently</strong> between two high-performance cores and eight efficient cores. Those <strong>performance cores clock up to 4.6GHz</strong> when you need maximum speed for demanding applications while the efficient cores handle background tasks and lighter workloads to preserve battery life. In essence, this means you can run virtual machines, edit 4K video, compile code and have dozens of browser tabs open at the same time without everything slowing down to a crawl.</p>



<p>That<strong> 64GB of DDR4 RAM at 3200MHz turns this into a multitasking monster</strong> that professionals actually need: video editors scrubbing through multiple 4K timelines without rendering previews, data analysts loading massive datasets into memory for instant querying and developers spinning up multiple Docker containers or virtual machines without the dreaded ‘out of memory’ warnings popping up. The <strong>2TB PCIe SSD provides storage space</strong> that meets real-world needs and fits years of project files, photo libraries and application installs while delivering read speeds of up to 15 times faster than traditional hard drives.</p>
<p>The <strong>17.3-inch Full HD display (1920×1080 resolution)</strong> offers screen real estate that eliminates constant window-switching and provides the opportunity for practical side-by-side document comparison. The narrow bezels maximize the viewing area without making the laptop’s footprint too wide, while an anti-glare coating means you can work near windows without fighting reflections. It’s bright enough at 250 nits to remain readable in most lighting conditions; direct sunlight still presents some challenges but it does on most laptops.</p>



<p>It comes <strong>preinstalled with Windows 11 Pro</strong> and ads business-focused features that the Home editions lack. Remote Desktop functionality lets you access this machine from anywhere with an internet connection, BitLocker encryption protects sensitive data in case the laptop is lost or stolen, and advanced group policy controls are helpful for IT departments managing security settings. Several USB ports-including one USB-C-an HDMI output for external displays, and an SD card reader round out the connectivity options needed daily by business users.</p>
<p>This is the best deal available on a laptop with these specs. If you’re looking for a powerhouse, this is it.</p>

While the game isn't going to demand an ultra high-end PC full of the best hardware, you might see your rig struggle in certain areas and during gunfights if your settings aren't properly dialed in.</p><p>You never want to lose all of your gear during a drop due to laggy gameplay or frame drops. To stop that from happening, we have a full list of the optimal PC graphics settings you should be using in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Best graphics settings for Arc Raiders on PC</h2><p>There are a decent number of graphics settings to change in the main menu of Arc Raiders, not to mention all the other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a> we have to offer. From our testing, changing even the most basic graphics settings has a huge effect on the amount of frames per second you get, even with a high-end PC. That said, you'll certainly want to see where your FPS is at after changing your settings to see if you need to lower anything further.</p><p>If you're experiencing noticeably low frames or jarring stutters, you might have to take matters outside of Arc Raiders itself. Changing settings in the Nvidia Control Panel or the game's config files in your directory is a way to go beyond lowering every graphics option to its lowest value, and it can have a big impact on your performance.</p><p>For now, though, let's go over the best PC graphics settings for Arc Raiders:</p><ul><li><strong>Window Mode</strong>: Fullscreen</li><li><strong>Display Resolution</strong>: Max resolution of your primary monitor (1920x1080, 2560x1440)</li><li><strong>Nvidia DLSS Frame Generation</strong>: Disabled (adds some input delay, but you can enable it if you're playing on PC with a controller or if you need a jump in FPS)</li><li><strong>Vsync</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Nvidia Reflex Low Latency</strong>: On</li><li><strong>Frame Rate Limit</strong>: Set to your monitor's highest refresh rate (60,144, 240, etc.)</li><li><strong>Upscaled Resolution</strong>: 100%</li><li><strong>Resolution Scaling Method</strong>: Nvidia DLSS / AMD FSR</li><li><strong>DLSS Quality</strong>: Balanced or Performance</li><li><strong>DLSS Model</strong>: CNN</li><li><strong>Field of View</strong>: 80</li><li><strong>Motion Blur</strong>: Disabled</li><li><strong>Nvidia RTX Global Illumination</strong>: Static</li><li><strong>View Distance</strong>: High</li><li><strong>Anti-Aliasing</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Shadows</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Post-Processing</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Texture</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Effects</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Reflections</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Foliage</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Global Illumination Resolution</strong>: Low</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594223-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.37.40.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594223" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594223-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.37.40.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594223"></a><figcaption>The PC graphics settings in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594223-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.37.40.21.png"></figure><p>In our testing, these settings still provided a clear picture on screen that wasn't blurry and kept all textures looking sharp. However, the performance bump from knocking down a few settings to either "Low" or "Medium" was substantial.</p><p>It's also important to set your Upscaling Method correctly, as that will provide you with the most significant leap in performance. You can also enable Frame Generation if you have a 40 or 50-series Nvidia graphics card, but you might feel some input delay in-game, especially if you're on a mouse and keyboard. However, when enabling Frame Generation, you'll see anywhere from 50 to 100 extra frames, making your game much smoother overall.</p><p>As it usually is with graphics settings on PC, you'll likely want to make some changes based on your performance in Arc Raiders. If you have a lower-end PC, then it's best to simply change every setting to its lowest value, set your upscaling to ultra performance, and maybe make some additional changes outside of the game. This might make your game look worse visually, but you should be able to reach a consistent 60 FPS at the very least.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, if you have a high-end PC, you can crank some settings up, such as view distance or textures, to give yourself a competitive advantage without sacrificing too much FPS. Use our settings to establish a foundation, head in-game to see your performance, and then make some changes if necessary.</p><p>If you're on keyboard and mouse in Arc Raiders, make sure to check out our other guide on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-keybinds-and-mouse-settings-in-arc-raiders/1100-6535833/" data-ref-id="1100-6535833">best keybinds and mouse settings</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-own-an-iphone-this-dji-gimbal-stabilizer-costs-pennies-and-films-like-hollywood-2000640317</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-own-an-iphone-this-dji-gimbal-stabilizer-costs-pennies-and-films-like-hollywood.1339948/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your iPhone already has optical image stabilization built in but try filming while walking and you’ll quickly notice those micro-jitters and shakes that make your videos look amateurish. The DJI Osmo Mobile 7 solves this problem with <strong>professional-grade 3-axis gimbal stabilization</strong> that counteracts every movement in real time and delivers the kind of smooth footage you see in actual films. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5181/">Originally $89, this gimbal drops to $75 on Amazon right now</a>, which marks an all-time low for early Black Friday shoppers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5181/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>It works via <strong>mechanical stabilization that’s independent of the digital system in your phone</strong>, basically three separate motors that work non-stop to adjust the position of the gimbal to compensate for hand movements, bumps and abrupt directional changes. These create <strong>footage that looks professionally shot</strong>&nbsp;even when you’re running upstairs or downstairs, or tracking a subject moving at high speeds.</p>
<p><strong>Coming in at just 300 grams</strong>, the Osmo Mobile 7 weighs less than most water bottles, has an ergonomic handle with anti-slip grip and remains comfortable even during extended shooting sessions. Meanwhile, an integrated foldable design collapses down to a compact 179x95x39mm size that easily slips into a backpack or large jacket pocket, and a built-in tripod deploys instantly for static shots or time-lapses without needing separate equipment.</p>



<h2>Intelligent Tracking That Works</h2>
<p>ActiveTrack 7.0 is the latest subject-tracking technology from DJI which uses complex algorithms to <strong>recognize and follow people, pets, or objects</strong> even through complex movements and crowded environments. This <em>Dual-Lens</em> enhanced tracking works by simultaneously leveraging both your phone’s main and secondary cameras to create a more accurate depth map so that the gimbal holds focus even on fast, close-up action shots. That means you can film yourself skateboarding, dancing or demo-ing products while the gimbal automatically pans and tilts to keep you centered in the frame without the need for a camera operator.</p>



<p>The DJI Mimo app makes this hardware a fully realized mobile production studio with features like <em>ShotGuides</em>&nbsp;which analyzes your environment and suggests specific camera movements and compositions used in professional cinematography. <em>One-Tap Edit</em> automatically assembles your footage into polished videos with transitions, music, and effects based on the content you capture, shaving hours off editing time and condensing it to minutes. The app provides <strong>manual controls for ISO, shutter speed, and white balance</strong> should you want granular creative control plus specialized modes like Slow Motion, Hyperlapse and Panorama that leverage the gimbal’s precise movement capabilities.</p>



<p>It makes for <strong>up to 10 hours of continuous operation on a single charge</strong>&nbsp;which means you can easily get a full day of content creation or event coverage without needing to stop and recharge. The <strong>USB-C port serves double duty by charging your phone while you film</strong>, and alleviates the problem of intensive video recording completely draining your device’s battery mid-shoot. The magnetic phone clamp attaches and detaches in a matter of seconds, utilizing firm magnets that hold your device secure even as you move around most aggressively but enable you to quickly switch between devices or to go handheld.</p>
<p>At $75 down from $89, this is the lowest price we’ve tracked for the Osmo Mobile 7, and these early Black Friday deals on DJI products have a history of selling out quickly once inventory starts moving.</p>

              <p>There are laptops you dream about but never actually buy because they sit in that untouchable price bracket reserved for professionals with corporate budgets. Normally retailing for $3,399, this Dell Inspiron 16″ laptop, 32 GB of DDR5 RAM, and a full terabyte of storage, is just that kind of aspirational machine.</p>
<p>But here’s where things take a very interesting turn for early Black Friday shoppers: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5179/">Amazon just dropped this powerhouse to $999, representing a staggering 71% discount</a> and marking an <strong>all-time low price</strong> for this configuration. This isn’t some refurbished model or a stripped-down version: you’re looking at a full-spec business laptop with Windows 11 Pro, and at this price point, it won’t last long before inventory disappears.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5179/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Dell built this “Inspiron 16” around an Intel Core 7 150U processor which <strong>packs in 10 cores and 12 threads that can smartly scale up to as high as 5.4 GHz</strong> based on your workload. That means this laptop changes its performance dynamically and give you serious processing power for video editing or data crunching while staying efficient for lighter tasks such as browsing or working on documents.</p>
<p>The accompanying <strong>32 GB of DDR5 RAM easily allows multiple demanding applications</strong> to run simultaneously without that frustrating lag in switching between Chrome tabs, Photoshop projects and Excel spreadsheets. That 1 TB PCIe NVMe SSD doesn’t just provide enormous storage capacity but also transfers at blazing speeds and allows your system to boot in just seconds and large files to move in near-instant timing.</p>



<h2>A Display That Improves Your Workday</h2>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ touchscreen deserves its own spotlight</strong> because Dell has made some smart choices here. The 1920×1200 resolution adopts a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of the traditional 16:9 and translates to more vertical screen real estate while navigating documents and web pages without needing to scroll so much. This display stays clearly visible even in well-lit offices or by the window with a brightness of 300 nits.</p>
<p>Dell has also integrated <em>ComfortView Plus</em> technology which reduces hazardous blue light emission without that weird yellow tint you get with cheaper filters; it makes those long sessions easier on your eyes. The <strong>touchscreen adds another layer of interaction</strong> that becomes surprisingly useful as soon as you get used to it, specifically when doing quick edits or getting through the touch-optimized interface of Windows 11.</p>



<p>The practical features extend to everyday usability, ways that make this much more than just another laptop but a real productivity machine. The full-size backlit keyboard includes a dedicated numeric keypad that anyone who works with numbers regularly will immediately appreciate. That ice blue backlighting isn’t for looks; it makes typing in dim environments or during evening work sessions significantly easier without eye strain. <strong>Windows 11 Pro brings enterprise-grade security features</strong>&nbsp;while the integrated fingerprint reader adds biometric protection that’s much safer and far more convenient than continuously punching in passwords.</p>
<p>Right now, you can essentially get flagship specifications at mid-range pricing since this is a laptop that usually sells for over three grand. Dell clearly priced it to move inventory fast ahead of Black Friday, and those kinds of early deals rarely stick around once word starts getting out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Have a participation trophy.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon Legends: Z-A is getting an update that will make rewards from Ranked Battles, specifically a desirable set of Mega Stones, much easier to obtain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://plza-news.pokemon-home.com/en/page/10.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official news post</a>, The Pokemon Company revealed that at the start of Season 2 of its online Ranked Battle mode, players will be able to receive Greninjite at Rank Y, and Delphoxite at Rank S. Previously, in Season 1, players had to achieve Rank K to receive Greninjite (Delphoxite was not yet available).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a pretty big deal, as the difficulty of obtaining these Mega Stones has been a point of criticism from the community ever since they were first announced as rewards. The trio of original Kalos starter Pokemon: Fennekin, Froakie, and Chespin, are available fairly early on in Pokemon Legends: Z-A, and all three of them have new Mega Evolutions. However, those Mega Evolutions can only be unlocked via the items obtained as rewards from online Ranked Battles, and aren't available in the story campaign at all. This was frustrating for many players, as plenty of people don't touch online play at all and would rather just play through the story only.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This update doesn't make it possible to obtain the rewards without engaging in the online component of Z-A, but it does make them much easier to obtain. With Season 2, you'll basically be able to get a Greninjite with a single Ranked Battle, even if you lose, as you can get rank points for actions taken in battle as well as actually winning. And you can move up multiple ranks in one go if you play well enough, making it pretty fast to go from Z to S for that Delphoxite. <em>And</em> it looks like Game Freak is updating how points are distributed to make it even easier to gain ranks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, if trends continue this way, it sounds like the Season 3 update will introduce Chesnaughtite at a similar rank to Rank S, and lower the rank requirement for Delphoxite to something even easier as well. Per the announcement, "Mega Stones will continue to be reissued frequently in future seasons."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, this is a pretty good change for folks wanting to collect all the Mega Stones. A couple of Ranked Battles in Season 2 and 3 will net you all three stones with very little effort, and then if you prefer you never have to play Ranked again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon Legends: Z-A's Season 2 starts on Wednesday, November 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">reviewed Pokemon Legends: Z-A and gave it an 8/10</a>, saying that it "finally feels like Game Freak hitting its stride in Pokemon’s 3D era, with a fun setting to explore, a well-written story, and a total battle system overhaul that works surprisingly well." The game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-sells-58-million-in-launch-week-half-were-bought-for-nintendo-switch-2">sold almost six million copies</a> in its opening week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2020, Blaze Entertainment made a splash in the retro gaming market with the introduction of the cartridge-based<a href="https://evercade.co.uk/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>Evercade platform</u></a>. Ever since, the platform has grown to include a variety of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evercade-exp-review"><u>handhelds</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evercade-vs-review"><u>consoles</u></a>, and<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evercade-alpha-bartop-arcade-review"> <u>bartop arcades</u></a>, along with more than 650 games across 78 – and counting – cartridges. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In late 2023, the company created the new brand<a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>HyperMegaTech</u></a> to release a series of simpler GameBoy-like handhelds with built-in games, which also happen to accept Evercade cartridges. As with the growing number of other Evercade-compatible devices and cartridges, the Super Pocket series is already up to a half-dozen variations. Although the Super Pocket series may not have the best screen size and resolution, or the most ideal controls for every game, it's still a value-packed portable companion, filling a completely different market than a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-handheld-gaming-pc"><u>handheld gaming PC</u></a>. However, depending upon your gaming preferences, certain models may prove better values than others.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">HyperMegaTech Super Pocket Editions – Photos</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">HyperMegaTech Super Pocket – Design and Features</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than aesthetic themes and associated colorways, every Super Pocket edition features exactly the same hardware. The only other differentiator between models is the types and number of built-in games, which are themed to a specific publisher like Taito, Capcom, Atari, Technos, NeoGeo (SNK), or Data East. Sometimes limited editions will feature an additional cosmetic variation, like with the Atari Edition or NeoGeo Edition, with a woodgrain look for the former and MVS styling for the latter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a plug-and-play device, each Super Pocket package comes with the handheld, USB-C to USB-A charging cable, and quick start guide. You just need to charge, then power on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When first powering on, you are prompted to answer a few questions, including your language and preferred difficulty (Easy or Normal) across all included games. Naturally, these and other settings are available to change after the fact by pressing the Game Menu button and choosing Settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 3.07 x 4.92 x 0.98 inches and 0.36lbs, the Super Pocket is slightly smaller and lighter than the original Game Boy that clocked in at 3.5 x 5.8 x 1.3 inches. The sleeker body does support a slightly larger display at 2.8 inches (2cm larger than the Game Boy’s), although that's still rather small for modern handhelds.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/16-2025-08-08-18-23-54-1761686192508.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket CapCom Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The IPS screen has a resolution of 320x240, a 4:3 aspect ratio. Overall, the display is colorful with good brightness and viewing angles, although the small screen size and low resolution do mean loss of detail in some places, particularly with text or games that don't have a native 4:3 aspect ratio. While good close-up vision always helps when it comes to handheld displays, just keep in mind that certain games on the Super Pocket will not have an optimized viewing experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Display options include Original, Pixel Perfect, or Full Screen aspect ratios, as well as Shaders/Scanlines. Original aspect ratio ensures the original game's graphics are not stretched or distorted, but may result in black bars on the sides or top of the screen. Pixel Perfect aspect ratio maps the original pixels to a "perfect" square of pixels, but may result in an even smaller active display than Original. Full Screen aspect ratio stretches a game's image to fit the entire screen, which eliminates any black bars or dead space on the display, but also stretches or distorts in-game objects. Shaders/Scanlines include None, Subtle, or Strong, the latter two of which are meant to mimic how classic CRT displays processed pixel graphics. Subtle adds thin scanlines with minimal screen darkening, while Strong adds thick scanlines with more prominent screen darkening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Below the display is the Game Menu button, direction pad, front speaker, Select/Insert Credit button, Start Game button, and the A, B, X, and Y face buttons. Both the direction pad and face buttons use standard membranes, so they have a softer feel and no real click but are still responsive enough for most games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/05-2025-07-28-16-40-17-1761686134420.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket NeoGeo Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Super Pocket comes with a blank dummy cartridge to protect the rear slot. Also on the rear of the unit is a volume control, and R1, L1, R2, and L2 buttons, the latter two of which are used to fast scroll in menus. Below the buttons is a rear speaker, which provides clear, distortion-free sound output even at maximum volume when combined with the front speaker, although you'll still want to use a good pair of wired headphones for the best possible audio. (Like other Evercade-compatible hardware, Bluetooth audio isn't supported.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the bottom of the Super Pocket is the USB-C charging port, power switch next to an indicator light that's blue when on, and 3.5mm headphone jack. Between the power switch and charging port is a charging indicator light, which shows red when charging and green when fully charged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its modest 3000mAh battery, you'll only get up to four hours or so of run time depending on play volume and game type. On the plus side, the battery does a tremendous job of holding a charge. I've gone many months without using some of my charged Super Pockets and they're still ready to play with 100% capacity when I do grab them again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">HyperMegaTech Super Pocket – Built-in Game Options</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Blaze has a history of working around certain licensing restrictions on how certain games can be sold by building them into both their Evercade and HyperMegaTech hardware. While some of these restrictions have loosened of late – meaning, you're starting to see some previously built-in only games coming to cartridge – a product like the Super Pocket is still one of the more reliable ways to guarantee access to games not yet, or may never be, on an Evercade cartridge. You can read the full lineup that comes preloaded on each edition <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ctMo55yqSEHAIQYLdvQsK8iUXBtR5ck6ph6kzBxj_ak/edit?gid=0#gid=0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>in this sheet</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/17-2025-08-03-22-30-50-1761686200301.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket Data East Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Super Pocket features the original games from their original platforms, so they're not scaled to or optimized for the display. This is not an issue for many of the games, but for some – especially arcade games with a vertical/portrait (aka TATE) display – the active area can be quite small unless you choose to purposely distort the image with the Full Screen aspect ratio option. Examples of portrait display arcade games include Kiki Kaikai on the Taito Edition Super Pocket and BurgerTime on the Data East Edition Super Pocket, the latter of which highlights how difficult it can also sometimes be to make out text. In general, though, there are always enough games, even on the 12-game Capcom Edition, that work just fine within the display's constraints. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/13-2025-08-03-21-20-06-1761686183151.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket Taito Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You also have to consider that the direction pad and four face buttons are not the best way to control every game. For example, Operation Wolf included on the Taito Edition is a light gun game in the arcade, so using the direction pad to drag the targeting cursor across the screen is less than ideal. Similarly, a game like Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting on the Capcom Edition is controlled with six buttons. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, but the rear buttons on the Super Pocket are not ideally positioned to both hold the handheld and easily and consistently press those buttons, particularly in the heat of battle. Games that need four or fewer buttons, which is admittedly most of what's included, are not a problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the plus side, when you're in any game, you can press the Game Menu button to Save or Load your place in one of six slots, as well as reference the controls. You can also change the Display settings, reset the game, or quit back to the main menu.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/15-2025-08-03-21-23-56-1761686187712.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket Atari Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the six current editions, the Atari Edition features the most games at 50, and also the most games from (five!) different platforms. While some of the arcade games like Super Breakout or Crystal Castles<em> </em>have portrait displays or native controls that don't map well to a digital direction pad, for the most part, the other games work quite well on the Super Pocket thanks to the modest controls and resolutions of the original consoles and handheld. Of course, older arcade and 8-bit console games may have less appeal to some people than what's featured on something like the Capcom Edition Super Pocket, even with just 12 games. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/11-2025-08-03-21-18-39-1761686166675.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket Technos Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want a slightly newer mix of arcade and console games, the Technos Edition might be more for you, though it only features 15 games with a good amount of overlap. For a little better variety, the 18-game Data East Edition might be more desirable, although that also features a few games not particularly optimized for the display. Finally, there's the NeoGeo Edition with 14 games, but each are well-optimized for both the controls and display as the Super Pocket's setup closely matches what the MVS arcade machine offered, making it arguably the best choice if you can choose only one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">HyperMegaTech Super Pocket – Cartridge Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The HyperMegaTech Super Pocket's ace in the hole is its cartridge slot, which provides access to hundreds of<a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>additional games from nearly every genre</u></a> across dozens of cartridges. There's some overlap, like with<a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/taito-arcade-1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>Taito Arcade 1</u></a>, but in general, these games are only found outside of what's built into any of Blaze's hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every cartridge is compatible, but not every game included on them is optimized for the Super Pocket’s display or controls. They are, however, tuned or tunable for the mainline Evercade hardware; the<a href="https://evercade.co.uk/exp-r/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>Evercade EXP-R</u></a> handheld, for example, has an 800x400 resolution 4.3-inch IPS screen, and can also enter TATE mode to better display portrait-oriented arcade titles. The two pairs of shoulder buttons are also far easier to reach and press in the heat of action.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/18-2025-08-03-22-32-51-1761686202891.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Super Pocket NeoGeo Edition</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other functionality missing from the Super Pocket that the mainline Evercade hardware gets is online connectivity. That means that the Super Pockets don't get access to firmware updates or free games of the month, nor can they apply any updates to cartridges. On the rare chance a cartridge needs an update to run properly, it needs to be done on a mainline Evercade console, handheld, or bartop before it can be used in a Super Pocket.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, if you want the full Evercade experience, you're better off with the EXP-R handheld, the<a href="https://evercade.co.uk/vs-r/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>VS-R console</u></a>, or the Alpha bartop. Fortunately, this is not a zero-sum game as the Evercade platform is designed to expand as your wants and needs evolve. To put it another way, investing in one or more cartridges (and one or more pieces of hardware) allows you to play a particular game or games however you want. The Super Pocket, in mimicking the general Game Boy design, certainly has its appeal, as does its ability to simultaneously host both its internal games and a cartridge that can nearly double its available content on the go.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hypermegatech-super-pocket-editions-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-clears-out-forerunner-255-now-selling-for-peanuts-in-early-black-friday-sale-2000640217</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running requires commitment and you need a watch that keeps up with your training goals without draining your wallet or dying mid-marathon, and the <strong>Garmin Forerunner 255 delivers</strong> exactly that combo of reliability and performance. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5133/">dropped the price to just $279, down from the usual $349,</a> which makes this one of those rare moments where a premium running watch becomes accessible. The Forerunner 255 brings serious training tools that adapt to your performance, recover alongside you, and guide you through race preparation with the kind of intelligence previously reserved for much pricier models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5133/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The battery life alone distinguishes this watch from the sea of devices that require charging every other day: You <strong>get 14 days of smartwatch use in between charges</strong>, which means you can spend more time training and less time looking for cables. That goes up to <strong>30 hours of continuous GPS tracking</strong> in GPS mode so ultra-runners and adventurers can take on the longest events without battery anxiety setting in.</p>
<h2>Your Body Knows When It Needs Rest</h2>
<p>Recovery drives performance just as much as hard training does, and the Forerunner 255 tracks that balance through HRV Status monitoring. Heart rate variability measurements happen automatically during sleep, analyzing how your body responds to training stress and daily life. The morning report consolidates everything into one snapshot when you wake up – your sleep quality, recovery status, and a personalized workout suggestion based on where you stand.</p>



<p>The fourth-generation Elevate optical heart rate sensor is more accurate than its predecessors, and reads directly from your wrist with fewer random spikes or dropouts. Multi-band GPS technology uses signals from multiple satellite frequencies to calculate your position with much better precision, particularly in demanding environments such as dense city blocks or forested trails. Tests showed this dual-frequency approach corrects signal bounce issues that plague standard GPS watches, keeping route maps accurate even when buildings or trees surround you. At <strong>49 grams for the 46mm version</strong> (39 grams for the smaller 41mm model), it’s light enough during a run that you tend to forget you’re even wearing it but with enough heft to feel durable.</p>
<p>Training plans change according to your real performance and do not follow a rigid schedule without considering how you feel: The Forerunner 255 offers personalized <strong>daily workout suggestions that adjust after each run</strong> based on your completion times, effort levels and recovery needs. Race predictions estimate your finish time for 5K, 10K, half-marathon and marathon distances by looking at your current fitness level, typical training paces and even weather conditions on race day.</p>



<p>The multisport profiles transform this from a running-only device to a triathlon companion. <strong>Swimming metrics include stroke detection and SWOLF scores for pool sessions</strong> while open water swimming tracks your path across lakes or ocean. Cycling profiles record power data when paired with compatible meters, and the watch automatically detects when you transition between sports during brick workouts or races. Water resistance extends to 5 ATM (50 meters) so showers, pool sessions, and rainy runs pose no threat to the electronics.</p>
<p>This is our favorite early Black Friday deal on a smartwatch, it might run out of stock very soon.</p>

Here's the top ten Pokémon card you can pull right now from mega Evolution, Destined Rivals and Journey Together, their values and where to buy them:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9112vA?object_uuid=d5115783-12d1-4f3f-b655-6a677ee5b1bd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132 (Mega Evolution)</strong></a>

                <p>If you've decided to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> on PC, then you'll have access to a couple of menus in the settings that console players won't have. From the first time you launch the game, you can find and alter the keybinds and mouse settings menus, which, of course, both have a massive impact on your gameplay.</p><p>While you could leave the default options as they are and not customize any of the settings, that might put you at a disadvantage against other PC players with dialed-in settings. To ensure you're using the best keybinds and mouse settings in Arc Raiders, take a look at the guide below, which is just one of several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a> we recommend.</p><h2>Best keybinds in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Let's start with the keybinds, as this is one of the first menus you'll see after heading into the settings (it's labeled "Controls"). Unlike some other extraction games or multiplayer shooters, Arc Raiders keeps things fairly straightforward when it comes to your keybinds. There are only a few crucial keybinds that you'll want to change, but these can play a huge role in whether you live or die during a gunfight with an enemy.</p><p>Below, you can see all of the keybinds and our recommended settings for each one in Arc Raiders:</p><ul><li><strong>Move Forward</strong>: W</li><li><strong>Move Backward</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Move Left</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Move Right</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Fire / Throw / Display</strong>: Left Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Aim</strong>: Right Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Jump</strong>: Space Bar</li><li><strong>Sprint (Hold)</strong>: Left Shift</li><li><strong>Crouch (Hold)</strong>: Left Ctrl or C</li><li><strong>Crouch (Toggle)</strong>: Left Ctrl or C</li><li><strong>Dodge Roll</strong>: Mouse Button 4/5 or Left Alt if you have no mouse buttons</li><li><strong>Walk (Toggle)</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Interact</strong>: E or F (depending on preference)</li><li><strong>Reload Weapon</strong>: R</li><li><strong>Shoulder Swap</strong>: X</li><li><strong>Weapon 1</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Weapon 2</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>Melee Weapon</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>Unarmed/Holster Weapon</strong>: 4</li><li><strong>Next Weapon</strong>: Mouse Wheel Up</li><li><strong>Previous Weapon</strong>: Mouse Wheel Down</li><li><strong>Items</strong>: Q</li><li><strong>Flashlight</strong>: E or F (depending on your Interact keybind)</li><li><strong>Access Inventory</strong>: Tab</li><li><strong>Map</strong>: M or Caps Lock</li><li><strong>Ping</strong>: Middle Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Emote</strong>: G</li><li><strong>Push to Talk</strong>: T</li><li><strong>Push to Talk (Proximity Chat)</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Ping Heard By/Emote Loudness</strong>: H</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594104" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594104"></a><figcaption>The keybinds menu in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png"></figure><p>We didn't alter too many of the default keybinds in Arc Raiders, but we did offer you some choices with a few of those we did change. For example, the dodge roll mechanic works great if you have a mouse button on the side of your mouse, but Left Alt also works perfectly well. We also swapped the "unarmed" keybind to "4," as that's easier to remember given that you can bring out your other weapons with the previous three number keybinds.</p><h2>Best mouse settings in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Now, let's cover your mouse settings in Arc Raiders, which boil down to your sensitivity options. If you want to customize your mouse and sensitivity further, you should head into whatever mouse software you have installed on your PC. This allows you to fine-tune your DPI, disable mouse smoothing/acceleration, and set up hotkeys if you wish.</p><p>Below, you can see our recommended mouse settings in Arc Raiders:</p><ul><li><strong>Invert Vertical Look Input</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Horizontal Sensitivity</strong>: 65-70</li><li><strong>Vertical Sensitivity</strong>: 50</li><li><strong>Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier</strong>: 75%</li><li><strong>Scoped Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier</strong>: 85%</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594103" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594103"></a><figcaption>The mouse settings in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png"></figure><p>We decided to scale the horizontal sensitivity up by 15-20 from the default value. Having a higher horizontal sensitivity allows you to spin around faster if you're being shot by an enemy behind you, or maybe to catch the spider hurdling at you before your quick and sudden death.</p><p>Moving on, the Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier has been reduced by 25% to allow for more precise aiming, while the Scoped Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier has also been reduced, but not as drastically. You still want to be able to move relatively quickly while using a large scope, but you also don't want your sensitivity too fast so that you skip right over a target when aiming down sights.</p><p>Of course, these sensitivity values will likely need to be changed depending on your mouse's core DPI. You'll want to make sure you dial that in before trying to mess around with the mouse settings in Arc Raiders. If you already have your mouse DPI in a good spot, then try to use our sensitivity values as a baseline and work your way up or down from there.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> is in its self-care era. At least, that was the major takeaway from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2s-latest-update-had-too-many-issues-developer-admits/1100-6535407/">frank Q&amp;A</a> with the game's director Mikael Eriksson, where he discusses, among other things, a new schedule for patches that the team hopes will lighten Helldivers 2's technical debt.</p><p dir="ltr">The critically acclaimed live-service shooter, which tasks players with grouping up and tackling hordes of alien foes in overwhelmingly hostile environments, has fallen on especially hard times lately. Frequent updates to the game since its launch in February of 2024--including fixes, balancing patches, and content drops--has caused Helldivers 2 to suffer from balance and performance issues and settle into an unsteady ebb and flow.</p><p dir="ltr">This instability has only hurt the game's diehard playerbase, who have spent months now fighting against crashes, increasingly untenable performance issues, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-explains-why-the-game-takes-up-so-much-space-on-pc/1100-6535217/">growing file sizes</a> (at least, on PC) and more wonkiness than is generally acceptable of Helldivers 2's sometimes slapstick action.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, Arrowhead Studios, the developer working on Helldivers 2, recently announced that it would be pumping the brakes on content updates and the game's planned roadmap for a while. The goal of the temporary hiatus is to give the team the ability to diagnose and work on Helldivers 2's multiple issues, which stem from the game's hazardous live environment, its developers nonstop cadence of content drops, and years of technical debt adding up.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAzmBlEFhYw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dAzmBlEFhYw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">To that end, Eriksson revealed that Arrowhead's plan moving forward is to deploy patches every two weeks for the next few months in order to reduce the number of critical bugs impeding players' ability to enjoy Helldivers 2. In the latest Q&amp;A, Eriksson cited the game's most recent patch as an example of what it intends, claiming that it fixed about 200 of Helldivers 2's bugs. Arrowhead hopes to keep hitting these patches before resuming with Helldivers 2's content roadmap around December.</p><p dir="ltr">Elsewhere, Eriksson was also probed about the game's tremendous file size on PC, where it sits above 140 GB. He claims that the team is aware of how "unacceptably large" this is and that the issue stems from the team optimizing for hardware that uses mechanical HDDs, mentioning that they introduce hurdles that the team overcomes by duplicating files.</p><p dir="ltr">Per Eriksson's comments, Arrowhead is working on ways to cut down the file size, including potentially finding ways to push updates to PCs that use one of these drives over the other, but it is currently still looking for the best possible answer to this problem.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the interview dives into more of Helldivers 2's issues including the potential causes of crashes, whether the game's anit-cheat could be responsible for bricking PCs, and justification for the studio's usage of the Stingray engine. It's a meaty and honest interview, even if Eriksson does sidestep some of the game's more pressing problems, like weapon balance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>People online seem tired of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919">crossover skins and silly cosmetics</a> in games like <em>Call of Duty </em>and <em>Battlefield.</em> And now one of the lead devs behind online shooter <em>Arc Raiders</em> has promised that you won’t see Santa Claus or dinosaur outfits in the newly released live-service game.</p> <p>The latest big hit on Steam is multiplayer extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>. It launched on October 30 on consoles and PC and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-steam-ai-server-connection-error-launch-2000640110">quickly racked up over 200k concurrent players on Steam</a>. And being an online game in 2025 means offering up cosmetics for players to earn or purchase. <em>Arc Raiders</em> is no exception, selling players skins if they so desire. But this year has also marked a turning point online in regard to in-game cosmetics. Players seem less willing to put up with silly crossover skins and goofy cosmetics. This has led to a whole ongoing skin saga involving <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-goofy-skins-call-of-duty-nicki-minaj-2000614447">which has promised not to include those kinds of items</a>, and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-skins-black-ops-7-blops-6-carry-over-battlefield-6-2000620379">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>,</em> which arguably <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">started the backlash</a> we are seeing and has backpedaled on allowing silly skins from <em>BLOPS6</em> to move forward into the upcoming FPS. And now the design director for <em>Arc Raiders</em> has weighed in on the topic and claimed the team is “protective” of the shooter’s visual identity.</p>

 <p>“What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have,” <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/skins-cosmetics-interview"><em>Arc Raiders</em> design director Virgil Watkins told <em>PCgamesN</em></a> when asked about silly skins. “[Cosmetics] will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction.” And while the devs and artists at Embark want to provide players with “as much freedom as possible” to express themselves, there are limits.</p>

 <p>“I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting [that] we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit,” explained Watkins.</p> <p>“But we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes Santa Claus. That’s not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that’s kind of the line you can draw. We’re pretty protective of making sure that anything that goes into the game fits within the visual identity, fits within the tone, fits within the setting. I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don’t know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly – I don’t think the novelty is worth the trade.”</p>

  <p>Watkins’ answer highlights the problem of trying to walk the line between not disrupting your game’s visual identity while also still offering skins people are willing to buy. This is a problem <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-season-one-small-map-battle-royale-reactions-negative-review-ea-2000639948"><em>Battlefield 6</em> is facing right now as it enters its first season.</a> While many of the skins added to the game in the recent update look pretty realistic to me, many other players online are furious about all the colors. One skin even had its neon green toned down after players complained enough. While that might be seen as a victory for some, it leads to a strange situation where other players might not want to buy the game’s battle pass or spend money on new skins because they’re too boring or plain.</p> <p>Threading that needle is proving tricky for EA, will likely be challenging for <em>Black Ops 7</em>, and I suspect it will be a problem for<em> Arc Raiders,</em> too. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-skin-is-causing-community-meltdown-grounded-ea-2000638294">All it takes is one skin to be a bit too silly</a> or colorful, and suddenly, the community might turn on you and use your own words against you. Good luck to all devs working on live-service games in 2025. It sounds like a nightmare.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> can be played solo, but its unforgiving post-apocalyptic landscapes can be even more challenging when you're by yourself. Not only can the game's dangerous enemies put an end to you quickly, but groups of other raiders can be roaming the wasteland, ready to take you down and steal all of your loot. Having a good team can help ensure that you extract safely. But what if your friends don't play on the same hardware as you? Let's take a look at whether ARC Raiders offers cross-play and cross-progression.</p><h2>Does Arc Raiders have cross-play?</h2><p>If you're looking to play with friends on other platforms, you're in luck. <strong>Arc Raiders offers cross-play with every platform</strong>, allowing you to team up with your pals even when they're in a different ecosystem. To play together, simply add your friend's Embark ID in the Friends menu by selecting Add Friend. This ID will include four unique numbers at the end, so be sure to include those, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593137"></a><figcaption>You can brave the conditions together using Arc Raiders cross-play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg"></figure><p>Cross-play is enabled by default, meaning you won't need to turn on any additional settings when you're ready to team up. To disable crossplay, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Cross-play</strong> and toggle it off. This will ensure you only play with players that are within your ecosystem. As such, you'll need to turn this back on again if you decide to play with friends on another platform.</p><p>Once you're ready to go on with your pals by your side, don't forget to take our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a>, too.</p><h2>Does Arc Raiders have cross-progression?</h2><p>There's more good news for those setting out into a post-apocalyptic Earth: <strong>ARC Raiders has full cross-progression support</strong>. This means that you can carry your progress across every platform. If you start on PS5, for instance, you'll be able to use the same save on PC or Xbox so long as you're signed into the same <a href="https://careers.embark-studios.com/connect/login" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embark account</a>.</p><p>However, it's important to note that playing across different platforms will require you to purchase the game multiple times. If you've bought the game on PS5 and want to play on PC or Xbox, be prepared to dish out an additional $40 to transfer that save over. Luckily, you can swap between these platforms at any time with no issues, so you'll never have to worry about losing your progress.</p>
