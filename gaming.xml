                <p>Splitgate developer 1047 Games has reacted to the online commentary regarding the recent re-launch of the shooter Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. The game arrived in mid-December 2025 and hasn't gotten close to the Steam numbers that Splitgate 2 or Splitgate 1 reached, prompting online commenters to wonder if the game will be able to stay online.</p><p>The developer <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a statement</a>, "Steam charts don't measure fun," adding that Steam player numbers only show "one number, on one platform, at one given moment." Steam numbers do no show the "full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming."</p><p>1047 Games re-launched Splitgate 2 under the name Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on December 17, and Steam numbers <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#3m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spiked to about 2,300 concurrents at launch.</a> In the past 24 hours, the game reached a peak of 952 players on Steam.</p><p>For comparison, Splitgate 2 had its most-ever players (25,785 concurrents) in early June <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-battle-royale-mode-out-now-alongside-splitgate-2-official-release/1100-6532195/" data-ref-id="1100-6532195">when the game's battle royale mode arrived.</a> The original Splitgate, meanwhile, achieved a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/677620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">record of 67,724 peak concurrent players</a> back in August 2021.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_kqmh6hXiM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_kqmh6hXiM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>1047 Games is encouraging people to give Spligate: Arena Reloaded a shot. "The gameplay's the best it's ever been, and we'd love for you to jump in and form your own opinion," the studio said.</p><p>The game will get a big new mode in the future in the form of Arena Royale, which is a battle royale mode.</p><p>Steam's player data is public, but the same cannot be said for PlayStation and Xbox, so we do not know how Arena Reloaded is performing on consoles. The game was always likely to face an uphill battle for marketshare, as data shows people may try new games but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025s-top-5-most-played-games-on-playstation-and-xbox-are-the-same-as-2024s/1100-6537207/" data-ref-id="1100-6537207">end up sticking with their established favorites. </a></p><p>It's been a bumpy road for Splitgate in the past year. One of the bosses at 1047 Games wore a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Make FPS Great Again" hat</a> at Summer Game Fest in 2025, which led to some controversy. Additionally, there were complaints about microtransaction prices. The studio would later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-dev-lays-off-staff-co-founders-forgoing-salaries/1100-6532622/" data-ref-id="1100-6532622">lay off staff, while its founders stopped drawing a salary</a>. Splitgate 2 took the unusual move of reverting back to beta in July 2025 before the re-launch in December.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Baldur's Gate 3 Cast Answers Our Burning Questions</p>
      </div>
<p>Stranger Things co-creator Matt Duffer mentioned to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that he was playing the Larian Studios-developed title while working on the final season. Duffer implied that the climactic showdown with Vecna and the Mind Flayer shared themes and elements with both D&amp;D and Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p>According to Duffer, the show's entire cast of characters found "self-acceptance" through the story and ended up "absolutely primed" going into the final battle.</p><p>"They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right?" Duffer said. "And that’s where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and something like Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable."</p><p>One of the biggest strengths of Baldur's Gate 3 was its memorable party members, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-fan-discovers-astarion-has-almost-as-much-spoken-dialogue-as-the-narrator/1100-6536824/" data-ref-id="1100-6536824" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-fan-discovers-astarion-has-almost-as-much-spoken-dialogue-as-the-narrator/1100-6536824/">such as Astarion</a> and Shadowheart, all of whom go through their own compelling story arcs. Similarly, the characters of Stranger Things overcame obstacles and developed significantly through the show's five seasons.</p><p>The fateful battle against the show's two main villains is set in an environment referred to as The Abyss, a desert wasteland in an alternate dimension. The "party" of characters travels there through the Upside Down to confront Vecna and the Mind Flayer, taking the latter down through a coordinated attack involving firearms, Molotov cocktails, a flare gun, and other means of brute force.</p><p>Of course, Stranger Things and Baldur's Gate 3 have some more explicit overlaps. As some of the characters in the show are avid D&amp;D players, they often name the creatures and villains they encounter after D&amp;D characters, such as Demogorgons, and of course, Vecna and the Mind Flayer. Baldur's Gate 3 heavily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-explains-mind-flayer-hidden-skill-tree-in-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6516428/" data-ref-id="1100-6516428" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-explains-mind-flayer-hidden-skill-tree-in-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6516428/">features mind flayers in its story</a>.</p><p>Interestingly, Duffer mentioned that "lots of video game references were applied to that final battle," though he doesn't elaborate on these references. One explicit reference early in the season was a somewhat inaccurate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranger-things-made-a-mistake-with-an-old-school-game-or-did-it/1100-6536658/" data-ref-id="1100-6536658" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranger-things-made-a-mistake-with-an-old-school-game-or-did-it/1100-6536658/">scene featuring Ghost 'n Goblins</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Having forgotten all about it (it was first announced years ago!), some news coming out of CES this week reminded me that Sony and Honda have teamed up on a new electric vehicle that, for the purposes of this blog, has some PlayStation stuff in it. And the news very quickly reminded me of why I'd forgotten all about the car in the first place.</p><p>The electric vehicle market is a cut-throat space; the emergence of a bunch of Chinese brands in recent years, the difficulties many established manufacturers have had switching their cars from combustion engines to electric motors and a hostile political climate have all worked together to create the most tumultuous auto market in decades.</p><p>In 2026 you can't just put out an electric car and expect people to buy it; you need to give them very good reasons to consider your offering ahead of the multitude of fantastic options already out there, particularly from Chinese and European labels. Which is why Sony and Honda's big CES <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9jRMrRoCmM&amp;themeRefresh=1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>press conference</u></a>, showing off the production model of their Afeela joint venture (now called the Afeela 1), was so disappointing.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykl_GmJDB1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="AFEELA | CES2026 Sony Honda Mobility Press Conference"></iframe></figure><p>Actually, disappointing might be the wrong word, because that would imply I had any kind of expectations for this vehicle in the first place. But it looked blergh when I first saw it in <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2023-01-04/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>2023</u></a>, and it still looks blergh now in 2026, only now it has a ton of better and cheaper cars to compete with.</p><p>What makes it blergh? Let's start with the styling! Which is subjective, I know, but I don't think it's a huge stretch to say the Afeela looks bland, or to point out it looks like<a href="https://lucidmotors.com/air?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Lucid made a cheap, taxi version of the Air</u></a>. Because EVs don't have huge engines at the front, and because they're supposed to be from the future, many companies have got <em>wild</em> with their styling (look at Kia and Hyundai), whereas the Afeela just looks like a...car.</p><p>Moving on to more objective faults, let's look at the Afeela's numbers. Now I know, numbers with a car aren't <em>everything</em>, but with an EV they kinda <em>are</em>, because an electric vehicle's range and charge speed are much more important figures for your daily experience than, say, a combustion engine's economy. To check out the specs for the Afeela 1, you can visit the car's <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>website</u></a>, select to build your own order and be met with, uh:</p><blockquote>Sensors: 40 UNITS</blockquote><blockquote>Computing Power: 800 TOPS</blockquote><blockquote>Tesla Supercharging Network​: 25,000+</blockquote><blockquote>AFEELA Intelligent Drive (Level 2+ ADAS)</blockquote><blockquote>AFEELA Personal Agent</blockquote><blockquote>Media Bar (External Information Display)</blockquote><blockquote>Immersive 3D Map</blockquote><blockquote>Immersive Entertainment Selection</blockquote><blockquote>Customizable Theme</blockquote><blockquote>Spatial Sound System</blockquote><blockquote>5G Connectivity</blockquote><p>That's nearly all stuff that every EV (actually, nearly every car) on the market just <em>has</em>, and is so basic and taken-for-granted that nobody even bothers looking up the specifics. Teslas have had self-driving for years, most EVs let you change their "theme" to some extent and almost every modern car rolling off a factory floor has some kind of voice assistant. A car's specs page should be where the important stuff goes, and with an EV that's its range, its battery size, its speed, its <em>charging </em>speed (as in, how long it would take you to charge from 10-80% on the road), its trunk size and maybe some other stuff like whether it has any V2L or V2G capability (meaning your car's battery can power appliances with the former and your whole house with the latter).</p><p>With the Afeela 1 you've gotta go digging to find most of that, which is never a good sign. And yup, you've gotta dig for a reason: most of the Afeela's specs are very, very bad by 2026 standards when you consider that this car is going to cost over <em>$90,000</em>. Some examples: it'll do "up to" 300 miles on a charge, which means it will actually do less in the real world, in a market where Teslas and Polestars are now routinely doing over 400 miles (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOjPP4LZvWE&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>or over <em>500 </em>in a Polestar 3 if you drive as carefully as possible</u></a>). Its maximum charge rate at a public fast-charger is 150kw; the Kia EV6 could do almost double that back in 2021. And its acceleration speed--again, not a huge deal, but something buyers do absolutely consider--hasn't even been announced yet, implying that either the pre-production model on stage at CES was <em>very </em>pre-production, or that it's going to be <em>slow</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>The two rear screens in the Afeela 1 are the most logical place to be using the PlayStation connectivity (L), while the car's yoke steering wheel (R) won't be to many people's liking</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>So does it have <em>anything</em> going for it? I dunno, it depends on how much you like the idea of <a href="https://wapo.st/4ssr7Ff?ref=aftermath.site"><u>playing PlayStation games in your car</u></a>, something the Afeela 1 will do via a Remote Play app for the car's infotainment system and rear screens. It also depends on how much you like the idea of a yoke steering wheel. Oh, and if you live in California or not, because that's the <em>only </em>state in the US from which you can order one of these cars at the moment.</p><p>But man, I look at this car and I see almost nothing that sets it out from the pack. The Afeela afeelas boring, in the same way so many other electric vehicles from established manufacturers--<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/709240/japan-evs-critical-materials/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Japanese ones especially</u></a>--do, where companies lacking either the commitment or the experience to really lean into the segment end up making cars that provide no reason to hate them, but none to love or buy them either.</p><p>I just don't see who this car is for. For under $90k in the US you can get a <em>premium</em> EV like a Porsche Macan, Audi S6 Sportback e-tron, Polestar 4, Lucid Air or BMW i4 (or i5), all of which crush the Afeela in terms of specs and inclusions (not to mention prestige). Even if it were $30k cheaper it would <em>still</em> struggle against cars like the Tesla Model Y and Kia EV5.</p><p>It's such a dated, forgettable vehicle that about the only time I ever see anyone talking about the Afeela is when, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonys-upcoming-afeela-1-car-will-let-you-drive-with-astro-bot-or-god-of-war/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">like this week</a>, the PlayStation stuff is mentioned. To which my counter would be: if you're looking to throw $90k at an electric car, you can get a much better one than this for that money, and have enough left over to toss a Steam Deck or PlayStation Portal in the back seat while you're at it.</p>

            <guid>1398811</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a>'s reputation precedes it. The notoriously-difficult precision platformer is designed to be extremely challenging, and death on every single screen is basically inevitable. Amazingly, it's taken over 15 years for anyone to fully complete the game — that's get 106% completion — without dying, but it <em>finally</em> happened at the end of last year (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-taken-15-years-but-someones-finally-completed-super-meat-boy-without-dying-once">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Back in December, Nintendo speedrunner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7bnhmqT3s">shredberg</a> became the first person ever to fully complete Super Meat Boy deathless. Yes, seriously, no one has been able to do this since the game was first released on the Xbox 360 in 2010. The platformer came to Switch in 2018.</p>
<p>"I've been doing this way too long" shredberg says laughing after his record-breaking win. "I'm not saying that I wasn't nervous, because I was very nervous at the end there, but I was way more nervous just in Dark Cotton... Once I got past Dark Hell 2, I was relatively fine."</p>
<p>"I'm gonna be emailing everyone — Kotaku, IGN, CNN, Chef's Illustrated. They're all going to hear about it."</p>
<p>You can watch the full two hour stream up-top, but if you've even played a few minutes of Super Meat Boy, you know how tough this game can be. shredberg, somehow, makes this look effortless.</p>
<p>Even one of the game's co-creators, Edmund McMillen, congratulated shredberg on social media with a simple "Congrats!"</p>

<p>Sharing his achievement on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Supermeatboy/comments/1pnjrqr/i_got_106_without_dying/">Supermeatboy subreddit</a>, shredberg thinks it took him "like 700-800 hours of grinding" to reach this goal, which is staggering.</p>
<p>He's been streaming much of his progress over on Twitch over the years, in-between other speedruns for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's next? Some followers on the archived stream have made some suggestions for shredberg, such as playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> or other games. Whatever it is, we hope shredberg has fun. Congrats on the record!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/</link>
            <guid>1398808</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Steam's Winter Sale is now over, and according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-steam-games-that-sold-the-most">the latest report from Alinea Analytics,</a> PC players are going to be spending their time playing ARC Raiders while they wait for the next store-wide sale for the platform this Spring.</p>



<p>December 2025 was the best December for Steam yet, with the platform generating<strong> over $1.6 billion</strong> last month. It was a <strong>22.7% increase</strong> compared to December 2024, and it handily beat December 2020's COVID-era numbers when Steam brought in a gross revenue of $1.4 billion.</p>



<p>As for what drove that record-breaking gross revenue? ARC Raiders, the third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios that continues to be the 'game of the hour' after its massive launch in October 2025, was a big part of that success. Since it hit the market, it has barely slowed down, just recently having reached over <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-estimated-to-have-sold-12-million-copies/">12 million copies sold</a></strong> overall. On Steam alone, Alinea estimates it has sold over <strong>7 million copies</strong>.</p>



<p>Over the holidays, ARC Raiders was the second-best-selling game on Steam by revenue. It sold over 250K copies on Boxing Day, and its concurrent player counts show no sign of the game leaving the top-played games on Steam anytime soon. At the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">it has yet to fall below 250K concurrent players on Steam since it launched</a>. </p>



<p>As for which game took the number one spot in terms of revenue, that went to Counter-Strike, which is what you'd expect from the game that constantly remains the most played game on the platform.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Steam-Top-Games-by-Copies-Sold-December-2025.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Alinea Analytics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The charts for Steam's December 2025 get more interesting when you look at copies sold, as they directly point out the value of a good deal. Detroit: Become Human was 90% off during the Winter Sale, making it less than the price of a latte at Starbucks. At that price, approximately <strong>993K</strong> players who hadn't bought it before took their chance, and it was the second-best-selling game, behind ARC Raiders, for December 2025.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the chart include Battlefield 6, which was 30% off during the Winter Sale, and Slay the Spire, which was also at an all-time low at 90% off during the Winter Sale. Good timing for developer Mega Crit, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">getting prepared to launch Slay the Spire II later this year, in March 2026</a>. </p>



<p>When ARC Raiders arrived in October 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto gave it a 9/10 in his review,</a> writing, "<em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em>"</p>

The release of Lorwyn Eclipsed will contain new cards for fans to enjoy, new prebuilt decks, and some sly marketing courtesy of the Jim Henson Workshop.</p><h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> Announcements</h2><p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-lorwyn-eclipsed" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast showcased the card and products included in the <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> set. Like most major set releases, it will contain Play Boosters, Collector Boosters, Draft boxes, and Prerelease boxes. The set will also include several prebuilt decks. These include two 60-card theme decks designed for Standard format, and two 100-card Commander decks.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The post showcases the artwork on the new cards. As the name suggests, this new set returns to the land of Lorwyn, a place separated by day and night by the twilight god Isilu. As such, shock land cards like Blood Crypts and Steam Vents will be reversible with Day and Night versions. In addition, certain Legendary Creatures and Planeswalker cards transform, such as Oko and Eridu. further representing the dichotomy.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This comparison to fairytale worlds is made more overt by some coy marketing on Wizard's part. In addition to a debut trailer, the studio released a three-minute promo video, titled <em>The Ballad of Squen and Cragg</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCQ5EF69rSQ" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on YouTube</a>. The video is a musical number centered on two characters, Squen from the sunny Lorwyn, and Cragg from the dark Shadowmoor, all brought to life through Jim Henson Muppets.</p><p>Additional posts confirm that Lorwyn Eclipsed will include borderless and art variants of certain cards. The big draw is a serialized, double rainbow foil, borderless version of Bitterbloom Bearer, brought to life by artist Rebecca Guay. Only 500 copies will be printed, so happy hunting.&nbsp;</p><picture>

Among these returning cards is one with a nasty history in Legacy format: <em>Painter's Servant</em>.</p><p>Prerelease events for Lorwyn Eclipsed will begin January 16-22. The set will then debut in <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em> on January 20. The set officially releases on January 23.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From cackling goblins to crackling spells, the world of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and other trading card games has no shortage of iconic imagery and artwork shot throughout its history. For the off-the-wall art collective known as Puke (yes, Puke... for real!), the magical worlds of TCG's have served as their inspiration, as they bring their wild creations to life via playmats, stickers, and other TCG accessories. I got the chance to sit down with the Puke gang to talk gross out humor, design aesthetic, and the importance of hand-made art in the world of <em>MTG</em>.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/puke-a-duel.jpeg?itok=HbET0Gbo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1374" height="800">

  </picture><p>To start, I wanted to know... just what in the world is Puke? "Puke is two dudes," says Stefhan Alvarado, one half of the two dudes. "I’m Stefhan and, like my partner in crime Josh, I'm an Illustrator. Puke is everything the both of us creatively agree on rolled up into one neat little brand." To which Josh Lees, the other half of Puke, adds, "Yeah to piggyback on this nerd's back, we're trying to bring something new and fresh to the community that isn’t defined by boundaries, and speaks to every purveyor of the wacky, weird, and outsider swag."</p><p>They're bringing the new and fresh something via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vomitspit/puke-presents-a-barf-bonanza?ref=user_menu" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a Kickstarter called Puke! Presents: A Barf Bonanza</a>. "Aside from just making cool merchandise and getting it out to the public," says Alvarado, "the Kickstarter’s main goal is to kick off Puke as a brand. Get the word out on the streets." With vibrant, colorful illustrations, the group seems to me to be kicking down the doors of what's established and expected in the tabletop art world, letting their unhinged creative juices flow.</p><blockquote><p>You can both have the same idea but how the artist chooses to channel their talent always leads to a different ending.</p></blockquote><p>Friends and collaborators since their art school days, both Alvarado and Lees have extremely distinct and unique visual styles. I wanted to know how they go about infusing those styles into one cohesive brand. "Our styles are very interesting to me," Alvarado explains.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have almost the same exact influences when it comes to our art but somehow what we each produce almost feels like polar opposites. Art is funny in that way. You can both have the same idea but how the artist chooses to channel their talent always leads to a different ending."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/puke-brains.jpeg?itok=bWpLDFPz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1374" height="800">

  </picture><p>"I think Stefhan nailed this on the head," says Lees, "It’s kind of dope to see how our styles meld together and how we work as a team. I think art style-wise, we both have a great respect for the other's craft, not to be too sappy. But we also aren’t afraid to tell each other if we have a different opinion."</p><p>"If I were to describe both of us in a different light," Alvarado continues, "I’d say that I lean more towards a traditional illustrator and Josh leans more into the fine artist territory. Those roles are all very shallow though, you learn pretty quickly as a working artist that you are a sum of your parts, and most of the time for illustrators that means that you have to be good at a lot of different things. In the end you end up being a Designer, Animator, draftsmen, illustrator, visual story teller, sequential artist, painter, etc."</p><p>For Alvarado, the coolest part of their collaboration is "that we’re both each other’s number one fans. We’re both competitive, but in a very healthy way. We push each other to keep upping the ante with our art. The product in the end speaks for itself it’s always the coolest it can be at that moment."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Since I'm here sitting down with two real-deal artists, I wanted to get their thoughts on the future of art and the increasing presence of AI. "With AI being forced down everybody’s throat," says Lees, "I think people want something that’s more human. As companies go full tilt into that landscape, they fail to understand that, for the viewer, AI art does nothing! Maybe it makes you mad or makes you laugh for a second, and then what? It's just slop."</p><blockquote><p>I think that’s why board games and TCGs are so fascinating right now. They feel very human.</p></blockquote><p>Alvarado agrees, "I think there's no better time than now to take creative risks with your art. I think it needs to feel tactile, gritty and imperfect, “punk” in a way. I think that’s why board games and TCGs are so fascinating right now. They feel very human. You’re basically collecting art and playing with it. You’re showing your individuality through the games by showing off your interests."</p><p>Lees continues, "While this is a terrible thing being implemented into our society, I do think that there will be a sort of Dada era of the arts where people make creative that rebells against the slop-apocalypse. That being said I do think that there is some really great music and art coming out these days; most likely being fueled by the times that we live in. Artists thrive in chaos and hard times."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Puke channels all of this frustration and inspiration into a concept they call "Art First." I asked them to explain this concept a bit more. "We keep hammering this Art First mantra down each other’s ear-holes because it makes everything simple. It keeps the brand from getting muddy. We keep pushing each other to make the dopest art we can make."</p><p>Lees adds to this sentiment, "It’s always been art, it’s always gonna be art, and it’s never <em>not</em> art. We want to strive to put out work that has an undeniable quality to it - and that goes from the quality of the playmats, stickers, and sleeves we're producing, to the image itself. We aren’t afraid to tell each other, 'hey that looks baddddd,' which keeps us honest and always makes us push it as far as we can go. Easy way to think of it is: Indiana Jones. We are Indiana Jones, and art Is our holy grail."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>As we wind down our conversation, I wanted to hear about their favorite <em>Magic</em> cards. "I think that aesthetically and mechanically," Alvarado says, "<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/82/dark-ritual" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Dark Ritual</a> is my favorite card. It represents its color so well and in the simplest way possible. Pay a little to get more. It feels like the spell a dark necromancer or warlock would use to summon a demon. Real Metal."</p><p>For Lees, his love of the game, and his favorite color and card, all started when he was a kid. "I started playing magic in the Time Spiral block," Lees explains, "when my childhood best friend gave me the gift of <em>Magic</em>." He and his buddy each bought a horrible pre-constructed deck during that block, "You people don’t know how nice you have it these days" Lees laughs.</p><p>"But from that, I was sorted into the house of Blue: the best color ever. Funny enough this leads into my fav magic card every which would be Mark Poole's <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/65/counterspell" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Counterspell</a>." The artwork, which depicts a mage with his spell fizzling as it leaves his fingertips, is described by Lees as, "just goated with the sauce, dripping with swag, sick, beautiful and wonderful all at the same time. Plus the best magic card mechanically ever created."</p><p>With that, our conversation comes to a close. Full of art, ambition, and clear-eyed intentions on what they want to create, there's a lot to love about Puke!</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vomitspit/puke-presents-a-barf-bonanza?ref=user_menu" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">To learn more about Puke and their outrageous Kickstarter, head over to the crowdfunding page!</a></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, MTV is a zombie network that primarily <a href="https://x.com/MTVSchedule/status/1465685976509030404/photo/1">airs episodes of </a><em><a href="https://x.com/MTVSchedule/status/1465685976509030404/photo/1">Ridiculousness</a>&nbsp;</em>and random Paramount-owned comedy films. It’s depressing. But before all that, before <em>The Real World</em> and <em>Road Rules</em>, MTV was a channel that mostly played music videos, and it was cool. So I was happy to hear that someone has created a free MTV simulator website, complete with retro ads.</p> <p>MTV Rewind is a website that tries to recreate the experience of watching the original music channel back in the day. When you first visit the site, it starts playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_music_videos_aired_on_MTV">original MTV broadcast</a>, complete with VJ introductions and the original music videos that were aired on that faithful day back in August 1981. I wasn’t alive back then, but it’s still fun to relive that launch from the comfort of my PC in 2025.</p>

  <p>Beyond recreating the first day, MTV Rewind features different decades you can swap between, built up of playlists featuring thousands of videos, as well as random, old TV ads from back in the day. And I have to admit, there is something special and comforting about returning to an era in which music was delivered to me without me having to create playlists, seek out artists, or hear the stuff that some algorithm decides I want to listen to next. Just a hose of old music videos streamed directly into my ears. Cool shit.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/1q5e7n1/comment/nxzbdgn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">The creator of MTV Rewind says</a> they built this project, which uses YouTube for all the videos, over the course of a week as a “passion project.” They shared on Reddit that they have “a deep nostalgia” for MTV and miss the 24/7 music videos. I’m happy they took the time to make this site. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a lot of 1990s music to jam out to while I work.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-developers-hit-back-criticism-steam-charts/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splitgate 2, which was recently rebranded as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, has been having a fairly tough time of late. The game was relaunched after being pulled back to beta following a hampered and relatively disastrous summer release, but the second wind has failed to generate much traction.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Splitgate developers at 1047 Games addressed the ongoing discourse around the game’s lack of success, which typically relies on Steam player numbers to frame a picture of the game’s struggles.</p>



<p>The developers are saying, as many have before, that Steam’s player numbers aren’t indicative of the bigger picture.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-rely-on-steam-to-get-your-consensus">Don’t Rely on Steam to Get Your Consensus</h2>



<p>In a recent post on social media damning the discourse around Splitgate: Arena Reloaded’s inability to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-failed-secure-traction-fumbled-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generate any hype</a> the second time around, <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the team said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Steam Charts don’t measure fun.</p>



<p>They show one number, one one platform, at one given moment. They don’t show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don’t capture the community that’s actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).</p>



<p>Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible.</p>



<p>To our amazing community: thank you. Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day.</p>



<p>And to everyone who hasn’t played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For reference, here’s what the Steam Charts look like for Splitgate: Arena Reloaded at the time of writing:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This statement comes months after Splitgate 2’s sentiments plummeted around a miserable launch and a marketing campaign that fell flat in a pretty spectacular way. There were concerns about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-drops-fans-concerned-microtransactions/">microtransactions</a> and bold statements made by the 1047 leadership team, and on two occasions, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developer-holds-another-round-of-layoffs/">layoffs were made</a> that further damaged the company’s PR image.</p>



<p>Even the game’s paid influencer campaign came under fire, with one analyst labelling the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-analysis-condemns-tone-deaf-influencer-campaign/">effort ‘tone deaf’</a> and stressing that it ‘alienated its core audience in pursuit of mainstream appeal.’</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re looking for a potential hit, zombie indie game, then you might want to start preparing yourself for the Quarantine Zone: The Last Check release date. By preparing yourself, this means ensuring you’re free of zombie bites.</p>



<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check infuses the infectious (no pun intended) eye for detail of Papers, Please, and the typical survivalist qualities of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-indie-games-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indie</a> survival horror rolled into one. One second, you’re scanning survivors for the slightest sign of a bite, the next, you’re desperately defending yourself from a horde of undead.</p>



<p>If you’re currently free of quarantine right now (even if you’re not, no one will tell), check out the game’s launch day.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-coming-out">When Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We see through you, literally. Credit to Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check has an official January 12 release date exclusively on PC systems.</strong></p>



<p>Closed playtests have come and gone, which means it’s time for the full launch. Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is one of the most-hyped Steam games in January, and with the month not bubbling in terms of AAA releases, it could be time for an indie game to get the huge boost it deserves.</p>



<p>Its game mechanics and fundamentals seem safe and secure, so unless there are any late breaches, you can look forward to a post-Christmas plague party to pile hours into.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-have-a-demo">Does Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Have A Demo?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A caged animal. Credit to Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is a free-to-play Quarantine Zone: The Last Check demo that you can download and play right now on Steam.</strong></p>



<p>It’s always safer to try before you buy. Thankfully, Brigada Games and Devolver Digital are more than happy to oblige, courtesy of The Last Check’s free Steam demo.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick explainer on how to acquire it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Steam</a> page.</li>



<li>Scroll down until you see a big, green box saying <strong>Download Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Demo</strong>.</li>



<li>Click <strong>Download</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose <strong>Install</strong>.</li>



<li>As long as you have the 21 GB required, it should download and install itself on the system.</li>



<li>Once ready, you can try out the free Download Quarantine Zone: The Last Check demo!</li>
</ol>



<p>Again, there’s a lot of interest in The Last Check, but it doesn’t hurt to have one ‘last check’ to see if it’s for you or not.</p>



<p>You’ve still got time to read about Quarantine Zone: The Last Check or play the demo.

                <p>Mistborn fans may be able to take to the virtual streets of Luthadel eventually, but not for a while. As part of the yearly "State of the Sanderson" <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/state-of-the-sanderson-2025#video-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, author Brandon Sanderson shared that he has been in conversations with multiple AAA developers about a potential Mistborn project. If the project does come to fruition, it will be years away.</p><p dir="ltr">Sanderson seems to be optimistic about the project's chances. He wrote, "I feel I’m finally getting established enough that we can make a Mistborn game happen. ... This is at Step One only, but it’s an encouraging One." Though he doesn't name any names, he does claim that he has been chatting with big players in the industry, including ones he is a fan of himself. Sanderson is also seeking maintain his rights to video game adaptations of Mistborn.</p><p dir="ltr">It appears that these discussions are in the earliest possible stage. "These rights were tied up with the film rights for the last... oh, six-seven years," Sanderson wrote, "so I didn’t get to test the market on them until recently." Sanderson concluded that any studio or publisher interested in developing a Mistborn or Stormlight project should get in touch with his representatives.</p><p dir="ltr">Mistborn is one part of Brandon Sanderson's sprawling Cosmere setting, which also encompasses the Stormlight Archive series. Multiple tabletop games based on Sanderson's work have emerged in recent years, including <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tabletop-rpgs-based-on-brandon-sandersons-novels-are-cheap-right-now/1100-6523355/">Cosmere tabletop RPGs</a> and <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mistborn-saga-deckbuilding-game-brandon-sanderson/1100-6532518/">a Mistborn deckbuilder.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Sanderson himself has some professional experience related to video games. He designed the world and created characters for <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/moonbreaker-is-a-brandon-sanderson-video-game-universe-designed-to-last/1100-6508189/">the tactics game Moonbreaker</a>. Should this project release, it would not be Mistborn's first foray into video games. A project called "Mistborn: Birthright" was in development for a few years before being canceled. Protagonist Kelsier was a guest character in Fortnite, owing to Sanderson's long-standing relationship with Epic.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Things Are a Bit Established at the Top” – The Top-5 Played Games in the US in 2025 on PS and Xbox Were the Same as 2024’s]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/</link>
            <guid>1398742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you think the problem with video games these days is that everyone plays the same five games all the time, which makes publishers more wary of taking risks, and instead of getting new, creative and innovative games, we get more of the same, then <strong>Circana</strong> analyst and executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> just gave you some fuel for that argument, as the numbers for the top-five played games in 2025 on PlayStation and on Xbox were the same as the top-five games played on both platforms in 2024.</p>



<p>They're even almost in the exact same order, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">Piscatella reports on Bluesky</a>, with the top five played games in the US on PlayStation, as ranked by percentage of active players, are:</p>



<ol>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Roblox</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>
</ol>



<p>On Xbox, the list is:</p>



<ol>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Roblox</li>
</ol>



<p>All five games are on the list for the most-played games on either platform in 2024, with the PlayStation 2024 list not changing at all, and the only difference on the Xbox 2024 list being that Call of Duty and Fortnite swap places, as do Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto V. But it's still the same five games, seemingly consuming everyone's time on consoles in the United States.</p>







<p>Piscatella followed the news up by saying, "<em>Things are a bit...established...at the top</em>." He also claimed that a more detailed report, including the top-selling games in 2025 in the US, overall and by platform, will arrive on January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>Any new game's biggest competitor is Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, and Roblox. Those are <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-biggest-competitor-threat-video-games-industry/">the five games that are dominating the industry,</a> and the reason why new games have a tough time gaining any traction.</p>



<p>Those are also five free-to-play games (Call of Duty: Warzone), and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">as Piscatella has reported before,</a> US consumers are likely to spend less on video games as tariffs and the rising cost of living continue to impact their discretionary spending. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">2025 might've been the year of indies</a> controlling the conversation and the awards, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight Silksong, Blue Prince, etc, but those are not the games that keep the industry moving. </p>



<p>So if you're the person complaining that we keep getting the same kinds of games over and over again, or that publishers aren't greenlighting new titles for fear that they'll get swallowed up by 'the big five,' then vote with your wallet where you can, and maybe spend a little more time <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">in the 'indies' section of Steam</a> instead of on Fortnite. It won't be much, but at an individual level, it's one of the best things you can do.</p>

              <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><em>Stranger Things</em> season five finale</a> ends with a big fight involving the major players of the series, and according to the creators behind the hit Netflix show, how this large fight played out was inspired by <em>Baldur’s Gate 3.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Last week, on New Year’s Eve,<em> Stranger Things</em> wrapped up after nearly a decade with an epic two-hour finale. While some fans weren’t happy with the conclusion and are <a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704">even theorizing that a special bonus episode will be released soon,</a> the last episode of<em> Stranger Things</em> did deliver a big battle featuring Vecna, the Mind Flayer, and many of the characters people have grown to love over the last few years.</p> <p><a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/">In a new interview with <em>Variety</em></a>, the Duffer brothers, the duo behind the show and its finale, revealed that the big boss fight was inspired by playing<em> Baldur’s Gate 3.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“We were thinking about <em>D&amp;D,</em> and I was playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> [while creating the finale], and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together,” said Matt Duffer. “Everyone had fully realized—either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues—moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> and something like <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">Swen Vincke,</a> the head of the studio behind<em> Baldur’s Gate 3,</em> seemed pleased with this information, <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2008573846526529945">resharing it on Twitter</a> and saying, “That’s pretty cool.”</p> <p>While speaking to <em>Variety</em>, Matt Duffer also added that “lots of video game references were applied to that final battle,” but didn’t confirm anything specific. Also, it sounds like the Duffers are aware of your wild theories that the “true” finale is yet to be revealed and simply replied, “Obviously, that’s not a real thing.”</p>

                <p>Prolific video game voice actor Troy Baker said he believes the generative AI revolution is a "good thing," in that it will push people to seek out "authentic" experiences made by artists as opposed to AI "gruel."</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-troy-baker-could-we" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Baker said there is no doubt "AI can make content way better than humans" and can "crank it out no problem." It is important to remember, however, that what AI makes is merely content, not art, Baker said.</p><p dir="ltr">"AI can create content but it cannot create art," Baker said. "And the reason why is because that invariably requires the human experience.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a fundamental premise to making art that people are not remembering right now, and it's that it requires artists. People go, 'Look what AI can do.' It's like, 'Yeah, okay. I see what it's capable of doing. It doesn't matter.' And we don't need to diminish it, we don't need to denigrate it, we don't need to demonize it. We need to just go, 'okay, it's there.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Baker said from a business perspective, AI is threatening, but that AI may actually be beneficial to artists in the long run.</p><p dir="ltr">"What I see happening is that this birth of AI, and this burgeoning industry of it, is actually going to drive people to the authentic," Baker said. "And we're going to see opportunities of, 'I want to go and watch this person sing this song live.' 'I want to see theater.' 'I want to read books.' 'I want to have this first-hand experience as opposed to the gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror.' I think that it's a good thing. It's a revolution."</p><p dir="ltr">AI use in game production, and AI voices, has become a hot-button issue in recent years, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actor-strike-ends-today/1100-6532363/" data-ref-id="1100-6532363">SAG-AFTRA video game actors strike</a> that ended last year revolving around actor protections in regards to AI. Despite vocal pushback from some players, certain developers have continued to move forward using AI to help create their games. Embark Studios, the developer behind last year's extraction-shooter-hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, uses <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">AI to generate NPC voices</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, actors like Matthew McConaughey and Michael Caine have signed deals allowing for their vocies to be used by AI. Despite James Earl Jones dying in 2024, an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">AI version of the Darth Vader voice actor's voice appeared in Fortnite</a> last year, where it quickly generated headlines due to players tricking the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/" data-ref-id="1100-6531608">AI into saying the F word and racial slurs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Baker, who is a member of SAG-AFTRA, recently received acclaim for his portrayal of Indiana Jones in MachineGames' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. Indiana Jones actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-praises-troy-baker-and-the-lack-of-ai-for-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/1100-6529281/" data-ref-id="1100-6529281">Harrison Ford himself praised Baker's performance</a> and said "[Baker] did a brilliant job, and it didn't take AI to do it."</p>

Hopefully, you have the RAM to run it.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the specs revealed today are only for 1080p/30 FPS (minimum hardware requirements) and 1080p/60 FPS (recommended hardware requirements), so there's no word on what kind of PC you'll need to play the game at, say, 1440p or 4K or even an FPS rate higher than 60. Nonetheless, you can find the requirements below:&nbsp;</p>

<figure data-uuid="91e9d815c552e"><a title="eShop Selects December 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91e9d815c552e/eshop-selects-december-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello and welcome to 2026 <em>and</em> the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a> of the year. You made it! Congrats!</p>
<p>Of course, we start the year off by looking at the last month of 2025, December. And boy, what a December we had — probably one of the most-stacked we've ever had, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>'s release and a bunch of surprise Nintendo Switch 2 Editions.</p>
<p>Of course, that means the eShop has been pretty busy, with some genuine surprises sneaking in before the Holiday season. So we've voted for the best of the best of the digital-only selection. The reles, as always: our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from December 2025 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wiqtgh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Alrighty then, let's have a look at the very best of December's eShop releases.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:195306,181925 @ 1767732152 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>We don't think anyone was expecting the amount of game releases we got in December 2025. Usually, the end of the year is a little quieter, but we were kept rather busy in the run up to Christmas.</p>
<p>Of course, there are two bigger games we haven't had the chance to review yet — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> dropped on Christmas Day in the US, and we're working on covering that very soon. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a>, which (now-former) Nintendo Lifer Felix <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">ranks among his favourite games of the year</a>, also slipped through the cracks of a busy festive period.</p>
<p>That leaves us with a total of eight games that scored an 8//10 or above that are eShop exclusives (at the time of writing this). Here's the five that didn't quite make the top in a closely-fought battle of votes:</p>

<p>Trust Tribute Games to give us a near-perfect Marvel beat 'em up in the same vein as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>. And that's exactly what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> is — not only a love letter to Marvel's rich comic book history, but a beautiful and excellent arcade side-scroller.</p>
<p>The roster is surprisingly robust and varied here, with every character feeling extremely distinct. And with the tag-team mechanic, you can play through the game multiple times with your favourite pairings and change things up as many times as you want. Add in the unlockable hard mode, and you have your new favourite co-op experience with a friend.</p>
<p>Available on both Switch 1 and 2 — and fantastic on both platforms — we scored the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/marvel-cosmic-invasion">an 8/10</a>.</p>

<p>Surprise! Speeding onto Switch 2 at the end of the 2025, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is <em>finally</em> fully realised on the newer console. Yes, it is getting a full physical later in 2026, but right now, this is a digital-only purchase or upgrade.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for this port, too, as CrossWorlds really struggled on the older hardware. Here, it's beautifully smooth with sharper resolutions and 60fps in both docked and handheld mode; all the other excellent bells and whistles are in tact, meaning this excellent racer can stand alongside Mario Kart World as one of the system's best, at least in the early days.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds scored an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">8/10 from us</a>, and there's more free content and DLC to come in the future.</p>

<p>One of 2025's very best games released on other platforms earlier in 2025 — <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/nobodys-really-heard-of-it-but-this-is-one-of-my-xbox-games-of-the-year-for-2025">Pure Xbox</a> is among the outlets celebrating it — and it <em>just</em> managed to squeak its way onto Switch in December. And thank goodness, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a> is a special one, and it barely beat out Sonic to win December's eShop Selects.</p>
<p>This short, sweet game follows Julián as he reflects on the time Ecuador qualified for the 2002 World Cup. This is not a soccer game, though — it's a beautiful narrative tale about Julián's experience growing up amidst this fervour. It's largely flown under the radar, but those who have played it have raved about it. And we're joining the chorus.</p>
<p>despelote scored <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/despelote">a well-deserved 9/10 from us</a> and takes the final eShop Selects trophy of 2025.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-december-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <p><span>After a long, eight-year wait, players can finally escape from Tarkov in </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span>. However, reaching the new end-game location, Terminal, is no easy feat, and neither is battling your way through to its conclusion. And now, following complaints from some in the</span><i><span> Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> community who found escaping too difficult, developer Battlestate Games has decided to make things even harder.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>As part of the long-awaited 1.0.0.2 update on December 1st of last year, Battlestate Games added four unique endings to </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov’s</span></i><span> gruelling 200-ish hour-long campaign. </span><span>Battling through the chaotic wave of AI-controlled enemies is no simple task, especially since you’ve just been stripped of all your gear, </span><span>but things become all the more punishing once you reach Terminal’s final hurdle. And according to </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/escape-from-tarkov/terminal-ending-change"><i><span>PCGamesN</span></i></a><span>, after some players said they found it too challenging, the devs decided that it actually still sounded a bit too easy.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If you’ve yet to complete Terminal for yourself, be warned that we’re about to get into heavy spoiler territory here.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>When </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov’s</span></i><span> full release update dropped, it added a brutal decision that players had to make: a boat had to be taken to reach the titular escape, but it only fit three. The game’s standard player formation is squads of five. Thus, two people had to stay behind, becoming engulfed in a nuclear blast while others sail away to safety (and earning themselves one of </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov’s</span></i><span> “bad” endings).</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Naturally, considering all the work it takes to get to that point, a sizable chunk of the community complained online. </span><a href="https://x.com/Velion/status/2007488455002206273"><span>This included</span></a> <i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> streamer Velion, who wrote, “</span><span>I would really like to see this changed where everyone can escape together. Imagine being able to go into terminal and meeting 2 other players who you work together on a hard map and you survive and make it out.” </span><span>Directing his feedback squarely at Battlestate Games, he tagged studio head Nikita Buyanov in his Twitter post.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Buyanov immediately replied by simply stating “its changed already,” which would reasonably lead you to assume that leaving Tarkov with all your buddies is now an option.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Turns out that Buyanov considers himself a comedian, as he actually meant that things have “changed” for the worse. As </span><a href="https://x.com/Pestily/status/2008264876163228137?s=20"><span>other players</span></a><span> online have already pointed out, the number of players who can now escape at the end of Terminal has been whittled down to one.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Of course, you could just play through Terminal by yourself and not have to bother with the hassle of deciding which of you gets to live once it ends, but that feels like it defeats the point. </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> has always been a game about forging bonds and making friends, and watching them all get consumed by a nuclear blast while you sail off into the sunset, </span><i><span>Titanic-</span></i><span>style, just seems fitting.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded will begin on Thursday, January 8. The mid-season update comes just over a month after Season 1 began on December 4.</p>



<p>With the start of Season 1 Reloaded, players will get new operators, modes, maps, and more. To celebrate the launch of the first Reloaded of the year, Activision has released a look at the multiplayer maps that will be available for all players.</p>







<p>In total, there are three maps coming—one brand new, one remastered, and one returning. </p>



<p>Starting with the brand-new map, Yakei is a small 6v6/2v2 map that sits “High above the neon-soaked streets, the rooftops of a dense Japanese city become the stage for betrayal.” Players will have to “navigate a labyrinth of ducts, vents, and industrial structures under an eerie night glow, where vertical combat and relentless pursuit turn every ledge into a fight for survival.”</p>



<p>The remastered map is Meltdown. Originally from Black Ops 2, Meltdown is a medium-sized 6v6 map that has a “classic three-lane design” through a nuclear power plant. </p>



<p>Lastly, Fringe is a returning 6v6 map from Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>What do you think of the maps coming in Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded? Leave your thoughts in the comments below, and stay tuned for full update details when they are announced closer to launch.</p>

This multi-step quest requires you to find multiple spots of interaction, as well as recover some specific pieces of loot. It can take some time to figure all of this out on your own, so we've put together a step-by-step process to get you through it.</p><p>Note that each part of this quest can be completed across multiple runs, so there's no need to wrap it all up in a single raid. That being said, you'll need to extract with the Magnetron and Flow Controller items once you find them, so it's probably best to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket or two to ensure you don't accidentally lose these precious items if you find them during your raid.</p><p>Here's how to complete Snap and Salvage in Arc Raiders.</p><h2 id="Where_to_find_the_rovers_in_the_Sandbox_and_how_to_take_a_photo_of_them">Where to find the rovers in the Sandbox and how to take a photo of them</h2><p>To take a photo of the rovers in the Sandbox, you'll need to make your way to (surprise!) the Sandbox POI on the bottom layer of the map.

                <p>This year marks the 15th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/" data-ref-id="5000-42960">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, the beloved spin-off that was developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Bethesda hasn't entrusted the franchise to many other developers, and according to studio boss Todd Howard, Obsidian was the only choice to take on New Vegas.</p><p>"They were the only choice," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/16/crawl-out-through-the-fallout" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/todd-howard-says-obsidian-was-the-only-choice-for-fallout-new-vegas-aside-from-the-studios-fallout-dna-devs-did-something-similar-with-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>). "They had done something similar with [Star Wars] Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well. We knew we were going onto Skyrim, the franchise was back, but we knew there was going to be a long break until Fallout 4--how can we keep this going?"</p><p>Obsidian was founded by ex-Interplay and Black Isle Studios devs who previously worked on the original Fallout as well as a canceled version of Fallout 3. That made the studio a natural home for New Vegas. Howard also said that the only note Bethesda had ahead of development was to focus on the game's warring factions and the players' ability to choose between them.</p><p>"The thing that made New Vegas special was the ferocious focus on choice-and-consequence gameplay," added John Gonzalez, the lead creative designer for New Vegas. "It's all about allowing the player to have tremendous amounts of narrative impact, narrative control."</p><p>Celebrity gamer--and the voice of New Vegas' ghoul mechanic, Raul Alfonso Tejada--Danny Trejo recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/danny-trejo-wants-a-fallout-new-vegas-remaster-and-wants-it-now/1100-6535647/" data-ref-id="1100-6535647">demanded a New Vegas remaster</a>.

And that's only for PC users.</p><p>Howard has remained elusive about the status of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a>, which isn't expected to arrive until well after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in December 2025, before <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ces/"><strong>CES 2026</strong> really kicked off</a>, ASUS invited Wccftech and other members of the press to downtown Toronto for a sneak preview at what ASUS would be bringing to the coming show in Las Vegas. It was an afternoon packed with information and a look at ASUS's lineup of 2026 products, and as you might imagine, there were more than a few intriguing devices shown off.</p>



<p>That said, everything that was in the showroom that day and all of the tech that is currently descending on Las Vegas comes with a cloud hanging over it: <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/"><strong>memory shortages</strong></a>. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/">shortage is threatening</a> (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">in some ways, already succeeding</a>) to send the entire tech world into disarray, which honestly makes it difficult to get excited about anything coming from ASUS or any other tech hardware manufacturer.</p>



<p>Even with the gloomy realities of the world creeping around every new device that was shown off, I was still able to find a few items that stood out to me as what to look forward to, and what might actually be worth saving up for, if you're in the market for some of the latest and greatest tech.</p>



<p>I also got the chance to speak with <strong>Sascha Krohn, </strong>global director of technical marketing at ASUS, about the company's 2026 lineup and what it's bringing to CES. <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-with-asus-ahead-of-ces-2026-everybodys-going-to-have-to-increase-prices-interview/">You can check out that interview here</a>.</p>



<p>Some housekeeping, these picks are just what stood out to me based on their specs, what actually seems exciting about the device, and how I'd be interested in using it. I only got to spend an afternoon getting up close and personal with these devices, and I'm not at CES 2026 personally, so these won't be hands-on impressions. We're sure to learn more about these devices as CES 2026 kicks off, so <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ces/">check out our full coverage of the showcase here for more</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-rog-g1000-the-outrageous">ROG G1000 - The Outrageous</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ROG-G1000-ASUS-CES-2026-Preview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The ROG G1000 at the ASUS CES 2026 Toronto Preview.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are always a few products that make their way to CES that aren't ever going to make it to consumers, and are just expensive showpieces for the show floor. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-g1000-flagship-rog-gaming-desktop-anime-holo-holographic-fans-420mm-aio/"><strong>ASUS ROG G1000</strong></a> straddles the line between a product that's actually going to be available to consumers and something that is better suited as a showpiece for CES.</p>



<p>It's that duality that makes it an impressive machine that can be easy to get excited for, with holographic fans and three-zone cooling. The fact that the chassis is so big, you can fit practically any component you want in there, not to mention ASUS's mandate that only the top-of-the-line hardware gets anywhere close to meeting this tower's standards.</p>



<p>After all, what else would you expect from the flagship ROG desktop in ASUS's 2026 lineup? But unless you have the storage space and, more importantly, the wallet space, the G1000 might as well be one of those impossible products you see at CES that you know you'd never actually get to try unless you were on the show floor. </p>



<p>It's cool and exciting to have a holographic fan and to see an LED show on steroids going on in your PC at all times, but with the price of all tech products in fluctuation, the G1000 may live up to its "<em>Built to be Seen</em>" tagline more than ASUS would like, as all we can do is 'see' it through our own computer screens without a hope of actually getting to see one at our desks while playing the latest release at max settings.</p>

<h2 id="h-rog-zephyrus-g16-the-respectable">ROG Zephyrus G16 - The Respectable</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ROG-Zephyrus-G16-ASUS-CES-2026-Preview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>ROG Zephyrus G16 2026 at the ASUS CES 2026 Toronto preview.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This entry comes with a fair share of bias, because I bought an ROG Zephyrus G15 laptop back in 2021, and it's been an incredible piece of kit for me since day one. It's easy for me to get excited about the ROG Zephyrus G16 because it's a better version of a laptop I already love, so take my recommendation of it with that in mind.</p>



<p>As someone who has been working and gaming on an older model in the Zephyrus line of laptops, what stands out to me about the 2026 G16 is how ASUS redesigned the cooling structure for the device, as I've found my current model to run hotter than I'd like while gaming. That's a personal highlight based on my own experience with my older laptop, but the undeniable highlight of the 2026 G16 model is its Nebula HDR OLED display panel.</p>



<p>At 2560x1600 and 240Hz, and up to 1000 Nits, this will undoubtedly be one of the best displays on a laptop this year. It'll be so crisp it might actually distract you long enough that you forget about the memory shortages for a few fleeting moments.</p>

<p>I know devices like the Zephyrus Duo and Zenbook Duo aren't anything brand new. It's not exactly innovative to be putting out yet another version of a device we've already seen before. But to me, if the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-g16-g14-laptops-next-gen-intel-amd-upgrades-dual-3k-oled-stunning-designs/">ROG Zephyrus Duo 2026</a></strong> ended up becoming the best dual-screen laptop so far, that would be innovative enough, because I truly believe dual-screen laptops are the future of laptops overall.</p>



<p>I don't think we'll be abandoning the kinds of laptops we've all been used to for decades, but I do see Duo laptops becoming the 'everything device' for the next generation. It's a tablet when you want it to be, without losing any of the features you get from a full laptop. You can fold it any which way you need whether you're relaxing by watching something online or if you're making a presentation to a group of people. </p>



<p>It's got two standout Nebula HDR OLED displays, all the ports you'd want with little need for any adaptor dongles, and it's got power to spare, especially if you get the model that is spec'd out below with an RTX 5090 and Intel's latest Panther Lake CPUs.</p>



<p>I don't necessarily need a new laptop, but if I did, the Zephryus Duo is what I would try to save my pennies for.</p>

<p>Lastly, the ASUS ROG Flow Z13 Kojima Productions collaboration stood out because it is just plain cool. Yes, it is last year's ROG Flow Z13; the hardware inside isn't anything new, but even with that in mind, it's tough to say 'no' to a laptop designed by Yoji Shinkawa and Hideo Kojima. </p>



<p>The hardware won't take you as far as even some of ASUS's more budget-friendly laptops from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-zenbook-a16-fastest-qualcomms-snapdragon-x2-laptop-proart-pz14-zenbook-a14-vivobook-s16-unveiled/">Vivobook</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-amd-ryzen-ai-max-ryzen-ai-400-mainstream-tuf-gaming-a14-laptops/">TUF Gaming </a>lines will, but those don't come with Yoji Shinkawa's brush stroke.</p>

            <guid>1398673</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I don’t pay much attention to Logan Paul, the content creator turned wrestler with side hustles that involve turning </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-most-valuable-pokemon-card-auction-2000656107"><span>into heartless cash grabs</span></a><span> and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-logan-paul-cryptozoo-nft-game-refund-lawsuit-1851143787"><span>failed NFT game</span></a><span>. But the social media persona entered my field of view last night after making </span><a href="https://x.com/LoganPaul/status/2008546103965479046"><span>a now viral post</span></a><span> pitching his idea for a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><span>new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game</span></a><span>. Well, “new” is a stretch, considering what he’s asking for is essentially another fucking remake of the original </span><i><span>Pokémon Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span> games. But having been in the series’ vicinity for almost 30 years, I know that this is the type of artless pitch lapsed and casual </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans would happily gobble down like Moomoo Milk.</span></p> <p><span>Pushing aside with all our might that this reads like a pitch to Game Freak that was probably written by ChatGPT (“nostalgic equity” is a phrase no human has ever said), let’s look at what Paul is actually asking for.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Idea for The Pokémon Company:</p> <p>I think there is a MASSIVE opportunity to capitalize on the decades of nostalgic equity that fans have with the franchise</p> <p>The same frenzy that originally propelled Pokémon into mainstream culture lives within millions of adults that yearn for the…</p> <p>— Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/2008279181080109173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>He says that The Pokémon Company has a “massive opportunity” to bank on nostalgia, as if Pikachu and friends have ever not taken the opportunity to shove the original Kanto starters into something over the past 30 years. He also mentions how, every few years, he’ll boot up the original games on a Game Boy to find “just as much joy” playing back through them as he had as a child.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>He then admits he doesn’t have “much of a connection” to newer Pokémon, which is where he begins to give the game away. He does like Annihilape and Baxcalibur, suggesting he’s not completely out of the loop. But since he doesn’t really seem to care about anything Pokémon has done in the last 27 years, he argues it would be cool for Game Freak to create “remastered” versions of the Generation I Game Boy games, with “adaptive NPCs that evolve alongside the player.”</span></p>

 <p><span>He says they could even use modern technology to let players connect to the internet for trading and battling, something Pokémon has literally been doing for 20 years, ever since </span><i><span>Diamond</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pearl </span></i><span>on the DS. He goes on:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>This will do three things</span></p> <p><span>1.) Give older fans a chance to relive their childhood thus awakening a massive, dormant demographic&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>2.) Give newer, younger fans a taste of what originally made the franchise so special</span></p> <p><span>3.) Bridge the gap for older fans who don’t connect with newer Pokémon in a way that’s familiar to them</span></p> <p><span>If we believe that video game cycles are like a pendulum, the near-future of gaming may birth a desire for more simplified, block-based aesthetics. We already see it happening with games like Minecraft &amp; Roblox. As technology continues to advance at an alarmingly rapid pace, I personally believe the future will lean towards “retro”</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>This LinkedIn-ass post tries to intellectualize what is obvious nostalgia-pining as some kind of market inevitability; that it would just be good business sense for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>to go back to Kanto for the people who only played those original games decades ago, outgrew them, and now think the problem is that the all-ages franchise has fallen “behind the times.” Also, crucially, Game Freak already remade those original games twice with </span><i><span>FireRed</span></i><span>/</span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>and the </span><i><span>Let’s Go </span></i><span>games on Switch, the latter of which are only seven years old.</span></p>

 <p><span>Yes, the original </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>are still the best-selling games in the franchise, and maybe some people are too young to realize that the level of Pokémania back then was far beyond the still massive success </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>enjoys right now. To insinuate that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is in danger of getting away from its base of ‘90s kids, though, is like saying the sun isn’t shining because you’re inside and can’t feel its warmth. But this is the sentiment of a lot of retired Pokémon trainers who stopped playing in elementary school and mistake their own lack of interest for the series no longer having the sauce.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s the same mentality that makes people mad that </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>have “regular animals” in them like Flamigo when </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>had Seel, or who didn’t like that Gen V and VI had Pokémon made of “objects” when Grimer and Voltorb were literal sludge and a living Poké Ball. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>made me feel something specific as a child, and now that I’m an adult and my brain has developed differently, I don’t feel that way anymore. Instead of the realities of adulthood crushing my spirit, it must be because the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games don’t have Professor Oak and Misty in them all the time.</span></p>

 <p><span>If all you’re looking at is video game sales numbers, you probably could foolishly think </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is “struggling” in the market compared to what it hit in the ‘90s, despite the absolute trashfire that was </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> still readily selling around 27 million copies, a number any other company would kill to hit. But </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is a lifestyle brand that makes most of its money from </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pokemon-has-become-the-highest-grossing-media-franchise-of-all-time/"><span>merchandise sales</span></a><span>, and you would think someone who played a major role in inflating the value of the trading cards would know that.</span></p>

 <p><span>Honestly, if people like Paul want something that feels just like the old games did when they were five, try a ROM hack. Fans have been making retro-style </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games for decades. They’re not only great, they’ll probably also make you feel cozy-wozy with their pixelated graphics that look like what you played on your Game Boy. And hey, you can probably find plenty that don’t include all the hundreds of new Pokémon you don’t like, but which millions of younger players grew up on and hold as dear as old-timers do Pikachu or Charmander.</span></p> <p><span>This yearning for the mines of Kanto exists around the periphery of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>every day, and it’s only going to ratchet up more this year with the series’ 30th anniversary celebrations <a href="https://x.com/pokemon_cojp/status/2006379822012911872?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q">already paying tribute to those old games</a>. ROM hacks, mock-ups from people who don’t even like the games anymore, and even fan art are constantly gesturing at the series’ old aesthetics. I still have my original copy of </span><i><span>Pokémon Yellow </span></i><span>sitting on my shelf to this day, and maybe if Game Freak releases those old games on Switch this year, I’ll play it again.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But I don’t need The Pokémon Company to keep looking back. And the company certainly doesn’t need to tap into a “massive,” untapped well of fair-weather fans who will come back to the franchise for good if they remake </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>again. I think it’ll live.</span></p>

<p>Dead by Daylight has announced its second collaboration with Stranger Things, with Chapter 2 arriving on January 27, 2026. </p>



<p>Behaviour Interactive’s popular co-op survival horror title, Dead by Daylight, is known to introduce collaborations with other franchises frequently. <span>Last year, we saw collabs with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-the-walking-dead-crossover-confirmed-reveal-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Walking Dead</a> and Dead by Daylight&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-announces-dead-by-daylight-collaboration/" target="_blank">enter</a> th</span>e world of Assassin’s Creed. Now, they have introduced a second collab with Stranger Things as the Netflix series comes to a close. </p>



<h2 id="h-dead-by-daylight-x-stranger-things-introduces-vecna-eleven-and-dustin">Dead by Daylight x Stranger Things Introduces Vecna, Eleven, and Dustin</h2>



<p>The new Stranger Things collab introduces the series’ most popular villain, Vecna (The First), as a New Killer. Vecna has two special abilities: Vine Attack, which creates a small area of effect on the ground, and The Upside Down &amp; Undergate, which allows the Killer to enter the Upside Down and navigate the map quickly and then return to the map with an Undergate attack. The character also comes with three new Killer Perks: Turn Back the Clock, Secret Project, and Hex: Hive Mind. </p>



<p>Then we have the two new Survivors, Eleven and Dustin. Dustin comes with three new perks: Bada Bada Boom, which allows him to trap a window for 40/50/60 seconds, Change of Plans, which enables him to transform a toolbox into a Med-kit, and Teamwork: Full Circuit, which allows him to repair faster and increase the size of the Good Skill Check zone. </p>



<p>Eleven also comes with three new perks in the Dead by Daylight x Stranger Things collab. The first is Extrasensory Perception, which enables Eleven to see auras in an expanding radius and use Elusive and Obvious. Second is We See You, which provides the character with one token when the Killer reveals their aura. Last is Teamwork: Soft-Spoken, which also helps repair faster and reduces generator repair noise.</p>



<p>Lastly, a new feature called Visual Terror Radius has been added, which animates the heart to match 3D heart behaviour and has its own Lullaby version. There are a lot more new additions which you can check out below: </p>

<ul>
<li>Once a Survivor has gained enough tokens, Worldbreaker activates, and the Worldbreaker Timer begins. While Worldbreaker is active, both the Vine Attack and<br>Undergate&nbsp;attacks&nbsp;do&nbsp;damage&nbsp;to&nbsp;Survivors&nbsp;instead&nbsp;of&nbsp;adding&nbsp;Worldbreaker&nbsp;tokens,&nbsp;and 4 Grandfather Clocks activate.</li>



<li>Worldbreaker lasts for a predetermined amount of time, based on the number of Survivors alive. Survivors can interact with the Grandfather Clocks spread around the map to speed up the Worldbreaker Timer.</li>

</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Hex: Hive Mind</strong>
<ul>
<li>The first time you hook any Survivor, a Dull Totem becomes a Hex Totem.</li>

<li>When&nbsp;<strong>1/1/1</strong>&nbsp;generator remains, all remaining generators explode, lose&nbsp;<strong>6/8/10%</strong>&nbsp;progress and start regressing, and the Hex Totem becomes dull.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3><strong>New Survivor – Dustin Henderson</strong></h3>



<p><strong>NEW SURVIVOR PERKS:</strong></p>
