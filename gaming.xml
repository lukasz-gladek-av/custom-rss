But as others pointed out, Totoki was referring to the business as a whole, which is lacking in homegrown properties on the scale of, say, Mario. Outside of Spider-Man, <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series">Sony's biggest transmedia sucess is arguably The Last of Us</a>, which debuted to great fanfare on HBO in 2023.</p><p>One fan opined on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1f90eob/comment/lli8qui/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, "This comment is referring to Sony as a whole, not just its games division. From that perspective, I think I would agree. As a casual viewer I couldn’t name anything that stands out to me from their film division that isn’t an existing IP, and even what they <em>are</em> making doesn’t have the greatest reputation. What is Sony Pictures without Spider-Man? Hotel Transylvania?"</p><p>Sony has prioritized the acquisition of major franchises, at one point seeking to team with Apollo to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-and-investment-firm-apollo-reportedly-submit-26-billion-offer-to-acquire-paramount">acquire Paramount for $26 billion</a> in a deal that ultimately fell through. Still, Sony is hoping that it can continue to develop popular properties of its own.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Whether it’s for games, films or anime, we don’t have that much IP that we fostered from the beginning</p></div><p>"We have the technology and creation is the area where we like and where we can contribute the most," CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said as part of interview. "By putting our efforts in creation, that also means that we will work with partners on the distribution side. So I think we have developed very good relationships with the so-called Big Tech players."</p><p>The interview also quotes Crunchyroll President Rahul Purini, who says the streamer is seeking to team with Sony to co-produce shows amid rising production costs. He estimates that there are around 800 million anime fans globally, which he believes could rise to a billion in the next few years.</p><p>"Given the constraints within the ecosystem, there is opportunity for various companies, including Sony, to see if there is a way to add additional capacity, bring additional talent and potentially leverage digital technology in the creation process," Purini said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/04/infamous-2-1725485658804.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Fans are getting nostalgic for Infamous and other lost PlayStation properties after a Sony exec that it wasn't doing enough to make new franchises. </figcaption></figure></output><p>Sony is just one of many media companies to join the frenzy to find valuable franchises for streaming services, video games, and other platforms. Nintendo, Sega, Warner Bros., and Disney are among the companies to dig into their portfolios to find fodder for movies and amusement parks, resulting in a host of revivals, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/even-eternal-champions-segas-obscure-1993-fighting-game-is-getting-its-own-movie-now">some of them quite obscure</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, Sony's attempts to create its own online franchise hasn't gotten well, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">Concord set to be pulled offline less than two weeks after launch</a>. Prior to the cancellation, Concord was set to appear in Amazon's Secret Level series, though it's unclear whether those plans will move forward. </p><p>In the meantime, Sony fans are being left to fondly reminisce about Infamous, Jak and Daxter, Dark Cloud, Gravity Rush, and other lost classics. Hey, at least there's always Astro Bot, right? Sony's nostalgic platformer will be out September 6. </p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-the-first-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/little-nightmares-3-the-first-preview.972435/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Sigmund Freud believed that the power of the uncanny came from placing the strange inside something that would otherwise be ordinary. Dolls, wax figures, settings, scenarios, people that are just off. It’s the familiar, but just strange enough to feel wrong, and it makes us anxious. I couldn’t help thinking of the uncanny as I played Little Nightmares 3. A sense of creeping dread pervaded my time with it, but I also found myself compelled to push forward, see more, and unravel the mysteries of its world. It’s a fine line to walk, but during my hour-long play session with the game, Little Nightmares 3 pulled it off, and left me wanting more when the “Thank you for playing” screen informed me my time was done.</p><p>Little Nightmares 3 might be the third game in the series, but it’s offering up a lot of franchise firsts. It’s the first game to be developed without series creator Tarsier Studios. Instead, Supermassive Games, the team behind Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and The Quarry is at the helm. Similarly, it is the first entry in the series to feature co-op play and the first to be a standalone sequel. You don’t need to have played the first two Little Nightmares games to understand this one, and as someone who has never played a Little Nightmares game before, I didn’t have much trouble following along.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Little Nightmares III Gamescom Opening Night Live Trailer</h3></div></output><p>The first thing I noticed about Little Nightmares was the way it builds atmosphere. It looks gorgeous, but what stood out to me was how it used light and shadow to highlight things you often don’t want to see or obscure things you might want to. Little Nightmares 3 understands that the scariest stuff is often what you can't see, or only get glimpses of, and it's happy to tease you along and build a sense of impending doom before the big reveal.</p><p>Then there’s the audio design; Little Nightmares 3 makes great use of environmental sounds and ambient noise to ratchet up the tension. Whether it’s the soft sound of footballs, the heavy machinery of a candy factory (more on that in a second), or the creaking of an old board that might be just stable enough to get you across that gap, Little Nightmares 3 uses what you hear in the environment to keep you on your toes. And that ambient noise? Genuinely creepy.</p><h3>The Kids Are(n’t) All Right</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Little Nightmares 3 follows Low and Alone, two kids desperately searching for a way out of Nowhere. Low and Alone didn't speak in the sections I played, but you get a feel for their relationship in the little moments where they check in on each other or help each other up. These two characters clearly know and care for one another, and there’s a tenderness in these small moments that sells that, no dialogue needed. I hope it lasts, but this is horror. A lot can go wrong.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These two characters clearly know and care for one another, and there’s a tenderness in these small moments that sells that, no dialogue needed.</p></div><p>No matter who you play as, you’ll be doing a lot of the same things: jumping over obstacles, pushing blocks, navigating narrow pathways over very long drops, and generally solving puzzles so you can delve deeper into the Spiral. But what makes them interesting is their equipment. Alone has a wrench that she can use to turn cranks, activate switches, and even break down walls. Low, on the other hand, wields a bow that allows him to hit switches from a distance, scare away birds carrying a key you might need, or shoot down a crate hanging by a thread from the ceiling. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There are also some problems that you just can't solve alone. Sometimes, that means boosting your partner so you can pull down a switch. Other times, one of you will have to carry a light to scatter the bugs that would otherwise attack you while the other uses the safety of the light to climb a ladder and search for the way forward. And sometimes, you'll just need an extra pair of hands to open a heavy door. </p><p>The puzzles I saw in Little Nightmares 3 weren’t necessarily hard, but they always made sure my partner and I were working together and communicating. Little Nightmares 3 works fine without another player - they're instead replaced with an AI version of whichever character you aren't playing that you can call over if you need help and will sometimes show you the way forward - but co-op play is definitely the way to go.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In one particularly memorable scene, my real-life partner and I had to hide from a very scary lady with too many arms, avoiding her while figuring out the way forward before she could spot us. Those moments are where Little Nightmares 3 shines.</p><h3>The Horror, The Horror</h3><p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t touch on the environments that make this all possible. I saw two parts of the Spiral in my time with Little Nightmares 3. The first was the Candy Factory, a monstrosity of an installation that was deeply uncomfortable to navigate because we knew we weren't alone. </p><p>In addition to the scary lady with too many arms, the building was populated by unnatural workers suspended from the ceiling and the creepy hum of machinery. It was uncanny in all the best ways; something clearly familiar, but also deeply wrong. I compensated by naming each of the lollipops we ran into Steve, and carrying them with me as long as I could. Each time we parted, I was heartbroken. Thankfully, there was always another Steve on the horizon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The second was the Necropolis, an abandoned ruin in the desert. While the Candy Factory is unnerving because you're not alone, the Necropolis builds dread by reminding you that you are. Each place raises more questions than it answers. Who is the Candy Factory making all these lollipops for? Who are those people hanging from the ceiling? What are all these bodies doing in the Necropolis? What happened here? And are we really alone? In my time with it, Little Nightmares 3 balanced the uncanny and the curious, and as anxious as I was about what was around the next corner, I was also eager to see more and piece together answers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If there's one thing I don't like about Little Nightmares 3, it's that there’s no local co-op. </p></div><p>If there's one thing I don't like about Little Nightmares 3, it's that there’s no local co-op. That said, you can play with a friend online even if only one of you owns the game, which goes a long way toward making up for it.</p><p>When my time with Little Nightmares 3 ended, I was sad to say goodbye to Low and Alone, but eager to visit the earlier games and see what I'd missed. Little Nightmares 3 is disquieting in the way horror should be while being an engaging co-op game that motivates you to push through the tension to see what's around the next corner. In fact, you might even call the balance uncanny. If Supergiant Games can continue to walk that line, Low and Alone are going to have a compelling journey indeed. I hope they make it.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

We recently played a 45-minute demo of one of the game's early chapters that shows off her newfound abilities to move between parallel realities with one major difference: In one world, her friend Safi is alive; in the other, she's been murdered, and the killer in the first reality may still be at-large, leading Max on an adventure to save her friend before it's too late.</p><p>We also spoke to the game's creative director, Jonathan Stauder, and narrative director Felice Kuan, about what went into building out this new story for Max, how she ended up in Vermont, and more on the lore surrounding the broader Life is Strange universe. You can read our Q&amp;A with the team below, before the game's debut on October 29.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Life Is Strange: Double Exposure Honors Both Endings of the Original Game | gamescom 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>Note: This interview has been edited for clarity.</p><p><strong>GameSpot: Does Double Exposure declare one ending from the first game canon, and if not, how does that work?</strong></p><p>Jonathan Stauder: Oh, no. Nope. So, in the course of starting up the game, playing the first couple of scenes, you will have the opportunity to say what occurred in the first game. From that point forward, you've determined your canon.</p><p><strong>Okay. I don't know if it would've made sense, but I was thinking, maybe she is shifting between two realities that spawned from the first game's ending.</strong></p><p>JS: Yeah, no. That's been a [source] of confusion. So just to be clear, the two realities are: Safi's alive and Safi's dead. Nothing with Arcadia Bay.</p><p><strong>And she's moved to Vermont, right? What went into that decision? I can understand the idea of, 'Let's get her out of the Pacific Northwest," but why Vermont specifically?</strong></p><p>Felice Kuan: I know that we wanted her far away, right? So symbolically, literally on the other side of the country [made sense]. I don't know if there was any other specific reason. I know that we were excited about winter, because the last game took place around Halloween, so then the next immediate season, you get winter, you get Christmas.</p><p><strong>So in a story about alternate realities, how can we be sure this is <em>our </em>Max from the first game? Why don't we need to worry about that?</strong></p><p>JS: Yeah, no, so it's <em>your</em> Max. Like we were saying, we give you that moment to sort of confirm what happened with that major choice. From that moment forward, you should feel confident as a player, like, "I'm taking the Max I knew from the first game forward into this one and evolving her."</p><p><strong>The plot reminds me of the movie Another Earth. Have you seen it and was that an inspiration?</strong> [Both developers confirm they haven't.]<strong> Do you have any other specific inspirations that led you to this story?</strong></p><p>FK: From the literary side, the multiverse [concept] is very, very in and very, very prevalent. And so I think we actually wanted--not that we weren't inspired, and not that we didn't check out other media--but we wanted very much to find Max's version of that. [What is her] meaningful intersection with multiverse ideas that Max could go through?</p><p>JS: And visually, I'm a huge fan of Remedy games and their own particular brand of weird and how they find their own way to do it, whether it's alt timelines, multiverses, that sort of thing. And so I think just as a jumping-off point, we're gonna find our own way to do this particular flavor of time travel across alt universes. I think, especially later in the game, you might see some visual flourishes that feel a little bit [like] Remedy.</p><p><strong>This series always uses lots of licensed music. Should fans expect more of that here? Can you speak to specific tracks or artists?</strong></p><p>JS: it'll be a bunch of things that you don't know yet, because they're all fresh and new and original for this game. My mandate for the soundtrack and the score was, you want kind of the story of Max and the story of Safi, and how they influence and intertwine and change one another, to echo in the music and the soundtrack. And so, hopefully, you play all five chapters, and you feel that. And I know there's a lot more about the music coming out before launch, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362123-screenshot2024-09-04145156.png" data-ref-id="1300-4362123" data-ratio="0.55905511811024" data-width="1016" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362123-screenshot2024-09-04145156.png" data-ref-id="1300-4362123"></a><figcaption>When Max attempts to use her long-dormant powers, she finds they've changed since last time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4362123-screenshot2024-09-04145156.png"></figure><p><strong>I've seen fan sentiment suggesting bringing Max back is simply fan service. Can you explain why it's more than that?</strong></p><p>FK: I think once you've gone through this [game], it'll be very clear that this is [necessarily] Max's story. We all found the first game very formative and felt like after a huge choice like the one she has made, there is a ton to unpack. It's also pretty much the [same] amount of time that has passed since that game's story, so our own perspectives of what it meant, I think, give us something to say.</p><p>JS: Right, so if we're looking at a list of powers that would be good for these protagonists and we're looking at this shifting between two distinctly different timelines, I think [we found] that it was a good method for Max to maybe work through all those issues coming out of the first game, and provide catharsis. So we said that, 'Oh, man, this could be a good Max game.' We go down that rabbit hole discover, 'Oh, I think we're right.' And then here we are.</p><p><strong>Is there anything a Life is Strange game couldn't do in the first game that you could do now? This could be technical or narrative-related, or something else.</strong></p><p>JS: Yeah. I mean, for sure, from a technical perspective. So this is the first Life is Strange game in Unreal Engine 5. So visually, there are a massive number of improvements. You're gonna see that in all of our performances, the fidelity, the lighting, all those sorts of things [...] Like Max's new power, the shifting, the immediacy of it--where you can pop between two versions of a space without a load screen that sort of thing. That's certainly something you couldn't have done, even say back in [2021's] True Colors.</p><p>FK: We love the first game. I think we tried to do everything it does, but more. I think that the first game set a path for having different kinds of characters that you don't normally see, and being very explicit about topics like teen suicide, things like that [games] just don't do. And so I think now we're at a place with however many there have been now, where we can do that and do it even more openly, and have it be baked into the process.</p><p><strong>Do all of the Life is Strange games share a single story universe?</strong></p><p>JS: Oh yeah, one hundred percent. Everything that Don't Nod made, everything that Deck Nine has made, that's all one continuity. But if you go, like, into the comics, into the novels, that is where things start to get a little murky. But for sure, all of the published games to date take place in the same world.</p><p>GameSpot: So in one world, all these kids are discovering that they have these powers and they're potentially like the Avengers of troubled youths. Thematically, you want to express that these kids all discover their powers at their lowest point, is that right? Something traumatic is triggering it each time?</p><p>JS: Exactly.</p><p>KF: And that means that not every power is a good Life is Strange power because the powers are intimately tied to the specific trauma, and when you find a story background and a power that, like, click, it's exciting.</p><hr><p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure launches on October 29 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.

This free-to-play adventure has a lot of efficient mechanics to help players feel like they have choices in its massive world. However, you may be wondering if that extends to cross-progression and cross-play functionality. Well, we have good news and bad news--so let's dive in and find out.</p><h2>Does Throne and Liberty have cross-progression (AKA cross-save)?</h2><p>So, the bad news first: <strong>Throne and Liberty does not support cross-progression</strong> at this time. As such, if you purchase the game on more than one platform, you'll have to start entirely new accounts and characters on each.</p>

      </div>
<p>Sadly, as of this writing, developer NCSoft has not announced any plans to add this functionality in the future, but we'll be sure to keep this updated if that changes.</p><h2>Does Throne and Liberty have cross-play?</h2><p>Now for the good news: <strong>Yes, Throne and Liberty supports cross-play</strong>. This means that you can play with players on other platforms with no notable restrictions, letting you choose your preferred place to play without worrying if your friends will be locked out of playing with you.</p><h3>Do you need PlayStation Plus or Game Pass Core subscription to play Throne and Liberty?</h3><p>If you're planning to play on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, we have some more good news: You do not need a PlayStation Plus or Game Pass Core subscription to play Throne and Liberty. You will, however, need to have a PlayStation or Xbox account--but if you play on one of these platforms, you probably already do.</p>

Helldiver 2's long-awaited third enemy faction, the Illuminate - previously seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 1, but still conspicuously absent from its sequel - has briefly appeared in-game. Which hasn't stopped developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> from declaring the incident to be "fake news".

Players began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1f8ql19/illuminate_on_map/">reporting</a> strange sightings across <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a>'s Galactic War map (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-players-get-all-wound-up-as-galactic-map-briefly-reveals-the-presence-of-the-illuminate-but-arrowhead-ceo-dismisses-it-all-as-fake-news/">PC Gamer</a>) earlier today, beginning with a mysterious cluster of purple sectors where players had previously only seen red for Automaton incursions and orange for Terminids.
</p>
<p>
If it's near-incontrovertible proof of an Illuminate presence you're after, though, then look no further than the small purple symbol players discovered when rolling over one of the mysterious new purple sectors - a symbol long-time fans will immediately recognise as the <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Helldivers_1:The_Illuminate">circle-in-a-circle design</a> representing the Illuminate faction in Helldivers 1.

Unfortunately for players hoping for answers, developer Arrowhead's immediate response was to spin up the in-game lore machine and have its Super Earth Armed Forces High Command dismiss the whole thing as a "recent server outage" caused by a lost Comms Technician decomposing in a server farm somewhere. It's a typically cheeky response from the studio, but it's impossible to tell if Arrowhead really is teasing the Illuminate's imminent arrival (it certainly has form here), or if the whole incident genuinely was an unintended glitch.

<p>
Over on social media, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani has <a href="https://x.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1831310588238037302">responded to reports</a> of recent Illuminate sighting with two words: "fake news". That, of course, brings to mind the time Arrowhead chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-infested-with-winged-bugs-and-its-up-to-us-to-squash-them">dismissed players</a> who'd claimed to have seen flying Terminids in-game as nothing but "bug sympathesers", insisting "bugs can't fly" - shortly before their arrival was made official.
</p>
<p>
Hints the Illuminate will soon be making a proper Helldivers 2 debut comes as Arrowhead continues to grapple with the fallout from August's major <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-announced-with-higher-difficulty-new-bugs-and-more">Escalation of Freedom update</a>. Players were particularly unhappy with some of the changes made as part of the patch, resulting in Arrowhead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-studio-reveals-60-day-plan-of-action-following-recent-patch-outcry">committing to a 60-day plan</a> that would see it addressing "fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/complete-mission-list-space-marine-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>There’s some concern surrounding the campaign length in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. On average, it will take approximately eight to ten hours to finish the story mode, which isn’t too long. However, much of the game’s lifespan revolves around its PvE mode, Operations, and its PvP mode, Eternal War. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-main-missions-in-space-marine-2">All Main Missions in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>Most players will likely start their time in Space Marine 2 by playing through the campaign. It’s an excellent introduction to the game’s core mechanics, characters, and the various worlds you’ll explore in the PvE and PvP game modes. Again, the story mode includes full co-op and will take around ten hours to finish. It features six missions, all of which are further broken up into various chapters and segments. Each mission will take quite a bit of time to play through; praise be to checkpoints.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Skyfire</strong></li>



<li><strong>Severance</strong></li>



<li><strong>Machinus Divinitus</strong></li>



<li><strong>Servant of the Machine</strong></li>



<li><strong>Voidsong</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dawn’s Descent</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Trust me when I say you want to complete the story mode, especially the chapters on Demerium. It offers some of the most memorable moments in gaming!</p>



<p>Furthermore, you can replay the story, should you wish to relive the epic moments of the campaign as Titus. Once you finish the game, you’ll start on the Battle Barge, where you can interact with the terminal by the dropship to change game modes and choose missions. From here, you can select any of the game’s campaign missions and play through them again.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-operations-in-space-marine-2">All Operations in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>You can tackle the game’s Operations, which are cooperative PvE missions, at any point during the campaign. They’re side stories that take place simultaneously alongside Titus’ storyline. Your objectives directly support the campaign’s actions. In total, there are six Operations:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Inferno</strong></li>



<li><strong>Decapitation</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vox Liberatis</strong></li>



<li><strong>Reliquary</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fall of Atreus</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ballistic Engine</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The Operations were designed for replayability. While the map layout and objectives remain mostly the same, it’s still fun to run through the hordes of enemies repeatedly for rewards, such as cosmetics, weapons, and armor pieces.</p>



<hr>



<p>I know many people are upset about the number of missions in the game, especially the Operations, but Saber Interactive has more coming, as per its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year one roadmap</a>!</p>

Where the circle layout usually only shows two factions – the Automatons and Terminids – and their progress as represented by red and orange colors, some were beginning to spot a third, purple color, gaining ground. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1f8qlkb/so_this_just_popped_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Helldiver343</u></a> was one of the first to share their findings and posted a screenshot of the updated map before the changes “vanished.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/17/helldivers2-blogroll-1694726613946-1708210207931.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Hellidvers 2 players think the Illuminate are on the horizon.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The image suggests that a third enemy, likely the Illuminate, will soon rear its head, but many were quick to write it off as a glitch, mistake, or even fake. Players then grew more suspicious when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1f8ql19/illuminate_on_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>additional reports of purple map progress</u></a> started to show up. Developer Arrowhead Studios had been silent about the strange sightings, adding to the confusion. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1f8qlkb/comment/llg8h2h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MoonlitSaiyan</u></a> said that they “didn’t know what to believe” before an in-game message suggested that Arrowhead was already very aware of player concerns.</p><p>“Some Helldivers may have noticed a recent service outage in the Major Order Communication Display,” the message says. “The issue has since been resolved.”</p><p>Arrowhead continues, explaining that a Comms Technician got trapped in a server room and died due to “exposure,” resulting in “organic tissue degradation on electronic equipment.” Of course, the technician's family has already been fined for damages, too.</p><p>It’s gross and par for the course for Helldivers 2 in a few ways. Arrowhead has been known to mislead players in the name of liberty in the past, with one past example seeing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-just-quietly-added-flying-bugs-ceo-insists-bugs-cant-fly">the team deny the existence of flying Terminids</a> despite numerous first-hand reports that the bug faction had managed to mutate. Arrowhead eventually admitted that flying creatures had indeed started to sprout from the ground, so don’t be surprised if the Illuminate finally makes their grand entrance in the near future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The alien group has existed since the days of the original Helldivers but was thought to be extinct by the time the events of Helldivers 2 began. However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-helldivers-2-players-are-convinced-the-illuminate-are-coming"><u>fans began to guess that they may soon return</u></a> shortly after launch thanks to the appearance of mysterious blue lasers in the sky. New models for the Illuminate have also <a href="https://x.com/HelldiversAlert/status/1766878355633164706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>leaked in the past</u></a>, so despite <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1768765861463035956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Arrowhead insisting that there is nothing to worry about</u></a>, all evidence has pointed to an eventual Illuminate takeover.

<p><em>Minecraft</em> is among the most successful and influential games of the early 21st century, winning many awards and selling over 300 million copies (so far) since its 2011 release. So it was only a matter of time before Hollywood gave us a feature film based on the 3D sandbox game, simply titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Minecraft_Movie"><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></a>. Sure, one might have reservations about yet another video game-based movie, but on the plus side, we've got Jason Momoa and Jack Black co-starring. And the first teaser is full of eye-popping candy-colored cubic visuals and sly references to the game that should please fans.</p>
<p>Within a year of <em>Minecraft</em>'s initial release, Mojang Studios was fielding offers from Hollywood producers about making a TV series based on the game, but the company wanted to wait for "the right idea." There was a 2014 attempt to crowd-source a fan film, but game creator Markus "Notch" Persson didn't agree to license that effort since he was already negotiating with Warner Bros. about developing a film based on the game. Thus began a long, convoluted process of directors and writers being hired and leaving the project for various reasons.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>When the dust finally settled, Jared Hess (who worked with Black on <em>Nacho Libre</em>) ended up directing. The COVID pandemic and 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike delayed things further, but filming finally wrapped earlier this year in Auckland, New Zealand—just in time for a spring 2025 theatrical release. Per the official synopsis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Jack Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative… the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Game players will recognize Steve as one of the default characters in <em>Minecraft</em>. The teaser is set to The Beatles' "Magical Mystery Tour" and opens with our misfits encountering a fantastical Tolkien-esque landscape—only with a lot more cube-like shapes, like a pink sheep with a cubed head. &nbsp;We get the aforementioned Piglins and other creatures before Black appears and dramatically announces with great fanfare, "I.... am Steve." Honestly, we'll probably watch it just for Black's performance alone.</p>
<p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> hits theaters in April 2025.</p>

However not long after publishing the post, Martin deleted it entirely. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195281" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="684" data-playlist="195281,195618,197209" data-current="195281"><div><p>11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20744.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Based on the post, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://archive.is/CaMRZ#selection-233.0-240.0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://archive.is/CaMRZ#selection-233.0-240.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which you can read in archived form here</a></span>, Martin took serious issue with the way <em>House of the Dragon</em> showrunners changed a moment known amongst fans of <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>as “Blood and Cheese.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/house-dragon-recap-season-2-episode-1-blood-and-cheese-1851560238&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/house-dragon-recap-season-2-episode-1-blood-and-cheese-1851560238">In the show</a></span>, Queen Helaena is accosted in the castle by two intruders, who demand she point out which of her two young children is a boy, ostensibly so they can murder the heir to the Iron Throne. She shakily offers them her necklace, but when they persist, she points to Jaehaerys, her son, who the intruder swiftly murders.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-dunk-and-egg-spinoff-1851613395&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-dunk-and-egg-spinoff-1851613395">We Got Our First Look At The Next <em>Game Of Thrones</em> Show</a></span></p><p>In the novel,  Helaena actually has three children,  Jaehaerys, Jaehaera, and Maelor (Maelor is not in the show, though Martin claims in the now-deleted blog post that he was told he’d be in the third season). When Blood and Cheese (as they’re known in the novel) break in, Helaena first offers up her own life, then reluctantly points out Maelor, who is the youngest, for the murderers to slay. But the intruders realize that she’s avoiding pointing out Jaehaerys, next in line for the throne, and kill him anyway, with Cheese whispering to Maelor that his mother chose him to die before leaving the castle. </p><p>Martin claims he argued with showrunner Ryan Condal about the change, but not for long “or with much heat,” saying that Condal gave him enough reassurances that he could accept the change. “[He] had what seemed to be practical reasons for it; they did not want to deal with casting another child, especially a two-year old toddler,” Martin wrote. “Kids that young will inevitably slow down production, and there would be budget implications. Budget was already an issue on <em>House of the Dragon</em>, it made sense to save money wherever we could. Moreover, Ryan assured me that we were not losing Prince Maelor, simply postponing him.  Queen Helaena could still give birth to him in season three, presumably after getting with child late in season two.  That made sense to me, so I withdrew my objections and acquiesced to the change.”<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2a8a54a39f4840c857864ae4fa80ba88" data-recommend-id="image://2a8a54a39f4840c857864ae4fa80ba88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Blood and Cheese stand in the castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Blood and Cheese stand in the castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a8a54a39f4840c857864ae4fa80ba88" data-recommend-id="image://2a8a54a39f4840c857864ae4fa80ba88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Blood and Cheese stand in the castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though Martin ultimately “still [loved]” the episode despite the changes, he has a much bigger issue with the alleged removal of Maelor outright, writing, “Sometime between the initial decision to remove Maelor, a big change was made.  The prince’s birth was no longer just going to be pushed back to season 3. He was never going to be born at all.  The younger son of Aegon and Helaena would never appear.”</p><p>He then references the “Butterfly Effect,” the philosophical notion that a very small thing, as small as the flap of a butterfly’s wings, can, across time, have major implications on things seemingly unrelated. Martin then warns readers of spoilers, writing that “If you have never read <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>maybe it does not matter, because all I am going to ‘spoil’  here are things that happen in the book that may NEVER happen on the series.” <strong>I’ll give you a spoiler warning of my own, as there’s major story beats in the novel coming now.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Helaena commits suicide not long after the death of Prince Maelor. Since she is beloved by the smallfolk, when rumors spread that it was Queen Rhaenyra who killed her (as Rhaenyra has taken over King’s Landing at this point), rather than Helaena jumping out of a window of the Red Keep, the people of King’s Landing flood the streets, demanding justice for the beloved ruler. “It is the beginning of the end for Rhaenyra’s rule over the city, ultimately leading to the Storming of the Dragonpit and the rise of the Shepherd’s mob that drives Rhaenyra to flee the city and return to Dragonstone… and her death,” Martin writes. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-finale-questions-answers-1851613595&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-finale-questions-answers-1851613595">Your <em>House Of The Dragon</em> Season 2 Finale Questions, Answered</a></span></p><p>He continues, writing, “Maelor by himself means little. He is a small child, does not have a line of dialogue, does nothing of consequence but die…but where and when and how, that <em>does</em> matter. Losing Maelor weakened the end of the Blood and Cheese sequence...it undercut the motivation for Helaena’s suicide, and that in turn sent thousands into the streets and alleys, screaming for justice for their ‘murdered’ queen. None of that is essential, I suppose… but all of it does serve a purpose, it all helps to tie the story lines together, so one thing follows another in a logical and convincing manner.”</p><p>Martin then ominously ends his post with a warning that there are “larger and more toxic butterflies to come if <em>House of the Dragon</em> goes ahead with some of the change being contemplated for seasons 3 and 4...”</p><p>I find it funny that Martin never got this publicly bitchy about the ending of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, which didn’t just deviate from his source material but created new storylines entirely, as he hasn’t yet finished the mainline novels. And I find it even funnier that he posted such a scathing takedown of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-book-season-2-adaptation-finale-1851607960&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-book-season-2-adaptation-finale-1851607960">a series I believe is doing adaptation the right way</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been more than four months since Gray Zone Warfare was released to a positive reception by MADFINGER Games. It’s a landmark tactical FPS with an enormous, immersive world, extraction shooter-like mechanics, and a stacked pipeline that promises to help the game evolve in an epic fashion.</p>



<p>At Gamescom, I was fortunate to sit down with Marek Rabas, MADFINGER’s CEO, to talk about the game his team have built, the future of the title, and most importantly, the state of play for tactical and extraction shooters.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-they-need-a-bigger-market">‘They Need a Bigger Market’</h2>



<p>It’s no big secret that extraction shooters have been coming up in recent years. We’ve seen many titles come and go, and even titans like Activision have taken a stab at producing a game (or a bolt-on mode) that jimmies itself into the genre. </p>



<p>It’s fast becoming overdone, and developers like MADFINGER are trying to alter the paradigm to produce something <strong>close</strong> but at the same time unique. That’s why Gray Zone Warfare has such a refreshing palette and promise – and why it’s leaning more into being a <strong>tactical FPS </strong>than a strict extraction shooter.</p>



<p>As we spoke, I asked Marek Rabas what he thought about the growing popularity of extraction shooters and the potential oversaturation of the titles making it to the market:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There are a <strong>lot </strong>of new extraction shooters. People noticed the success of Tarkov, even the big guys – that’s why they made DMZ – but the big guys don’t have the balls to do it exactly like Tarkov. They need a bigger market, so they can’t do that. They don’t get the <strong>essence </strong>of Tarkov.</p>



<p>There are a lot of indies, including us, who saw the potential in <strong>tactical shooters</strong>. Big companies, they started to just make battle royales, and they killed the big brands. Even Call of Duty, Ghost Recon, all these titles, they’ve just killed it a bit.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a fair point. Many modern developers piecing together new extraction shooters are trying to make them more ‘arcadey’ and globally accessible, going so far as to introduce paid features that make the game a little easier.</p>



<p>Rabas insisted that people looking for something more challenging and genuinely strategic <em>‘don’t have anything else to play except Tarkov or Arma or Squad’</em>. But there are limitations to these games, such as a steep learning curve, elements that ‘put off’ the average player, or frustrations like ‘needing to have a second monitor’.</p>



<p>That’s certainly true for Escape from Tarkov – if you’re not playing with maps, market trackers, guides, or ballistics charts on a second monitor, you’re far too pro at the game.</p>



<p>Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel in the extraction shooter market, some developers – like MADFINGER – have opted to feed those hungry for a <strong>tactical shooter</strong> – and it has already proven to be successful.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-try-to-be-different">‘You Try To Be Different’</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>More extraction shooters will inevitably surface, of course. </p>



<p>On the horizon, you’ve got titles like Beautiful Light, Exoborne, Marathon, Delta Force, and whatever ARC Raiders turns out to be. In recent weeks, Arena Breakout Infinite was released, as was Level Zero: Extraction.</p>



<p>That’s a sentiment that Rabas echoed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There will be more extraction shooters coming. Tencent is not stupid, that’s why they created Arena (Breakout Infinite). If the guys abandon them, new games will come and fill the space, and you (need to) try to be different.</p>



<p><em>(Speaking about Gray Zone Warfare)</em> This is why we chose it to be session-based and not match-based. This is more experience-based than competition-based, you know? And we chose the jungle because everyone is doing Western or Eastern urban and forests.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many will claim that Gray Zone Warfare is an extraction shooter by nature, but few have linked it to Escape from Tarkov. From the setting to the core military mechanics and from the unique gameplay loop to the mysterious backstory sitting at the heart of the map, there’s a lot to set GZW apart from Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>In my opinion, GZW walks a blissful line between various genres. It’s an extraction shooter that’s not punishing, and it’s a tactical shooter that’s not intense or overly complex. It’s a milsim title that’s light on the sim, and it’s a survival game that eases you into the concept.</p>



<p>Plenty is in the pipeline for Gray Zone Warfare – keep an eye on Insider Gaming to catch all the latest news for this game.</p>

            <p>
Flaming Fowl Studios - the developer that announced then shelved a game on the same day back in April amid financial difficulties - has unveiled its latest project, a comedic sci-fi auto battler called Konfronto that's due to release on PC later this year.
</p>
<p>
Flaming Fowl, which was founded in 2016 by former members of original Fable developer Lionhead Studios, first made a name for itself with the release of card battle <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fable-fortune">Fable Fortune</a>, but it's perhaps known for its acclaimed digital adaptation of popular board game Gloomhaven.
</p>
<p>
The studio's third release, a co-op RPG with turn-based combat called Ironmarked, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-lionhead-devs-announce-new-game-shelve-new-game-and-confirm-layoffs-all-at-the-same-time">revealed back in April</a>, but it wasn't exactly a moment for celebration. Instead, Flaming Fowl's unusual announcement came with the news the project was being shelved due to a current lack of funding in the industry, and worse, that it had been forced to lay off around 20 people at the studio. The hope was Ironmarked's announcement and accompanying demo would be a way to demonstrate the team's work and help them find jobs elsewhere.

<p>
As for the nine remaining employees, Flaming Fowl said they'd be turning their attention to a small, self-funded strategy title it was intending to release before the end of the year. And five months later, we now know that game to be Konfronto.
</p>
<p>
Konfronto is described as a "sci-fi roguelike auto battler" in which players command and upgrade an intergalactic carrier. They'll need to outfit it with new spacecraft, equip it with "weird and wonderful" technologies, and hire its crew - all so they can battle it out in asynchronous multiplayer. 
</p>
<p>
"The position of cargo items can both trigger awesome combos with other cargo or combine to create entirely new technology," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2994150/Konfronto/">Konfronto's Steam page</a>. "Hundreds of unique items means, billions of combinations - and we've tested them all... honest, don’t look into it. "
</p>
<p>
There's no launch date for Konfronto beyond a vague "2024" window, but it'll be arriving as a Steam early access release when it does show up. The "fully playable" initial version is said to feature "plenty of content", but the goal is to add more ships, cargo, and crew members - alongside an improved UI and other features - as early access continues. Flaming Fowl says it expects Konfronto to remain in early access for around six months, depending on feedback.
</p>
<p>
To give interested players a taste of Konfronto's action, Flaming Fowl will be releasing a demo of the game as part of Steam NextFest in October. "NextFest is a huge opportunity for devs that are self-publishing like ourselves," creative director Mike West said in a statement accompanying Konfronto's announcement. "We really hope the community enjoys what we have made, or at the very least they pretend to enjoy it if they are streaming."

			<p>Goichi Suda, more commonly known as Suda51, and Shinji Mikami require no introductions. Over the long years of their careers, they released seminal titles that have had a lasting impact on video games and contributed to shaping the medium as we know it today. The No More Heroes series, Killer 7, the Resident Evil and Dino Crisis series, the original Devil May Cry, and Viewtiful Joe are only some of the games the two Japanese developers either created or helped make that have influenced many of the games that came after them.</p>
<p>Besides the aforementioned Killer 7, Suda 51 and Shinji Mikami collaborated on a few other games, such as Shadows of the Damned, which is coming to modern PC and consoles as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-gets-official-release-date/">Hella Remastered edition</a>. During Gamescom, I had the chance to chat with the two legendary developers not only about the upcoming remaster and the original concept for the game, which changed heavily during development, but also about the projects they would like to develop, their illustrious careers, and more. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Shadows of the Damned has become a cult classic over the years, but it is far from being the most popular game you have worked on together. Why did you decide to bring it back? Do you feel the game will be better received now?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: The original Shadows of the Damned came out in 2011 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and these days, it's pretty hard to play, even if someone wants to. Back then, the game wasn't promoted that much and didn't really get as widely known as we'd hoped. For this reason, we wanted to bring the game back for modern consoles to allow more people to experience it, whether for the first time or all over again. Also, we'd like to get as many of our Grasshopper games available as possible, and we decided to start off with Shadows of the Damned.</p>
<p><strong>Why a remaster and not, say, a remake?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: I'm not sure there's a good answer to this question. A remake would cost a lot more money to make. The original's graphics were pretty good for the time, and they held up pretty well, so there wasn't really a necessity to remake the game fully.</p>
<p><strong>Besides New Game Plus and new costumes, is there anything else that has been changed or improved? If nothing has been changed, is there anything you would have liked to change, given the chance?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: As you mentioned, there's a New Game Plus mode and new costumes, but apart from that, the game is 4K compatible to better work on modern consoles. Besides this, there isn't any other change. Shadows of the Damned was based on an idea called Kurayami, and if the game we ended up making would have been based on that idea, I would have wanted to make a full-on director's cut of that. But unfortunately, that wasn't the game that we put out, so I didn't want to make any changes. Playing the game for the time in 10 years, however, I noticed the tempo of the action really stands out for modern games' standards, as does the trip through hell, which compliments the graphics well and how everything is presented. I think that is really cool, and I might have added something to it if given the chance</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about the original concept for Shadows of the Damned, it's been known that Suda-san wasn't really happy about how the game turned out in the end. Do you think the original concept would have worked better nowadays with people having a different perception of Japanese games compared to 2011?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: As you mentioned, the perception of games has changed over the years, and nowadays, it would be easier to make. To be honest, I haven't given up on it yet. This isn't an actual guarantee, but it could be the next, next, next project I will work on.</p>
<p><strong>Now that the Shadows of the Damned series has been revived, is there a chance of a sequel with both of you involved?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: I'd rather make a Killer 7 sequel first, but realistically, if the game sells well enough, I'd like to look into making a sequel. I really love Garcia, Paula, and Fleming as characters and their dynamic, which is kind of like an adult version of Super Mario Bros. I'd really like to continue their story if there's an opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about potential future projects, is there any game or series you have worked on that you would like to give another chance with a sequel or remake?</strong></p>
<p>Shinji Mikami: God Hand 2.</p>
<p><strong>I approve of that. </strong><em>(Everyone laughs)</em></p>
<p>Suda51: I have talked frequently with the people from Spike Chunsoft, and one game that has come up several times is Michigan, a game that I released years ago. The type of game and its general vibe would go over pretty well the way video games are these days, and it's something I'd like to revisit again at some point.</p>
<p><strong>You have collaborated on multiple projects. What did you learn from each other, and have you applied these lessons to other projects?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: Up until we made Killer 7 together, me and Grasshopper mainly developed adventure games. Killer 7, on the other hand, was an action game, and I learned a lot from Mikami-san on how to make such a game, decide on a direction, and solve typical action game issues. That experience was basically my textbook about how to make an action game.</p>
<p>Shinji Mikami: Working together with Suda51 was a lot of fun, but there wasn't anything to learn from him. I really love the scenarios and stories he writes, but it's not the sort of thing that you can learn from or copy, even if I had wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>Are you open to collaborating again on a future project?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: If it was somehow possible to do, I'd love to develop a Killer 7 sequel with Mikami-san.</p>
<p><strong>Now that you have mentioned it again, I really have to ask. Is a Killer 7 sequel happening?</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: We have talked about it with a few different media outlets before. The only thing preventing a Killer 7 sequel from happening is the IP. If we somehow got the rights to that...<br>
Realistically, I am a bit scared of going back to the series again. When we made the original, I poured time, energy, and passion into it like never before, directing everything and making sure every little thing was just right. The work was very draining, and I'm not sure I could do that again.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about the original Killer 7, a lot of content was cut from the game. So, maybe some sort of complete edition would be an easier way to revisit the series.</strong></p>
<p>Suda51: A complete edition is something I could do, and I wouldn't have to drain myself so much to put it out.</p>
<p><strong>You both had very long careers. One word to define them, and another to define your collaborations.</strong></p>
<p>Shinji Mikami: It's kind of hard to find a single word to define my career. "Completely putting myself into everything" is a good definition. Regarding my collaborations with Suda-san, a good definition would be "enjoying new things."</p>
<p>Suda51: As Mikami-san said, it is difficult to find a single word to define my career and our collaborations. If I had to find a word, I'd say "Instinct."</p>
<p>Regarding my collaboration with Mikami-san, it felt like going to school. Back in the day, we'd get together for an hour or two, and for the first twenty or so minutes, we would discuss actual game development. For the remainder of the time, we would talk about non-gaming-related stuff, and I not only had fun but also learned a lot from these talks.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/chemistry-set-card-game-brings-scientific-joy-courtesy-of-former-zachtronics<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new game studio is making its tabletop debut. But this studio aren't completely new to interactive entertainment. They are former indie videogame developers known for scientific puzzle games. Their first project is on-brand: a card game simply called <em>Chemistry Set</em>.</p>
<h2>The Chemistry Set Card Game Announcement</h2>
<p>The announcement of the <em>Chemistry Set</em> card game came via media post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/coincidence.games/post/3l2dhx32skk23">on Blue Sky</a>. The post describes the game itself: a two-player competitive experience about building molecules out of atoms.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chemistry-set-card-game-bluesky-announcement.jpg?itok=YJ-vk4vn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chemistry-set-card-game-bluesky-announcement.jpg?itok=756CTJht 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Developer Coincidence Games' web page contains additional information about the game and studio. First, it specifies that <em>Chemistry Set</em> is not an educational experience. You don't need any knowledge of chemistry whatsoever to enjoy this card game.</p>
<p>As for the developers, they are all former devs of Zachtronics LLC, an indie videogame developer. The founder, Zach Barth, is the lead designer on <em>Chemistry Set</em>.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it makes sense that Coincidence Games' first title revolves around science-based puzzle solving.</p>
<p>Zachtronics' body of work includes 2011's <em>SpaceChem</em>, a game about synthesizing chemicals in a reactor, the 2015 sandbox game <em>Infinifactory</em>&nbsp; the 2017 industrial engine-building game <em>Opus Magnum</em>, and retro-tech puzzle anthology game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zachtronics-announces-its-final-game-last-call-bbs" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Last Call BBS</em></a>.</p>

<p>When you first dive into a horde shooter, you want that overwhelming feeling of power. You play on one of the lowest difficulty settings to crush every foe in your path. But as you learn the maps and mechanics, you find brushing off enemies easy, and you want more of a challenge. That’s when you ramp up the difficulty. To help you decide where to start, here’s a look at the campaign difficulty modes in Space Marine 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-difficulty-modes-in-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2">All Difficulty Modes in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 includes four campaign difficulty modes: Easy, Normal, Veteran, and Angel of Death. Saber Interactive is planning a fifth, more challenging difficulty level for some time during year one, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per its roadmap</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a simple, straightforward experience, I recommend starting on Easy. It’s a fantastic time, and you genuinely feel powerful. But if you want a slight challenge while still feeling like an Ultramarine, Normal is an excellent starting point. That said, the game does recommend Veteran. I don’t. Especially for new players, it’s a bit much to handle at first.</p>



<h3 id="h-easy-mode">Easy Mode</h3>

<ul>
<li>Balanced for a better story experience</li>



<li>Enemies are less aggressive</li>



<li>Health and Armour are greatly increased</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-normal-mode">Normal Mode</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Presents a fair gameplay challenge</li>



<li>Enemies are moderately aggressive</li>



<li>Resources need to be managed wisely</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-veteran-mode">Veteran Mode</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Set up as the intended experience</li>



<li>Enemies are dangerous</li>



<li>Tactical and skillful play is rewarded</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-angel-of-death-mode">Angel of Death Mode</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>Introduces serious challenge</li>



<li>Enemies are tougher and more aggressive</li>



<li>Recovery after mistakes is much harder</li>
</ul>



<p>All of the game’s difficulty modes alter the amount of armour you start with, making recovering from combat encounters either a breeze or an absolute hair-pulling experience. In time, as you learn the game’s dodge and parry mechanics, however, you will find that increasing the difficulty to Veteran or Angel of Death becomes a must!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-change-difficulty-modes-in-space-marine-2">How to Change Difficulty Modes in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>When you start a new game in Space Marine 2, you can select the game’s difficulty before stepping into Titus’ boots. But once you’re on the Battlebarge, you can still increase or lower the campaign difficulty. </p>



<p>Walk up to the terminal near the dropship, right to the left-hand side on top of the staircase leading to the launch platform. Here, you can interact with the terminal to select any one of the difficulty levels. You can also swap between Campaign, Operations, and Eternal War (PvP) at this very same terminal!</p>

<p>Bloober Team wants to bring you back to the 90s. When the Silent Hill 2 remake launches in October, the developers are giving players a way to increase the overall immersion of the game.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/BlooberTeam/status/1831331608302907651">social media</a> on Wednesday, the developers announced that players will have the option to turn off all UI elements within the game. In addition to that, they have created a “90s filter” for players to add on to it.</p>



<p>“We’ve also created a “90s filter” with grain effect, color correction and screen adjustments to complete the old-school experience,” Bloober Team said while showing off an example.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the original Silent Hill 2 launched in 2001, the first game in the series launched in 1999 and was developed in the late 90s. So, adding a 90s filter to the game isn’t all that ridiculous.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 launches on October 8 for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

Black Ops 6 features the most advanced movement of any boots-on-the-ground Call of Duty, with fast and fluid omnidirectional movement.</p><p dir="ltr">Tactical layout is recommended for those using a standard controller, as it maps your crouch/slide/dive button to the thumbstick, so you can be quick without ever needing to move your thumb. If you have something like a Scuf or another controller that lets you remap your buttons, you can just leave this on its default setting.</p><p dir="ltr">Trigger Effect is something you definitely want to turn off for PS5. The immersion might feel cool, but for more precise aiming, you want to have this effect turned off.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deadzone">Deadzone</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362006-deadzones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362006" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362006-deadzones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362006"></a><figcaption>BO6 dead zone setting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362006-deadzones.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Deadzone Inputs:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Left Stick Min: 0.3</li><li dir="ltr">Left Stick Max: 0.99</li><li dir="ltr">Right Stick Min: 0.3</li><li dir="ltr">Right Stick Max: 0.99</li><li dir="ltr">L2 Button: 0.0</li><li dir="ltr">R2 Button: 0.0</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Stick drift varies for each player's controller.

This test will give you numbers on the bottom of the left and right stick images. Whatever numbers it gives you, you want to adjust the minimum stick drift number for that specific stick to go at least one number higher than the number you're given.</p><p dir="ltr">For example: If your left stick test shows a 3 and the right stick shows a 2, you want to adjust the minimum drift for the left stick to a 4 and the right stick to a 3. Then test again to make sure you don't have any more drift.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, you'll want L2/R2 set to 0.0 to make sure you're getting instant activation.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Aiming">Aiming</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Sensitivity Multiplier:  <ul><li dir="ltr">Ground vehicle sensitivity: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">Air scorestreak sensitivity multiplier: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">Tablet sensitivity: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Sens.

You might want to keep the sprint assist setting off to play a bit slower and more tactical, but for me, I found that it gave me much more fluid movement, and it required fewer button inputs to get sprinting into action and make use of the omnidirectional movement. As an added bonus, it makes for less wear on your hands and your thumbsticks as well.</p><p dir="ltr">You might even like the mantle assistance on, but for me personally, I found I was often mantling at awkward times when I would prefer to just stand behind the cover. This setting will definitely keep you moving, but it seems like it is more likely to put you at a disadvantage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Movement_behaviors">Movement behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Automatic airborne mantle: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Slide/Dive behavior: Tap to slide</li><li dir="ltr">Auto door peek: Off</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Advanced_movement_behaviors">Advanced movement behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Sprint/Tactical sprint behavior: Toggle</li><li dir="ltr">Auto move forward: Single tap</li><li dir="ltr">Sprint restore: On</li><li dir="ltr">Slide maintains sprint: On</li><li dir="ltr">Tactical sprint behavior: Single tap sprint</li><li dir="ltr">Plunging underwater: Trigger</li><li dir="ltr">Sprinting door bash: On</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Vehicle_behaviors">Vehicle behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Vehicle camera recenter: Short delay</li><li dir="ltr">Camera initial position: Free look</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Combat_behaviors">Combat behaviors</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362008-combatbehaviors.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362008" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362008-combatbehaviors.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362008"></a><figcaption>Combat behavior settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362008-combatbehaviors.jpg"></figure><ul><li dir="ltr">Aim down sight behavior: Hold</li><li dir="ltr">Weapon mount activation: ADS + melee</li><li dir="ltr">Quick C4 detonation: Grouped</li><li dir="ltr">Equipment behavior: Hold</li><li dir="ltr">Manual fire behavior: Press</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Advanced_combat_behaviors">Advanced combat behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Change up directional behavior: Ping</li><li dir="ltr">Change zoom activation: Sprint/Tactical Sprint/Focus</li><li dir="ltr">Weapon mount exit: Short Delay</li><li dir="ltr">Interact/reload behavior: Prioritize reload</li><li dir="ltr">Sprint cancels reload: Off</li><li dir="ltr">ADS stick swap: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Depleted ammo weapon switch: On</li><li dir="ltr">Scorestreak reordering: Numerical order</li><li dir="ltr">Dedicated melee weapon behavior: Hold melee</li><li dir="ltr">Swap body shield and execution behavior: Off</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Overlay_behaviors">Overlay behaviors</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Ping wheel delay: Moderate</li><li dir="ltr">Double tap ping wheel delay: Moderate</li><li dir="ltr">Wheels behavior: Hold</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_graphics_settings_for_console">Best graphics settings for console</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Display">Display</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">120 HZ refresh rate (If applicable): On</li><li dir="ltr">Safe area: Adjust to your specific monitor/TV</li></ul><ul><li dir="ltr">Eco mode preset: Efficiency</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Post_processing_effects">Post processing effects</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362010-postprocessingeffects.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362010" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362010-postprocessingeffects.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4362010"></a><figcaption>Post processing effects</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4362010-postprocessingeffects.jpg"></figure><ul><li dir="ltr">World motion blur: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Weapon motion blur: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Depth of Field: Off</li><li dir="ltr">FIDELITYFZ CAS: On</li><li dir="ltr">FIDELITYFZ CAS Strength: Choose somewhere between 50 - 80</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="View">View</h3><p dir="ltr">Accessibility solutions:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Motion reduction: On/off is personal preference</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For the motion reduction setting, I personally use this because I'm sensitive to motion sickness.

			<p>The new season of <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-road-trip-fortnite-rocket-league/">Rocket League</a> went live today, and ancient folklore is present in the game. Players will get to explore a brand-new arena called Drift Woods. As you are competing against other players, you may find yourself sighting the Chupacabra or even an appearance of Mothman.</p>
<p>Season 16 will give you access to new cars such as the BMW 1 Series, which you can unlock automatically by purchasing the Rocket League Season 16 Rocket Pass Premium. This will give you access to the BMW 1 Series RLE Car Body, the Chupacabra Topper, Sasquatch Print Wheels, and a Mothman Decal as you scale up the Season 16 Rocket Pass Premium tiers.</p>
<p>You can also obtain a Mothman Antenna, Darker Disc Wheels and a Ghoulpost Antenna, if you want to get into the Halloween spirit ahead of time. There are over 70 Tiers to unlock across the Free and Premium tracks, meaning those who aren't purchasing the Premium pass will still get some cool rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rocket League Season 16 - Urban Legends Emerge from the Arena’s Darkest Depths" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W0qrGEG4pog?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As well as the cosmetic rewards, players can expect to hear some new music on the Rocket League Radio, with a new song to represent Season 16 titled "Lie." This song has been produced by Mr. Bill &amp; Culprate and will be available on the Rocket League Radio. It will appear in the Featured Shop as a Player Anthem.</p>
<p>One important note that was added to the blog post announcing Season 16 of Rocket League is that the BMW 1 Series and BMW 1 Series RLE car bodies both use the Octane hitboxes, meaning that these car bodies will be eligible for cross-game ownership between Rocket League and Fortnite.</p>
<p>The post-demolition camera is one of the most important features added to Rocket League season 16. It's a more seamless transition with improved tracking that shows precisely where you are in the arena and where you will respawn afterward. The latest season of Rocket League has already started and will continue until December 4, 2024.</p>
<p>During this season, players will also see and participate in the available Competitive Tournaments for both Soccar and Heatseeker, depending on your preferred game mode. There are 32 teams in total, and to accommodate players in South Africa, players can participate in weekend tournaments.</p>
<p>You will be rewarded for your efforts if you successfully climb up the ranks during the Competitive Tournament. This includes rewards such as the Bateye Topper, the Gnaw'd Wheels, and the Rocketmancer Goal Explosion.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/rocket-league-season-16-urban-legends-emerge-from-the-arenas-darkest-depths" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on the official Rocket League website explains the Competitive Tournament schedule slots in more detail so those who want to compete can find out when they can expect to be online and available to play Rocket League.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> is a Bandai Namco-developed anime MMO which released in Japan last year, and was meant to arrive in the west at some point this year courtesy of Amazon Games. Alas, that's no longer the case - and the game is also shutting down in Japan early next year.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, Bandai Namco Online announced that they have made the difficult decision to end service on Blue Protocol. They will shut down their Japanese Blue Protocol servers in January 2025, and have ended plans to release the game in the West in collaboration with Amazon Games," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139230/view/4244166473681846926">the announcement from last week</a>.
</p>
<p>The Japanese servers will be shut down on January 18th, 2025. As of today, the game has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139230/BLUE_PROTOCOL/">delisted from Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Outwardly, Blue Protocol seemed to be following closely in the footsteps of Genshin Impact, with a world of blue skies, green grass, and Breath Of The Wild-style enemies to bash through action-RPG combat. Ed wasn't sure there was anything more to it beyond that when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blue-protocol-seems-like-a-slick-anime-mmo-if-an-extremely-predictable-one">he had a chance to play it last year</a>, calling it predictable, describing its world as "eh", and fretting over the inevitable microtransactions.
</p>
<p>Still, it's a shame we won't get a chance at a proper play of it - and even more so that it's shutting down for those players who were already invested. Bandai Namco say that they're not offering refunds for players who already spent real money on in-game Rose Orbs currency, but they'll be handing out 5000 free Rose Orbs every month between now and January for players to spend on in-game cosmetics. That sucks.
</p>
<p>There's apparently still some new contnet to come to the Japanese version of the game before it closes down, and its developers have <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/506">put together a schedule for the remaining months here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
