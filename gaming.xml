		<p>Motion Twin have experienced the highs and lows of game development. An early star of the social-media web-based gaming movement, when the market started to dissolve things were looking bleak until they settled on making a huge creative pivot to create something niche and something hardcore. The result was the runaway indie success, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/06/dead-cells-review/">Dead Cells</a>. Following that up is never going to be an easy task, but with Windblown they’ve retained many of the lessons learned along the way, and though they’ve created a new, undeniably cuter, roguelike IP, it’s still got plenty of that Dead Cells bite to take the unwary by surprise.</p>
<p><iframe title="Windblown First 15 minutes of Single Player" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hBLnaZbEIk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before you can do anything in Windblown, you have to choose a body. This is a purely aesthetic choice, so you won’t have to question too hard whether to be an Axolotl or a Pangolin, and once you’ve completed your first run you can swap into any of the other bodies. If you played the demo you also get access to a Guinea Pig, which is, presumably, the most correct choice.</p>


<p>You immediately awaken in the fantastical isometric land that Motion Twin has created, impossible islands hovering in the sky, while rivers drop off into nothingness. The characters boast bold, comic-book lines, but the world itself is more grounded. Well, as much as a bunch of floating islands can be grounded.</p>


<p>Dashing here is both traversal and evasion. You hit the button to transition from island to island, as well as to jump between different areas above and below, while you must utilise it in combat to get out of the way of the increasingly aggressive and swift enemies you encounter along the way.</p>
<p>You immediately feel the vein of Dead Cells running through Windblown, emphasising movement and timing as much as any of the myriad Souls games that are out there. It’s certainly fast, and leaping from island to island and in and out of combat feels gloriously smooth.</p>
<p>Windblown is a roguelike, so you make repeated runs into the Vortex, collecting Cogs and upgrading your abilities as you go. You can choose Gifts at various points, finding friendly memories – seemingly the remnants of fallen heroes – that are willing to bestow new skills upon you. They fall into different categories, but each will give you a new edge in combat, whether that’s ignoring the first hit in each Biome or randomly marking a nearby foe with automatic lightning damage. You can have three Gifts active at any one time, and there’s liable to be plenty of tinkering to find your ideal loadout.</p>

<p>You can also switch between different weapons, grabbing new and more powerful variants as you progress. Much like Gifts, each of these also boasts additional effects or skills, making them increasingly lethal in the right hands. While you start out with a Fish Knife – a standard sword by all accounts – you move onto more interesting options like Kunai and dual blades, and you can access two of these at any time. These can work synergistically too, so completing a combo with one lets you then immediately switch to the other with a special attack.</p>
<p>Alongside that, there’s Trinkets to be found which give you additional skills, with the first one I encountered giving you an explosive Goo blast that damages and slows enemies. Soon enough, you feel incredibly powerful, and during our hands-on Windblown really dispensed these with speed. I really enjoyed the different choices you were given too, and I’m definitely going to spend some time exploring them.</p>
<p>The only thing that didn’t quite fit right for me was the tone at the outset. The soundtrack in the opening area of Golem Gates is very mellow, with slow, drawn-out synthwave echoing across the floating islands. It’s an odd counterpoint to the kinetic combat, particularly at the beginning of the game, but as you advance the soundtrack really picks up, with funky beats feeling more at home with the speed that Windblown wants you to operate at.</p>

<p>When you die – which you definitely will – you’re transported back to the Ark, Windblown’s main hub, where Eperin will fill you in on how it is that you’re able to be brought back to life so succinctly. It’s from here that you can unlock new boons, making the start of each run that little bit easier, as well as joining up with other players.</p>
<p>One of Windblown’s key elements is the ability to play in co-op with up to three other players, and from the Ark you can create your own lobby, or hop into any of those that are available with space. We weren’t able to check this element out during our preview, but it feels like Windblown will be a lot of chaotic fun with a few friends, and I can see speedruns being particularly popular. I hope there’ll be a time-trial mode or racing events, as Windblown feels utterly perfect for that.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun with Windblown. Its fast combat, cute art style and swiftly expanding range of upgrades are certain to find their way into player’s hearts – you should definitely add this one to your wishlist.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-ticket-sales-disrupted-bots/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games has just announced a postponement of ticket sales for the Worlds Final in London, England. In a post on social media, the team revealed that ‘significant bot activity’ is impacting the pre-sales of tickets for the League of Legends World Championship final, which is set to be held at the O2 Arena on November 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nothing-is-sacred">Nothing is Sacred</h2>



<p>The League of Legends World Championship tournament is arguably the biggest esports event in the yearly calendar, pulling in tens of millions of viewers around the world. It holds the record for the most-viewed tournament in history, and it boasts a prize pool worth a staggering $2.25 million. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, that level of popularity means that scalpers are using bots to mass purchase tickets for the grand final event, due to take place at the O2 Arena in London on November 2. Following the disruption caused by bots, Riot Games has opted to postpone a round of pre-sales to resolve the issue:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After discovering significant bot activity impacting our pre-sales over the last 48 hours, we’ve taken the difficult but necessary decision to temporarily postpone the final round of ticket sales for the Worlds Final.</p>



<p>We’re working to resolve the issue and will update you as soon as we can. We’re also identifying tickets purchased by bots so we can get them back into the hands of actual fans.</p>



<p>Fans who have already purchased tickets for the Worlds Final legitimately are unaffected. However, if you believe your purchase has been impacted, please contact AXS customer service so they can assist in troubleshooting your issue.</p>



<p>Thanks fo your patience as work through this — our goal is to ensure a fair and smooth ticketing process for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With each successive year, the League of Legends World Championship becomes more ambitious. This year’s event is proving to be no different, and there is less than a month until the trophy is lifted by one of the best League teams on Earth.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-increasing-salaries/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fromsoftware-increasing-base-salaries-by-11-8-and-offering-more-to-new-graduates.1000425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-increasing-salaries/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The last couple of years have been pretty tough on the gaming industry, so good news pieces like this are always appreciated. Per a recent <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20241004_wageincrease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>, it has been revealed that FromSoftware, the developer behind games like Elden Ring, Bloodborne, and Sekiro, is boosting basic salaries for enrolled employees by approximately 11.8%.</p>



<p>Not only that but the firm is also gracing new graduates entering the business with higher monthly salaries, offering an increase from 260,000 yen to 300,000 yen ($1,776 to $2,049).</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-rewarding-work-environment">‘A Rewarding Work Environment’</h2>



<p>In the wake of so many studio closures and layoffs, it’s nice to see that FromSoftware is flourishing, recognising the need to reward workers and foster a positive working environment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At FromSoftware, we strive to make games that convey emotion, create value, and inspire joy. To this end, we are working towards stable income and a rewarding work environment where our employees can apply themselves to development. The increase in base and starting salaries is one implementation of this policy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was a few months back that FromSoft’s president, Hidetaka Miyazaki, spoke strongly about the waves of redundancies that have been slowly chipping away at the industry for almost two years:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Speaking to myself and this company, I want to say that this is not something I would wish on the staff at FromSoftware in a million years … While we can’t say 100%—we can’t say with complete certainty what the future’s going to hold for From and Kadokawa—at least as long as this company is my responsibility, that’s something I would not let happen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier this year, FromSoftware released Shadow of the Erdtree, the first major expansion for Elden Ring, and it became an overnight sensation. It brought hundreds of thousands of players back to the game, stormed up sales and streaming charts, and reestablished why Elden Ring is considered one of the greatest games ever made.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Entering Toluca Prison is one of the more unsettling and strange moments of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a>, and that disturbing vibe is amplified early on when you find yourself trapped in a room filled with bugs, with a keypad locking the door and barring your exit.</p><p dir="ltr">The only way to escape this room is by punching in the right code on the door's keypad, but finding the code can be difficult--especially as the place periodically fills with bugs you'll need to smash if you want to keep them from attacking you. The room represents an excellent moment in Silent Hill 2 that can make you panic as you search for clues to open the keypad, but if you're struggling to get yourself out of that room, like we did, we're here to help.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's how you solve the puzzle of the bug-room keypad, including the solution if you don't want to find it yourself. As always, if you <em>do</em> want to find it yourself, now's the time to stop reading.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What Is The Door Code For The Bug Room Keypad In Toluca Prison?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4378076-bugroomkeypad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378076" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4378076-bugroomkeypad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378076"></a><figcaption>The blood on the keypad is a clue, but maybe not in the way you expect.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4378076-bugroomkeypad.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In other, similar rooms to the bug room, like when you need the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/silent-hill-2-remake-apartment-safe-code-in-the-blackout-room/2900-5824/" data-ref-id="2900-5824">apartment 206 safe code</a> in the Wood Side Apartments, the clues to opening the door have been hidden on the walls--and that might encourage you to whip your flashlight around desperately, looking for information. Unfortunately, there's nothing to find, but the clues you need are still there.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of looking at the walls, when you've cleared out the deadly bugs, check the keypad itself. You'll see that you need a three-digit code to get out. The other pertinent detail here is that the keypad is covered in blood. Usually, the blood stains might suggest which keys you need to press.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, for this puzzle, the situation is exactly opposite. Only three keys on the pad <em>aren't</em> covered in blood, and that's your clue. You'll also see these three digits light up when the room's lights flicker every few seconds.</p><p dir="ltr">The three keys that aren't covered in blood are 2, 3, and 9, giving you all the info you need to find the code. Unfortunately, there aren't any more clues--you just have to start punching in combinations. There are only six possible combinations if you use all three numbers.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want the answer, though, <strong>the code is 923</strong>. Type it in and the door will pop open, allowing you to continue your exploration of Brookhaven.</p><p>There are many more puzzles and confusing sections in the Silent Hill 2 remake.

			<p>It's been just a few days since Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-releases-in-september/">released</a> the first Starfield expansion, Shattered Space, on PC and Xbox Series S|X. Meanwhile, Design Director Emil Pagliarulo <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/it-might-not-be-everyones-cup-of-tea-but-what-is-as-starfield-shattered-space-launches-bethesda-reflects-on-the-importance-of-players-speaking-their-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to Gamesradar</a> about the studio's sci-fi IP and its place among the Bethesda portfolio.</p>
<p><em>I think, in a lot of ways, Starfield is the hardest thing Bethesda has ever done. We pushed ourselves to make something totally different. To just jam into an Xbox the biggest, richest space simulation RPG anyone could imagine. That we pulled it off makes Starfield something of a technical marvel. It's also, in a lot of ways, the best game we've ever made. But for us, most importantly, Starfield has its own unique personality and now sits right next to Fallout and Elder Scrolls.</em></p>
<p><em>It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but what is? We created a new IP from the ground up and an experience that is absolutely unique on consoles. And I'm not saying Starfield is better or worse than any other game – just different in what we offer. It's that weird Bethesda blend of immersion, action, and RPG… but also different to Bethesda's other RPGs. Starfield is developing its own unique fanbase – it's big, and it's growing. Bethesda used to feel like the studio of Elder Scrolls. Then, it was the studio you'd associate with Elder Scrolls and Fallout. Now it's Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Starfield. Bethesda Game Studios' big three.</em></p>
<p>Pagliarulo has worked on all major titles made by Bethesda Game Studios over the past twenty-plus years: The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Fallout 3, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76. As such, he is uniquely qualified to look back at the studio's previous work, although of course fans may well disagree. Starfield featured a different brand of exploration compared to what players were used to in The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, although the Shattered Space expansion is supposed to have returned to the studio's trademark style.</p>
<p>In any case, Pagliarulo also joked that the one thing Bethesda learned from making Starfield is that its fans 'really, really, really want The Elder Scrolls 6'. It should not come as a surprise, given that Skyrim was a massive hit and the best-selling game made by the studio to date. It's already been thirteen years since its release, and will be at least sixteen before The Elder Scrolls 6 launches, although production <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-officially-in-early-development-but-you-wont-hear-any-more-about-it-for-some-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> in late 2023. Shattered Space probably isn't going to be the only Starfield expansion, though, thus requiring Bethesda to split its focus somewhat.</p>

						<h5>Silent Hill 2</h5><p><span>October 8th, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 5</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>Let's all be honest: Silent Hill 2 (the original) is one of, if not the best, horror game ever made. Indeed, it's arguably one of the best games ever made, point blank. With an outstanding story, compelling enough characters, and strong visuals (for the time), but most of all, a horror game that dripped in the atmosphere and sucked you in better than even the most adept of prostitutes.</p>
<p>To say that a remake of this, one of the very few games that has genuinely put me on edge, interested me would be an understatement. Naturally, I was, even if I was worried about it being done by Konami and Bloober Team. Konami is Konami, and Bloober Team has been struggling to recreate Silent Hill in every game, not understanding that Walking Simulators aren't great and that the story from the Character's trauma only works with a good character.</p>
<p>Still, they didn't write this story; they're working with a series and game that started it. Could they get it wrong?</p>

<p>So, let's make something clear: Bloober Team has made Silent Hill 2 their own. This isn't a one-to-one remake of the original, though it remains the town we remember—or have <a href="https://www.game-cities.com/virtual-cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read about in tourist guides</a> telling us the best places to visit; that or if you've ever visited the <a href="http://www.visitsilenthill.com/index2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill Tourism Board</a>, ready to make the trip of a lifetime. They have expanded everything while making the town and the game their own. The town is also larger, and you can now go into far more buildings, even ones not core to the story, with new areas added to the game, giving even more of a feel of exploration.</p>
<p>Exploration was always a key part of the first, despite its limited amount of "side" elements, simply due to the time it was released. Here, you can break into shops, enter several buildings once locked off, find more notes and lore about the town's inhabitants, and sometimes extra resources. However, I won't say it will always be to your benefit. I once went exploring and found three health potions and maybe six handgun bullets - I used two health potions and maybe all six of the bullets to get myself back out. Granted, the lovely notes about death, despair, and trying to escape the town were good reads.</p>
<p>You'll also find more little puzzles, for lack of a better word. Very early on, you'll find a mini-market; the front door is locked, but the side door has a keypad. There are spoilers here, but it's nothing major - You can also find a corpse with a note on it. This person tried numbers 0000 to 4014 before having to run away to safety; flip the paper over, they went back and tried 4014 to 4439. Of course, that leaves 4440 to 9999 left, and you're free to try them all; the game wants you to - you'll find the person was very close.</p>
<p>I want to say that wasn't in the original, but it has been a while since I last played it. I may be wrong. Still, things like this, an added apartment building, a music store, bars, and more, add to the feeling that Silent Hill 2 is a town that has seen better days. Much like Jaywick, the coast isn't enough to make this a visitor's hotspot, <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2024-06-04/farages-party-on-the-pier-launch-proves-a-surprise-to-seaside-attraction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not when horrors brought from the worst minds roam the streets</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Silent-Hill-2-Review-03-Notes-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, I should clarify something before I continue. Silent Hill 2 (the original) is in my top ten "best games ever" list and at the top of my best horror games ever list. I also have a lot of nostalgia for it, and I've already started this review by saying what I was concerned about coming in. So let's talk more about the town, and let's talk about what else stood Silent Hill 2 apart, and being honest, stands this apart: Atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 HD Collection, released twelve years ago, failed due to its lack of atmosphere, which came from the draw-distance being pushed right back and killing the fog. It could have been the case here, but it isn't. Another worry about modern games is that the polish almost entirely kills the jankiness that sets older horror games apart, too; I'm going to say something I didn't think I would have said before playing this: Bloober Team have succeeded admirably.</p>
<p>The fog is impressive; it feels like you're <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Jane, also in Maine</a>. More appropriately, it feels like Silent Hill, and it's very successful in continuously maintaining a foreboding atmosphere. You still have the radio to alert you when enemies are nearby, but even this isn't the tool it once was - again, memory may be failing - but here you have little bugs that keep your radio going, helping to set you on edge further. You're looking for something to attack you, but it's a creeper.</p>
<p>Then you have the Otherworld. Adding to what is already an ominous world is just that bit extra. Here, everything is decaying, monsters are a bit more dangerous, and dear god, do I find myself on edge here. It's no word of a lie when I say that moving from the Otherworld into regular old Silent Hill gave me genuine relief; I felt safer. I was safer, but I still wasn't - but when a game that already has you thinking, "What's next?" has you sigh of relief that the evil world has gone to sleep for a while, you know it's doing something right.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Silent-Hill-2-Review-04-Triangle-Man-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I've mentioned that Silent Hill 2's enemies get more challenging in the Otherworld, and that is the case, so let's touch upon combat itself now - gameplay and movement in general, too. This takes the free-camera over-the-shoulder third-person that seems mandatory in horror games now, and I would honestly argue it's for the better. While the fixed camera perspectives can work to add a sense of being watched (oddly, by you), a sort of detached feeling, the atmosphere is kept with the current camera, but you have more freedom to see and feel the world around you. It's also highly responsive, and while it doesn't have the jank in movement, you still don't feel like a super soldier.</p>
<p>No, running is still a strong option when you find yourself in potential combat. Indeed, running is the option more often than not; the alternative will leave you wasting valuable resources you can hardly spare. Now, I will say that it is easier than the original thanks to the responsive controls, the handy dodge feature, and a few more resources thanks to the larger world. This is particularly true, as mentioned, in the Otherworld. Enemies not only seem to deal more damage and are more aggressive, but they also have extra attacks or at least extra effects, meaning how you tackle them has to change. It all makes combat a bit more tactical.</p>
<p>There's also a feeling of weight to it. When swinging a melee weapon, from a board to a steel pipe, it feels like you're swinging into a mass of flesh. As mentioned, you don't feel like a super soldier. Enemies take a good number of swings to take down, and I may be wrong, but James feels like he slows down during multiple attacks, and I've found myself getting hit when I've overreached. Shooting, as well, will take a few bullets to take an enemy down, and your accuracy isn't perfect, even within that reticle; plus, you're going to have some human error when enemies are closing in.</p>
<p>However, I must admit two small things stand out as not great; sometimes, you will be grappled by an enemy and have to mash X to get away. Now, it's far from an unusual mechanic, and you could argue that mashing a button in a horror game because you're being that is somewhat fitting, but it just doesn't feel like "Silent Hill". The other, which is small, is that the game cheats - we've all seen it where what would be enemies are laid on the floor, seemingly dead. Some are, and others pop up. Now, I've played more than enough games, and I give some of them a swing to see if they'll jump up in disgust that I would do such a thing rather than ambush me. They don't jump up but come to life when I open a door. No, they were dead; the door is not a door of resurrection.</p>
<p>What this is to say is that the combat in Silent Hill 2 is genuinely great. This is particularly so when you come to the bosses, who offer a good level of challenge and are very much in keeping with the game's theme. I will admit that my playthrough (I've only played through once so far, due to time constraints) has been on both normal combat and normal puzzle, so there's a solid chance that on hard, you'll find yourself pressed. On normal, I felt reasonably challenged, but never at a complete absence of resources due to using them all because a nurse gave me a painful priapism.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Silent-Hill-2-Review-05-Fanservice-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Let's talk sexy now. Suppose you have ever had the misfortune of visiting the internet. In that case, you already know the outrage over the nurses not having double D's like Debbie in Dallas and that Maria isn't as sexualised. Those who care about the creator's vision will also know that the current designs of a more appropriately chested nurse monster and a more subtle Maria are faithful to Masahiro Ito's original ideas. I'm going to say right now, aesthetically - not just in the sense of the fog mentioned above - Silent Hill 2 is fantastic.</p>
<p>James, Maria, Eddie, Pyramid Head, the Mannequin. Everything looks fantastic. Of course, modern technology helps, but it's more than that: the designs work in the world we're presented with, and the game isn't afraid to give you that little tease of what is to come or even what once was. A few easter eggs or bits of foreshadowing made me smile. The environment, the buildings you enter, and everything else feel like a town that was lived in and has gone to hell.</p>
<p>It all loops us back to the start, where I can do nothing but praise the atmosphere, which is helped by the immersion this brings. Even something as simple as when walking down the street, you can see some ammo or a health potion through a car window; smash that car window, and you can reach in to get the goodies. Other features include animations like James pulling out the map and a pen to mark a point of interest as you encounter it. They aren't huge features, but all the small things make it believable.</p>
<p>Even something as small as blood appearing on James' jacket when he's damaged really helps. Plus, it circles back around to the combat and the exploration to find more resources, such as healing items. Having a red haze, akin to shooters, to show your damage is standard, but it can be removed. For immersion, I would.</p>

<p>Add an excellent soundtrack, which accentuates every part of the game, and you have something special. Which, I must admit, is what I think this remake of Silent Hill 2 is. Much like the Resident Evil remakes, this has brought a legend of the Survival Horror genre into the modern age. Most importantly, it's done it while managing not to sacrifice what made the original great.</p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 will take roughly double the length of time to complete than the original, though there is an achievement to complete the game in less than ten hours. That's your speedrun objective. My one completed playthrough took over twenty hours because I am an explorer, and I backtracked a little because now and then, the next step isn't clear. In addition, and this is all I'm allowed to tell you, under punishment of exile to Silent Hill, additional endings have been added to the game, giving even more replay value.</p>
<p>So, shall I succinctly finish this? Silent Hill 2 is scary, atmospheric, polished, and fun (or as fun as a game like this can be). It is great, the best game by the Bloober Team, and proof that, somewhere in the organisation, someone in Konami knows what needs to be done, and they must be nurtured.</p>

<p>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-shattered-space-review.1000329/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After the fast-travel extravaganza that was Starfield’s base campaign, I very much approve of the way its Shattered Space DLC course-corrects to make the new Va’ruun homeworld location feel much more like Bethesda’s previous open worlds. This planet is host to a substantial chunk of new quest content revolving around a long-winded but not uninteresting story about a futuristic theocracy that dangerously mingles science and religion despite their obvious conflict. That said, this first expansion is not terribly ambitious, either. It doesn’t introduce any significant new features that refresh anything you’ll do once you hop in your ship and leave this planet in a way similar to, say, the Dragonborn expansion did for Skyrim. Not every expansion can be so bold, of course, but those that aren’t miss an opportunity to leave a lasting, revitalizing mark on a replay of a big RPG like this, and limit themselves to a flash in the pan.</p><p>After dusting off my save, my level 46 Starborn passed through the Unity, grabbed Sarah from the Constellation Lodge, ran through the Mantis mission to score a ship, did a couple of temples, and then dove into the DLC – which <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/starfield-how-to-start-the-shattered-space-expansion">turned out to be easy to find</a> because it shows up the next time you go artifact hunting. The ominously spooky space station you begin on makes some good use of zero-G combat by adding glowing blue walls that, if you’re propelled backwards into them by gunfire, both deal damage and disorientingly teleport you, so you’ve got to be aware of what’s behind you when you open fire. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That’s where we’re introduced to the Phantom menace: these new enemies aren’t ghosts, but their spooky blue energy field and glowing eyes sure makes them look the part (and easy to spot from a distance) until it dissipates when you kill them, which is a notably cool effect. They can be both novel and annoying to fight: Not only are they often high level and thus pretty bullet spongey, they can teleport at will to both reposition when you’ve drawn a bead on them and also land right behind you with a big honkin’ knife. Listening for the whoosh sound effect of one popping into and out of existence can be your only warning before your health bar takes a big hit (especially a little later on when you might turn around and see the local equivalent of a Terrormorph tapping on your shoulder).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That’s where we’re introduced to the Phantom menace.</p></div><p>The floaty part doesn’t overstay its welcome, and when you get your boots back on the ground it’s not long before you’re whisked to the Va’ruun homeworld, which was kept conspicuously mysterious in Starfield’s campaign at launch. I did have to laugh when the notoriously reclusive and xenophobic group immediately invited me to not only walk freely among them, but fully convert to their religion. That’s very much a Bethesda thing, where everybody lets you sign up and no faction affiliations are mutually exclusive, but after playing the main campaign it was a little silly to find them so welcoming, even given the extraordinary circumstances presented.</p><p>You would not mistake their city, Dazra, for any of the others in Starfield. For one thing, the purple-tinged architecture is completely different and much more alien looking, even though the Va’ruun themselves are still human under all their face ink, and they only <em>talk</em> like they’re vampires on What We Do in the Shadows. (Completing the main quest lets you use their buildings in your own settlements.) Also, half of the city was destroyed in a catastrophic accident that left a weird and twisted crater so massive you can only really get a sense of it by looking at the map (they have maps now!), and the inhabitants are still recovering from what sounds like a Thanos snap-like loss of life. It’s a compelling setting, though I will say that the surviving half of Dazra looks a little too clean and orderly to really sell this as a disaster zone, even though it’s all anybody’s talking about.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>None of this lore will be on the test, and it’s no match for a good blaster at your side.</p></div><p>Getting to know the Va’ruun and the factions within its weird space theocracy obviously means listening to a high dose of religious lore involving a large serpent. It’s all written and delivered up to Bethesda’s standards, but it can be a lot when you’re staying immersed in it for this long. Don’t worry, though – none of this will be on the test, and in the long run it’s no match for a good blaster at your side. </p><p>Your quest to bring the three factions together to solve the ongoing crisis takes place entirely in Dazra’s surrounding region, which is notably different from the other main faction quest cities. Rather than sending you to your ship to zip off to errands on other planets, once you reach the Va’ruun homeworld you’re never required to travel anywhere else – not even flying to another landing zone on the same planet – to complete every single quest you can find there. The only time I left in the 12 hours it took to beat the main story and every major sidequest I came across was when I hopped in my Razorleaf to go shopping in the Settled Systems for healing items, which are hard to come by on this planet without sleeping for days at a time waiting for the local doctor to restock. (Ironically, if you took the Serpent’s Embrace trait that says you grew up practicing the Va’ruun religion, your character will suffer a stat penalty for not doing grav jumps frequently enough.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We see multiple meaningful locations on the same chunk of extraterrestrial real estate.</p></div><p>Instead, you either drive the recently patched-in rover car to each quest location around the Dazra or just hoof it the old-fashioned way, which I found refreshing. Most of the main Starfield quests felt detached and disjointed because of all the planet-hopping and fast-traveling to new locations, but here we get a more traditional Bethesda sense of place and continuity. We see multiple meaningful locations existing on the same near-seamless chunk of extraterrestrial real estate instead of one important thing and a bunch of procedurally generated filler. I also like how the crater is filled with gravity distortion bubbles, which I actually wish were used more often to really distinguish this planet from others and let you float to otherwise unreachable areas.</p><p>On the other hand, this down-to-earth approach makes Shattered Space extremely focused in the way it expands on Starfield, to the point where there is zero use of interstellar travel or space combat. As far as I can tell there’s absolutely nothing added for spacefarers other than now you have a way to legitimately acquire Va’ruun ships instead of stealing them from Zealots who attack you in space. That’s fine, as an expansion doesn’t always have to meaningfully expand every aspect of a game – but I was surprised that there wasn’t at least a token feature thrown in for space jockeys in an expansion with “space” in the title.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s nothing wrong with a celebrated band playing the hits.</p></div><p>Sure, the majority of these quests feel like Starfield-flavored rewrites of things I’ve done before in Fallout or Elder Scrolls games, but there’s nothing wrong with a celebrated band playing the hits. Track down the fugitive and decide whether to kill him or help him fake his death? Check. Root out the traitor diverting emergency supplies to the Zealots and decide whether to turn them in or take a bribe? Check. Rescue the hostages and decide whether to double-cross someone? Check. </p><p>As far as loot goes, there are a handful of new weapons to get your hands on, and although they’re mostly just the Va’ruun’s take on weapon types we already have, there’s nothing to dislike about more variety, both in their bulky visual design and their splashy energy effects. There are also some <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/starfield-shattered-space-how-to-use-vortex-shards">craftable grenades</a> you can make out of pieces of defeated Phantoms. Again, though, it’s a little disappointing that they’re unlikely to change much about the way you’ll play when you leave this planet.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dan's favorite planet-hopping space games</h3></p></div><p>Since the mainstream Va’ruun themselves turn out to be generally alright folks, just as Andreja promised, you don’t spend much time shooting at them. Instead, there are a fair number of Zealots (including a very beefy new armored melee type) and the occasional generic spacers to fight in order to mix things up from tangling with Phantoms. I usually play on hard difficulty because normal is a cakewalk, and nearly everything was very manageable in Shattered Space. I say “nearly” because I did end up turning it back down to normal for the final battle – but that was mostly so I didn’t have to buy every health pack in the Settled Systems before attempting it again, because not taking damage in that firefight is quite tricky.</p><p>Finally, I have to give Shattered Space a little credit for giving me a good reason to return to Starfield and get a feel for how it works with all of the improvements Bethesda’s made in the past year. The maps and the car really do make a substantial difference in inconveniences I had to overcome to enjoy the main campaign, and even though the inventory is still bad and the temples remain maddeningly repetitive (and with a Bethesda game, it should go without saying there are still plenty of bugs, new and old) those improvements have gone a long way toward making this a game I’m glad I took the time to revisit.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Star Wars Outlaws is one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Ubisoft's most controversial games</a>. Not only did they funnel a significant amount of money into it, but it was released as a buggy mess that players were struggling to get into. Today, Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment have released a new update, update 1.2, which brings enhancements to both console and PC. On the website, it's known as Title Update 2 and is the latest in a series of ongoing updates that will help smooth out any wrinkles in the game. Ubisoft posted an extensive list of patch notes on its website, stating, "In this second Title Update, we've focused on improving the camera on your speeder and its responsiveness, amongst other tweaks to ensure your adventures are smothered and more rewarding."</p>
<p>For those installing Title Update 2, it varies in size from platform to platform. Below are the sizes for the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5: 3.80 GB</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S: 4.71 GB</li>
<li>PC: 5.60 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>This update has been used to focus on the speeder and camera movement, but most importantly, they've added more fixes to the stealth experience in the game. AI detection has been adjusted, with the number of NPCS and their positioning, patrol pathing, camera detection and environmental opportunities being tweaked to allow for a smoother, less challenging experience for the players that are struggling. The stealth missions <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-will-be-patched-to-improve-those-annoying-insta-fail-stealth-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been a point of contention</a> since the game was released, with Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment already releasing fixes for this issue in Title Update 1.</p>
<p>For all platforms, they have improved stability and performance across all platforms, as well as fixing FPS drops for those using a rig with Intel ARC GPUs. VRAM impact has also been added to RTXDI usage.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of complaints throughout the short history of Star Wars Outlaws, with it receiving a low User Score of 5.4 on Metacritic. While there are a myriad of issues players found with the game, such as not being able to build a world that is exciting or interesting enough for the Star Wars universe, a lot of the issues revolve around the protagonist herself.</p>
<p>To try to give Kay more life, they've improved the animation of her movements and scaled AI reactions to environmental actions from investigation to combat. Ubisoft have also listed all the issues they've fixed, where Kay wasn't receiving any damage from enemy blasters, or controller presets not being saved when players were playing on different consoles of the same platform.</p>
<p>Overall, this patch has added a significant amount of improvements to the game compared to the first Title Patch, all of which are uploaded onto <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1Kq2ABlTdHgkdbGRQZ20he" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft's website</a> for players to read.</p>

Flashpoint is in such high demand that all preorders placed on the site after October 1 are classified as Wave 2 and won't ship until March 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-ea-paradox-launcher-pc-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has had a rough month--of all places<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/01/assassins-creed-maker-ubisoft-ubi-faces-questions-over-its-future.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this CNBC article has the most comprehensive and level-headed roundup</a> I've seen--but among all the disappointment and frustration over everything the company has done (and not done) lately, there's one thing in particular I want to point at and say "this <em>really </em>pisses me off and I wish you would stop it".</p><p>That thing is the company's continued bungling of my platform of choice, the PC. You can see this reflected in a bunch of ways: the fact Ubisoft have long insisted on selling their games on their own desolate shopfront, the fact they made their own PC launcher that sucks, and the way that when you <em>can </em>get a Ubisoft game on Steam (and the company has recently pledged to return to it), shit like this happens:</p><figure><figcaption>Source: Reddit</figcaption></figure><p>Steam is a launcher. It works. Companies like EA and Ubisoft have their own launchers that routinely do <em>not </em>work, or when they do, work poorly. If I buy a game in Steam and launch it in Steam to then play it in Steam, I should not have to be subjected to <em>another </em>launcher! I've already launched the game and want to play it there, thank you!</p><p>And yet. In a best case scenario, waiting for Steam to boot a game then having to wait for Ubisoft or EA or Rockstar or Paradox or whoever's launcher to load after it, then having to click play <em>again </em>just so we can play the game we already clicked play on in Steam is a pointless waste of time. At worst, like we see above (or like I've personally experienced everywhere from trying to play <em>Star Wars Squadrons</em> in VR to a recurring <em>Europa Universalis IV</em> bug that makes the game <em>unplayable</em>), the extra load (and introduction of extra variables where shit can go wrong) can straight up break your ability to play a game at all.</p><p>As such, I have a modest proposal. I think anyone responsible for the implementation of a launcher for their PC games should be thrown into the ocean.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the latest in a series of title updates that includes a long list of tweaks to the visuals as well as some squashed bugs.

That means adjusted AI detection, tweaked NPC locations and positioning, and more are here to ensure sneaky smugglers have a more enjoyable experience. Players will also notice that it’s easier to control Kay Vess when she’s on a speeder thanks to an improved camera and speeder response time. The update also lists stability improvements that should help with dropped frames for certain users, improved animations for Kay, and better lip-syncing.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws solidified Ubisoft’s place in a galaxy far, far away when it released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S on August 26. It launched to “generally favorable” critic reviews and “mixed or average” user reviews, as defined by <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-outlaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Metacritic</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed"><u>underperformed sales-wise by the publisher’s standards</u></a>. The company said last week that its development teams were “fully mobilized to swiftly implement a series of updates to polish and improve the player experience.”</p><p>Patch 1.2 is a sign of Ubisoft’s continued interest in addressing fan feedback, and there is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-unveils-roadmap-leading-up-to-november-steam-release"><u>more on the way, too</u></a>. To start, title update 3 is still scheduled to bring quality-of-life improvements later this month.

We already knew they were coming thanks to Gameloft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-includes-tiana-timon-and-pumbaa">most recent roadmap</a>, but Timon and Pumbaa's officially make their <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> debut next Wednesday, 9th October.
</p>
<p>
The Lion King favourites arrive as part of Disney Dreamlight Valley's free Jungle Getaway Update, which has now been detailed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK7qi44pC8s">Gameloft's latest developer video</a>. Timon and Pumbaa will, for instance, initially be encountered in the overhauled Lion King Realm, first introduced when Simba and Nala joined the village life sim last April.
</p>
<p>
This time around, the Lion King Realm is explorable in the daytime, with players joining Timon and Pumbaa on a "relaxing jungle retreat" where they'll "learn valuable lessons in the art forms of rest and relaxation." Once the adventure is complete, Timon and Pumbaa will be available out in the main world, complete with their own Friendship quests and rewards.

<p>
Elsewhere in the Jungle Getaway Update, there's a new battle-pass-like Star Path, this time with a music festival and rock concert-inspired theme. The Night Show Star Path, as it's known, features "rebellious clothing and hairstyles" inspired by Disney villains, Disney princesses, and rock music. It also includes new unlockable elements and furniture to create your own concert stage, including neon lights and pyrotechnics.
</p><p>
And wrapping up October's update are a selection of quality of life improvements, including tweaks for Scrooge McDuck's in-game store. Furniture items, for instance, will now appear in place of any empty clothing displays, and there's a chance for additional Realm decor to arrive in the daily rotation. That's on top of new Edit Mode control schemes, and the ability to add crafting recipes and duties to the onscreen quest tracker.
</p>
<p>
Disney Dreamlight Valley's free Jungle Getaway Update will be available on all platforms when it launches next Wednesday, 9th October.

<p>YouTube Shorts are about to get longer – which kind of defeats the point, but it’s great news for content creators. It was just announced that YouTube will start supporting longer Shorts as of October 15, taking the maximum duration for a qualifying clip from 60 seconds to 180 seconds.</p>



<p>In an update posted by the platform’s representatives, it was stated that this was a ‘top requested feature by creators’ and that it’ll give users more flexibility to tell their stories.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shorts-getting-long">Shorts Getting Long</h2>



<p>It’s likely the beginning of the end in terms of growth and evolution. TikTok started by allowing users to record and upload clips just a minute or two in duration, and now, you can upload videos that last <strong>one hour </strong>on the platform. It’s a bit odd because the majority of users these days want short, sharp, and entertaining content.</p>



<p>But hey, the longer the video, the more ad revenue and earning opportunities for creators, so it’s not all bad.</p>



<p>For the longest time, YouTube Shorts have accommodated a 60-second limit, but as of October 15, that’s set to change, with YouTube boosting the duration limit to 180 seconds. Here’s what the team said in a release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Longer Shorts, more of you. Starting on October 15, you can upload Shorts up to 3 minutes long. This was a top requested feature by creators, so we’re excited to give you more flexibility to tell you story. This change applies to videos that are square or taller in aspect ratio, and won’t affect any videos you uploaded before October 15. And we’ll be working to improve recommendations for longer Shorts in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Content creators looking for more avenues along which to diversify their portfolio will swoon at this change. It’s another angle for them to try making a few dollars by uploading content. There’s quite a difference in how regular YouTube videos and YouTube Shorts are monetised, but they’re lucrative enough even for small creators.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a solid change? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft's efforts to improve the Star Wars Outlaws experience continue today with arrival of its newest update, this time promising further stealth tweaks, speeder improvements, performance and stability optimisations, and more.
</p>
<p>
Title Update 1.2, as the latest update is officially known, weight in at 3.8GB on PS5, 4.71GB on Xbox Series X/S, and 5.6GB on PC. Its primary goal, according to Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1Kq2ABlTdHgkdbGRQZ20he">release notes</a>, is "improving the camera on your speeder and its responsiveness", as well as "other tweaks to ensure your adventures are smoother and more rewarding."
</p>
<p>
Top of its list of notable changes, though, are those aforementioned stealth tweaks. Star Wars Outlaws' previous Title Update 1.1.2 already made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-patch-to-fix-incredibly-punishing-stealth-sections-is-now-live">some initial changes</a> to the games's stealth sequences - which  director Julian Gerighty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-punishing-stealth-sequences-will-soon-be-easier">acknowledged</a> were "unfair" and "incredibly punishing" shortly after launch - but Title Update 2 seems to take things further.

<p>
Ubisoft says it's adjusted AI detection to improve stealth, as well as the number of NPCs and their positioning, patrol pathing, and camera detection. Additionally, it mentions "highlighting environmental opportunities to reduce player friction." That's on top of various much-requested speeder enhancements, including camera improvements when FOV is increased, improved response and reaction when the speeder is called, plus better environmental collision to reduce the likelihood of players being knocked off the speeder during travel.
</p><p>
Elsewhere, stability and performance improvements are promised across all platforms, Kay's movement animations have been enhanced, and various progress-impacting issues have been fixed, including one that would cause players to get stuck in the hyperjump sequence towards Kijimi. The full list of fixes is considerably more expansive - Kay, for instance, now closes the correct eye while aiming down sights - and you'll find them in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1Kq2ABlTdHgkdbGRQZ20he">Ubisoft's patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Outlaws hasn't, of course, been the unmitigated success Ubisoft was hoping for. Last month, the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">admitted</a> the game's launch had been "softer than expected", a situation it was hoping to remedy with a "series of updates to polish and improve the player experience in order to engage a large audience during the holiday season". 
</p>
<p>
Today's Title Update 2 is just one part of that plan, with future content set to include Star Wars Outlaws' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-lando-calrissian-story-dlc-gets-november-release-date">first bit of post-launch story DLC</a>, starring Lando Calrissian, on 21st November. That's alongside continued work on "optimisation, gameplay polishing, and tweaks, as well as quality of life changes includes adjustments to combat and stealth gameplay".
</p>
<p>
Whether Ubisoft can turn Star Wars Outlaws' fortunes around in time for the holidays (or at all) remains to be seen; Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell felt the experience was fundamentally flawed when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">reviewed it back in August</a>, awarding it two out of five stars.

In Sid Meier’s <em>Civilization 7</em>, such flights of historical fantasy can become historical fact. The game has new ages to experience, new civilizations to build up, new leaders to guide them, and — for the first time in franchise history — the ability to mix and match leaders and civilizations to build the empire of your wildest dreams. <em>The Verge</em> had the opportunity to test out the game and talk with its developers at Firaxis Games. The brief, three-hour demo wasn’t enough time to get a feel for how well leaders and different civilizations work together, but I left feeling excited about all the ways <em>Civilization VII</em> aims to change the course of history.&nbsp;</p><p>In previous <em>Civilization </em>games, civs were always tied to a specific leader who was usually, but not always, a noteworthy head of state. Later iterations of the game offered multiple leaders for civs, and on a couple of occasions where it made historical sense, one leader could straddle multiple civs like France and England both having access to Eleanor of Aquitaine, who, during her unusually-long-for-the-time-period life, was the queen of both countries.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-86197c61-7f6e-4283-a3d2-bd8bbbe6fea2"><div><p>Here are the PC requirements for Civilization 7.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471">Check ‘em out</a> to see if your PC can run the game when it comes out on February 11th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-latest-expansion-wiped-out-some-guilds-inventories-seemingly-for-good-and-players-are-furious<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>World of Warcraft's latest expansion, The War Within, has been out for over a month now, and things are going great. Critics and players are largely happy with all the new content additions, the new Delve feature appears to finally be appropriately balanced, and the Race to World First was a real fun nail-biter.</p><p>But there's been one major, glaring issue with The War Within simmering since a pre-launch patch that's frustrated hundreds of players, with seemingly no fix in sight: the disappearance of thousands of items from guild banks, seemingly never to be returned.</p><h3>The Great Guild Bank Caper</h3><p>Issues began on August 13 with Patch 11.0.2, which dropped a number of updates to the game ahead of the release of the latest expansion, The War Within. In the following days, players began flocking to the official community forums, Reddit, and other community spaces to report a strange and upsetting issue: tons of items seemed to be missing from their guild banks.</p><p>While initially some players suspected thieving guild members or some sort of visual bug, as more reports came in, the reality became increasingly clear. Without warning, hundreds of guilds had seen massive amounts of items sitting inside their banks wiped out by the 11.0.2 patch with seemingly no rhyme or reason. Not every guild was impacted, nor did every impacted guild lose every item, but many reported half, two-thirds, or even the entire contents of their banks vanishing. Individuals who used guild banks as personal storage reported losing the accumulated riches of several years playing WoW. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Blizzard Game Review</h3></div></output><p>For some guilds, the extent of the damage was difficult to track at all. According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1euiumg/guild_banks_missing_items/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">player reports</a>, the in-game "logs" of guild bank withdrawals and deposits did not reflect massive amounts of items being taken out, leaving those who were less active stewards of their guild banks struggling to remember what had even been in there in the first place.</p><h3>Blizzard Responds</h3><p>As reports flooded in over several weeks, players became increasingly frustrated by Blizzard's lack of public response to the issue. Informal player surveys found that it was impacting hundreds of players and guilds, with likely far more going unreported, so it seemed unusual for the developer to remain silent for so long on what seemed to be such a massive problem.</p><p>Finally, after over a month, <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/guild-bank-missing-items-update/1963451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blizzard issued a response </a>explaining what had occurred. Per Blizzard, "a technical update that was made to support cross-realm guilds" encountered an unexpected bug that "caused one of our maintenance processes to make some items disappear." Blizzard claims this mainly impacted items "related to professions materials from prior expansions" but acknowledged other items had disappeared as well. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The result will be an incomplete restoration for some guilds, and we do not have a way to restore the remaining missing items.</p></div><p>In response, Blizzard said that it had been "packing up the missing items that we’re able to identify as lost by this process, and we will soon mail those to the guild leader character for each affected guild." But there was a catch. "Due to how some of the data was lost, we’ve reached a point where the result will be an incomplete restoration for some guilds, and we do not have a way to restore the remaining missing items for them." The developer apologized for both the incomplete restoration and the long wait.</p><p>While on its face this seemed to be a positive resolution to a frustrating situation, relief quickly turned to anger as players realized exactly how "incomplete" the "incomplete restoration" would be.</p><h3>Incomplete Restoration</h3><p>In the weeks since, players have been sharing the results of the "incomplete restoration" of their guild banks, and it doesn't look good. Some guild leaders are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fmkbl4/a_tiny_fraction_of_everything_i_lost_due_to_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showing off</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fm2lcg/a_guild_bank_beforeafter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before and after</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1flqk73/out_of_7_full_guild_tabs_wiped_this_is_all_that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshots</a> of their banks, claiming to still be missing hundreds of items worth thousands of in-game gold. Some are reporting restorations that are insulting or even humorous, such as one person claiming they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1flqk73/comment/lo5es58/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received a single piece of silk</a> in the mail, or another who only got a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fm7p7l/i_think_i_might_win_the_award_for_spookiest_guild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bunch of Halloween-themed items</a> back. Some are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1foaz2k/my_guild_of_13_years_lost_every_item_and_not_even/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing stories of collections</a> they spent years building being completely wiped out with nothing restored. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fr08m1/i_feel_bad_for_my_friend_regarding_the_guild_bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One player claims</a> their friend, a 72-year-old woman, lost an entire guild bank's worth of pets, toys, mounts, and other items she was giving out as gifts to new players. Others have noted that since Blizzard's item restoration is sending items to guild leaders via in-game mail, any guild whose leader is inactive won't receive any of its items back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Still others are bringing up the fact that since the introduction of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/07/the-wow-token-is-now-live">WoW Token</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fodlt9/the_guild_bank_thanos_snap_should_get_more_outrage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-game items essentially have an equivalent value in real-world money</a>. "Would you accept your bank to "whoopsie" your savings account, replace it with a fraction of what it had, and have the end all be called an "incomplete restoration"?" they wrote.</p><p>There are some players who are coming to Blizzard's defense. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fodlt9/comment/lopm6fb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Several commenters have pointed out</a> the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fodlt9/comment/lopm6fb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sheer scale of what went missing</a> makes it very likely that Blizzard is telling the truth about its own ability to restore missing items, and there's really no good way to determine who is owed what even with data backups. But even players who acknowledge Blizzard's in an impossible spot are still frustrated by the loss of sometimes years' worth of progress, savings, and work, and concerned that further mass item deletions may happen in the future. It's an unfortunate black mark on what is otherwise a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review">very well-received expansion</a>, and an unfortunate weird side effect of the addition of a long-asked for feature (cross-realm guilds).</p><p>"It's heart crushing, and it's hard to play the game, even though this was stuff we could play without technically, it was about getting others what they need and would enjoy," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fodlt9/comment/loplodt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said one player</a>. "It took a lot of the enjoyment out of the expansion for leadership of my guild."</p><p>IGN reached out to Blizzard for further comment as to how this happened or if the company plans to take any further actions to restore lost items, but did not receive a reply in time for publication. We will update if and when we receive a response.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

We do surveys and everything, we do market research. We don’t wanna just make something, we wanna make something we honestly believe that the players to their core will enjoy, and that drives our decisions.”</p><p>The interview was published this week but conducted prior to the latest controversy to hit <em>MTG</em>: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-commander-banned-cards-wizards-1851661288?_gl=1*bi4a5f*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzk4NDUzNi4xMjQuMS4xNzI3OTg2MTY4LjUuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-commander-banned-cards-wizards-1851661288?_gl=1*bi4a5f*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzk4NDUzNi4xMjQuMS4xNzI3OTg2MTY4LjUuMC4w">the banning of several powerful cards in its popular Commander format</a></span>. Following an online harassment campaign targeting some members of the volunteer-staffed Rules Committee which issued the bans, Wizards of the Coast announced the group would be dissolved and the decisions would be taken back in-house to shield people from abuse. It’s still not clear how that will all ultimately play out. </p><p>In the meantime, however, two Universes Beyond sets that might end up among the most popular yet are due out next year:<em>&nbsp;</em>cards based around both the<em> Final Fantasy </em>games and on <em>Marvel</em> comic book heroes. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Vice President of the Rainbow 6 franchise, Cameron Lee, has left the franchise and Ubisoft.</p>



<p>Cameron Lee joined the Rainbow 6 brand in April 2022 after working as Vice President of Production at Activision but had previously had over 20 years of experience as a producer, manager, and VP at companies including EA, Bungie, and BioWare, and has worked on such franchises as Tony Hawk, Call of Duty, and Dragon Age.</p>



<p>Following the announcement to join the Rainbow 6 franchise, Ubisoft said that Lee “will be responsible for creating the long-term brand strategy for the Rainbow Six franchise and aligning and collaborating with all internal partners.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear why Lee decided to leave the franchise and the company, but an internal email sent to staff reads, “For the time being, the role of VP and Executive Producer for the Rainbow Six brand will not be replaced.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming asked Ubisoft for comment on Lee’s departure but has not received a comment.</p>

<p>Motorsport Games, the studio behind Le Mans Ultimate and other racing video games, has had another round of layoffs. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming first learned of the layoffs earlier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikestrawmedia.com/post/3l5mr2bpput25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Thursday</a> across the studio’s social media and marketing departments, but couldn’t confirm the number of employees that were impacted. <a href="https://traxion.gg/le-mans-ultimate-hangs-in-the-balance-as-studio-hit-by-further-redundancies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Traxion</a>, which was formerly owned by Motorsport Games, reports that 10 employees were let go in the latest round. Insider Gaming has since been able to corroborate that the number is “around there”, per sources.</p>



<p>After talks of layoffs began, a brand and marketing manager for the company took to social media to confirm that he had been “made redundant from Studio 397 and Motorsport Games due to further reductions in the workforce.”</p>



<h2 id="h-why-more-layoffs-at-motorsport-games">Why More Layoffs At Motorsport Games?</h2>



<p>As far as why the layoffs are taking place, Insider Gaming understands that the studio has continued to struggle to find investors to help fund the company. Multiple sources have said that the company has continued to look for various funding opportunities, but nothing substantial has been achieved yet.</p>



<p>“They’re trying, but they need more than what they’re getting,” said one source. “The goal remains to release Le Mans Ultimate on console in the future.”</p>



<p>Motorsport Games is scheduled to hole a  “Special Meeting of Stockholders” on October 25 in Miami, Florida. As part of the meeting, they will hold a vote to approve a purchase of up to 949,310 shares of Motorsport Games Class A Common Stock. Should that deal be approved and the company sell all of the aforementioned shares, it could bring in roughly $1.5 million in funding based on the current market price of Motorsport Games shares.</p>



<p>In October 2023, Motorsport Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-announces-new-console-game-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold the license to NASCAR</a> to iRacing. Not long after, the company also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indycar-terminates-agreement-with-motorsport-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost the license</a> to the Indy Car game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-indycar-game-status-up-in-the-air-at-motorsport-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been in development</a>. </p>



<p>Motorsport Games has yet to respond to multiple requests for comment from Insider Gaming on the layoffs and status of the company.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-graces-f-dev-talks-about-tales-of-the-abyss-remaster-possibilities-and-the-future-of-the-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A beloved RPG series celebrated its 30th anniversary.</h2></div><section><p>Bandai Namco recently announced Tales of Graces f Remastered as the first title in the Tales Remastered Project, celebrating the Tales of 30th anniversary. We both got to go hands-on with Tales of Graces f Remastered and speak with the game’s producer, Yuki Ishikawa, who talked to us about the series’ future and the possibility of a Tales of Abyss Remake. </p><p>First, we asked why Tales of Graces f Remastered was chosen as the first title in the Tales of Remastered Program. One, Graces f is one of the more beloved titles of Tales of, Ishikawa said. It’s especially heralded for its battle system. Two, it was just “good timing to make this a remastered title.” </p><p>What Ishikawa means by “good timing” in this moment is related to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-arise-review">Tales of Arise’s wide, positive reception</a> not just within Japan, but with the overseas audience as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“When the team is thinking of what comes next for us, if they were to bring up something that is like a 2D pixel kind of game that was only on a Famitsu console the last time, there would be a huge gap between people who have liked Tales of Arise and then with that kind of content,” Ishikawa explained.</p><p>And three, the original version of Tales of Graces f had only four languages, so with a remaster, the Tales team is able to bring Tales of Graces f to a wider audience with more language options. This is especially true considering Graces f has been “stuck” on the PS3, at least over in the West, since its initial release here in 2012. Tales of Graces f Remastered is being released on pretty much all platforms–Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, <em>and</em> PC.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If [a Tales of the Abyss remaster] could happen and I could share that joy with the rest of the fans, that’s something I’ll work hard towards</p></div><p>“In the past there were certain titles that were platform exclusive, but as of this moment and in terms of the current direction of the Tales of team, they're not looking to have the title or any upcoming titles to be platform exclusive,” Ishikawa explained. “We want to bring Tales Of to a wider audience. So we think one of the ways is by having it available on as many platforms as possible.” </p><p>Of course, there’s more to come after Tales of Graces f Remastered. </p><p>Personally, Ishikawa is a fan of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/11/tales-of-the-abyss-review">Tales of the Abyss</a>, and quoted it as one of the reasons why he entered the company [Bandai Namco]. “If [a Tales of the Abyss remaster] could happen and I could share that joy with the rest of the fans, that’s something I’ll work hard towards,” Ishikawa said. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Tales of Graces f Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“The goal for the Tales of IP in general is to make the IP grow,” Ishikawa explained. “So it’s not to say that the Tales of series is going to end with Tales of Arise…So whether there is an entirely new title, whether it’s a remaster, whether it’s a remake, we can’t say for sure, but we definitely want to keep moving forward.” </p><p>For more on Tales, don’t miss our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-hands-on-a-tasteful-modernization-of-a-classic-rpg">Tales of Graces f Remastered Hands-on preview</a>.</p><p><em>Casey DeFreitas is IGN's Deputy Guides Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
