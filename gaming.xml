			<p>A new Star Wars Jedi Survivor PlayStation 5 Pro patch has gone live today, addressing some of the issues that have been widely reported in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Patch 10, whose full notes can be found on the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsJediSurvivor/comments/1i1zbqc/star_wars_jedi_survivor_ps5_patch_10/?share_id=q7gfZIwubLqwX_g2bptR4&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">official subreddit</a>, updates PSSR to the latest version, reduces foliage flicker, improves reflection visuals on Koboh River, and reduces flickering in volumetric fog, resulting in improved image quality.</p>
<p>Among the PlayStation 5 Pro enhanced games available to date, Star Wars Jedi Survivor was definitely among the worst alongside Silent Hill 2 and a few others, mostly due to the fact that the game used an older version of the PSSR upscaler which couldn't handle certain visual elements appropriately. Other games, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, however, benefited greatly from the AI-powered upscaler, showing that it can deliver some solid results under the right conditions and with the proper implementation.</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi Survivor is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the second entry in the series by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-cannot-change-the-past/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>While Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order was a surprise journey when it was first released, the time spent apart hasn’t made Cal Kestis’ adventures any less enjoyable. A similar framework in unfamiliar territories helps to establish Jedi Survivor as a quality sequel to the original release. Jedi Survivor still plays it safe in comparison to the prior game. It may be difficult to give Jedi Survivor full marks for its individuality, but compared to the predecessor focused on Cal’s time as a Jedi Padawan, each title can stand up on its own merits, and Jedi Survivor polishes up much of the experience as it propels the narrative ever forward on Cal Kestis’ journey to Tanalorr.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crashlands-2-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crashlands-2-release-date-revealed-for-april.1083054/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crashlands-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Butterscotch Shenanigans has announced the&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>release date, with the hotly-anticipated crafting RPG sequel (crash) landing on PC and mobiles in a couple of months.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>arrives on April 10th. It'll serve as the sequel to 2016's much-loved&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em>, which Butterscotch Shenanigans says has amassed "more than 1.8 million downloads" since being released back in 2016.</p>

<p><em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>will once again take you to the planet of Woanope, and you'll once more play the role of "intergalactic trucker and disgruntled corporate employee" Flux Dabes, so this sequel will feel like a real homecoming if you enjoyed the original.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crashlands-2-release-date-april-resources.jpg?itok=0pbDlDuf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crashlands-2-release-date-april-resources.jpg?itok=D-uqsnma 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>will take you back to the surface of Woanope in April.</figcaption></figure><p>The story sees Dabes returning to Woanope to revisit old friends and take a vacation after suffering from "corporate burnout". Before the vacation starts, however, a "mysterious blast" from Woanope's surface sends Dabes crashing to its surface once more.</p>

<p>From there, you must venture into what Butterscotch Shenanigans calls "a beautiful living wilderness" complete with its own alien ecosystem. You'll need to learn how that ecosystem works and exploit it to your advantage in order to survive.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>carries the same sense of intrepid exploration as its predecessor, it's also an altogether more cozy affair. You'll be able to build your very own comfy quarters on the surface of Woanope, filling it with "all the pets, friends, and trophies you collect along the way".</p>

<p>That's not to say there isn't a story to discover. Butterscotch Shenanigans says that "something's not quite right" on the planet of Woanope, so together with new friends and allies, you must unite the planet's factions to restore balance.</p>




<p>Butterscotch Shenanigans CEO Adam Coster says it knows the original&nbsp;<em>Crashlands&nbsp;</em>was "an important part" of many players' childhoods (way to make me feel old, Adam). As such,&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>has "grown up as much as they have".</p>

<p><em>Crashlands 2</em>, er, lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401730/Crashlands_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices on April 10th.</p>

When Fisk asks why Murdock stopped being a vigilante, our blind hero answers, “A line has been crossed,” before we see his cracked Daredevil mask fall to the ground. From the sounds of it, Murdock is struggling with the common vigilante paradox of how enacting violence may debatably stop some violence but also blurs the line between justice and retribution. Obviously he gets back to bone-crushing action before all is said and done (and, by the looks of it, breaks many, many bones indeed), but the season could find him struggling to reconcile his thirst for vengeance with his duty to protect. </p><p>Another aspect of the new trailer that should pique everyone’s interest is the dynamic between Murdock and Mayor Fisk. The trailer reveals it was Murdock who invited Fisk to meet at the diner. But more importantly, we see Fisk’s almost sentimental connection to his archnemesis, displayed when he remarks, “It’s not entirely unpleasant seeing you again.” Looks like there may be a mutual level of respect between the two men who both succumb to their violent sides to serve their individual purposes.  </p><p>Something tells me there’ll be some common enemy or convoluted entanglement of circumstances that invariably leads to Fisk and Daredevil temporarily teaming up. We’ll find out if I’m right when the series premieres on March 4. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first in-game look of Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 Terminator has been unofficially revealed for Mortal Kombat 1. The first look comes via a Mortal Kombat 1 Pro Kompetition trailer. </p>



<p>In the first look, we see T-1000’s hand go from liquid metal to human. The character is based on actor Robert Patrick’s likeness from the movie. For Conan the Barbarian, it’s based on the likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger from the 1982 movie. His appearance showcases a brutality where he puts a dagger through his opponent’s face before cutting him in half.</p>



<p>Conan the Barbarian won’t feature Schwarzenegger’s voice. However, Patrick is voicing his character in the game. You can check out the trailer for yourself below with the new character appearances starting around the 45 second mark.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Conan the Barbarian is scheduled to release for players on January 21. There is no release date yet for T-1000 Terminator. They are the last of the announced DLC fighters coming to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster. Current reports suggest that Warner Bros. Games and NetherRealm Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/">scrapped plans for Kombat Pack 3</a> after a lackluster performance of the Khaos Reigns expansion. </p>



<p>Neither Warner Bros. Games nor NetherRealm Studios have confirmed this to be the case or responded to requests for comment on the reports. That said, should it be the end of future releases for the game, Mortal Kombat is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to be a focus</a> for Warner Bros. Games moving forward, according to its CEO.</p>

<p>PGA Tour 2K25’s release date carries on the series’ pattern of two-year cycles. A new installment of expert ball-striking and green-reading beckons, and your tee time is arriving sooner than expected. We have news on 2K25’s launch and its day-one platforms.</p>



<p>Many golfers out there struggle with the round-to-round grind of the real thing. I fall into this category, and while I’m not the worst golfer, only the wish from a genie’s lamp could get me close to being good. 2K’s simulated golf series is the perfect playground for disillusioned players (like me) to capture a sliver of what it’s like to be great at golf. </p>



<p>PGA Tour 2K25 looks to be a natural evolution of everything we’ve seen before, and its release date and platforms are known.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-pga-tour-2k25-s-release-date">When is PGA Tour 2K25’s Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A serene setting. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>PGA Tour 2K25 releases worldwide on February 28, but you can play the game earlier on January 21 through Early Access.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7TlP1WBr50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Next Round, Best Round” announcement trailer</a> dropped on January 14. It highlighted visual upgrades over its predecessor, the introduction of three of the four majors (The Masters being exclusive to EA), some of its stacked roster, and the anticipated release date.</p>



<p>Clean your clubs, mark your balls, and prep your outfit because the round gets underway soon. Even though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-revealed-releases-february-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25 has officially been announced</a>, we’ve known about a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour game</a> since November. Take-Two let the news slip during a November 6 Earning’s Call.</p>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-release-time">PGA Tour 2K25 Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>A worldwide midnight launch for PGA Tour 2K25 is expected.</strong></p>



<p>It’s standard practice for pretty much most titles nowadays, but expect a mightnight release in each region. This does mean it varies—depending on where you live—but Early Access also has a big say on how soon you get to experience PGA Tour 2K25 anyway.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-pga-tour-2k25-platforms">All PGA Tour 2K25 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>2K has confirmed the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC as the only launch platforms at launch.</strong></p>



<p>This means PGA Tour 2K23 is the last of its kind to incorporate all generations of consoles. A PS4 and Xbox One launch was also included, but the same can’t be said for PGA Tour 2K25. The developer and publisher have decided to move on, so if you’re looking to tee up 2K25, you need to have the right launch hardware.</p>



<hr>



<p>As a golf enthusiast, I’m very excited to see the improvements 2K has made for PGA Tour 2K25. With rival franchise <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-pga-tour-gets-latest-major-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports PGA Tour</a> now competing in the simulated golf space, it’s an exciting time.

                <p>During the middle of Act 2 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a>, you'll come across a side quest to complete the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-how-to-complete-the-trial-of-sekhemas/2900-6130/" data-ref-id="2900-6130">Trial of Sekhemas</a>. While optional, completion of the trial grants you access to your class' Ascendancy, which totally revamps and customizes your build. Naturally, all players should try to complete the Trial of Sekhmas to unlock the full potential of their character.</p><p>It sounds simple, but the Trial of Sekhemas is an extremely difficult endeavor that many players won't pass their first time around. Part of what makes the trial so challenging is the Honor system, which is exclusive to the trial and acts as a secondary HP bar.</p><p>Below, you can see exactly how Honor works in Path of Exile 2 and what to do about it ruining your runs in the Trial of Sekhemas.</p><h2>How Honor works in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>When you first begin the Trial of Sekhemas, you'll see a new HP bar has been put at the bottom of your screen. This is the Honor bar and it tells you exactly how much Honor you currently have, your max Honor, and what keys you have for the trial.</p><p>You'll start the Trial of Sekhemas with max Honor. Your character's max Honor is determined by the total of your Life and Energy Shield stats. So, for example, if you have 250 Life and Energy Shield each, you'll have a max of 500 Honor. Whenever you take damage from an enemy, your Honor will be reduced little by little. The Honor bar works parallel to your normal HP bar, so just because you lose Honor doesn't mean you also don't lose HP.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4427443-pathofexilescreenshot2025.01.14-16.03.49.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427443" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4427443-pathofexilescreenshot2025.01.14-16.03.49.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427443"></a><figcaption>Your max Honor is determined by Life and Energy Shield numbers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4427443-pathofexilescreenshot2025.01.14-16.03.49.21.png"></figure><p>If you hit zero Honor, your run in the Trial of Sekhemas ends, point blank. The Trial of Sekhemas is a one-life dungeon, so the two ways you can end your run is by dying normally by running out of HP or losing all of your Honor. A majority of the time, losing all of your Honor is how the trial will end as it's extremely difficult to get any Honor back once you've lost it.</p><p>Honor doesn't regenerate often throughout the Trial of Sekhemas, so taking damage is severely detrimental every time it happens. This is decent news for ranged classes and disastrous for melee characters. Ranged characters can stay at a distance to deal damage while melee characters have to ensure they're dodging perfectly to avoid getting hit too often.</p><p>The amount of Honor damage you take is dependent on what kind of damage the enemy is throwing at you and how much resistance you have to it. For example, if you have a low chaos resistance and the enemy throws poison at you, you'll take more Honor damage. On the flip side, if you have a high resistance to the elements and you're hit by lightning or fire, you won't lose as much Honor. The exact calculations for how much Honor damage you take per hit are extremely complicated, so we won't go too deep into the weeds on that.</p><p>It's also important to note that you take less Honor damage the closer you are to an enemy. So you want to try and stay close to enemies, even if you are a ranged character. Of course, you don't want to stay too close so that you're getting hit more often, as that would negate the benefits of less close range damage.</p><h2>Can you restore Honor in Path of Exile 2?</h2><p>Fortunately, there are some ways to restore Honor, either by a percentage or in its entirety.</p><p>The first way you can restore Honor is by using specific Djinn Boons. These are bonuses that can be applied to your character specifically during the Trial of Sekhemas. You can apply boons to your character by visiting Balbala in between trial rooms, who sells boons in exchange for Sacred Water.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4427446-pathofexilescreenshot2025.01.14-16.03.03.15.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427446" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4427446-pathofexilescreenshot2025.01.14-16.03.03.15.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427446"></a><figcaption>Balbala sells you useful Boons and Relics</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4427446-pathofexilescreenshot2025.01.14-16.03.03.15.png"></figure><p>Boons are classified as Minor or Major, depending on their effects. Minor Boons are sold for less Sacred Water but have weaker effects compared to Major Boons. One of the best Major Boons to purchase is Earned Honor, which costs 600 Sacred Water and restores a percentage of Honor for every trial room you complete.</p><p>In addition to applying boons, Honor can also be restored at fountains after a room's completion. If you approach the fountain and interact with it, you'll restore a percentage of Honor. However, a fountain isn't guaranteed to spawn after every room and doesn't restore a ton of Honor, so you don't want to rely on it too much.</p><p>The final way to gain back some Honor is by leveling up during the Trial of Sekhemas. If you level up your character, your Life and Energy Shield stats are increased. Since your max Honor is the sum of those two stats, you gain extra Honor depending on how much the stats went up as a result of your new level.</p><h2>How to reduce Honor damage in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>The final question you might have about Honor is if you can increase your resistance to it so you don't lose as much if you get hit.</p><p>Luckily, there are Relics you can equip that boost Honor resistance. Relics can be added to your character before you enter a Trial of Sekhemas room and some of them have terrific Honor effects. Relics can boost your Honor resistance as well as raise your max Honor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4427447-pathofexilescreenshot2025.01.14-16.02.28.04.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427447" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4427447-pathofexilescreenshot2025.01.14-16.02.28.04.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427447"></a><figcaption>Relics are a way to boost your Honor stats</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4427447-pathofexilescreenshot2025.01.14-16.02.28.04.png"></figure><p>\When you first start the Trial of Sekhemas, you'll only have one Relic to equip. However, as you progress through more rooms, more Relics can be added. Balbala also sells Relics you can purchase, which offer Honor boosts and bonuses.</p><p>Ultimately, though, you'll be battling with your Honor bar for the entirety of the Trial of Sekhemas. No matter how many Relics you have or what your max Honor is, if you take a string of hits in a trial room, you're likely going to have to start over from scratch eventually.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/save-the-saves<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The case we’re about to discuss is none other than the beautiful and critically acclaimed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Star Named EOS.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> In this article about console porting, we’ll discuss specifically the solutions we found to translate the save system. Without further ado, let’s jump right in..</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Star Named EOS,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the system operations are performed directly and synchronously without a hint of asynchronous interaction. This is quite an exciting task that presents many challenges. For example, PlayStation 5 works with saves through memory mount, which does not happen instantly. The critical point is that the saves will only be completed by unmounting the memory area. In fact, for PlayStation, you can use PlayerPrefs, which works similarly to memory mount, but all of this happens behind the scenes, out of our control. However, this approach has a significant drawback — the available memory volume is limited since the primary purpose of this feature is to save game settings. Therefore, the limits are pretty expected. However, since screenshots are used for saves, this limit will be insufficient, so the first save option remains primary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What about Xbox? Xbox currently uses GDK API as the main one, and to use it at the start of the project, synchronization with cloud data always takes place. This already affects another element of the project — initialization. But that’s not what we are here to discuss. The main idea of working with saves on Xbox is that each time you write or read, you need to open a container, perform the necessary operations, notify the GDK API about the changes (if any), and close the container.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What about the Switch? It is almost the same as on PlayStation: mounting and unmounting take time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How is data saved in the original game we are working on? Saves are created as follows: data is saved, a screenshot of the screen is taken, and it is recorded in the save. Each time a save is deleted or a new one is created, the data is reread.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We created a unified save system for this project as a single entry point for any platform. Each platform has its own SDK and methods for working with saves, so creating a unified system became essential for ensuring consistency. As a result, we made a single entry point script that works using the Adapter pattern and controls entities for each platform, determining which platform is in use and running the appropriate script.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, we have a more or less complete picture of our main challenges. What are they?</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The project code must be able to release the main thread without breaking the core execution logic.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We need to minimize the number of calls to our save system, as even asynchronous calls can cause freezes.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since we have asynchronous calls, we must ensure the main condition — only one call to the save system at a time.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A simple and quite effective solution is to use Task. Async. Why? Because it allows you to pause the original logic and resume it when needed. Is this the best solution in terms of project performance? No. Will it provide the fastest and most expected result? Yes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, this approach generates much additional code after compilation, but it gives us precisely the expected result. Now, we need to remove all direct calls to the file system and replace them with new calls to the "new save system implementation" that we developed on Task. Async.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After that, we rework all methods that call our save system methods to async so they can pause their execution until all save or load actions are completed. We also partially rework higher-level methods in the call hierarchy if necessary. Thus, the first most critical issue has been resolved.</span></p><p>A screenshot of The Star Named EOS. Image via Pingle Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What next?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this stage, we encountered an issue with Unity’s “Player Prefs.” To address it, we created a custom analog that works similarly but saves data to a file, allowing it to be used on any platform, including Switch. This solution was necessary because Nintendo Switch does not support Unity “Player Prefs” and can only save using the native Nintendo SDK.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, we had to minimize calls to the save system. The original project was implemented as follows: We have an analog of PlayerPrefs that is written to a file—a dictionary with save names that are used to access screenshots and save data. Every time reading, writing, or deleting files occurs, they are read from scratch. On PCs, especially with SSDs, this is not a problem, so optimization can be ignored, but on consoles with more than a dozen saves, this can lead to serious problems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are several solutions to this problem:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bundle a large amount of data and access the saves with a batch of operations (which requires reworking the original logic and may take a lot of time).</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Create a cache for already loaded saves and use cached data for repeated access.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second option was much more convenient to implement, so we chose it as the main one. It does not create additional interaction scenarios when there are dozens rewrites of one object or simultaneous read-and-write operations. Such situations might not be very obvious, but avoiding them from the start is better so they do not become a significant challenge later on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, we have one final challenge left — multiple simultaneous write, read, and delete operations. This is pretty easy to manage when using asynchronous calls. Each time we are about to work with a file, we can use an indicator, such as a semaphore or a simple variable that signals that the queue is still busy. Since we reworked the original logic for Task, async, our code awaits further calls, and a simple variable where we do an increment when the save operation starts and a decrement when it ends is sufficient. This way, we can ensure that multiple operations do not happen simultaneously, and the interaction logic eliminates competition at the entry point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hope you’ve had a good read and maybe learn something. Until next time...</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Stray Kit Studios, a studio that includes former developers of Age Of Empires, Borderlands and Bioshock, have revealed Wartorn, a real-time tactics roguelite in which two elven sisters pit spells and minions against a brace of fantasy opponents, including ogres. It's a smaller-scale, squad-managerial affair reminiscent of the ancient Myth: Fallen Lords, though the "painterly" art direction reminds me more of the impressionistic World War 1 fable 11-11: Memories Retold.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I come and go with "painterly" art direction in video games. Often, it just feels like an upmarket way of saying "looks a bit smudged", and smudginess isn't generally desirable in a game where you give soldiers waypoints. But Wartorn (not to be confused with venerable RTS <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/21304/wartorn/">WarTorn</a>) does look rather lovely, and the scenically concussed presentation seems to complement the ebb and flow of the game's elemental combos, environment destruction and physics interactions. Still, there's a slow-time mechanic if you feel overwhelmed. Here's a trailer.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Wartorn - Official Reveal Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2tt1bNPFk0U?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
I also like that Wartorn sounds quite story-driven, though I'm less enthused by the on-the-nose talk of moral choices. "Set in a fantasy realm torn apart by extremism and the unraveling of ancient bonds, Wartorn follows an extended family as they fight to reunite and survive," explains the press release. "Players will make tough decisions, from choosing who gets fed to deciding which lives can be saved, all while confronting the moral quandaries of violence and sacrifice."
</p><p>
As for the roguelite progression stuff - they're calling it "unique", but I don't really see how, based on the press release and trailer. Apparently it "rewards players for perseverance, offering heirlooms, hero upgrades, and new abilities that carry forward with each run", which sounds like business as usual for a liker or liter of rogues.
</p>
<p>
To give you a sense of the pedigree, Stray Kite's co-founder and chief creative officer is Paul Hellquist, former Bioshock lead designer and creative director on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a>. Co-founder and technical director Shovaen Patel was lead programmer for sparky tower defender Orcs Must Die and Age Of Empires Online - a defunct MMO which somebody called Brendan Caldwell <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-age-of-empires-online">rather liked</a>, an unreasonably long time ago. The studio have previously worked on projects for other companies, including Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep - which I myself reviewed for Edge and found pretty unexciting - and Fortnite. Wartorn is their very first original project.
</p>
<p>
Did you play Myth: The Fallen Lords? It was one of Bungie's old joints, before they got into man-shooting. I remember being obsessed with the units who could dual-wield and being sad when I got them all killed. Hopefully, I'll be a better custodian for Wartorn's elf sisters. They seem pretty capable. Wartorn launches into early access in spring 2025 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/">Steam</a> and the Epic Game Store (EGS storepage link to follow, once it's live).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I’ve been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I’m going away next month.”</p><p>Fortune’s Run has been in early access for over a year at a price of $20. It currently has just over one hundred user reviews with a Steam rating of 90 percent. It’s due to receive more updates and content, but there’s no telling when, if ever, the game will actually be completed at this point. “It’s a shame, but it’s the consequences of my actions,” the developer continued. “I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn’t going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that. So the game isn’t TOTALLY dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it’s unclear what will happen.”</p><p>The game is a boomer shooter take on PC classics like <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Thief</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>with the grimy post-apocalyptic punk visual style of the early <em>Fallout</em> games. It’s mission-based instead of an open-ended sandbox, making it a unique blend of old-school PC gaming sensibilities. <em>Fortune’s Run</em> is the kind of game about which people constantly write things like, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmersiveSim/comments/16y788y/how_is_nobody_talking_about_fortunes_run/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmersiveSim/comments/16y788y/how_is_nobody_talking_about_fortunes_run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How is nobody talking about Fortune’s Run?</a></span>” It was already a cult hit with the potential to be a lowkey GOTY-contender whenever it came out of early access.</p><p>“I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there’s absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it’s just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time,” Dizzie wrote. “I want to underline that I’m no longer in financial dire straits since our game actually sold OK, so I should be able to afford rent once I get out, so there’s a chance that if you wait a few years I’ll be able to cap off the release. In fact, there’s not very much content left to work on, I’ve been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time.”</p><p>Before going to prison, the developer left players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805320&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with one last update</a></span>. It includes new missions, story sequences, puzzles, objects in the environments to interact with, and “hundreds upon hundreds of bug fixes.” However, it’ll break players’ existing saves and there’s no one to QA it. It’s unclear if Dizzie will be communicating with fans again before development goes on hiatus or if this is the last communication for some time. The game remains available to buy on Steam.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Few gaming publishers are more fiercely protective of their IP than Nintendo. In the past year alone, Nintendo has reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-intensifies-crackdown-on-youtube-emulator-channels-report/1100-6526834/" data-ref-id="1100-6526834">cracked down on YouTube emulator channels </a>that featured the company's games and played detective <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">to locate and identify an alleged Switch pirate</a>. During a recent appearance at an event run by Japan’s Association of Copyright for Computer Software, Nintendo's patent attorney Koji Nishiura took the time to walk through the company's stance on emulation.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/kikakuthetower/250112a#i-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Denfaminicogamer</a> and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-attorney-weighs-in-on-what-makes-emulators-illegal/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Nishiura suggested that the emulators by themselves may not be illegal, but the way they are used can determine if they are breaking the law. To illustrate his point, Nishiura noted that emulators may copy proprietary programs or disable security encryptions, both of which are activities that Nintendo frowns upon. He also said that emulators can be used to play pirated copies of Nintendo's games, which the company still considers to be illegal.</p><p>Nintendo has emulated several of its own games for its modern systems, which clearly falls within the company's rights. However, many classic games released on the oldest systems--including NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and GameCube--aren't readily available to legally play from Nintendo itself. Some emulator hosts have argued that by maintaining a library of these games, they are preserving a piece of video game history.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Nintendo doesn't seem to share that view. Although the company is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-lawsuit-shuts-down-switch-emulator-yuzu-and-3ds-emulator-citra/1100-6521589/" data-ref-id="1100-6521589">laser-focused on shutting down Switch and 3DS emulators</a>, it also prevented the Dolphin GameCube and Wii emulator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dolphin-emulator-team-abandons-plan-to-launch-it-on-steam/1100-6516124/" data-ref-id="1100-6516124">from launching on Steam</a>. Additionally, Nintendo sued <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-suing-creators-of-switch-emulator-says-tears-of-the-kingdom-was-pirated-1-million-times-pre-launch/1100-6521417/" data-ref-id="1100-6521417">the creators of a Switch emulator</a> and contended that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/" data-ref-id="1900-6418063">The Legend of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom</a> was pirated 1 million times before launch. Even though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-announced-for-january-16-as-switch-2-reveal-rumors-heat-up/1100-6528766/" data-ref-id="1100-6528766">the reveal of Switch 2</a> may come as soon this week, Nintendo isn't likely to stop going after emulator creators anytime soon.</p>

			<p>There’s a really specific sort of nostalgia that hits me like a truck whenever the <em>Tales </em>series is mentioned. I grew up hovering around this series of JRPGs, but never playing them. Other series like <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>and <em>Final Fantasy </em>caught my attention, but I would still spot <em>Tales </em>in the periphery. The series seemingly spawning a new mainline entry almost every year, combined with me hardly following news of the franchise, led to this sort of awe I would experience whenever I continuously discovered more and more <em>Tales </em>games that I had no idea even existed. As I’ve gotten older and started digging deeper into games and series I never gave a shot earlier in life, I’m finally getting around to playing a lot of these <em>Tales</em> games that only existed as ideas and myths to me. <em>Tales of Graces f </em>was one such myth – a Wii game I barely knew existed, which became a PS3 game I downloaded but never touched, and finally, it arrives in my life for the third time as a massively remastered and polished multi-platform re-release. And with this kind of care and quality, I’m hoping every entry in the series can eventually re-materialize in my life this way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tales of Graces f Remastered – Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGlgsKCOSE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Narrative and character arcs are a huge focus of <em>Tales of Graces f – </em>although things seem deceptively lighthearted and simple in the opening hours of the game. You play as 11-year-old Asbel Lhant, spending lackadaisical days in his Lhant, which him and his younger brother Hubert are heirs to the throne of. Neither are concerned with that inheritance, though, because they’re far busier figuring out what to do when they encounter a girl with purple hair and amnesia in the middle of a flowery meadow outside of town. Asbel does his best to take care of her and help her remember who she is, with help from his sickly friend Cheria. As drama and disaster strike the trio, though, the game flings us seven years into the future where they’re caught in the middle of a disastrous clash between three powerful kingdoms.</p>


<p>Of the many quality-of-life upgrades made to <em>Tales of Graces f Remastered, </em>the new option to swap between the original English or Japanese voiceover is huge in helping the story and its characters properly pluck at your heartstrings. For some gamers, the dated and slightly stiff English dub of what was originally a 2011 Nintendo Wii game might be more cheesy than charming, so being able to play with the Japanese voiceover enabled is a boon. Especially when this new version of the game has added full subtitles for mid-combat and post-battle dialogue, ensuring you won’t miss any details no matter which language you set the audio to. The cheesiness of a dated JRPG English dub is well worth experiencing in my opinion, though, so I happily plugged along with that dub for most of my run through the game.</p>


<p>Another immediately noticeable and extremely welcome change in <em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em> is the incredible job they’ve done upgrading and enhancing the visuals of the game. Don’t expect a <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth </em>treatment or any kind of wildly different approach to the original aesthetic of the game – the designs, art-style, and vibe of the original version are perfectly preserved. With sharper textures, more defined lighting, and a resolution way higher than what was originally rendered on the Wii or even the PS3 re-release, this version of the game feels like the way it was intended to look from the beginning. A lot of modern remasters of old RPGs hit a weird uncanny valley where the ultra-high resolution and super sharp textures kill a lot of the charm of the original version’s aesthetic – but I felt no such thing here. This is the perfect window into a bygone era of JRPGs that celebrates the charm of it’s original aesthetic while also polishing it to a perfectly balanced degree for a modern, more future-proofed release.</p>
<p><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em> packs in a lot of other welcome quality-of-life changes – for main quests, side quests, and timed cutscene events, you now have icon marks visible that show you where those objectives are and how far you are from them. You’ve also got the ability to use a new Dash function to move faster than before through the map, and even the ability to disable Encounters when you aren’t in the mood for random mob battles. Skits, the iconic “bonus conversations” of the <em>Tales </em>franchise that give you a sillier look into the banter between your party, now have new dialogue controls so you can speed up or skip through text during them. A collection of skits that were only available in the Japanese version of the game have also been included in this release with English translation for the first time. There’s a massive amount of other enhancements too – like new audio settings, the difficulty-modifying “Grade shop” available from the beginning, colourblind support for certain puzzles in the game, and so much more. Plus – every wacky piece of costume DLC from the original release is included for free.</p>

<p><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em> is an incredible JRPG experience. Diving into the classic real-time arena combat and the endearingly goofy Skits that made this franchise so iconic is such a treat. To have so many ways to customize the experience on the fly and make it even easier to dig into my favourite parts of the game is a blast. Whether I’m trying to breeze through a dungeon to get to the next story beat or I want to dig into some Artes grinding and savor every battle, <em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em> lets me do just that. It’s a beautiful remaster of a game I should’ve played long ago, and one that feels on par with even the latest entries in this long-running franchise.</p>

			<p>Despite having attained more success in recent years in the West following a long period of time when new entries in the series took years to hit North America and Europe or never did, Bandai Namco has been pretty conservative regarding remasters of older entries in the Tales series. Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-vesperia-definitive-edition/">Tales of Vesperia: Definitive Edition</a>, the Japanese publisher only teased that older games would be hitting modern gaming platforms and PC in the future, only recently revealing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-series-remasters-consistently/">full-blown initiative</a> that will see the constant release of remasters. The first remaster spearheading this initiative is Tales of Graces f Remastered, a very solid remaster that leaves the original experience almost intact, enhancing it with welcome quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250108190600_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of game content, Tales of Graces f Remastered doesn't feature anything new, and the game's main story and the Lineage &amp; Legacies epilogue that was added with the PlayStation 3 port of the original Wii release have been left untouched. As such, players will once again get to experience Asbel's fateful encounter with the mysterious girl he later names Sophie, the childhood promise he makes with her and the prince of the kingdom of Windor Richard, the tragedy that made him abandon his duty as the future lord of Lhant to become a knight, and the journey he makes across the world and beyond to protect all he holds dear.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the story is possibly the worst feature of Tales of Graces f and, having been left unchanged, of the remaster as well. It isn't bad by any means, but everything that is set up in the first few hours of the game, including the personal conflict between some of the characters and the larger political conflict between different nations, is eventually resolved with some of the usual JRPGs' tropes, including the power of friendship. It is a shame, as some of the events in the first few hours of the game held some potential, but the execution leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the average story is salvaged by an incredibly strong cast, which includes the aforementioned main character Asbel, Sophie, and Richard, Asbel's estranged brother Hubert, who was forced out of Lhant to prevent a succession crisis, childhood friend Cheria, the knight captain Malik and the cheerful Amarcian technician Pascal. While not all of them have the same degree of involvement or development in the main plot, although every one of them gets a development arc of sorts, they are all rather charming, as are their interactions, mostly in the Groovy Chat skits, a returning staple in the series. These interactions become even better in the short Lineage and Legacies epilogue, also thanks to a bigger involvement of Richard in the party dynamics that lead to some hilarious exchanges.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250114224347_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If Tales of Graces f Remastered delivers a predictable tale, it does not fail to provide an extremely fun gameplay, possibly one of the best in the entire series. For a long time before getting unified and later becoming part of Bandai Namco as a whole, the Tales development studio was divided into two different teams - colloquially known as Team Destiny and Team Symphonia - which handled the development of the 2D and 3D entries in the series respectively. Tales of Graces is the only 3D game developed by the 2D-focused team and it shows, as the game is, in my opinion, the only 3D entry in the series that emulates the series' original gameplay the best. While the removal of a proper world map in favor of an interconnected world impacts the sense of scale considerably, as the roads connecting towns and dungeons are extremely linear and don't offer much in terms of content outside of treasure chests, optional Discoveries that provide some information on the world and visible enemy symbols, the linearity somewhat favors the experience nowadays, making for a more compact game that doesn't waste much time with traveling through an empty open-world map. Location design is just as straightforward and doesn't hold that many surprises, although dungeon design is decisively better than other more recent entries in the series, as it features some simple puzzles, some of them easier to complete in the remaster as color recognition is no longer required to solve them.</p>
<p>The star of Tales of Graces f Remastered gameplay is undoubtedly its combat system, the Style Shift Linear Motion Battle System, which served as the basis for the combat system used in later entries in the series such as Tales of Zestiria and Tales of Berseria. While enemies are fought on a 3D battlefield, it is only possible to move on the same axis as the targeted enemy unless using the Free Run mechanic, which is not particularly effective due to its slow speed and cost in terms of combat resources. This, however, doesn't mean that there are no defensive options besides the classic guard, and it is possible to backstep and sidestep to avoid enemy attacks. If done with the right timing, the character will also recover some Chain Capacity, a self-restoring resource that is used to perform Artes. CC, which comes in two different values, Min and Max which indicate how much CC is available at the start of battle, and the maximum possible value, is tied to the critical hit mechanics. Unlike in the vast majority of JRPGs, critical hits are not percentage-based, but happen when a gauge has been filled in combat, and every time a critical hit is performed, there's not only the high chance of stunning an enemy, which is very beneficial to keep the offense going, as hitting a stunned enemy with a base 1 CC attack restores a huge amount of CC, but also increases by one point the minimum value. All these mechanics are tightly woven, and mastering them makes combat feel extremely rewarding.</p>
<p>Even if one were to play Tales of Graces f Remastered at a low difficulty without engaging with the mechanics outlined above, the game would be extremely fun to play. While, visually, enemy design is nothing to write home about, their combat design is excellent, especially for bosses, and dodging their attacks by using the evasion mechanics properly is very satisfying. Character combat design is just as great, as every playable character essentially has two fighting styles that can be seamlessly combined, for the most part. Asbel, for example, can fight with his sword sheathed with his A Style Artes and fully drawn with his B Style, for example; Hubert uses his double-sided blade with his A Style Artes, which become twin guns with his B Style Artes; spellcasters like Malik, Cheria, Pascal, and Richard can combine the physical Artes of their A Style and the spells of their B Style to reduce casting times. With the fast execution of the vast majority of A Style Artes and the fact that it is possible to quickly sidestep after their quick animations have ended, Tales of Graces f Remastered feels snappy and fun at all skill levels.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250115121951_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of character customization, Tales of Graces f Remastered features some rather unique mechanics that leverage one of the series staples, Titles. Each title in the game, which is obtained by either story progression, leveling up, using Artes a set amount of time, or accomplishing a variety of feats such as traveling a certain distance or spending a certain amount of Gald, comes with five different skills between stats improvements, passive skills, Artes, and Mystic Artes, the powerful cinematic attacks that can be unleashed during this game's version of the traditional Overlimits mechanics, Eleth Rise. While the system is simple and doesn't offer a lot in terms of pure customization and character building, it makes players engage more with the game's combat mechanics, rewarding them as they take advantage of them over the course of the adventure. Providing players more customization options is the Dualize system that allows players to fuse together two items, which can be used to enhance gear and produce Gems sporting a variety of special effects, including CC values boosts, but this is a system that not too many will fully take advantage of, as it is a little obscure and not properly explained in-game.</p>
<p>While Tales of Graces f Remastered doesn't introduce any major change to the original, the quality of life improvements make it a great release for both newcomers and returning players. Besides making color-based puzzles clearable even without color recognition, the remaster features a slew of other new features, including being able to access the Grade Shop on the first playthrough, the ability to switch on and off some of the features it offers at will, such as the experience and SP multipliers, Destination Icons for main and time-sensitive sub-quests, the latter especially welcome as it is easy to miss side-quests in the original, dash and enemy toggle which can speed up progression a lot, an auto-save function, the ability to retry even normal battles upon defeat, and the ability to skip to the next line of dialogue during Groovy Chats.</p>
<p>Tales of Graces f Remastered also features enhanced visuals, although the improvements are relegated to a mere resolution bump, as the vast majority of visual elements, like character models, lighting, and textures, don't seem to have received a major overhaul. Still, this isn't a major issue, as the game's colorful visual style has aged incredibly well, and some of the low-resolution textures don't look out of place even at 4K resolution. Besides resolution options, the PC version also offers some graphics settings to tweak at three framerate caps - 30, 60, and 120 FPS. Being an undemanding title, Tales of Graces f Remastered ran extremely well on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) at 4K resolution and locked 120 FPS, and I expected less powerful system configurations to run the game just as well at resolutions higher than 1080p.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Tales of Graces f Remastered doesn't add much to the original experience, but the choice improvements it introduces make for a slightly more enjoyable game. While the story isn't all that exciting, the charming cast and the excellent gameplay make the remaster one that is worth getting for both series fans and those who may have never experienced Asbel's adventure before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/promise-mascot-agency-voice-actors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Paradise Killer&nbsp;</em>developer Promise Mascot Agency has announced some of the voice actors it's managed to score for new game&nbsp;<em>Promise Mascot Agency</em>, and the list of names is pretty crazy already.</p>

<p>In a Steam news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2585830/view/514072769031307363" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the studio reveals five of the actors that will be playing characters in the open-ended narrative adventure, and you'll almost certainly recognize some of the names on the list.</p>

<p>First up is Takaya Kuroda, who's best known for voicing&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>'s Kazuma Kiryu. Kaizen says Kuroda "just turned up to the audition" and that the studio "didn't even dream to ask for him", but he's voicing player character Michi, which feels appropriate given Michi is a "stoic" ex-yakuza.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/promise-mascot-agency-voice-actors-dialogue.jpg?itok=pk0ldjki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/promise-mascot-agency-voice-actors-dialogue.jpg?itok=EzgPv3n0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ex-yakuza Michi will be voiced by Takaya Kuroda, best known for voicing ex-yakuza Kazuma Kiryu.</figcaption></figure><p>The next big name on the list is&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>'s Ayano Shibuya, who voices Purah in both that game and its sequel&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. She's voicing assistant manager and "chaos goblin"&nbsp;Pinky in&nbsp;<em>Promise Mascot Agency</em>.</p>

<p>Bizarrely, industry legend Shuhei Yoshida, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation" rel="nofollow">recently left PlayStation</a> after 31 years with the company, will be voicing "resident veteran gamer and arcade owner" MonouGe. Yoshida did say he didn't want to vanish from the industry, but this was not on my bingo card.</p>

<p><em>Chainsaw Man</em>'s Eri Saito, who Kaizen says also voiced a member of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>'s Beauty and the Beast Unit, will join the cast as Matriarch Shimazu.</p>

<p>Rounding off the voice cast announcements for today is none other than&nbsp;<em>Deadly Premonition&nbsp;</em>auteur SWERY, whose real name is Hidetaka Suehiro. He'll be playing "reformed ex-biker-gang-member priest" Kannushi-kun.</p>

<p>A new job listing by Guerrilla Games suggests that the developers hope to attract more than 1 million players globally to their upcoming Horizon Multiplayer title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/horizon-multiplayer-game-live-service-player-count-ambitions-guerrilla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a> via (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horizon/horizon-zero-dawns-multiplayer-spinoff-has-big-dreams-as-guerrilla-confirms-its-hoping-to-attract-more-than-1-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), a new <a href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/join/senior-platform-engineer-decima/7779018002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> for a senior platform engineer at Guerrilla Games’ Online Infrastructure team has seemingly provided new details about the upcoming online multiplayer title based in the Horizon universe. One of the job requirements for this position is for the applicant to have experience in “building and operating multi-service, 1M+ user globally distributed systems across multiple public cloud providers”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though the listing hints that Guerrilla Games could expect over 1 million players for their Horizon Multiplayer game, the game itself is not mentioned. However, considering they do not currently have any other multiplayer games in the works (that have been confirmed), it can be speculated that it is the Horizon online title. At the same time, the million-player user base might be an upper limit to ensure the server can smoothly handle the influx of players during the launch period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Horizon Online Multiplayer title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in 2022, announcing, “A new internal team is developing a separate Online Project set in the Horizon’s universe.” Since then, no official announcements or news have arrived about the game; however, a recent job listing suggested that the online Horizon game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Horizon Zero Dawn movie was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced by Sony at CES 2025</a>. Also, according to a new claim, LEGO Horizon Adventures <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could come to Xbox in a few months</a>. What are your thoughts on Guerrilla aspiring to bring more than one million players to their Horizon online multiplayer game?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A isn’t being built to take advantage of the hardware improvements of the Nintendo Switch 2. That’s according to Jeff Grubb on his latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/TfkNfMonxoc?t=3942s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Last of the Nintendogs</a>” episode.</p>



<p>Grubb said that when the next Pokémon Presents takes place—likely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-pokemon-presents-date-seemingly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Pokemon Day</a>—all of the games shown will be developed for the current Switch console.</p>



<p>“I did hear that everything in that Pokémon Direct will be positioned as ‘These games are Switch 1 games’,” Grubb said. “They will work on Switch 2, but there will not be anything that is obviously made for Switch 2. Which is normal for The Pokémon Company.”</p>



<p>His co-host, Mike Minotti, seemed surprised by that with a belief that “of all that games that should get a performance boost on the Switch 2” it should be the next Pokémon game.</p>







<p>Announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during last year’s Pokémon Presents</a> on Pokémon Day, Pokémon Z-A is the follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus from 2022. The game features “a new adventure awaits within Lumiose City, where an urban redevelopment plan is under way to shape the city into a place that belongs to both people and Pokémon.”</p>



<p>More on the game is expected to be shown, including the announcement of a release date, during the upcoming Pokémon Presents event in February. There will also be new information on upcoming plans for Pokémon Go along with the expected surprises that always seem to appear during the events.</p>

                <p>The newest update for PUBG brings back a popular, fan-favorite feature--Recall. With the new 33.2 update, players on the Sanhok map can utilize the Recall system, which allows them to bring back fallen teammates mid-match. Recall was originally added to PUBG in 2023 before being removed.</p><p>Now, however, Krafton is bringing the feature back. "We heard your feedback!" the developer said in the official patch notes for update 33.2</p><p>Players can use the Recall system every 2.5 minutes, though the ability to bring back fallen teammates goes away from Phase 6 onwards. The Recall system also works with custom matches.</p><p>When Recall was originally added to PUBG, players had to acquire a special item, the Blue Chip, and take it to a special location, to revive fallen allies. Players could also pick up Blue Chips belonging to enemies to prevent them from coming back to the match, thus adding new layers of strategy. Whether or not the Recall system will change in any way for its forthcoming re-introduction is unknown.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJSdDPhABJ4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pJSdDPhABJ4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Patch 33.2 also brings back the Loot Truck, which is a heavily armed vehicle that roams around the map and drops valuable loot when damaged. Matches begin with four Loot Trucks that travel on predetermined routes.</p><p>If players completely destroy a Loot Truck, it will drop all of its cargo, but players will want to be far away when this happens, as the 10-meter blast radius can knock down or kill anyone caught inside it.</p><p>You can <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/8119" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see the full patch notes for PUBG update 33.2 on the PUBG website.</a></p>

<p>"Classic games and the mission to safeguard them for future generations have always been at the core of our work. Over the past decade, we've honed our expertise in this area. The GOG Preservation Program, which ensures compatibility for over 100 games and delivers hundreds of enhancements, is just one example of this commitment. We were thrilled to see the Program warmly received not only by our players but also by our partners and the gaming industry as a whole."</p><p>He continued: "As a European company, we feel a responsibility to lead in preserving gaming heritage. Joining EFGAMP reinforces this commitment. Our next step is to expand institutional collaboration with museums and governmental and non-governmental organisations worldwide. We hope our experience will contribute meaningfully to their efforts. We are also discussing exciting new game preservation projects, which we look forward to sharing soon."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyper-light-breaker-devs-promise-fixes-for-performance-and-accessibility.1082904/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Heart Machine's action roguelite&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>has officially launched in Early Access, and the developer has promised fixes for some of the game's most pressing issues by the end of the week.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s Steam review rating is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently sitting at Mixed</a>, with negative reviews often pointing to problems like accessibility restrictions and performance dips.</p>

<p>Now, in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heartmachine.bsky.social/post/3lfqn5mpqnk22" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a thread</a> on social media platform Bluesky, Heart Machine has promised that fixes for "performance issues and accessibility requests", such as mouse sensitivity options and the ability to invert the game's camera, will be introduced "by the end of the week".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-characters.jpg?itok=M66FpfHv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-characters.jpg?itok=80lHaCM1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fixes are on the way for some of&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s most pressing problems.</figcaption></figure><p>Addressing the Mixed review rating, Heart Machine says that Early Access games necessarily "take on the risk of negative early reviews and feedback" owing to different players' "expectations" for such a release.</p>

<p>The developer calls feedback received about&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s performance and accessibility problems "extremely reasonable" and says that receiving "large quantities" of such feedback "actually helps us determine how to prioritize future updates".</p>

<p>In closing, Heart Machine says it's heartening (that's my cheap pun, not theirs) to see accessibility concerns being raised, as the studio was "already planning" to add these features and the fixes required are "straightforward".</p>

<p>A more specific timeframe hasn't been given for the fixes to these issues, but given that we're already on Wednesday, the end of the week is fast approaching. We'll likely see an update in the next few days.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is, it's the third game by Heart Machine, following on from 2016's&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-style action-adventure game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter" rel="nofollow">Hyper Light Drifter</a>&nbsp;</em>and 2021's parkour platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/solar-ash" rel="nofollow"><em>Solar Ash</em></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike its predecessors,&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is a roguelite that's designed to be replayed, and it supports co-op play too. You'll traverse a variety of procedurally-generated worlds with "incredible freedom", slaying enemies and gathering loot to create unique loadouts.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

In them, Batman and Superman show up to finish Braniac off and reveal that the Justice League members the player killed were actually just clones. Everyone except Wonder Woman seemingly, who ended up getting killed at the hands of the Superman clone. Batman’s pivotal death? Also a clone. It was all part of the caped crusader’s master plan, apparently. It sounds about as well put together as the live-service pitch for the underlying game. </p><p>The Suicide Squad members remove their bomb implants and leave the planet to explore outer space, while the remaining Justice League members travel to all of the universes Braniac ruined to set things right and “atone.” The whole thing last less than two minutes, and despite being entirely an exposition dump, still feels like it leaves a lot unexplained. It’s also hard to know how much ofthis was Rocksteady’s original plan for the story’s year-one conclusion, and how much of it was cobbled together last-minute as the studio pivots to new projects. </p><p>“That was the most disappointing ending I’ve seen,” wrote one commenter on YouTube. “Pissed off the entire fandom, sullied their legacy,  only for it to go the ‘none of it mattered’ route just for the sake live gaming and money,” wrote another. Many pointed out that Robin is also technically dead in the Arkhamverse now too. “I did kindaaaa hope that they would go out with bang but obv that didnt happen, just killed brainiac and im more confused then satisfied,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1i18yte/that_was_kinda_ass_ngl/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1i18yte/that_was_kinda_ass_ngl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> a player on Reddit. Even some players on the game’s official Discord who loved <em>Suicide Squad</em>’s gameplay and have stuck with it for nearly a year were let down by the ending. </p><p>The bizarre clone twist caps of nearly 12 months of rough going for a big-budget blockbuster from one of the most acclaimed studios in games. Bad reviews and fan frustrations with the base campaign’s main story rolled into underwhelming post-launch content plans that offered very little in the way of fresh mission types or new story beats. The new playable characters rotated into each season, beginning with the Joker and ending with Deathstroke, also didn’t win players back. </p><p>By June, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893?_gl=1*zkd93a*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjk1MDQyOS45MS4xLjE3MzY5NTI4MDUuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893?_gl=1*zkd93a*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjk1MDQyOS45MS4xLjE3MzY5NTI4MDUuNjAuMC4w"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a></span> that Rocksteady had already pivoted to other projects, like a <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> director’s cut, and in recent months the studio has suffered two rounds of layoffs.

Where that leaves the <em>Batman: Arkham</em> universe remains to be seen. A VR spinoff, <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow </em>arrived just last year to decent reviews. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The official Conan the Barbarian gameplay trailer will be debuted on tomorrow’s Kombat Kast, giving fans a deeper dive on this powerful fighter. Release timing and availability for T-1000 Terminator will be announced at a later date, Warner Bros. said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator is the final DLC character added to the gory fighting game as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and, later this month, Conan the Barbarian. Fans have been wondering for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s sales success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For its part, Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat 1 has sold more than four million copies, and in November Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady">the company plans to double down on just four titles, including Mortal Kombat</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago">NetherRealm chief Ed Boon said the developer decided on its next game three years ago, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, although neither NetherRealm nor owner and publisher Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You even help a living finger work through anger issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Promise Mascot Agency is punching above its weight is in the voice cast department. It’s nabbed PlayStation developer legend Shuhei Yoshida in his first ever video game voice role, and the announcement comes hot on the heels of Yoshida’s last day at Sony.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">At farewell party yesterday 😆 <a href="https://t.co/hpiPWQIO1z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hpiPWQIO1z</a></p>— Shuhei Yoshida (@yosp) <a href="https://twitter.com/yosp/status/1879264451079315564?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Shuhei Yoshida worked on PlayStation from the very beginning, playing a key role in the original console’s success from 1993. He was one of the more public-facing PlayStation executives while President of SIE Worldwide Studios from 2008 to 2019, championing indie and VR success in particular. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-retiring-from-sony-in-january">Yoshida announced his exit from Sony in November during his 31st year at PlayStation</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on,” he explained at the time. “You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Yoshida long-term plan remains up in the air, in the short-term he’s turned to video game voice acting, and that's where Promise Mascot Agency comes in. Yoshida plays Monouge, an odd-looking green-skinned former mascot who is opening their own game center.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida isn’t the only big name joining the Promise Mascot Agency voice cast. Yakuza: Like A Dragon’s Takaya Kuroda, who plays series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, and Legend of Zelda’s Ayano Shibuya also star, as do Eri Saito (Chainsaw Man, Metal Gear Solid 4, Way of the Samurai 3) and Swery, developer of Deadly Premonition, The Good Life, and Spy Fiction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see what Yoshida and co sound like in-game in the exclusive trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can’t believe that our weird game managed to attract such a strong voice cast,” said game director Oli Clarke Smith.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When our lead Japanese localiser, Roppyaku Tsurumi, told us that Kuroda-san had auditioned, we just about lost our minds. All of the cast have brought our group of misfits to life wonderfully.
