The Far Cry strategy board game takes players back to one of the most memorable locales from the video games: Far Cry 3's Rook Islands. Far Cry 3 took the top spot in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-far-cry-games-ranked/1100-6496072/" data-ref-id="1100-6496072">our series ranking</a>, so it's pretty cool that Funforge collaborated with Ubisoft to turn the iconic open-world FPS into a tabletop strategy game.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3VJ3F53?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Far Cry: Escape from Rook Islands</a> is designed as a reinterpretation of Far Cry 3, so it has the same premise: You and up to three friends are stranded on the beautiful but dangerous tropical islands controlled by the fan-favorite villain Vaas Monetenegro.</p><p>The board game features eight story-driven missions. The combat system is card-based with a tactical bent that requires you to consider each move when squaring off against the Acolytes of Vashna and other threats. As you can see in the picture above, the game comes with a bunch of different components. It has numerous overarching systems, including experience points for leveling up, upgrading weapons, crafting potions, and gear management. Each playable character has their own unique specialties to promote teamwork. A Friendly Fire mode can be used to make the missions more challenging.</p><p>Far Cry: Escape from Rook Islands is fully playable solo, too.</p><hr><h2>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice - Strategy Board Game</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379652-acbrotherhood.png" data-ref-id="1300-4379652" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379652-acbrotherhood.png" data-ref-id="1300-4379652"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4379652-acbrotherhood.png"></figure><p>If you're bummed about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">Assassin's Creed Shadows delay</a> until February 14, you could pass the time by getting together with some friends to play the official tabletop game. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B59Z8D4Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice</a></strong> is on sale for 50% off, dropping the price from $80 to $40. This deal is even better when you consider that the game was still sold for its original $140 list price as recent as July of this year.</p><p>Brotherhood of Venice tells an original story within the Assassin's Creed universe during the Italian Renaissance. It features beloved characters from the video games and new characters created by Synapses Games; the publisher collaborated with Ubisoft to make an authentic Assassin's Creed experience. If you like tabletop strategy games and Assassin's Creed, Brotherhood of Venice is a serious bargain at this price.</p><p>The replayable campaign is split into 26 quick chapters, with each run lasting 30-90 minutes on average. You and up to three friends are tasked with investigating and assassinating enemies of the Brotherhood.</p><p>Brotherhood of Venice is designed as a cooperative experience, but the ability to play solo by controlling two Assassins was built into the game. The five playable Assassins are custom-molded miniatures. As shown in the image above, the miniatures are unpainted, but you can paint them with the help of an acrylic paint set, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HUAL-Professional-Students-Beginners-Christmas/dp/B0B2WNG3B1?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this budget-friendly starter kit from Amazon</a>.</p><p>Along with the miniatures, the box contains a gameboard, cardboard character standees, dice, cards, and an instruction booklet.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-retro-gaming-hoodies-zelda-super-mario-prime-big-deal-days-2024/2900-5838/">Official Nintendo Retro Hoodies Are 20% In Amazon's Early Big Deal Days Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/lego-set-prime-big-deal-days-amazon-deals/2900-5823/">Best Lego Deals At Amazon Ahead Of Prime Big Deal Days</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-prime-big-deal-days-deals/2900-5817/">Best Nintendo Switch Console, Game, And Merch Deals Ahead Of Prime Big Deal Days</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-prime-big-deal-days-deals/2900-5816/">Best PS5 Deals Ahead Of Prime Big Deal Days Sale At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-complete-calvin-and-hobbes-is-on-sale-for-best-price-in-years-for-prime-big-deal-days/1100-6526922/">The Complete Calvin And Hobbes Is On Sale For Best Price In Years For Prime Big Deal Days</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/binding-of-isaac-strategy-card-game-is-ridiculously-cheap-at-amazon-for-prime-big-deal-days/1100-6526924/">Binding Of Isaac Strategy Card Game Is Ridiculously Cheap At Amazon For Prime Big Deal Days</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-has-big-discounts-on-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-more-square-enix-games/1100-6526819/">Amazon Has Big Discounts On Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth And More Square Enix Games</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-deluxe-illustrated-book-box-set-lotr-collector-edition/1100-6525568/">Lavish New Lord Of The Rings Illustrated Book Box Set Is 25% Off At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>All future Halo games will be developed in Unreal Engine 5, and will be created by a new studio at Xbox, sort of. Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced on Sunday night</a>, during the Halo World Championships, that developer 343 Industries will be changing its name to Halo Studios to signify a “new dawn” for the Halo franchise.</p>



<p>In addition, it was revealed that Halo Studios has multiple games in development.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-why-the-change-to-unreal-engine-5-for-halo">Why The Change To Unreal Engine 5 For Halo?</h2>



<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries,” studio head Pierre Hintze said. “Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of&nbsp;how&nbsp;we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p>



<p>As part of that change, Halo games will no longer use the Slipspace Engine that was created specifically for Halo Infinite. This opens up developers to work on the new games as opposed to simply upkeep the engine itself. The move to Unreal Engine 5 for Halo will allow for better development games for fans thanks to the benefits the engine offers developers.</p>



<p>“Respectfully, some components of Slipspace are almost 25 years old,” said studio art director Chris Matthews via Xbox Wire. “Although 343 were developing it continuously, there are aspects of Unreal that Epic has been developing for some time, which are unavailable to us in Slipspace – and would have taken huge amounts of time and resources to try and replicate.”</p>



<p>“We had a disproportionate focus on trying to create the conditions to be successful in servicing&nbsp;Halo Infinite,” Hintze said. “[But switching to Unreal] allows us to put all the focus on making multiple new experiences at the highest quality possible.”</p>



<p>As far as the new games in development, Halo Studios says they’ll release when the company feels they’re at the right state to be released. </p>



<p>What do you think of the changes at the former 343 Industries, now Halo Studios? Does the move of Halo to Unreal Engine 5 have you excited about its future? Join the discussion below or at the official Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

Chapter 2: 343 Industries. Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of how we make <em>Halo</em> games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p><p><em>Halo</em> games previously ran on Halo Studios’ proprietary Slipspace Engine, which required a large portion of staff to upkeep.</p><p>“We believe that the consumption habits of gamers have changed—the expectations of how fast their content is available,” said Hintze. “On <em><a title="Games > Halo Infinite [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a></em>, we were developing a tech stack that was supposed to set us up for the future, and games at the same time.”</p><p>Halo Studios chief operating officer Elizabeth van Wyck added, “The way we made <em>Halo</em> games before doesn’t necessarily work as well for the way we want to make games for the future. So part of the conversation we had was about how we help the team focus on making games, versus making the tools and the engines.”</p><p>Adopting Unreal Engine 5 also means Halo Studios can create games with a focus that can satisfy fans, even setting up multiple games to create different games simultaneously.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Studio art director Chris Matthews explained, “Respectfully, some components of Slipspace are almost 25 years old. Although 343 were developing it continuously, there are aspects of Unreal that Epic has been developing for some time, which are unavailable to us in Slipspace—and would have taken huge amounts of time and resources to try and replicate.</p><p>“One of the primary things we’re interested in is growing and expanding our world so players have more to interact with and more to experience. Nanite and Lumen [Unreal’s rendering and lighting technologies] offer us an opportunity to do that in a way that the industry hasn’t seen before. As artists, it’s incredibly exciting to do that work.”</p><div id="carousel_919742"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>To showcase what the future of <em>Halo</em> will look like, Halo Studios created “Project Foundry,” which is not a neither a game nor a tech demo, but an exploration of what is possible for a <em>Halo</em> game in Unreal Engine 5, as well as a training tool for how to get there.</p><p>“Where this type of work’s been done historically, across the industry, it can contain a lot of smoke and mirrors,” explained Matthews. “It sometimes leads players down paths where they believe it’s going to be one thing, and then something else happens. The ethos of Foundry is vigorously the opposite of that.</p><p>“Everything we’ve made is built to the kind of standards that we need to build for the future of our games. We were very intentional about not stepping into tech demo territory. We built things that we truly believe in, and the content that we’ve built—or at least a good percentage of it—could travel anywhere inside our games in the future if we so desire it.”</p><p>Hintze added, “It’s fair to say that our intent is that the majority of what we showcased in Foundry is expected to be in projects which we are building, or future projects.”</p><p>As for what is to come for the <em>Halo</em> series, while Halo Studios is not talking specifics about the new games in development quite yet, it did say that a new <me>Halo game is not imminent. <em>Halo Infinite</em> will continue to be supported through the Slipspace Engine, and it will continue to receive more Operations and Forge mode updates.</me></p><p>“One of the things I really wanted to get away from was the continued teasing out of possibilities and ‘must-haves,'” Hintze said. “We should do more and say less. For me, I really think it is important that we continue the posture which we have right now when it comes to our franchise—the level of humility, the level of servitude towards <em>Halo</em> fans.</p><p>“We should talk about things when we have things to talk about, at scale.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-studios-unreal-engine-xbox-343-industries-halo-world-championship<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">343 Industries will now be known as Halo Studios in a fresh beginning for Xbox's flagship franchise.</h2></div><section><p>The future of Halo is starting to come into focus. During Sunday's Halo World Championships, 343 Industries made a number of announcements, including that it will officially be changing its name to Halo Studios and that it's working on multiple new games. In addition, the newly-rebranded studio say that all future projects will be developed on Unreal Engine, leaving behind the Slipspace Engine utilized by Halo Infinite. </p><p>The announcements were unveiled in a seven-minute video shown ahead of the Halo World Championship's grand finals, which showcased the results of Project Foundry — an experimental project designed to show a Halo game built using the Unreal Engine. While it's not much more than a tech demo, it offers a glimpse at a fresh beginning for Xbox's flagship franchise in the wake of 2021's Halo Infinite.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It's a huge shift for the Halo series, not the least because of the resources poured into the Slipspace Engine over the course of its development. The studio formerly known as 343 Industries notoriously struggled with the Slipspace engine during Halo Infinite's development, in part because it used tools dating back to the early 2000s. Still, it was expected to serve as the foundation for the series after Halo Infinite.</p><p>“Respectfully, some components of Slipspace are almost 25 years old,” art director Chris Matthews said in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>.  “Although 343 were developing it continuously, there are aspects of Unreal that Epic has been developing for some time, which are unavailable to us in Slipspace – and would have taken huge amounts of time and resources to try and replicate."</p><p>An early 2023 report suggested that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-343-studio-shakeup">Halo's developers were ready to hit the reset button on the series</a> after a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-developers-mass-layoffs-human-impact-sony-ea">heavy shakeup within the studio</a>, including transitioning to the Unreal Engine. The report also said that Halo's developers were focusing on pitching new Halo games while prototyping ideas. Project Foundry appears to be the culmination of that effort.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Halo Studios: Unreal Engine Screenshots Revealed</h3></div></output><p>The newly-rebranded Halo Studios, for its part, is seeking to forge ahead under the leadership of Pierre Hintze and Elizabeth Van Wyck, with the studio now working on multiple new games. The three stepped into top roles at the studio in the wake of studio GM <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-boss-bonnie-ross-leaves-343-studios">Bonnie Ross' departure in 2022</a>, with series veteran Joseph Staten leaving Xbox in 2023. The new name and engine follows Xbox saying earlier this year that it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console">"full speed ahead" on a next-generation successor to the Xbox Series X|S</a>. </p><p>"We had a disproportionate focus on trying to create the conditions to be successful in servicing Halo Infinite,” says Hintze. “[But switching to Unreal] allows us to put all the focus on making multiple new experiences at the highest quality possible.”</p><p>The projects will be "ready when they're ready," Halo Studios says.

			<p>Until Dawn Remake on PC is reportedly filled with several bugs. Users report that ray traced settings are completely broken, and some upscaling technologies aren't effective at all.</p>
<p>For those unaware, the studio Ballistic Moon, a new team founded by former leads at Supermassive Games, was selected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-pc-specs-released-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-and-ray-tracing-are-supported/">release Until Dawn Remake on PC</a> (and PlayStation 5), which did excite fans considering that the title's stunning visuals were being held back by inferior platforms, but now it is being disclosed that the game's graphical state is entire of bugs and that users are utterly disappointed by how the PC port isn't working with RT like it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-pc-specs-released-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-and-ray-tracing-are-supported/">originally advertised to be</a>.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/until-dawn-remake-amd-fsr-3-0-frame-generation-ray-tracing-hdr-are-not-working-on-pc/">DSOgaming</a> claims that Until Dawn Remake on PC sees no visual change when ray-tracing is enabled and that the image quality is exactly the same. This is a surprising fact, given that not having RT on a PC port makes it completely useless. Here's a look at the game before vs. after RT is enabled, and by first impressions, there are no changes to the overall graphics.</p>

<p>Well, the non-functionality of RT isn't the only disappointment here, as it is said that the title isn't working with AMD's FSR 3.0, however, NVIDIA's DLSS works just fine. The developers promised that all upscaling technologies would support the PC port; however, for AMD users, it is a disappointment that a crucial feature wasn't working for them. Overall, the title feels rushed, and several other bugs make the PC port a failure when it comes to addressing the graphical capabilities that the PC platform holds.</p>
<p>We expect the developers to push out an optimization update to get the PC port up and running since, in this state, it won't prove to be much of a success.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> star Josh Hutcherson says the second Freddy-themed movie is "much bigger" and "scarier" than its predecessor.</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.esquire.com/style/mens-fashion/a62490388/josh-hutcherson-ritz-carlton-late-checkout-interview-2024/">Esquire</a>, as spotted by <a href="http://v/">TheGamer</a>, Hutcherson talked about the "higher stakes" and teased that there will be "more" and "different" animatronics, with the Freddy universe "opening up in a big way".</p>

<p>"We're finding the balance right now of building this world and expanding it in a really cool way but also making sure the characters stay really grounded," Hutcherson said. "That's something that I really think that we all fought for in the first film, because this world that was created in Five Nights at Freddy's, it's so out-there.</p><p>"It's so over-the-top and wacky, in a way, that to find the emotional truth of the characters was gonna be what was gonna work. I think the fans are gonna flip for it. It's gonna be a lot of fun with the source. It's gonna be scarier, too, actually."</p>
<p>Talking about how much he enjoys working in the Freddy-centric world, Hutcherson says the possibilities with his character, Mike, "are endless".</p>
<p>Does that mean a third movie could be on the way?</p>
<p>"This could have a very potentially long run and it could be a lot of fun, but at this point we're focusing on the second movie. We'll see what comes after that," Hutcherson teased.</p>
<p>Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-officially-in-the-works">announced the sequel back in April at CinemaCon</a>.</p>
<p>On its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sees-second-largest-video-game-adaptation-debut-of-all-time">Five Nights at Freddy's scored the second-largest debut of all time for a video game adaptation in the US</a>, coming only behind that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">Nintendo and Illumination's animated Super Mario Bros.

            <p>Wikipedia has had to lock down the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> page after repeated vandalism from editors who refuse to accept that the remake of Konami's seminal horror game released to critical acclaim earlier this week.</p>
<p>Outright lies around the games reception and metacritic score - including one edit that said the game had "received the worst reviews imaginable" - means the page has now been put into a semi-protected state to stop unregistered users from making wild, unsubstantiated claims, including one that said Eurogamer had awarded it 0/5 stars when, in fact, it got top marks.</p>

<p>It's unclear what's motivating the edits, although its presumed by some to have been fuelled by the nauseating discourse that the game is "woke" because of changes made to the characters facial features and clothing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-is-utterly-miserable-and-thats-why-its-great<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em><strong>Warning: this article contains mild thematic and environment spoilers for Silent Hill 2. </strong></em></p><p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is the most miserable experience I’ve had with a game in recent memory. </p><p>With an opening sentence like that, you’re probably expecting to read a very negative critique of developer Bloober Team’s recreation of Konami and Team Silent’s survival horror classic. But, in this very rare occurrence, complete and unrelenting misery is actually a positive. The original Silent Hill 2 is perhaps the bleakest, most sombre game ever made and Bloober Team has successfully preserved its miserable magic, ensuring this remake is a deeply effective descent into genuinely uncomfortable terror.</p><p>That journey begins with sound and vision. The thick, opaque fog that conceals the town of Silent Hill is part of the story’s instantly recognisable iconography, and the remake’s impressive modern volumetric effects mean it feels thicker and more isolating than ever. Moving away from the monster-infested streets should feel like an escape, but instead you’re forced to find shelter in some of the dankest, most depressingly disgusting residences you’ve ever seen. Much of Silent Hill 2 is themed around a descent, and there’s a clear gradient in the visual texture of each area that communicates that downward spiral. Locations initially feel unkempt and abandoned, such as apartment blocks with peeling wallpaper and empty cupboards. But push onwards and the architecture becomes increasingly oppressive. Recognisable shapes and textures are replaced with rougher, broken alternatives, and eventually the entire area becomes a rusting, decayed husk. What starts as unnerving transforms into truly nightmarish the further you dare to press on. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/03/silent-hill-2-remake-01-1727954034055.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill 2's iconic fog is suffocating, especially in its modern-day form.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Contributing to all this, as horror tradition demands, is minimal lighting. You are locked inside dark buildings for the majority of the game’s lengthy runtime (anything from 12 to 18 hours, depending on your playstyle). This becomes increasingly distressing, particularly during exploration of Toluca Prison – the facility’s lights can only be turned on for a few seconds at a time, forcing you to sprint between breaker switches in a mostly doomed attempt to hold back the darkness. Being starved of the sun for such long stretches means that the mere sight of daylight is like gasping for air after spending what feels like days beneath water. It’s deeply, unpleasantly effective.  </p><p>That visual palette is accompanied not so much by a musical score, but by the most oppressive collection of noises your ears have ever suffered, provided once again by original Silent Hill 2 composer Akira Yamaoka. It’s particularly effective in the late game, when what sounds like an approaching beast is dynamically woven into the orchestration during times of high tension. It makes you second guess every sound you hear, and over time it grinds away at your sense of reality. It’s not easy to simulate insanity, but this soundscape is as close as you can (un)comfortably get. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The most impressive, unsettling achievement is inflicting empathy through gameplay design.</p></div><p>Effective art and sound design has been the flagship feature of many horror games, but these disciplines are the surface of the experience. I don’t mean that disparagingly – the surface is vital – but it’s what’s beneath that truly cements the terror. Games like Resident Evil 4 and Dead Space are, in reality, action games with horror masks, and so are rarely ever truly scary. Silent Hill 2, on the other hand, is a horror game right down to its nerve endings and bone marrow. Its environment and objective design pull on similar threads to the art and sound, constantly seeking new ways to unnerve you. Each location visited is an obtuse puzzle to be solved. You’re forced to walk circuits of each floor, backtracking to find keys or hidden entrances to rooms that will once again send you backwards to progress. This almost spiral-shaped route through the apartments, hospital, hotel and more forces you to endure increasing mental exhaustion. </p><p>This fatigue, combined with the seemingly relentless length of each area, robs you of hope. It’s particularly horrible in the final third, when you’re forced to navigate the prison and the subsequent labyrinth back-to-back with absolutely no respite. These locations feature long stretches of near-impenetrable darkness, thematically grim puzzle work, and the most aggressive, grotesque enemies in the entire game. The resulting emotional toll effectively communicates the mental space that the protagonist James Sunderland finds himself in. And that’s Bloober’s, and by extension Team Silent’s, most impressive, unsettling achievement: the ability to inflict empathy through gameplay design.      </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/03/silent-hill-2-remake-02-1727954070065.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The unrelenting darkness of Silent Hill 2's corrdors grinds away at your mental endurance.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The miserable tone of Silent Hill 2 is maintained through a number of other gameplay tricks. As mentioned earlier, the story revolves around James’ descent into horror, and that’s represented both metaphorically through the visual design, and literally through a frequent need to jump into pitch-black holes. Each leap requires you to press the action button a couple of times, replicating his hesitancy and reluctance to leap into the unknown. </p><p>As the atmosphere becomes increasingly unbearable, there’s nothing built into the campaign to offer any levity or security. In the Resident Evil series, for instance, you gradually collect an increasingly powerful arsenal, allowing the late-game to be an exciting, explosive romp through blood and guts. It also toys with its dialogue and monster design, often opting for goofy characterisation that secures the series its beloved ‘cheesy horror’ credentials. Last year’s Alan Wake 2, despite clearly being inspired by Team Silent’s work, features absurdist humour and Lynchian direction to lean into the weird instead of horrifying, allowing for laughs to cut through the tension. Silent Hill 2, though, has none of this. For the most part your weapons are a broken pipe and a pistol, and even when you do get access to something a little more hard-hitting it’s nothing more than a simple shotgun or rifle with a long reload time and limited ammo. Alongside a difficulty curve that sees familiar enemies become erratic, wall-crawling freaks, Silent Hill 2’s atmosphere consistently finds ways to suffocate you.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Silent Hill 2 isn’t about having fun, it’s about exploring parts of the human experience we traditionally avoid.</p></div><p>It’s not usual for an assessment to use terms like ‘suffocate,’ ‘oppressive,’ and ‘miserable’ as positives, but horror is not a usual genre. It’s one of only two entertainment categories built around eliciting an uncontrollable response from the audience (the other being comedy). Horror is an emotion-manipulating machine, and the genre’s most effective stories can force us to experience feelings we typically don't encounter in our everyday lives. Horror films spend their entire runtimes exerting different levels of pressure in order to achieve that manipulation, and the most effective etch images in our mind that continually reappear when the lights go out. </p><p>Video games are a very different medium, though, and their experiential nature enables them to manipulate us in more intense ways. Rather than ask us to observe, they demand that we interact, typically for four, five, sometimes even 10 times longer than an average scary movie. This can force us to experience a very different reality. While there’s a frequent insistence from some parts of the player community that games are only about fun or escapist entertainment, that’s often not the goal of many developers. Sometimes that goal is communicating uncomfortable ideas, and the path to that is through exposing us to a reality that’s deeply unpleasant. Silent Hill 2 isn’t about having fun, it’s about exploring grief and guilt – parts of the human experience that we traditionally avoid. Strangely, there’s an uncomfortable thrill in actively exploring those ideas via a video game.</p><p>The 2001 original’s technical limitations helped contribute a few thorns to that painful experience; the semi-fixed camera made environments feel restrictive and claustrophobic, and the awkward aiming installed each encounter with a sense of desperation. Bloober Team’s remake prunes those thorns, replacing them with modern third-person controls that make the experience a little friendlier to play. But those are the only significant concessions provided, so while combat sequences are perhaps a little less panicked than they once were, Team Silent’s nightmarish vision is preserved. It means the remake is a modern reminder not just of an era where Konami was a master of survival horror, but also the significant power of Silent Hill 2’s unrelenting misery.</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Silent Hill: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Every game in the Silent Hill series -- and yes, we're including P.T.</p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is considering increasing its 8.58 percent stake in Nintendo.</p>

<p>The fund - which also has stakes in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-nexon-become-latest-video-game-companies-in-saudis-investment-splurge">Capcom, Nexon</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-reportedly-increases-nintendo-stake-for-second-time-in-a-month">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-sovereign-fund-acquires-usd3-3bn-stake-in-activision-ea-take-two">Take Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard</a> - is currently transferring its shares in these gaming companies to its Savvy Games Group subsidiary.</p>
<p>It also has an interest in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-increases-stake-in-ea-by-55">EA</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-acquires-stake-in-embracer-group">acquired a £840m stake in Embracer Group</a> in 2022, reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracers-collapsed-2bn-deal-reportedly-with-saudi-arabia-funded-savvy-games">"walking away" from its $2bn "major strategic partnership" with Embracer</a> earlier this year, sending the latter into a tailspin that led to a spectacular collapse back in May.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-raises-eyebrows-with-saudi-prince-meeting">Even Hideo Kojima raises eyebrows after meeting Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud last year.</a></p>
<p>"There are always opportunities," said vice chair Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan Al-Saud at Tokyo Game Show, but stressed: "It's important to keep the communication going so you get there in the right way. We don't want to rush into anything."</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's PIF is also involved in a number of other entertainment businesses, including sports and films.</p>
<p>The news comes after several key developments for Saudi Arabia and its gaming portfolio, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-is-hosting-the-inaugural-esports-olympic-games-next-year">hosting the next esports Olympic Games</a> and the new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-new-era-of-overwatch-esports-with-saudi-funded-partnership">Overwatch Champions Series, or OWCS</a>.</p>
<p>The Savvy Gaming Group is a subsidiary of the Public Investment Fund, an initiative chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The hugely-controversial figure has been blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Meanwhile, his rule of Saudi Arabia has maintained the country's notoriously poor human rights record, with homosexuality still criminalised and punishments ranging from floggings to the death penalty.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Peter Walczak didn't identify as a "car guy," which makes his hobbyist superproject of choice all the more surprising: building a functional life-size version of the iconic Warthog jeep from the Halo games. By his own admission, the retired Navy test pilot has poured untold hours and thousands of dollars into this amazing prop, which he hopes to feature in Halo fan films someday in the future.</p><p>Walczak grew up playing video games, but his interest in the hobby waned as he got older. However, when a coworker told him about a hot new video game console called the Xbox in the early 2000s, he decided to pick one up. His primary interest wasn't Halo, though--it was Steel Battalion, an obscure Xbox exclusive that required its own intimidating secondary controller, which featured two joysticks and three pedals. "It was an awful game," Walczak says. "At that point, I thought, 'I might as well get this stupid Halo game that everyone's talking about.'"</p><p>Like many others, Walczak quickly fell in love with Bungie's groundbreaking console shooter; he cites its beautiful levels and sci-fi story as two of the major reasons why. He even ended up playing with his coworker online, going head-to-head in beloved maps like Blood Gulch. The franchise ended up reigniting his love for video games. Walczak was stationed in Hawaii when Halo 2 came out, and while his compatriots were exploring the island and going to the beach, he was sitting inside an aircraft carrier, playing the new game on a washed-out 12-inch television. "It was the peak of that gaming era for me," he says. "Nothing comes close."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378909-img_1073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378909" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378909-img_1073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378909"></a><figcaption>Image courtesy of Peter Walczak</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378909-img_1073.jpg"></figure><p>To be clear, Walczak does call himself a "car guy" now, but the title was hard-won. A lifelong tinkerer with a background in electrical engineering, he first got the idea of putting together his own Warthog when he saw Weta Workshop's take on the mean green jeep, which was used in the live-action series Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn. ("I just thought, I can probably build something like that," he says, laughing. "How hard could it be?")</p><p>However, it wasn't until Walczak settled into a new home with a garage that he actually felt he could work on it in earnest. That's when he caught a lucky break: an acquaintance of his was selling a beat-up old truck for a very reasonable price. Walczak showed up and wrote a check; shortly after, he and a few buddies were stripping the truck for parts, reimagining it as a base for a futuristic jeep recognizable to a generation of gamers.</p><p>"That's definitely when it became real," Walczak says. "Before, I was just a guy with a few sketches. After I wrote the check, I had a dilapidated old truck in my driveway. I just thought, 'What am I doing with my life? I guess I'm actually building this thing.'"</p><p>Embarking on the project in earnest in 2014, Walczak had to teach himself many skills to pull off the build, a process which he jokingly ascribes to "YouTube University." For example, he had to teach himself how to weld various metal parts securely together, which he hadn't done since college. He also had to master a 3D printer and learn the ins-and-outs of almost every facet of the truck base. From early on, Walczak tried to use as many off-the-shelf parts as possible to keep the project relatively manageable, but over time, he realized that he would have to buy a variety of components from different manufacturers to achieve his goals.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4379020-6619774127-43789.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379020" data-ratio="0.66640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4379020-6619774127-43789.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4379020"></a><figcaption>Image courtesy of Peter Walczak</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4379020-6619774127-43789.jpg"></figure><p><span>Despite the scale of the vehicle, he says he's done almost all of the design and work by himself, with two major exceptions. He commissioned a racing firm to create the windscreen for the truck--which ended up being the most expensive part by far--and he got help from a friend at a machine shop to help him bend the rear bumper to the proper specification.</span></p><p>"I was a handy person with a technical degree, but I realized pretty quickly that I had to learn a lot to get this done," Walczak says. "I had done a bit of welding in school, but I didn't know how to weld, really…The hardest part of the project was finding parts that were compatible with the base truck. It's really easy to go on a car forum and find some guy who says, 'Yeah, this part in X car looks about two feet long,' but it's a little different when you need something that's exactly 22 inches. It's been a learning process for sure."</p><p>Walczak has documented much of the process of putting the Warthog together on social media, which of course garnered positive responses from the Halo fan community, as well as the usual range of curious missives. Many ask the creator for the plans or blueprint for the Warthog, which always amuses Walczak--no such documents exist. Some have even offered to buy it outright, with one user offering tens of thousands of dollars for the super-prop. Needless to say, it's not for sale. "Every price I've been offered would really just cover the parts," Walczak says. "I just tell them, 'Hey, this is 10 years of my life you're talking about!'"</p><p>Like a lot of hobbyists who have put a lot of time into a single project, Walczak looks on the early days of his endeavor with a sense of bemusement. When I ask him if he might tackle another fan-build of this scale again, he offers a surprising thought. "Honestly, I have to resist the urge to do this one all over again," he says, laughing. "There are things I would do completely differently. But to be honest, I haven't decided yet…People ask me to sell these to them. It's just wild to me." He's considered building his take on the Pelican--the dropships that spill Warthogs and marines from their guts in many well-remembered Halo missions--but that's just a dream for now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378911-img_0781.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378911" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="4032" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378911-img_0781.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378911"></a><figcaption>Image courtesy of Peter Walczak</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4378911-img_0781.jpg"></figure><p>As of this writing, Walczak describes the Warthog build as roughly 97% complete, as he recently completed one of the most difficult steps: taking the entire vehicle apart and painting it, which took far longer than he expected. His ultimate goal of creating a drivable Warthog is within reach. "I can see the end of the tunnel," he says. "It's a strange feeling."</p><p>"People always talk about the turret, like the cops will pull me over and say, 'Hey, what's that?'" Walczak says. "Honestly, it's a piece of PVC pipe. It's not something I really worry about…When it comes to making it street-legal, it's more about making sure it has working windshield wipers, seatbelts, that sort of thing. I think it's doable, for sure."</p><p>When it comes to those who would look to follow in Walczak's footsteps, he has some pointed words of wisdom: "Stop talking about it and just do it." He notes that he's seen many projects in the fan community collect hundreds if not thousands of upvotes on their first announcement, only to fall by the wayside once the intrepid leader hits an unforeseen obstacle. He recommends that fans start small and build from there: For example, if you can't afford the materials to build Master Chief-style armor at home, try painting foam mats instead.</p><p>"People always say, 'It's too hard.' Look, nobody said it was ever going to be easy," Walczak says. "Spend less time talking about it and more time learning. You might not have the skills or the money to get started today, but you can go on YouTube and learn something, or just buy a cheap welder and play with it. Scratching ideas on a piece of paper is progress. So you're broke; that's okay. I was pretty broke when I started too…It doesn't have to be life-sized, it can be a scale model, it can sit on your desk. Just do something. That's the main thing."</p>

					<p>Following over a year of rumors, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the PS5 Pro console on September 10. Like the PlayStation 4 Pro console, it's a mid-generation hardware refresh aimed at high-end gamers who wish to run PlayStation 5 games at higher frame rates and/or with better visual quality.</p>
<p>As PlayStation Principal Product Manager Toshi Aoki <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-a-full-package-with-exceptional-value-for-players-says-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> in late September, Sony has started discussing the PS5 Pro internally even before the PlayStation 5 launch (November 2020). The first concrete rumors about the specs <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-zen2-rdna3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came in October 2023</a> via RedGamingTech, while another leaker <a href="https://wccftech.com/additional-ps5-pro-specs-and-details-potentially-leaked-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared even more in December 2023</a>.</p>
<h2>Release date and pricing</h2>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will debut globally on Thursday, November 7, 2024. Its pricing was by far the most contentious topic of the unveiling. Pre-release rumors hinted at a price of around $500, but the reality is far different: Sony asks $699 / £699 / €799 for its new console.</p>
<p>This is a major departure from the PS4 Pro, which launched at the same price as the base PlayStation 4, just $399. Of course, many things have changed over these last eight years, such as inflation and the inability to reduce manufacturing costs over time after launch.</p>
<p>Despite the high price, Sony remains confident that the PS5 Pro console could sell similarly to the PS4 Pro, which accounted for circa 20% of the total PlayStation 4 sales. Since then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-like-pc-would-cost-a-fair-bit-more-says-df-rtx-4070-is-the-closest-gpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-price-is-not-that-bad-says-zampella-youre-not-getting-the-same-performance-from-a-700-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Respawn's Vince Zampella</a> have argued that assembling a PC as powerful as the PlayStation 5 Pro would inevitably cost more nowadays.</p>

<h2>Hardware Specifications</h2>
<p>The console's main enhancements are undoubtedly found in the GPU, a significant improvement over the PS5's RDNA 2-based graphics card that only featured 36 Compute Units. The PS5 Pro, on the other hand, is equipped with 60 Compute Units, or 67% more than the base console. The memory speed is also 28% faster, going from 448GB/s to 576GB/s.</p>
<p>Overall, Sony says this will translate into 45% faster rendering. But the PS5 Pro's ace in the hole may well be the inclusion of unreleased AMD technology that will greatly improve ray tracing performance (up to twice as fast). System architect Mark Cerny <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-motivated-amds-development-of-advanced-ray-tracing-says-mark-cerny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> outright that Sony spurred this innovation.</p>
<p>The new console will offer a 2TB SSD, more than twice the 825GB of the PS5. However, it does not include a disc drive or a vertical stand, which must be purchased separately (for $79.99 and $29.99, respectively) for those interested. The PS5 Pro also supports Wi-Fi 7 and 8K displays.</p>
<p>So far, few developers have commented on the hardware, but No Man's Sky Engine programmer Martin Griffiths openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-absolutely-rocks-says-no-mans-sky-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> that the PS5 Pro 'absolutely rocks.'</p>

<h2>Software Features</h2>
<p>Another major new feature of the PS5 Pro is the so-called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution. This is the first console with built-in AI upscaling technology powered by machine learning. Cerny said of PSSR:</p>
<p><em>We added custom hardware for machine learning and an AI library called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, or PSSR for short. PSSR analyzes the game images pixel by pixel and can add an extraordinary amount of detail, which boosts the effective resolution.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>While usage of technologies like PSSR will require work on behalf of the individual game developer, the console also includes a system-wide feature called PS5 Pro Game Boost, which can improve the performance of PS4 and PS5 games alike. Moreover, another feature called Enhanced Image Quality for PS4 games will be available to improve the resolution on select PS4 games.</p>
<h2>PS5 Pro Confirmed Games</h2>
<p>So far, 62 existing or upcoming PlayStation 5 games have been confirmed to receive proper support for the new console. You can find them all below, and we'll add more as they are announced by the respective game studios.</p>
