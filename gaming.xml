The highly requested setting for Ubisoft’s biggest franchise will be explored through two protagonists: the fictional shinobi assassin Naoe and the real-life Black samurai Yasuke.</p><p>In anticipation of Ubisoft’s highly anticipated journey into feudal Japan, we’ve put together this breakdown of everything you need to know about Assassin’s Creed Shadows, from its price and release date to its gameplay and story.</p><p><strong>Jump to</strong>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="#release-date">Release Date</a></li><li><a href="#story">Story and Setting</a></li><li><a href="#gameplay">Gameplay Details</a></li></ul><h2>Latest Assassin’s Creed Shadows Trailers</h2><p>Ubisoft has released several trailers for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the most informative of which — the reveal trailer and the most recent gameplay trailer from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-forward-2024-everything-announced"><u>Ubisoft Forward</u></a> — are embedded below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 id="release-date">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Release Date</h2><p><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released on November 15.</strong></p><p>It will be playable three days early, on November 12, for those who preorder either of Shadows’ three premium editions (more on these below) or subscribe to Ubisoft+ Premium on PC ($18/month).</p><h3>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Platforms and Price</h3><div id="200650" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Out November 15 Assassin's Creed Shadows</h3></p></div><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is coming to<strong> PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC (via Ubisoft Store or Epic Games Store), Mac, iPad, and Amazon Luna</strong></p><p>The base version of Assassin’s Creed Shadows costs <strong>$70</strong> across all platforms. An <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-requires-an-internet-connection-to-install-but-not-to-play-after"><u>internet connection will be required</u></a> to install even the physical version of the game, though it can then be played offline. </p><h2 id="story">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Story</h2><h3>Plot and Characters</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows stars two protagonists: the shinobi assassin Naoe and the samurai Yasuke. Naoe is the fictional daughter of the real Fujibayashi Nagato; <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained"><u>Yasuke</u></a> is based on the real, 16th-century Black samurai of the same name.</p><p>Set during the late Sengoku period (or Azuchi-Momoyama era) of feudal Japan, Shadows begins in 1579 during a time of civil war within the country, complete with the era’s samurai, shinobi, Portuguese merchants, and Jesuit missionaries. The two protagonists converge as they find themselves on opposite sides of conflict: Yasuke served as a retainer to Nobunaga, the daimyo who led the Oda clan in its invasion of Iga; Naoe, under the leadership of her father, is part of the Igan resistance.</p><p>Here’s the official synopsis from Ubisoft:</p><p><em>Live the intertwined stories of Naoe, an adept shinobi Assassin from Iga Province, and Yasuke, the powerful African samurai of historical legend. Against the backdrop of the turbulent late Sengoku period, this remarkable duo will discover their common destiny as they usher in a new era for Japan.</em></p><p>Like Assassin’s Creed Mirage and the original AC before it, Shadows’ main targets can be assassinated in any order. “One thing that we really wanted is [to make] sure the world feels alive, and those targets are always in the world,” said game director Charles Benoit. “So it's possible that you’ll encounter some of them without really knowing about them before.</p><p>Quests, therefore, won’t point you toward your next target but will “guide” you with hints. “It's less of ‘follow a quest up to a point’, but it's much more, ‘I want to do this’ and then you'll find the way how to do it,” said creative director Jonathan Dumont. </p><h3>Feudal Japan Setting</h3><p>Assassin’s Creed is well known for its exploration of different places and eras with each new entry. This year’s game takes players to feudal Japan, specifically 1579 through the early 1580s. Shadows is set during the end of the tumultuous Sengoku period at the height of Oda Nobunaga’s power when the warlord overthrew the Ashikaga shogunate and began his campaign to unify the warring factions of Japan.</p><p>Central Japan, where Nobunaga held power, will serve as the center of Shadows. Locations we’ve seen in the hitherto released trailers include the Iga province and Takeda Castle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3>Game Length and Map Size</h3><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is closest in size to 2017’s Egypt-set Assassin’s Creed Origins, according to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/japan-set-assassins-creed-shadows-is-around-the-same-size-as-assassins-creed-origins"><u>Dumont</u></a>. "It's in-line with the latest Assassin's Creeds that we've done," he said, referring to the series’ post-Syndicate RPGs. "On a scale level, maybe we can compare it a little bit more to the size of Assassin's Creed Origins.</p><p>"We did want to have a much closer to real life scale ratio,” Dumont added. “So because castles took a lot of space, and we really wanted the mountains to feel like mountains, [we've made] the environments feel wider in the game. But I would say around the same size as Origins."</p><p>Dumont didn’t comment on game length, though we’ll note Origins main story takes roughly 30 hours to complete, according to IGN sister site <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/46402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>How Long to Beat</u></a>.</p><h3>Does Assassin’s Creed Shadows Have a Modern-day Story?</h3><p>Ubisoft has yet to reveal details about Shadow’s potential modern-day segments, though it sounds like there will be one. Assassin’s Creed executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/assassins-creed-shadows-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game File</u></a>, “You are in the Animus,” when asked about the modern day in Shadows. He also revealed Assassin’s Creed Infinity will be known as the Animus hub and serve as a portal to the series’ modern-day sections moving forward.</p><p>This section will be updated as more information is announced.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 id="gameplay">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Gameplay</h2><h3>Yasuke and Naoe Differences</h3><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows allows you to switch between Yasuke or Naoe at will, with the exception of introduction quests and character-specific missions.</p><p>Naoe plays as a more typical assassin; she’s equipped with a Hidden Blade and the ability to kill stealthily by scaling walls and hiding in foliage. As Naoe, you’ll also have access to throwable kunai and her chained blade, which is swung around to slice through enemies and environments. The assassin is also given a grappling hook to improve traversal; it can be attached to the edges of roofs and other miscellaneous anchor points. “It's all physics-based, so there's a little bit of improbability sometimes when using it,” said Dumont. “There's a danger to using it, but you could also perform assassinations from it.”</p><p>Yasuke, on the other hand, has a more head-on approach to combat; the samurai’s heavy armor keeps him on the ground, where he excels as a master swordsman.</p><p>Each character has individualized skill trees and gear, though XP, collected weapons, and resources are shared.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3>General Combat</h3><p>Dumont says the team’s goal was to make Shadows’ combat feel “spectacular,” and to this end they’ve increased the amount of environmental items that can be carved up or destroyed and reintroduced instant kills with the Hidden Blade. “The thing that shines the most, I feel, in Assassin's Creed, it's really the Hidden Blade, the assassination, being able to stay hidden,” said Benoit. “So that's the core that we want to keep. What we needed to push forward [was to make it] feel a bit more modern in the approach.”</p><p>Shadows also adds duels reminiscent of those seen in Akira Kurosawa's samurai films. “When we have a mini-boss type of fighter, we really want it to feel like a duel,” said Benoit. “So this exchange of blocking, parrying, dodging. So it's always like a dance.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><p>Weapons you’ll acquire throughout Shadows include katanas, the kanabō war club, yari spears, shuriken, kunai, and the kusarigama (sickle on chain). Weapons have their own skill trees, and proficiency is increased by playing with each weapon. These can be found or crafted by gathering components throughout the game world. And yes, the ability to transmog is still here, allowing flexibility in the appearance of your gear.</p><p>Yasuke and Naoe will also be faced with a new enemy type: servants. These characters exist between civilians and enemies, and are able to raise alarms and call for reinforcements.</p><h3>Exploration and Traversal</h3><p>The big addition to Shadows world is a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-50-details-you-need-to-know"><u>light-dark system</u></a>, which has a major influence on the game’s stealth mechanics. Powered by an upgraded version of Ubisoft’s Anvil engine, Shadows global illumination system creates dynamic light and shadows that affect enemy vision. You can influence this by snuffing out lamps and taking out torch carriers. The degree to which you are hidden is displayed through a new light meter on the UI.</p><p>The light-dark system intersects with Shadows new seasons mechanic, which changes the terrain (and therefore how you interact with it) as spring turns to summer, fall, then winter. Seasonal differences include changes to weather/wind, bodies of water (swimmable or frozen), the height of grass, foliage, enemy positioning, and visibility. “Players will have to adapt constantly to what the environment is giving them,” said Dumont. The seasons will change as you progress through the main quest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Eagle vision, which allows you to see characters through walls, returns in Shadows, though gone are the drone-like birds used to scout locations in Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. In an effort to reduce the amount of map icons, climbing to the top of synchronization points no longer unlocks a portion of the map, rather they provide a vantage point from which you can survey the surrounding area for highlighted points of interest. However, these locations still serve as fast-travel points.</p><p>Shadows will take you through Japan’s diverse landscape of towns, trading posts, farmland, mountains, forests, and historic castles rendered nearly to scale. Each castle serves as a type of bespoke dungeon, according to<strong> </strong>Benoit, who added, “It’s so big, it's like an adventure each time you go in the castle.”</p><h2>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Development</h2><p>Ubisoft Quebec is leading development of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The studio previously headed up development on Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, Syndicate, and Black Flag, as well as 2020’s Immortals: Fenyx Rising. Over a dozen other Ubisoft studios are providing development support.</p><p>Jonathan Dumont, creative director of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, is again overseeing the creative direction of Shadows. Charles Benoit, who served as a game designer on Odyssey, is the game director for Shadows.</p><p>Shadows was first announced in 2022 as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-announced-with-two-new-games"><u>Assassin’s Creed Codename Red</u></a>. It was officially named and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-dual-protagonists-and-more-revealed-by-ubisoft"><u>subsequently unveiled</u></a> in May 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Assassin's Creed Review</h3></div></output><h2>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Editions, Preorder Bonus</h2><p>Ubisoft is selling three <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-collectors-edition"><u>editions of Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a> — Standard, Gold, and Ultimate — as well as a GameStop-exclusive Collector’s Edition.

Just within the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/13/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator">character creator</a>, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit. The better Rook's belt, the better the potency of their healing potions, which are replenished by destroying green pots scattered about the world. That's not all, though, as higher-quality belts can proc [<em>editor's note</em>: proc is a term used as a shorter way of saying "programmed random occurrence"] additional effects like momentary invulnerability.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>When creating your character, you can immediately view aspirational armors, which won't play into Rook's class until the "mid-to-late game," according to game director Corinne Busche. You can also toggle Rook's starting gear and casual wear in the creator, giving you a pretty good look at how Rook will look in more laidback cutscenes, in combat, and how they might appear later in your Veilguard journey. Busche tells me a lot of the gear in Veilguard is bespoke to your Rook or their followers, which is to say, an armor piece for a Warrior-class Rook probably won't be in a chest for a Mage-class Rook. On a similar note, armor designed for companion Bellara Lutara can't be used for another companion like Lace Harding.</p>

<p>In just my few hours viewing Busche play the game as part of my visit to BioWare's Edmonton office for our current <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2024/06/09/cover-reveal-dragon-age-the-veilguard"><em>Game Informer </em>cover story</a>, I see a lot of armor to collect from things like chests scattered about Arlathan Forest, for example, and elsewhere. Some of it looks awesome, and some of it doesn't quite line up with my personal taste. That's how it goes in the genre of RPGs.</p>

<p>However, Busche tells me there is transmogrification, or transmog for short, in the game, and calls it "robust." This means you can take an armor's stats and apply it to a different piece of armor. In other words, if you have a really cool piece of armor you like and find a new piece with better stats but don't want to give up the look of your current armor, you don't have to. Transmog allows you to take that new armor's stats and apply them to your current armor, giving you all the benefits while keeping the visual style you prefer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transmog isnt just for Rook, though; you can transmog armor and other things for your companions as well. I don't get to see how Veilguard's transmog system works in-game, but just knowing it exists allows me to rest easy knowing my Rook will look as fashionable as possible while saving Thedas.&nbsp;</p>

While the teaser gave little away story-wise, the trailer did showcase the long-running fighting game's central characters, Sol Badguy and Sin Kiske. The trailer, which is stylized in a similar fashion to the game's cutscenes, pits the pair against a mysterious new foe named Unika, who has a grudge against Gears. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Arc System Works America (@ArcSystemWorksU) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcSystemWorksU/status/1808932912542462425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Guilty Gear stands head and shoulders above other fighting games series thanks in part to it being one of the flashiest anime fighters of all time. Consequently, Guilty Gear also has a reputation for being one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/QIjtNL7Pfqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hardest story timelines to follow</u></a>. A case in point is the fact that the story mode for Strive's predecessor, Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2, is essentially an uninterrupted hour-long anime unto itself. For folks wondering where Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Riders will sit in the series storied lore, here's a plot synopsis for the show:</p><p>"After the decline of the once robust fields of science and technology, a new energy source known as magic fuels the modern era," the official description reads. "Humanity creates forbidden biological weapons: Gears. Those Gears eventually stand against humanity in a rebellion. Although they manage to overcome in the struggle for survival known as the Crusades, humanity’s losses are so great that even after several decades pass, their emotional wounds remain unable to fully heal. </p><p>"Sin Kiske, the child of a human and a Gear, heads to his father Ky and mother Dizzy’s wedding ceremony. Their wedding breaks the ultimate taboo: a union between a human and a Gear. Even with the world at peace, it took many years for such a ceremony to come to fruition. Despite the complex array of emotions surrounding it, the wedding ceremony is met with blessings. When suddenly, a mysterious girl appears… The fated child inheriting Gear blood–and the mysterious girl who despises Gears. Their meeting would shake the world."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-review"><u>our review</u></a> of Guilty Gear Strive, we gave the game a 9/10, saying, "Guilty Gear Strive sets a new standard for anime-like fighting games with its visuals, stellar netcode, and flexible fighting system that encourages and rewards creativity."</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

<p>The rise in popularity of gacha-style games, following the immense success of Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail, led to additional titles from the same studio and many similar developers. But the former continues taking the world by storm, now with Zenless Zone Zero. But there’s a bit of confusion surrounding the release. Is Zenless Zone Zero mobile only?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-can-i-play-zenless-zone-zero-on">What Can I Play Zenless Zone Zero On?</h2>



<p>Thankfully, the answer to whether Zenless Zone Zero is mobile-only is a resounding “No.” You can play ZZZ on multiple systems, including PC, PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS. It’s free to play, though there are numerous microtransactions and in-game currencies to purchase with real-world money.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-zenless-zone-zero-on-console">Is Zenless Zone Zero on Console?</h2>



<p>Currently, the only console that supports Zenless Zone Zero is PlayStation 5. It’s unlikely miHoYo will backport the free-to-play gacha game to last-gen systems. Furthermore, none of their previous titles launched on Xbox Series X|S. We don’t expect this one to, either!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-zenless-zone-zero-free-on-ps5">Is Zenless Zone Zero Free on PS5?</h2>



<p>Yes! If you visit the PlayStation Store and search for “Zenless Zone Zero,” you’ll find the recent release completely free to download and play. There are no strings attached; add the game to your account, then wait for the rather large download size of around 60GB to finish before hopping in-game!</p>



<h2 id="h-will-zenless-zone-zero-be-on-nintendo-switch">Will Zenless Zone Zero Be On Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, it’s improbable that Zenless Zone Zero will launch on Nintendo Switch. While the studio unveiled Genshin Impact for Nintendo Switch, it never came about. They went quiet following its announcement, and many still wait impatiently for the handheld’s chance to play.</p>



<p>It’s likely Zenless Zone Zero won’t even receive an empty announcement for a Nintendo Switch port.</p>

Even with the world at peace, it took many years for such a ceremony to come to fruition. Despite the complex array of emotions surrounding it, the wedding ceremony is met with blessings. When suddenly, a mysterious girl appears… The fated child inheriting Gear blood–and the mysterious girl who despises Gears.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-season-2-is-out-next-week-will-add-mrs-freeze-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Rocksteady sent out an email newsletter to announce the release date and details for Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League Season 2.</p>
<p>The big addition is the playable new character Mrs. Freeze, also known as Nora Fries. She's an alternate version of Mr. Freeze, who is more commonly found in DC adaptations (including Batman Arkham City, where the Caped Crusader fights him in one of the boss battles). The newsletter did not go into further details on Mrs. Freeze's moveset, but the developers will likely do so shortly, given that Season 2 is coming to Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League next Thursday.</p>
<p>Episode 3, called Frozen Hearts, will add an Elseworlds Mayhem map, a Superman versus Flash Brainiac fight, an 'ever-changing' Metropolis,&nbsp;new Infamy sets and Notorious gear such as the Killer Frost Infamy set, Firefly Notorious, and Parasite Notorious Melee, and of course, a new Battle Pass.</p>
<p>Episode 4, called Winter, brings a Green Lantern versus Superman Brainiac fight, new incursions, new Infamy sets and Notorious gear such as the Captain Cold Infamy set, Icicle Notorious, and Trickster Notorious Melee, and new Shop items.</p>
<p>It does look like Rocksteady will keep its promise to deliver four seasons of post-launch content for the game despite its massive failure. As revealed by parent company Warner Bros., Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributed</a> to a $200 million lower EBITDA compared to last year's outstanding performance bolstered by Hogwarts Legacy. The game was also panned by critics, including Wccftech's Nathan Birch, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave it just 5 out of 10</a>:</p>
<p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has a sprinkling of that classic Rocksteady charm, delivering polished visuals, fluid traversal and combat, and some snappy repartee, but the whole experience is bogged down by dreary, repetitive mission design, empty live service elements, and a feel-bad story that’s mean-spirited to the point of feeling oddly resentful.</em></p>
<p>The studio isn't at any risk of being shut down, though. According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, it will be given the chance to return to what it does best: a single-player game. Meanwhile, some Rocksteady employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are helping on a Hogwarts Legacy Director's Cut</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite has just announced the commencement of the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1808863497897304138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">All Sweat Summer</a>, during which players can embark on exclusive quests to earn unique summer-themed rewards. In addition, Fortnite has decided to implement significant changes to the Ranked Mode as part of the All Sweat test. </p>



<p>These changes are designed to immerse players in a tournament-like experience. Discover all the alterations to Fortnite’s Ranked mode below.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-sweat">Time to Sweat</h2>



<p>The Fortnite Status account has announced a series of changes that will be implemented in Ranked Battle Royale and Zero Build between July 4 and July 18. Among these changes, all vehicles and vehicle items, including the upgraded boss cars, will be disabled. The unique and new weapon of Chapter 5, Season 3, the Nitro Fists, will also be disabled. </p>



<p>Lastly, players will no longer be able to hire characters, but enemy NPCs and Bosses with medallions will still be present. It’s time to bring out your competitive spirit, as Fortnite’s All Sweat Test for Ranked mode has begun. The development team will be closely monitoring player feedback during this time.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>During All Sweat Summer, Ranked Battle Royale and Zero Build will be switching things up a bit! From July 4 to July 18:</p><p>– Vehicles and vehicle items are disabled, including Boss Cars.<br>– Nitro Fists are also disabled.<br>– Characters are no longer Hireable, but hostile Characters… <a href="https://t.co/nLBFutgq7u">pic.twitter.com/nLBFutgq7u</a></p></div>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1808864035380601000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>For those wondering, you don’t need to worry about the entire season being vaulted; these changes only arrive for Fortnite’s Ranked Modes. The standard Battle Royale and Zero Build Mode will still include all the elements introduced for Fortnite’s Chapter 5 Season 3, Wrecked. </p>



<p>This consists of the newly announced <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1808139084440736232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Magneto mythic, </a>which allows players to defend themselves with a metal shield and shoot projectiles at other players, builds and vehicles to cause damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-integration-with-rocket-racing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nascar recently revealed a landmark integration </a>with Fortnite’s Rocket Racing Mode. Also, the official status account confirmed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pirates-of-the-caribbean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pirates of the Caribbean collaboration will arrive on July 19</a>. What do you think about Fortnite’s Ranked Mode changes to make the game more sweaty? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

No. Here’s another response to this prompt that looks like a little dog.</p><figure></figure><p>Generative AI is stupid. It is not a thinking machine.

You may have heard of the global craze for taiyaki inspired by the work <em><a title="Games > Kanon [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kanon">Kanon</a></em>, but are you familiar with its original creator and head writer, Naoki Hisaya? I had the honor of being a sub-writer for that project. Naoki Hisaya started the trend of ‘<a title="Genres > Visual Novel [417 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a>s that make players cry,’ a pursuit that I have passionately followed for over 20 years. The pinnacle of this journey is <em>Heaven Burns Red</em>. Whereas Hisaya used sophisticated storytelling techniques to evoke tears, I took a rather direct approach, and that’s the essence of <em>Heaven Burns Red</em>. To think that this work would be released in places where he sparked the taiyaki craze—such a delightful coincidence feels like fate. We eagerly look forward to sharing <em>Heaven Burns Red</em> with you. Thank you.”</p><p>Jun Maeda, a Japanese writer and composer. He is considered a pioneer of visual novel and his notable works includes <em>AIR</em>, <em>CLANNAD</em>, <em>Little Busters!</em>, and <em>Angel Beats!</em>. </p></blockquote><p>Watch the western announcement trailer and a video message from Jun Maeda below.

It's a "deluxe collector grade figure with 42 points of articulation and 12 different accessories including multiple face plates and alternative hands." The figure will be released in August 2024, with preorders now available.</p><p>Coming soon after in The Shapes Collection is Kratos and Atreus from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War Ragnarok</a>, Varl from Horizon Forbidden West, and Jin Sakai from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-review">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. These figures have between 24 and 34 points of articulation depending on the model, and two to four different accessories each.

"We made sure the many articulation points made sense and even the finest textural detail shows up on the figures."</p><p>Creative director at Ghost of Tsushima studio Sucker Punch Jason Connell chimed in too. "Jin’s Ghost armor has so many beautiful details, including intricate fabric patterns and overlapping armor plates that are integral to the design of his character," he said. "In addition to his katana, it’s also always important to us to see all of his various Ghost tools represented to capture his different fighting techniques."</p><p>PlayStation didn't reveal if further figures would be released down the road, but as these four just scratch the surface of its wealth of franchises, it's perhaps likely. Other potential figures could include Ellie from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-i-review">The Last Us</a>, Nathan Drake from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/11/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review">Uncharted</a>, Spider-Man from, well, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review">Spider-Man</a>, and more.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
