            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>is eight years old this year, and developer Behaviour Interactive is celebrating with a slew of new announcements surrounding the game.</p>
<p>During an anniversary celebration stream today, Behaviour revealed a number of new things coming to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>, including more details about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>, a new game announcement, and another tantalizing crossover.</p>
<p>First up, the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>crossover content has been revealed, and if you guessed that everyone's favorite lich Vecna would be the killer joining the roster from the popular tabletop RPG, you'd be absolutely correct.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-vecna-screenshot.jpg?itok=ZCtaTYib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-vecna-screenshot.jpg?itok=pk28Awuw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Say hello to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s newest killer Vecna. Then run away from him screaming.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with Vecna, the crossover is also bringing a new survivor (well, technically two) in the form of the Bard. You can choose between elven female Aestri Yazar and human male Baermar Uraz for your Bard.</p>
<p>A new map, the Forgotten Ruins, is being introduced. It's Vecna's domain, but it's scattered with chests in which you can find gear to help you fight his spells. In a cute&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed twist, you'll have to roll to see what item you get.</p>
<p>All of this&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed stuff is coming to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>on June 3rd, but if you're of a mind, you can check it out right now on the PTB (public test build) via Steam. You can do that by selecting the "public-test" branch in the game's Properties window within your Steam library.</p>

<p>As well as learning about the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>crossover, we also got a glimpse of some of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s upcoming spinoffs.</p>
<p>None of them are perhaps quite as out there as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooked-on-you-dead-by-daylight-dating-sim-is-out-today"><em>Hooked On You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim</em></a>, but they should whet your appetite for more&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>content.</p>
<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Project T&nbsp;</em>is a third-person co-op shooter in which you will explore the Backwater, a hitherto-unexplored region controlled by the Entity. The game is in its early development stages right now, so you'll have to wait for a bit more info in the coming months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-project-t-spinoff.jpg?itok=rzU6dWI1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-project-t-spinoff.jpg?itok=FzNqotuy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Project T&nbsp;</em>is currently in its early development stages.</figcaption></figure><p>We also got to hear more about&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone</em>, the single-player narrative horror game currently in development over at&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/quarry">The Quarry</a>&nbsp;</em>and <em>The&nbsp;</em><em>Dark Pictures&nbsp;</em>dev Supermassive Games.</p>
<p>The game will revolve around a group of teens who head to a small town in order to make a movie. It sounds like a pretty typical Supermassive setup, but with the extra spice added by the&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>connection.</p>
<p>Finally, a brand new game,&nbsp;<em>What the Fog</em>, was announced. It's a "chaotic roguelite" in which you'll need to work with a friend to complete objectives across a series of procedurally-generated levels. The game's available right now on Steam, and it's free for a limited time as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-what-the-fog-spinoff.jpg?itok=V8wYxhDl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-what-the-fog-spinoff.jpg?itok=9zUj08e_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>sure is getting some spinoffs.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>itself isn't getting neglected, of course. The game is getting a new 2v8 mode (and it will be a mode, rather than a modifier) that will see teams of two killers and eight survivors working together.</p>
<p>Abilities in this mode will be rebalanced around co-operative play, and a class system will be introduced to replace&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s usual Perks. Behaviour says it'll reveal more about this mode later this year.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Behaviour also revealed a brand new crossover:&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>is coming to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</p>
<p>We don't know too much else about this crossover yet, but it'll be interesting to see how it pans out. If Dracula is the killer, surely none of the Belmonts can be survivors? After all, Belmonts don't flee from Dracula.</p>
<p>That's all for today's jam-packed&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>anniversary show, anyway. Stay tuned for more on everything you've heard about here!</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight</a> is turning eight years old, and Montreal-based series creators Behaviour Interactive had certainly a lot to announce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIwtIGmevQE&amp;ab_channel=DeadbyDaylight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during their big anniversary broadcast</a>. Plenty of new detail was provided about the new Dungeons &amp; Dragons update, although we also learned that a Castlevania chapter is on the way later this year. Players can also look forward to the introduction of a mode with two killers instead of the usual one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are plenty of spinoffs on the way. We got a new trailer for the Supermassive-Games-developed narrative adventure The Casting of Frank Stone, and some information on “Project T,” a new PvE shooter spinoff set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Perhaps most exciting and unexpected, Behaviour shadow dropped What the Fog, a new cartoony Dead by Daylight action platformer.</p>
<p>Before we jump into anything else, let’s check out the cinematic trailer for Dead by Daylight: Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | Dungeons &amp; Dragons | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dcizzog5WBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dead by Daylight: Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ new killer is the lich king Vecna, who brings the following unique abilities to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Fly</strong> grants him flying speed for a short time, letting him pass over obstacles in his path.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Flight of the Damned</strong> conjures flying spectral entities that can pass through obstacles and cause harm to all they hit.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Mage </strong>Hand creates a ghastly, phantasmic hand that can complete tasks such as holding and blocking the use of Pallets.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Dispelling Sphere</strong> creates a moving AOE sphere that reveals Survivors and disables their Magical Items.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the new survivors are a pair of bards, Aestri Yazar and Baermar Uraz (you’ll have the same perks and abilities regardless of who you pick).</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Mirrored Illusion</strong> spawns a static copy of the Survivor in front of a Totem, Chest, Generator or Exit Gate for a limited time</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Bardic Inspiration</strong> inspires others through a stirring performance. Roll a d20 and fellow Survivors get a Skill Check buff depending on the result of the roll.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Still Sight</strong> lets you briefly see the auras of all close by Generators, Totems, and Chests.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A new dungeon-esque map, the Forgotten Ruins, featuring treasure chests you’ll need to roll a 20-sided die to open, will also be part of the D&amp;D chapter.</p>
<p>Moving on to the 2v8 mode, Behaviour is promising it will take place on larger maps, the replacement of perks with a new class system, and a new cage mechanic instead of hooks. Behaviour is promising to reveal more about the mode in July.</p>
<p>Next up, here’s a first gameplay trailer for The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Casting of Frank Stone | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1xixINNd6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And here’s an early look at Project T, which is clearly very much a work in progress at this point.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project T | A First Look" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b1_DhOrH4Ds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And here’s What the Fog, which is available to download… right now! Those with a Behaviour account can get the game for free, although Behaviour is only giving away 2 million copies. If you miss out, the game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139020/What_the_Fog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on Steam for 5 bucks</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What the Fog - Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZGSG0CihE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, here’s your first peek at the Dead by Daylight Castlevania chapter. Apparently, more will be revealed on August 6.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dead by Daylight | Castlevania | Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YEfRYKRr8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Phew! That was a lot of stuff! Dead by Daylight can be played on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and mobile devices. The Dungeons &amp; Dragons will be available on June 3, although it’s available on PC test servers now.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24155657/lonely-island-jorma-taccone-knuckles-musical</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lonely-island%E2%80%99s-jorma-taccone-couldn%E2%80%99t-stop-adding-jokes-to-knuckles%E2%80%99-dream-musical.870528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24155657/lonely-island-jorma-taccone-knuckles-musical<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="P79yI1">The nonsense was all there on the page — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140560/knuckles-cast-adam-pally-kid-cudi-interview">Adam Pally</a> in an echidna costume, Julian Barratt rocking out in an owl headdress, an enormous puppet hell demon, a black-box-theater-worthy interpretation of a Sonic stage — but when director Jorma Taccone began orchestrating the hallucinatory musical tucked inside <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140560/knuckles-cast-adam-pally-kid-cudi-interview"><em>Knuckles</em>’</a> fourth episode, his impulse was to pile on even more. </p>
<p id="ZjmMHX">“Toby [Ascher, the showrunner], right from the jump was like, <em>Look, I was raised on Adult Swim, I want to make this weird and push boundaries and make this as interesting and different and unexpected as possible</em>,” Taccone tells Polygon. “And obviously, that’s up my alley.”</p>
<p id="1nyBY0">The episode, “The Flames of Disaster,” is not just up Taccone’s alley — he built the dang alley. After breaking out with Digital Shorts on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, the Lonely Island member applied his go-hard-or-go-home comedy stylings to feature work like <em>MacGruber</em> and <em>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping</em>. While, on paper, a spinoff of the Sonic the Hedgehog movies may not have immediately called for his established skill set, his longtime collaborator Brandon Trost, the director of photography on <em>Popstar</em> and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> who pivoted to directing on <em>Knuckles</em>, convinced Taccone to step in for a one-off. </p>
<p id="tH8jct">Thanks to a lo-fi approach to executing on the musical concept, Taccone could basically do whatever he wanted, and with the resources of a major motion picture crew; <em>Knuckles</em> employed most of the same crew from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23021865/sonic-2-knuckles-director-interview"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em></a>, that would eventually go straight from the series into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131363/keanu-reeves-shadow-the-hedgehod-sonic-3"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a>. </p>
<p id="Q4yZr2">“My goal for the episode was honestly to have this be something that you watch and are like, <em>Whoa, what was that?</em> — it’s so packed for 21, 22 minutes,” Taccone says, still sounding as giddy as he was on set. “When I showed it to my wife, her response was, ‘I don’t even know what to say about that.’” </p>

<p id="EODsil">“The Flames of Disaster” picks up the morning after a raucous Shabbat dinner, as bounty hunter Jack Sinclair (Barratt) kidnaps deputy sheriff Wade Whipple (Pally) off the porch of his mom’s house. Knuckles declines to save him — Wade needs to become a true warrior, and this is his shot. Even if he’s being carted across Idaho in an electrified steel cage. As Wade reels from shocks to the brain, the action shifts to his subconsciousness, where Pachacamac (voiced by Christopher Lloyd), the elder of Knuckles’ tribe, appears to him at a bowling alley of the mind to send him on a spiritual journey — of interpretive dance and puppetry.</p>

<p id="SKdOvd">The first thing Taccone did when he received the script for “The Flames of Disaster” was call his brother Asa Taccone, who has played an instrumental role in writing the songs for Lonely Island over the years. Working with another of their go-to collaborators, composer Matthew Compton, the trio wrote a power ballad for Barratt to wail as Pally swayed, kicked, ran, and twirled his way around the bowling alley set. At this point, Taccone can’t even tell if he’s parodying anything with “The Flames of Disaster” — “honestly it feels very Lonely Island to me?” he says, realizing he had created his own musical subgenre — but when the song was wrapped up, it made sense to call in a favor with one of his leading creative inspirations: Michael Bolton. </p>
<p id="n8MVKd">The Lonely Island gave Bolton a late-career resurgence with their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6CfKcMhjY"><em>SNL</em> video “Jack Sparrow.” </a>Now Taccone can text him when he needs a little of that Bolton magic on a new project.</p>
<p id="aZk7DZ">“It’s been bizarre in my life to say that I can consider Val Kilmer a friend [after <em>MacGruber</em>], and it’s been bizarre to say that Michael Bolton is definitely a dear friend,” Taccone says. “We call him Lord Boltron, which I would really like to spread as much as possible. We really want people at concerts to be yelling out ‘LORD BOLTRON!!’”</p>

<p id="SY8ilh">“The Flames of Disaster” checked two boxes for the <em>Knuckles</em> production: An episode with very little of its main star, a pricey CG creation, and an episode that could lean even further into the lo-fi to contrast with anything the audience would expect from the series. Taccone approached it as a “community theater production,” despite working with many of the most sought after production heads working in Hollywood.</p>
<p id="TwsJXk">When Taccone met the episode’s choreographer — Ellen Kane, whose credits include West End productions and the recent <em>Matilda</em> movie — he remembers her being super game for any wacky idea. He could only be self-deprecating. “I was like, ‘Just know... this <em>is</em> beneath you.’”</p>
<p id="37rHdt">But Taccone sells himself short: The ultimate production is astounding. The director says his personal comedy mantra is “comedy is contrast” and there are examples everywhere. Pally spends most of the episode in a dingy Knuckles costume dancing through Kane’s precision choreography like he’s in <em>Fame</em>. A giant demon erupts from the back halls of the bowling alley only to go on and on about browsing Facebook Marketplace (“My whole thing was: I just want him looking for mountain bikes,” Taccone says.) There are throwaway gags — watch for the puppets phasing in and out of the dream — that the director says he carved out time for just because if anyone caught them for a split second they’d get a laugh. Not every dream came true, like the floating head of Michael Bolton, but he came close. With a seasoned team, he could say “Can I get a flare gun? I want the mailman to shoot a flare gun,” and then he’d have a flare gun. </p>

<p id="DWZeVU">“I am so used to working within the margins of not a lot of time or money, and being able to shoot a lot in that amount of time,” Taccone says. “And while this is way more episode days than I had had on things like <em>MacGruber</em>, we packed it back. I was trying to get a lot of shots per day. So certain parts we almost treated it like a music video. The first thing I did was have them buy me a little Bluetooth speaker so I could even run playback [of the song] just so I could get more takes quickly and read cue things very quickly. So I could do all these lines from Julian really fast, so fast I couldn’t wait for us to even connect to the timecode.” </p>
<p id="Fr4mzu">The absurdity is technical, and for Taccone, the results are transcendent. He is the most surprised that an episode of the <em>Knuckles</em> TV show made him get… a little teary. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24155430/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover-vecna<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="PeaPI9"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/dead-by-daylight/39050"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a> is a game absolutely packed with murderous monsters, both original and licensed from other franchises. The next crossover is a little bit outside of the usual horror wheelhouse — <em>Dead by Daylight </em>is producing a chapter themed around the wildly popular tabletop game <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Vecna, known in-game as The Lich, will be the game’s next Killer. Vecna is joined by a pair of Elven bards, one male and one female, who will serve as the new Survivors. </p>
<p id="RBE67h">Behaviour Interactive announced the crossover during the game’s anniversary stream Tuesday, which included sneak peeks of other titles in the same universe and a new 2v8 gameplay mode.</p>
<p id="g6WUOI">Vecna is a powerful mage, with access to an array of spells. He can fly, summon spectral entities, create a mage hand to manipulate items, and dispel magic. While most Killers in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> focus on throwing hatchets or swinging a blade, Vecna uses magical abilities to hunt down Survivors. Luckily, there’s an upside to facing him as an enemy. When Vecna is the Killer, he spawns chests around the map. Opening them starts a dice roll, and if the player is lucky enough, they can obtain some of Vecna’s legendary loot. </p>
<p id="clUNU0">The Eye and Hand of Vecna can be obtained from these chests. The Eye of Vecna grants invisibility to Survivors after they leave a locker, while the Hand of Vecna allows you to teleport between lockers. If you roll a critical failure, Behaviour promises something terrible happens — but we don’t know what quite yet.</p>
<p id="C8XbNo">With the runaway success of<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/10/19/21519763/baldurs-gate-3-review-larian-rpg-dungeons-and-dragons"> <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>, as well as the recent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23635507/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-sxsw-review-spoiler-free">Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie</a>, it’s interesting to see Dungeons &amp; Dragons expand even further by entering the illustrious cast of the asymmetrical horror game. <em>Stranger Things</em>, a show no stranger to D&amp;D tie-ins, based its season four antagonist on Vecna, and they even share the same name — so maybe he’ll form a special bond with <em>Stranger Things’ </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/19/20812070/stranger-things-dead-by-daylight-nancy-wheeler-steve-harrington-demogorgon-chapter"><em>Dead by Daylight</em> Kille</a>r, the Demogorgon, who was similarly named after a D&amp;D monster.</p>
<p id="xNGmdh">Behaviour also teased the next licensed chapter, which will be a cross-over with the Castlevania franchise. We don’t know who the Killer or Survivor will be for that, but we can expect details later this summer. The stream also shared that a third licensed chapter will arrive before the end of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>’s next anniversary.</p>
<p id="KaP1B8">For fans who prefer the original aspects of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, Behaviour shared a look at some other games in the same universe. <em>The Casting of Frank Stone</em> is a branching narrative game from <em>Until Dawn </em>developer Supermassive, similar to <em>The Quarry</em> or the Dark Pictures Anthology. A two-player co-op title called <em>What the Fog</em> is also briefly available for free with the registration of a Behaviour account, and it looks like a much cuter and absurd take on the Entity’s Realm.</p>
<p id="5lsb9C">The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> DLC is coming to the test realm today, and the chapter will release on live servers on June 3.</p>

Once you’re in, you’ll be standing right next to the church where Aerith and Cloud met (try not to cry!).

Walk a few steps forward and she’ll blink out of existence. </p><h2 id="h8252"><a id=""></a>Hey, I didn’t see her ghost. What gives?</h2><p>For reasons unknown, you can actually disable Aerith’s ghost loading into the church without even knowing it. During Cloud’s flashback, if you chat with the owner of the Inn in Nibelheim and say “Let me know the situation,” it disables Aerith’s ghost. </p><p>No one knows for sure why this happens. Unfortunately, the flashback scene takes place very early in the game, so you’d likely need to go back and play it all over again if you accidentally disabled the ghost scene.Which, hey, replaying <em>FF7</em> is hardly a bad thing anyway.</p><h2 id="h8253"><a id=""></a>Is that <em>really</em> Aerith’s ghost?</h2><p>There’s a spooky subtlety in the Aerith’s ghost “scene.” One of the kids you’ll find upon re-entering the church and seeing Aerith’s ghost will say “Hey, where’s the flower lady” if you chat with them.

Firstly, you can see an option titled “After Aerith’s death” in the game’s dubugging program for activating this ghost scene. Secondly, there’s a bit of scrapped dialogue from an NPC that was removed from the game who, upon talking too after re-entering Midgar, says that they saw a woman disappear and that the church is haunted. To me, that’s an indication that Square Enix was at least thinking about the idea of the church being haunted and people seeing apparitions there.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341"><em>Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Retro Review</a></span></p><p>That said, as some have found out, there is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/0vViHqNrd6E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/0vViHqNrd6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unused Aerith dialogue</a></span> found in the game’s files that would play <em>after</em> her death, indicating that previous versions of the story might’ve involved Aerith living in some way after the events in the City of the Ancients.</p><p>But whether it’s an intentional spooky and sad moment, or the result of some leftover code running amok, I happen to enjoy the idea of briefly seeing Aerith’s spirit for a brief moment. Plus, it kind of makes Aerith’s ghostly depictions in <em>Advent Children</em> and <em>FF7 Rebirth</em> a little more harmonious to the original.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Midwinter Entertainment, a studio underneath Behaviour Interactive, has released a first look at its upcoming game currently known as Project T. </p>



<p>Project T is a 1-4 player PvE co-op shooter that’s in early development. The game is set in the same universe as Dead by Daylight by, according to Midwinter, expands on the world, ”&nbsp;introducing new characters, gameplay, and settings – as well as a few familiar elements for those in the know.”</p>



<p>In the first look that you can see below, Project T has you play as “trespassers” who have been taken out of their world and trapped within the Entity in a region called the Backwater. Within the game, players will have to watch out for monsters called “The Thrall” that come in various forms and have different abilities.</p>



<p>The Backwater, artistic director Risa Taneda says, will be an ever-changing landscape that will offer numerous gameplay features.</p>



<p>As of writing, there’s no set release date for the game nor are their confirmed platforms aside from PC. The studio did announce an Insider Program that will allow players to help shape the game during development as well as receive regular development updates and even playtest opportunities. You can sign up for the Project T Insider Program <a href="https://insiderprogram.bhvr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the game’s official website</a>.</p>

Players were treated to a small glimpse of what they can expect when the long-running gaming franchise swoops in to sink its teeth into <em>Dead by Daylight</em> later this year.</p></blockquote><p>And here are more details on the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Chapter:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome weary travelers. A new Chapter in our tale is about to begin. One filled with pain and power. Fantasy and fear. One driven by the darkest magic and told in song around flickering campfires. <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> has come to <em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</p><p>Fifty years ago, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> first inspired mere mortals to enter its world and campaign to become legends. In celebration of this milestone, the franchise is expanding its horizons with a rare plunge into horror, infusing dark fantasy into the <em>Dead by Daylight</em> universe with a new Killer, Survivor, Map, and <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-inspired gameplay elements.</p><p>Our story unfolds in the crumbling Forgotten Ruins, where the power-hungry villain, The Lich—Vecna, will stop at nothing to achieve his gruesome ambitions. Aestri Yazar, a Bard, has found herself cast into this forsaken land. She must survive at all costs—for who else will be able to tell the tale should she perish?</p><p>Will you seek to impose your deadly will, or face the darkness and survive with your party of 4? Ambitious adventurers can get their start early with a limited-time public test build on Steam. Just remember—the difference between life and death is sometimes just a roll of a die.</p><p><strong>An Eternal Tyrant</strong></p><p>The Whispered One. Lord of the Rotted Tower. The Master of Secrets. Few dare speak his true name. Vecna’s thirst for dark knowledge led him to many strange realms, but a clue found by a servant ignited a new obsession. It spoke of an unknown land. A realm of fog, home to an incredible dark energy.</p><p>Driven to harness this power, Vecna spent endless nights fixated on how he might wield it. When he finally found a way in – when The Fog came – excitement washed over him. He’d conquered and ruled countless Realms before, why would this be any different?</p><p>Vecna knows no fear, for he carries the Book of Vile Darkness. With it and within the Entity’s Realm, he can cast four spells:</p><ul><li>Fly grants him flying speed for a short time, letting him pass over obstacles in his path.</li><li>Flight of the Damned conjures flying spectral entities that pass-through obstacles and cause harm to all they hit.</li><li>Mage Hand creates a ghastly, phantasmic hand that completes tasks such as holding and blocking the use of Pallets.</li><li>Dispelling Sphere creates a moving AOE sphere that reveals Survivors and disables their Magical Items.</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_882435"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Bardic Inspirations</strong></p><p>What would the world be without darkness to contrast the light? What would one sing about if not for the delicate balance between good and evil? Players will be able to choose between Aestri Yazar, an Elf, and Baermar Uraz, a Human, to form The Troupe and lead them on their final adventure.</p><p>As the forces of evil began to mysteriously vanish from the land, the Bards needed to find out why. Their arduous journey led them to the Rotted Tower. Mustering up the bravery for a chance encounter with the Arch-Lich, Vecna, they were instead met with a Black Fog.</p><p>Whether you choose the role of Aestri or Baermar, they enter the fray with three unique Perks:</p><ul><li>Mirrored Illusion spawns a static copy of the Survivor in front of a Totem, Chest, Generator or Exit Gate for a limited time</li><li>Bardic Inspiration inspires others through a stirring performance. Roll a d20 and fellow Survivors get a Skill Check buff depending on the result of the roll.</li><li>When not in motion, Still Sight lets you briefly see the auras of all close by Generators, Totems, and Chests.</li></ul><p><strong>Enter the Dungeon</strong></p><p>The setting for this journey lies in the Forgotten Ruins, a thrilling new Map. It is here that Vecna has made his domain while he researches the mysteries of the Realm. Be brave, traveler, beneath the ruins of a ruined tower lies an underground lair of terrible experiments and horrifying secrets.</p><p><strong>A Roll of the Dice</strong></p><p>New tools are available to fight this evil. When facing off against Vecna, seven Chests are scattered across the Map. Seek out their loot and gain untold powers.</p><p>To open a Chest, the adventurer must roll a d20. Should you roll a 2 or a 3, you’ll find a regular <em>Dead by Daylight</em> item. Rolling a 4 to 19, however, unlocks a Magical Item—either Gauntlets or Boots, that are equipped automatically. Each Magical Item gives the wearer an ability designed to counter one of Vecna’s spells.</p><p>Rolling a 20, a critical success, grants a powerful Magical Item that can be used like a Perk.</p><ul><li>The Eye of Vecna allows the user to vanish for a brief period after exiting a Locker.</li><li>The Hand of Vecna allows the user to teleport from one Locker to another.</li></ul><p>They may be powerful, but power comes at a cost. Each time they are called upon, the user loses a Health State, so choose your moment wisely.</p><p>As for the unlucky adventurers who roll a 1, a critical fail, they have a nasty surprise waiting for them.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dead by Daylight</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [6,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,295 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [26,676 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,145 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,062 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/dead-by-daylight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/dead-by-daylight-windows/9nms4sfnbgbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>View a new set of screenshots <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/dead-by-daylight/may-14-2024/">at the gallery</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is officially slashing its way onto PC this month, and for anyone looking to experience the open-world samurai game on Steam Deck, there's <em>mostly </em>good news. Sony's PC porting studio Nixxes has confirmed that Ghost of Tsushima will be playable on Steam Deck--and "similar" handheld gaming PCs--but only for the single-player campaign and its Iki Island expansion.</p><p>The Ghost of Tsushima: Legends co-op multiplayer mode won't be playable on that system due to it requiring Windows to access PlayStation Network integrated features. This has led to a strange situation where the game has been listed as "Unsupported" for Steam Deck.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After teasing the announcement on social media late last week, Behavior Interactive released full details on the next crossover event coming to Dead By Daylight--Dungeons And Dragons, which will introduce a new Killer, two new Survivors, a new map, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">The Dead By Daylight: Dungeons And Dragons event will introduce Vecna, the Lord Of The Rotted Tower, to the game as a Killer character. He wields the Book of Vile Darkness, which allows him to cast four spells in pursuit of survivors:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Fly</strong>, which lets him fly over obstacles for a short time</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Flight Of The Damned</strong>, which summons ghost-like creatures that can pass through obstacles and damage anyone they make contact with</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mage Hand</strong>, which creates a magic floating hand that completes tasks for Vecna</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Dispelling Sphere</strong>, which sends a moving energy sphere across the map that can reveal Survivors and disable certain items</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4302741-dbddnd.png" data-ref-id="1300-4302741" data-ratio="0.56410256410256" data-width="936" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4302741-dbddnd.png" data-ref-id="1300-4302741"></a><figcaption>Vecna in Dead By Daylight: Dungeons And Dragons</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4302741-dbddnd.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The event will also add a pair of Survivors to the mix, both of whom are bards--the elf Aestri Yazar and the human Baermar Uraz. Each bard possesses the same perks when selected:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mirrored Illusion</strong>, which creates a decoy version of the character in front of specific points on the map</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bardic Inspiration</strong>, which gives each Survivor certain perks based on a d20 roll</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Still Sight</strong>, which reveals the locations of Totems, Generators, and Chests by standing still for a short time</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Finally, a new map based on Dungeons and Dragons' Forgotten Ruins will be added via the update. The map features multiple chests with contents depending on the roll of a d20; those contents are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>1 (Critical Fail)</strong>: A "nasty surprise"</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>2-3:</strong> Normal item</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>4-19:</strong> Magical items which automatically equips and can be used to repel Vecna's attacks</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>20 (Critical Success)</strong>: One of two magical items that acts like perks  <ul><li dir="ltr">The Eye Of Vecna: User can disappear for a short time after exiting a locker</li><li dir="ltr">The Hand Of Vecna: User can teleport from one locker to another</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">The D&amp;D event wasn't the only collaboration mentioned during the livestream, however, as the event ended with a brief teaser for a Castlevania-themed event. The event is scheduled for "later this year," with more information coming August 6.</p><p dir="ltr">Dead By Daylight is available now for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Other features coming to the game for its eighth anniversary include a 2v8 mode and a new standalone co-op roguelite game.</p>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Anytime I log into&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rarest-fortnite-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a></em>, I always end up in a jaw-clenching, competitive mood, especially when the triumphant of Victory Royale is in my grasp. But, in a surprising turn of events, my recent session offered a moment of peace and relaxation, thanks to the new <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@lofigirl/6437-7858-4061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lofi Girl <em>Fortnite</em></a> exploration map.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Embarking on this map, you’ll be immediately enveloped in the comforting embrace of Lofi beats. It’ll take you on an object-finding mission to search for musical and secret notes. For those who’ve long been captivated by Lofi Girl, the setting will feel familiar, as it’s the very spot of her iconic room.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">But here’s the twist — you won’t be seeing it from&nbsp;a regular perspective. Instead, you’ll be shrunk down to a miniature size, offering a whimsical and fun twist to the gameplay. It’s a concept reminiscent of beloved&nbsp;films like&nbsp;<em>Toy Story&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Small Soldiers.</em><br></p>

Getting from one end of the room to the other almost felt like a journey to Mordor. But still, there’s no rushing around on this&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;map, so I can’t complain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">Equipped with a Grapple, Wardrobe Selector, and Radio Selector, you’ll navigate through a variety of sounds, mirroring the diverse music on Lofi Girl’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LofiGirl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a>. From synthwaves to dark ambient moods, the map offers an immersive audio experience, complete with ambient sounds that mimic rain, white noise, and forest vibes.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">There are a bunch of tiny details scattered around the room to pay more homage to Lofi Girl. One of the most prominent ones is the display on the computer, depicting Lofi Girl in her element on her YouTube page. Her headphones, including Lofi Boy’s, are also available for character customization.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-use-the-creative-mode-code-to-access-the-lofi-girl-fortnite-map" data-injectable="false">Use the Creative Mode code to access the Lofi Girl <em>Fortnite</em> map</h2> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">While <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-2024-collab-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the collaboration</a> between Lofi Girl and&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;may seem like an unexpected pairing, it’s not entirely surprising. Epic Games has a history of unique collaborations, such as the Rocket League&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rocket-league-teams-up-with-the-lofi-girl-for-this-years-frosty-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frosty Fest event</a>. Now,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;players can further indulge in their love for Lofi Girl by using the ‘6437-7858-4061’ to access her<em>&nbsp;</em>map.</p> <figure data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">Now, all that’s left is for Lofi Girl to get a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>skin (could also throw Lofi Boy in there). Maybe then Battle Royale can be much more chill, rather than the bustling competition it is today.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="198" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For fans of Brandon Sanderson’s <em>The Stormlight Archive</em>, the fifth book in the series—<em>Wind and Truth</em>—marks an important place in the saga, serving as the conclusion to its first story arc. </p> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="216" data-injectable="false">So, be you a long-time reader or have only recently been getting into the series, here’s a run down of <em>Wind and Truth</em>‘s release date, how you can pre-order it, and how you can read an early glimpse of it.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-release-date-for-wind-and-truth" data-injectable="false">What is the release date for <em>Wind and Truth</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true"><em>Wind and Truth</em> is scheduled to <strong>release on Friday, December 6</strong>, just in time for Christmas in case you know any Brandon Sanderson fans. You’ll want to make sure they haven’t bought it already, and have at least read the previous books. As the fifth and final entry in a story arc that began in 2010, <em>Wind and Truth</em> probably isn’t the best jumping on point for Sanderson’s epic fantasy series.</p>
 <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">This also isn’t the end of <em>The Stormlight Archives</em> as a whole. Sanderson has said in the past he envisions the series as consisting of 10 books. So, while <em>Wind and Truth</em> is an ending per se, it only marks the halfway point of the wider saga. After <em>Wind and Truth</em>, there will be a sequel series comprised of another five books; one set after a big time skip according to<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5t9nyy/comment/dgvwl8j/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> a 2017 Reddit AMA</a> Sanderson hosted.</p>

 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to read the <em>Wind and Truth</em> prologue</h2> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="false">On March 31, 2022, Sanderson uploaded the prologue chapter for <em>Wind and Truth</em> to his website. You can <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/prologue-to-stormlight-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">read it for yourself here</a>, and it’s a chunky chapter, offering a new perspective on the night Gavilar, King of Alethkar, was assassinated. It’ll hopefully keep you satiated until the book’s full release, but Sanderson did note that this is a rough draft, so some details may be changed or tweaked in the final product.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-tsushima-is-unsupported-on-steam-deck-due-to-psn.870489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-steam-deck-unsupported<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s multiplayer mode won't be playable on Steam Deck, Sony and porting studio Nixxes have announced, and the reason once again involves PSN.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/04/17/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-cross-play-and-system-requirements-revealed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">p</a><a href="https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1790396884873355624" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ost on X</a> outlining the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-system-requirements">impending PC release</a>, Nixxes says that&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s single-player mode, including its&nbsp;<em>Iki Island&nbsp;</em>expansion, will be fully playable on Steam Deck thanks to extensive optimization efforts.</p>
<p>However, the game will technically sport an "Unsupported" rating on Steam Deck. That's the rating Valve assigns to games for which "some or all" of their functionality doesn't work on Steam Deck, and in&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s case, it's the multiplayer component.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-steam-deck-psn-jin-snow.jpg?itok=02rP6qA2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-steam-deck-psn-jin-snow.jpg?itok=eXoBAy5L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s single-player is fully playable on Steam Deck, but its multiplayer is not.</figcaption></figure><p>Nixxes says that because&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s multiplayer requires Windows "to access PlayStation Network integrated features", you won't be able to play the game on Steam Deck, which runs a custom Linux shell.</p>
<p>This represents another stumbling block for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>on PC when it comes to PSN integration. Last week, owing to its requirement for a PSN ID in order to access multiplayer, the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-no-longer-available-on-steam-in-almost-180-countries-due-to-psn-requirement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removed from Steam in many countries in which PSN is not available</a>.</p>
<p>A PSN account isn't required to play the single-player game, though, which is why you'll be able to enjoy it on your Steam Deck without any restrictions.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Sony has slipped up with regards to PSN account requirements.</p>
<p>Although Sony recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">walked back</a> a decision to require&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>players to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">link a PSN ID with their Steam account</a> to keep playing on PC, that game was also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-delisted-for-over-100-countries-on-steam">delisted in many non-PSN countries</a>, and at time of writing, it hasn't been restored.</p>
<h2><em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>global PC launch timings revealed</h2>
<p>It's not all doom and gloom for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>PC players, though. Along with the warning about Steam Deck compatibility, Nixxes also revealed the&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>global launch timings on PC.</p>
<p>Most areas of the world will get to play the game on May 16th, but if you're in Sydney, Auckland, or Tokyo, you'll have to wait until the following day due to time zone shenanigans.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-launch-timings.jpg?itok=bSZpmZIx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-launch-timings.jpg?itok=u-5Pj1B7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's when you'll get to play&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>on PC.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's a rundown of the timings featured in the image above.</p>
<ul><li>Los Angeles: 8am (PDT)</li>
<li>Mexico City: 9am (CST)</li>
<li>New York: 11am (EDT)</li>

<li>Sydney: 1am, May 17th (AEST)</li>
<li>Auckland: 3am, May 17th (NZST)</li>
</ul><p>As ever, if you don't live in one of these cities, pick the time zone closest to you and you'll be able to get a good idea of when the game will launch in your region.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156397/tomb-raider-series-amazon-phoebe-waller-bridge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In addition to announcing a second season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156409/hihi-b"><em>Mr. And Mrs. Smith</em></a> and a fifth season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156299/the-boys-are-coming-back-for-a-fifth-season"><em>The Boys</em></a>, Amazon is adding another new series to its television lineup: <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-video-orders-itomb-raideri-series-based-on-t">a live-action <em>Tomb Raider</em> series</a>. The series will be produced in collaboration between Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge serving as the show’s writer and executive producer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/27/23574923/amazon-tomb-raider-tv-series-phoebe-waller-bridge">confirming rumors reported earlier last year</a>.</p><p>The <em>Tomb Raider</em> series is no stranger to live-action adaptations. In the 2000s, Angelina Jolie starred as the badass grave robber in<em> Lara Croft: Tomb Raider </em>and its sequel, <em>The Cradle of Life</em>. At the time, both movies were financial if not critical successes but are viewed more favorably today, especially when compared to contemporaries like <em>Doom</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, and <em>Max Payne</em>. In 2018, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/7/12122532/tomb-raider-movie-reboot-alicia-vikander-lara-croft-march-2018">a reboot of the <em>Tomb Raider</em> movie franchise</a> was produced to follow up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9695274/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review">the reboot of the game series</a>, this time with <em>Ex Machina</em> star Alicia Vikander in the lead.</p><p>With the <em>Fallout</em> show hitting over 65 million viewers, Amazon has proven it can make a pretty good video game adaptation. Plus, the streamer is no stranger to successful adaptations of other mediums with <em>The Boys</em>, <em>Gen V</em>, and <em>Invincible</em>,<em> </em>so a <em>Tomb Raider</em> series seems like it could be a good fit. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/27/21031773/phoebe-waller-bridge-2019-fleabag-killing-eve-james-bond-amazon-prime-video-emmys">notable for her work on <em>Fleabag</em> and <em>Killing Eve</em></a>, also seems to be a fan of the series, sharing in Amazon’s press release, “Lara Croft means a lot to me, as she does to many, and I can’t wait to go on this adventure. Bats ‘n all.” I’m not sure if bats were a pain in the ass in the reboots as they were in the original trilogy, but at least, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24072931/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered-game-review">as an original trilogy fan myself</a>, I feel like the series is in capable hands. She also has hands-on tomb-raiding experience, so to speak, starring alongside Harrison Ford in the latest <em>Indiana Jones </em>movie.</p><div><p>The streamer is producing this new show in tandem with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23510923/amazon-tomb-raider-game-crystal-dynamics">Amazon Games publishing the next entry in the <em>Tomb Raider</em> game series</a>. This also means that if the <em>Tomb Raider</em> series turns out to be good, fans likely won’t have to wait too long for a new game like all the poor players <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-steam-pc-new-vegas-1851410034">jonesing for a new <em>Fallout</em> entry</a>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-megalopolis-trailer-might-be-the-coolest-thing-i%E2%80%99ve-ever-seen.870483/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24156434/megalopolis-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="N72y4i"><em>Megalopoli</em>s<em>, </em>legendary director Francis Ford Coppola’s first film in 14 years, is one of 2024’s most notable movies for two reasons. First, it is the decades-in-development self-funded passion project of a cinematic titan, and second, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/megalopolis-francis-ford-coppola-challenges-distribution-1235867556/">no one wants to distribute it</a>. On paper, that’s plenty baffling, but it only becomes more so when you see what the film looks like. </p>
<p id="38TxhT">An urban fantasy about an idealist who seeks to rebuild a New York City-like metropolis into a utopia following a disaster, the trailer is mostly a montage of dreams and decadence. Statues walk, chariots race in Madison Square Garden, and Adam Driver ruminates on the nature of utopias. </p>
<p id="HLLByi">At just a minute and a half, the trailer is awe-inspiring (even on a phone screen), with little context for the narrative. It’s the platonic ideal of movie marketing: Win, lose or draw, the trailer sells <em>Megalopolis</em> as something that <em>must</em> be seen, preferably in a theater. Let’s hope that after the film premieres at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, we get the chance to see it, and very soon at that. </p>

  <p id="Fwd752">After making fans wage war by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24107923/house-dragon-game-thrones-trailer-red-black-team">picking which of two trailers to watch on YouTube</a><em>, </em>HBO is back with a new trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419614/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2</a> that promises things will go quite badly no matter who your fave is. That’s the Westeros Promise, baby!</p>
<p id="LSmqLU">While the first season skipped through time, season 2 looks like it’s settling in for the long haul. The new episodes seem to depict the immediate fallout from last season, when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23368925/house-dragon-kids-who-rhaenyra-alicent-daemon-jace-joffrey-aegon">Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney)</a> was installed as king in a coup over Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D’Arcy), kicking off the Targaryen Civil War, aka <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23415231/house-dragon-green-blacks-dance-dragons-explained">the Dance of the Dragons</a>.</p>
<p id="6uVt9n">The new trailer shows off both sides of the Worst Family Ever amassing supporters and dragons, promising tons of sexy intrigue and backstabbing in addition to big, brutal battles atop horse and dragon. Frankly, it looks pretty spectacular, and even if the we know where this story ends, getting there seems like it’s gonna be a hell of a ride. </p>
<p id="og0jsW"><em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2 premieres on HBO and Max on June 16.</p>

The Xbox store has hosted the likes of Xbox Live Arcade, which shone a light on rising indie games that have gone on to worldwide acclaim, like <em>Castle Crashers</em>, and it still has a number of digital-only titles you can’t find anywhere else.

The sale is likely one of a few leading up to the closure of the Xbox 360 store in a few months. Until then, folks can pick up a number of 360 titles that will otherwise be disappearing at the end of July for dirt cheap.</p><p>For example, <em>Cloudberry Kingdom</em>, a Ubisoft-published title I haven’t heard about in <em>so</em> goddamn long, was delisted from Steam back in 2020 but is still available on the 360 digital store and on sale right now.

The Xbox 360 store is one of the last places you can buy it before it becomes lost media. Come July, that and a few other titles, like <em>Puzzle Arcade</em>, will be gone, so if you’re a preservationist, or just someone a little bit nostalgic for the early days of digital-only console games, you may want to give it a look.</p><p>Other games, like the Xbox 360 versions of 2014’s <em>Thief, Trials Fusion, </em>and <em>Far Cry 4</em>, will also be unavailable digitally once the store closes, but these are also titles you can find in print, on other systems like PC, or on modern console storefronts thanks to backward compatibility between the last few generations.</p><p>Some of the games listed vary between regions, but for the most part, there are over 60 games that you rarely see on sale that are heavily discounted right now. If you’ve got an Xbox 360, or think you might want to hold onto some of these titles, I’d urge you to get on it right now.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-players-filed-27-million-reports-in-six-months-%E2%80%93-but-only-10-were-legit.870471/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-players-reports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In the latest <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/45/df/45dff59c-7b36-44df-9e64-e673dae355c1.pdf?n=293843.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Transparency Report</a>, Microsoft revealed a whole host of information related to the moderation, user protection, and enforcement ecosystems it promotes across its gaming platforms. In a staggering figure, it was shown that more than 27.4 <strong>million </strong>reports were filed by Xbox players in the space of six months in H2 2023.</p>



<p>It was revealed that a whopping 12.7 million reports were filed regarding in-game or on-platform communications and that in the six months, more than 10.3 million enforcements were issued – but only 2.1 million of those came from player reports, which is fewer than 10% overall. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-issue">What’s The Issue?</h2>



<p>Either 25 million reports were filed in error (or maliciously) or Microsoft’s moderation system is a little more lenient than we’ve been led to believe.</p>



<p>If 27.4 million reports were filed but only 2.1 million reports ended up leading to enforcement, there’s a stark imbalance somewhere in the system. However, Microsoft was quick to confirm that proactive enforcement is much more prevalent, with the tech titan using automated systems to detect cheaters and malicious operators on its platforms. That’s primarily why H2 of 2023 saw a whopping 79% of all enforcement action come off the back of proactive measures.</p>



<p>Amazingly, it was revealed that Microsoft secured a proactive enforcement rate of 100% (or close enough to that figure) for account tampering, piracy, cheating, fraud, and phishing, slamming down on these topics long before they were reported by players. </p>



<p>Out of the millions of enforcements across the board, it was confirmed that around 693,000 were issued due to harassment or bullying, and another 551,000 were due to adult sexual content. At the other end of the spectrum, 7.32 million enforcements were issued due to cheating or inauthentic accounts. </p>



<p>In the closing slides, Microsoft claimed that it’s increasing more toxicity on its platforms over time, and that includes text-based, image-based, and video-based communications. That’s not always a good thing, though – an Xbox user recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-user-baldurs-gate-ban/">got a one-year ban</a> for sharing a captured game clip featuring a sex scene in Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Complicated Business of Pokémon</p>
      </div>
<h2>How To Get Poipole</h2><p>Unlike most other Ultra Beasts in Pokemon Go, Poipole is only obtainable through the World of Wonders Special Research story. Complete the first step of the questline and you'll earn a chance to catch Poipole. You have until June 1 to claim the World of Wonders Special Research.</p><p>If you've purchased a Wonder Ticket, you can also add a second Poipole to your collection by completing the third and final set of Timed Research tasks. Wonder Tickets are available through the in-game item shop until June 1 for $10 USD.</p><h2>How To Evolve Poipole Into Naganadel</h2><p>Poipole's evolved form, Naganadel, officially debuts in Pokemon Go on May 23, during the Ultra Space Wonders event. To obtain Naganadel, <strong>set Poipole as your buddy Pokemon and catch 20 dragon-type Pokemon</strong>. Once you've met that condition, you can evolve Poipole using <strong>200 Poipole Candy</strong>.</p><h2>Ultra Space Wonders Event</h2><p>As mentioned, Naganadel will debut as part of Pokemon Go's Ultra Space Wonders event, which runs until May 28.

Amazon Prime's foray into the iconic gaming property comes hot on the heels of its success with the Fallout series, and today's announcement only noted one talent signed to the project: Fleabag creator/writer/star Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Waller-Bridge is listed as a writer and executive producer here.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The series, based on the iconic Tomb Raider video game franchise, follows the adventures of world-famous archaeologist and adventurer Lara Croft," reads a press release. "The series is produced by Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios, and will premiere exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tomb Raider on TV">Tomb Raider on TV</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There have been a number of Tomb Raider adaptations for film, starting with the early 2000s films starring Angelina Jolie and the more recent 2018 reboot headlined by Alicia Vikander. If Waller-Bridge brings any of the trademark humor (and brutal honesty) of her Fleabag series to Tomb Raider, this could be a very different (and refreshing) take on the adventure property indeed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news also shows that Embracer is keen to get in on the current transmedia sweep, particularly for prestige TV and film. Amazon's own Fallout show has been, by all counts, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/amazon-says-fallout-attracted-65-million-viewers-in-just-over-two-weeks">a sweeping success</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with a second season in the works. HBO's The Last of Us show, also a huge hit, started the prestige trend, and also has a new season coming (with the potential for more).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Fallout and The Last of Us are any indication, popular series also see huge bumps in player counts for their associated video game properties—and Embracer was quick to mention a new Tomb Raider game is also in production. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fallout-games-double-in-player-count-after-prime-video-show">numbers indicate that, increasingly, viewers become players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—and players will go back for second helpings of the games after watching the shows.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

<p data-characters="221" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Today, during the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead by Daylight</a></em> 8th Anniversary livestream, Behaviour Interactive handed the floor over to developer Midwinter Entertainment to discuss its upcoming shared world shooter set in the same horrific world. </p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">Currently codenamed <em>Project T</em> and still very early in development, this third-person shooter takes players into the otherworldly <em>Dead by Daylight</em> fog and forces them to survive and thrive against the terrifying monsters that emerge from it. It’s a very different game for the franchise, but one Midwinter Entertainment wants to take the same approach with, developing it alongside the community based on their feedback and interactions. </p>
 <h2 id="h-project-t-playtest-pushes-playtest-sign-ups-live" data-injectable="false"><em>Project T</em> playtest pushes playtest sign ups live</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/truck-in-project-t.jpeg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Behaviour Interactive</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Behaviour Interactive</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Behaviour Interactive</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">Midwinter Entertainment offered a brief explanation of what <em>Project T</em> is, but you can see yourself in its upcoming playtests. All you need to do is sign up for the <a href="https://insiderprogram.bhvr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Program</a>, and you’ll receive emails about upcoming events as and when they’re planned. Initially, the playtest is only for PC, but will expand to consoles in the future. </p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">The <em>Dead by Daylight</em> spin-off is still in early development, but I’m mostly just itching to get in for for exclusive rewards being offered for playtesters. Gotta be lookin’ good and ready when<em> DbD</em> celebrates its eighth anniversary. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Not a survivor or a Killer, but a secret third thing</h2> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true">In <em>Project T</em>, players aren’t <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-survivor-perks-in-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivors</a> or Killers; they’re Trespassers. It’s a new role to the universe. They’re individuals who have also been whisked away from their reality by The Entity into its domain, where it hopes to extract even more fear from them. </p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Trespassers will find themselves in a realm called The Backwater, a sort of dark, overgrown swamp. They must work together and fight back against the monsters, known as The Thrall, that emerge from the fallen trees, sticky bogs, and feral overgrowth using whatever they have to hand. Thankfully, and perhaps surprisingly to <em>Dead by Daylight</em> fans, the main tools at a Trespasser’s disposal are guns. </p>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">The goal of each match is for Trespassers to complete objectives as they move through The Backwater and kill any Thrall that tries to stop them. The Backwater changes over time, though, meaning every match you play will look and feel different. There are trucks to help traverse, and while driving between objectives is one use for these vehicles, Midwinter Entertainment hinted they might be useful for completing those objectives as well. </p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">During a press preview, Midwinter Entertainment was asked about character crossovers with <em>Dead by Daylight</em>. The studio did not confirm what crossovers would look like, but did mention there will be a lot of crossover between <em>Project T </em>and <em>Dead by Daylight</em>. All I’ve been able to imagine since is a battle-hardened version of Dwight Fairfield with a shotgun and using his tie as a bandana. </p>

<p data-characters="308" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you enjoy driving cars around the <em>Fortnite</em> map, you’ll likely be more than familiar with running out of gas and traveling on foot until you find another vehicle. Visiting a gas station is a quick and easy way to refuel your car, allowing you to keep driving until you find another to take its place.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-a-gas-station-in-fortnite" data-injectable="false">Where to find a Gas Station in <em>Fortnite</em></h2> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Eight gas station spawns exist in <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5, Season 2, primarily around Reckless Railways and Rebel’s Roost. Other named landmarks like Snooty Steppes and Grand Glacier have stations nearby, giving you several locations to visit, depending on the Battle Bus’ travel direction. Below is a map of every gas station location.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">Almost every gas station also has a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-sports-car-locations-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">car spawn</a> for you to grab if your current one is low health. That way, you can quickly refuel and head out or swap out your car for an improved version. Sometimes, you may have a weekly or event quest asking you to visit a gas station and refuel your vehicle, allowing you to knock out this objective and get some quick and easy XP.</p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="false">Otherwise, if you&nbsp;just&nbsp;want to refuel your car, you can interact with a gas pump and bring the nozzle to your vehicle.&nbsp;As you hold your attack button toward the car with the gas nozzle, your fuel percentage will rise until it reaches 100&nbsp;percent. Just be careful, as, during this time, anyone can come in and damage you, your car, or the nearby pumps, creating dangerous explosions.&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="7gql5B">It’s been a bit of a slow time of year for comedy movies, but 2024 has enough laugh-out loud gems to round out a list. And there’s a wide variety of sub-genres to pick from: musical reboots, existential animated kids’ movies, campy horror flicks, and even a DC parody.</p>
<p id="FQB0r3">So behold: the best comedy movies of 2024 so far. This list will continue to be updated throughout the year, and will be sorted in reverse chronological order, so the newest movies always show up first. </p>

<p id="aat0ax"><strong>Where to watch:</strong> In theaters May 17 </p>

<p id="1hMB6r">Director Pamela Adlon (<em>Better Things</em>) gets nitty and gritty about the epic highs and lows of pregnancy in <em>Babes</em>, but the best part is the central relationship between two best friends. Eden (Ilana Glazer), a single yoga teacher, and Dawn (Michelle Buteau), a married dentist with two kids, have been besties for decades — and even though their life priorities are a bit different now, they make time for each other. </p>
<p id="Gko4uU">Eden finds herself pregnant after a one-night stand, and decides to go through with having the baby. It’s a new stage of their relationship, especially as Dawn struggles with balancing her job, her family, and her friendship with Eden, all while Eden embarks on this scary journey of single motherhood. It’s wickedly funny, but also says a lot about the strain adulthood puts on friendships. — <em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="UNVz7u">Director-star <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24119175/peoples-joker-director-interview-banned-batman-trans-movie">Vera Drew</a> initially planned <em>The People’s Joker </em><a href="https://www.thepeoplesjoker.com/get-involved">as a found footage movie</a>, pulling together clips from Joker’s past, present, and future to create a new Jokerfied experience. While the found footage element didn’t happen, the end result (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23353241/the-peoples-joker-review">after a brief delay over rights issues</a>) is a breath of fresh, satirical air in our IP-saturated landscape, part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24132301/trans-movies-2024-i-saw-tv-glow-peoples-joker-t-blockers-essay">a new wave of trans-authored cinema</a> that is shaking up what mainstream audiences can experience in trans film.</p>
<p id="SnZ4XM"><em>The People’s Joker </em>cleverly uses the DC canon as grounding for the setting, an avenue to explore gender expression, and for comedy, subverting expectations of these well-known characters. But my favorite part of the movie is how Vera utilizes many different styles of animation from many different creators to create a mixed media effect. It’s unlike anything else you’ll see this year. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="M9KJPp">The true story of the <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n03/bee-wilson/merely-a-warning-that-a-noun-is-coming">Littlehampton poison pen letter scandal of 1923</a> is a fairly depressing one, another in a long line of reminders that justice systems depend on people’s judgment, and people are notoriously prone to prejudice, stereotypes, and other forms of confirmation bias that get in the way of the truth. But Thea Sharrock’s lively (and heavily fictionalized) British comedy about the scandal addresses those points with a light perspective that offers a little uplift and a lot of good humor. International treasure Olivia Colman (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/24/18236661/the-favourite-story-ending"><em>The Favourite</em></a>) stars as Edith Swan, a pious working-class spinster who starts getting obscene anonymous letters; Jessie Buckley is her neighbor, Rose Gooding, a foul-mouthed libertine accused of writing them, in an era where calling someone a “foxy ass whore” in print was enough to warrant a prison sentence at hard labor.</p>
<p id="IalFAt">The absolute shock and disbelief Edith and Rose’s entire community feels over seeing words like “asshole” in print is part of the humor here, but a lot more of it comes from Jonny Sweet’s bouncy, winking script, which keeps the action zippy and highlights the ironies of an entire community full of hypocrites delighting in their self-righteous offense at the letters. (Any metaphor for today’s online communications is strictly intended.) Colman and Buckley’s performances add a terrific edge to it all, but this is an ensemble piece at heart, and Anjana Vasan as a lady detective trying to wade through institutional sexism rounds out the cast for a lively, sparky story that isn’t particularly believable as history, but sure lands well as funny, engaging metaphor. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="YPgfRS">Don’t get fooled by only seeing one Coen name in the credits; <em>Drive-Away Dolls</em> (or its original title, which still appears in the credits: <em>Drive-Away Dykes</em>) has the same hilarious crime-caper spirit that marks all of the Coen brothers’ best early works. </p>
<p id="3QmTsK">The ’90s-set movie follows two lesbian friends (Margaret Qualley and Geraldine Viswanathan) on an East Coast road trip with two clueless gangsters hot on their trail. Equal parts excellent friends-on-the-road movie and crime comedy, <em>Drive-Away Dolls</em> is an early contender for the most fun movie of 2024, and one that will likely be hard to beat. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="0v8i8b">“What if Looney Tunes, but for adults, and filtered through video games and silent slapstick comedy?” That’s the genius combination that makes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24127338/hundreds-of-beavers-movie-review-funny-new-comedy-silent"><em>Hundreds of Beavers</em></a><em> </em>one of the most special movies of the year, a pure expression of cinematic comedy that will have you laughing in stitches. The low-budget indie follows Jean Kayak (Ryland Brickson Cole Twes), a trapper trying to survive in the harsh winter of the Great Lakes region. He’s surrounded by hundreds of beavers (which are presented as people in mascot beaver costumes) who view him as a threat, and he must solve a series of problems and puzzles to survive and thrive in the harsh environment.</p>
<p id="9eYmMI">Ludicrously silly and packed to the brim with jaw-dropping gags and special effects on its limited budgets, <em>Hundreds of Beavers </em>is the funniest movie I’ve seen in years. It’s the perfect antidote for what has ailed mainstream American comedy for years, by actually bringing back jokes instead of just the tone of comedy. I can not recommend it highly enough. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="qOxu2E">Fans of the Broadway musical <em>Mean Girls</em>, based on the 2004 movie <em>Mean Girls</em>, have understandably bridled against some of the changes in this screen adaptation, from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24036144/mean-girls-songs-cut-from-broadway-musical-differences">many songs cut from the Broadway version</a> to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24033633/mean-girls-musical-movie-review-2024-tina-fey">casting of protagonist Cady Heron</a>. But while it’s an imperfect translation of the stage experience, it still stands on its own as a lively, creatively staged movie that puts plenty of verve into its catchy, inviting musical numbers.</p>
<p id="e2cruF">The performances aren’t out to replace the 2004 version of the movie: They’re new interpretations, delivered with big musical energy. This is a tremendously fun movie, designed to send people home singing. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="ajGXRN">Jake Johnson’s directorial debut follows a man who’s so at sea after a breakup that he agrees to star in an underground reality competition where he tries to survive for a month with assassins trying to kill him. But <em>Self Reliance</em> isn’t the kind of manic thriller that premise suggests; Johnson told Polygon it’s much more of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24036265/jake-johnson-self-reliance-interview-wes-anderson-connection">a mashup of two of his favorite movies</a>: Wes Anderson’s <em>Bottle Rocket</em> and the Adrian Lyne thriller <em>Jacob’s Ladder</em>. That’s an odd combination of improbably dissimilar projects, but they coalesce into an offbeat indie comedy about human connection, and the mortifying ordeal of trying to be known by people who aren’t all that interested in the knowing.</p>
<p id="W4zkl1">Produced by The Lonely Island and featuring Andy Samberg playing himself in a pretty hilarious cameo, <em>Self Reliance</em> has some of the same dry humor and secret sentiment as the group’s movie <em>Palm Springs</em>, but with even smaller stakes and even less predictable storytelling. It’s goofy stuff, but it’s an enjoyably light story that’s designed to keep the audience guessing. And it’s just about impossible to watch without wondering: <em>Would I do any better under these circumstances? </em>—<em>TR</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I think most people will agree the future doesn’t look too promising. Between crappy AI replacing real humans and billionaires controlling more and more of the world, things seem a bit bleak, I’d say. So<em> Mullet Madjack</em>, a new retro-inspired, anime-themed, first-person shooter on PC, comes at a perfect time. It’s a fast-paced, action-packed game where you use guns, knives, kicks, and bombs to kill rich AI-powered robot billionaires who have turned humanity into a massive, ever-consuming audience. In other words, it’s catharsis in the form of a boomer shooter. Oh, and it’s also one of the best games I’ve played this year. </p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Out May 15 on Steam, <em>Mullet Madjack</em> tasks you with saving an influencer who has been kidnapped by evil robillionaires for reasons that are so good I won’t spoil them here. But suffice to say, these AI/human/robot hybrid monsters are greedy and dangerous, and will end up destroying everything if they aren’t stopped. And that’s where you come in.</p><p>You arrive at a large building and have to fight your way up each floor as quickly as you can to make sure the audience of humans watching the violence doesn’t get bored. You only have 10 seconds to finish each floor, but killing robots, blowing shit up, and doing cool moves gives you extra time. And if you fail, you die. But don’t worry, you’ll get another chance, albeit back on the bottom floor. The audience is never satisfied. Not even death is an escape in <em>Mullet Madjack</em>. Sorry.<br></p><p>Unlike other recent retro shooters—like <em>Boltgun </em>and <em>Hrot</em>—which are often about exploring open levels, finding secrets, and using keys to progress through locked doors, <em>Mullet Madjack</em> is different. This is a game all about speed and style. You’ll finish most levels without killing every AI-infused monster that you encounter. You just need to kill enough to stay alive, keep the timer going, and make it to the next exit.<br></p><h2 id="h8221"><a id=""></a>Less <em>Doom </em>and more <em>Hades</em></h2><p>And unlike other boomer shooters, you aren’t picking up new weapons or ammo. Instead, <em>Madjack </em>is structured more like a roguelike. Between each floor, you get a chance to unlock an upgrade or new ability. As you defeat super-rich robots every 10 floors, the lore of <em>Mullet Madjack </em>is revealed more and more, though I didn’t need that carrot on the stick to keep playing.<br></p><p>Even if <em>Mullet Madjack</em> didn’t have killer, ‘80s anime style and fantastic worldbuilding, I’d still recommend it in a heartbeat because the combat is just that good. It starts out simple enough, but as you work your way up the tower more layers are added, including useful shortcuts, platforming, weapon upgrades, acid floors, double jumps, and more cool shit I don’t want to spoil here.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="430bf5c0b12707cf4efec5dc020e8f52" data-recommend-id="image://430bf5c0b12707cf4efec5dc020e8f52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows someone buying upgrades in Mullet Madjack.

No, it eases you in and lets you get a grip on the controls, and the flow of combat, before it adds a bit more. And then more. And then more.<br></p><p>After a few hours of <em>Mullet Madjack</em> your gameplay will look like an impossible mess to people who haven’t played it. But it never feels like that while you’re sliding around or kicking robots into vending machines. That’s thanks to the vibrant and easy-to-read design of the world and its enemies.<br></p><h2 id="h8222"><a id=""></a>Fast and funny</h2><p>Even at 100mph, I always felt in control and knew what was happening, which isn’t a brag on my part. It’s a compliment to the developer who was able to create something that plays so fast and looks so wild, but never feels confusing or messy.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2fd56afc5c969006fc187fd9f4e606b2" data-recommend-id="image://2fd56afc5c969006fc187fd9f4e606b2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows someone shooting an uzi in Mullet Madjack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows someone shooting an uzi in Mullet Madjack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hammer95 Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2fd56afc5c969006fc187fd9f4e606b2" data-recommend-id="image://2fd56afc5c969006fc187fd9f4e606b2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows someone shooting an uzi in Mullet Madjack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s also an incredibly funny game, too. <em>Mullet Madjack</em>’s future is one where giant corporations sell you things as silly (and worthless) as a pack of action movie one-liners to spout off during combat. Your main character is constantly shouting anti-capitalist chants at the start of each level, some of which make sense, and others that feel like maybe this mullet-sporting gun-nut isn’t all there.<br></p><p><em>Madjack </em>also includes nods to old video games and late ‘80s entertainment, including turn-based RPGs and Tamagotchis. There’s truly something for everyone.<br></p><p>In 2024, billionaires and AI have become some of our biggest enemies. So it’s nice to have <em>Mullet Madjack</em>, a game that lets me mow down a bunch of rich-robot assholes using assault rifles and shotguns. It’s even better that the game is one of 2024’s best, thanks to its solid world-building, awesome visuals, and incredibly fast action. The future might suck, but at least it’ll be fun! </p><p><em>Mullet Madjack </em>launches on Steam on May 15. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-reveals-the-finals-isn%E2%80%99t-performing-as-well-as-expected.870411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nexon-the-finals-not-performing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In December, Embark Studios shadowdropped The Finals, a high-octane, destructive first-person shooter with some hero elements worked in. It pulled in a substantial audience overnight, reaching a peak player count of a quarter of a million users on Steam alone. This free-to-play shooter was regarded as a ‘major franchise pillar’ for Nexon, the game’s publisher and great expectations rose following a successful launch window.</p>



<p>However, in the most recent financial update from Nexon, it was confirmed numerous times that The Finals isn’t hitting expected targets and that work is underway to find out why that is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-hitting-the-mark">Not Hitting The Mark</h2>



<p>In the financial letter published recently by Nexon, it was revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The launch of Season 2 in March created a short-lived increase in player metrics but delivered lower-than-expected retention and revenue. The Embark team is working with our Korea-based Live Operations team to understand and address the key issues.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/RLCz/ukdB/n3z8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nexon admitted</a> that the solid results of other titles in its portfolio were ‘partially offset’ by The Finals’ shortfall. Ultimately, The Final’s failure to deliver on expectations meant that the publisher reported lower revenue than it was originally targeting, despite reporting growth in MapleStory and rampant success from DAVE THE DIVER.</p>



<p>It wasn’t all bad, though. Nexon’s report confirmed that The Finals pushed consolidated MAUs up on a year-over-year basis. The free-to-play nature of the game was always bound to attract a vast audience, and even the teething issues caused by rampant cheating weren’t enough to keep away a core following.</p>



<p>That’s not the end of the story, though. Nexon expects growth for The Finals, particularly with the game’s third season dropping in June.</p>

<p>On May 16, Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut will be released on PC, bringing this incredible samurai-themed title to an entirely new market. It’s the complete package, featuring the base game, the Iki Island expansion, and the game’s cooperative multiplayer mode, Legends – which has been the source of a little controversy in recent days.</p>



<p>Valve has just published an article on the Steam site detailing everything you need to know about the launch of Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-tsushima">Back to Tsushima</h2>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima was released on PlayStation 4 in 2020 and ported to PlayStation 5 shortly after. It was a remarkably well-received game, boasting an immersive, emotional story, beautiful visuals, and a massive, open world that was bursting at the seams with opportunities to explore every corner of it. Now, almost four years after the game was released, it’s being made available on PC.</p>



<p>There’s one point of contention, though. To play Legends on Ghost of Tsushima on PC, you’ll need to make or link a PSN account, which is the exact controversy that caused a nightmare of a response from the Helldivers 2 community in the last week or so. It instantly makes a portion of the game unavailable in every country where the PlayStation Network doesn’t operate, which is enough of a sticking point, even if you get the game’s single-player mode to trawl through without any such restrictions.</p>



<p>That’s enough about that, though. Here’s when you can expect to start playing Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut:</p>



<ul>
<li>PDT: May 16, 8 AM</li>



<li>EDT: May 16, 11 AM</li>



<li>BST: May 16, 4 PM</li>



<li>CEST: May 16, 5 PM</li>



<li>JST: May 17, 12 AM</li>



<li>BRT: May 16, 12 PM</li>



<li>AEST: May 17, 1 AM</li>
</ul>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut is available for pre-load now.</p>



<p>It was also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215430/view/4188987871078331985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed by Valve</a> that Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut can be enjoyed on the Steam Deck – as well as ‘similar handheld gaming PCs’. However, it’s marked as ‘unsupported’ on the Steam Deck owing to the PSN integration requirement for Legends.</p>

                <p>The pandemic "meme stock" run is the stuff of history books and Hollywood movies these days, and now one of the figures central to that phenomenon has made a grand return. Keith Gill, better known by his online handle Roaring Kitty, posted a meme of a player sitting forward in his chair on X/Twitter, which usually indicates that the poster is going to take the match seriously--and it appears to have had a tangible effect on GameSpot's stock price.</p><p dir="ltr">In the day since that announcement, Roaring Kitty has posted a large number of videos to X, mostly depicting hype-up sequences from popular movies and TV shows, such as Troy, Peaky Blinders, and Marvel movies. According to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/meme-roaring-kitty-gamestop-amc-stocks-401916acd3715d35cc0220143b26b2ac" rel="nofollow ">AP</a>, Gill's return appears to have triggered a large run on GameStop stock, which surged more than 74% on Monday. As of this writing, the stock price has settled around $50, almost three times its pre-Roaring Kitty return price of around $17. The run also caused sale of the stock to be temporarily halted multiple times on Monday.</p><p dir="ltr">Gill is the main character of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-meme-stock-movie-dumb-money-out-now-on-digital/1100-6519129/">Dumb Money</a>, a Hollywood film that highly dramatizes the story of the GameStop short squeeze. Though the film received positive reviews from critics, it was not a box-office success, earning roughly $20.7 million against a reported $30 million budget from its theatrical run. The ballooning value of GameStop and other stocks in January 2021 had outsized effects on the financial industry, with trading platforms like Robinhood being hit with class-action lawsuits after the broker prevented its clients from making GME purchases. A US House committee even held a congressional hearing on the phenomenon.</p>

And that has allowed me to swing back and forth and do very divergent things. It’s made my career very fulfilling for me, because I get to stretch and change. I don’t ever feel like I’m in a box, because I get to express myself in such different ways. It’s rare! It’s a rare thing to be able to do that, so I’m quite grateful that my career started that way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Much like an interactive video game story, you and I are now presented with two paths – the path of the mature antihero with a lot of action combat, and the path of the fun… shall I say family-friendly (laughs) kind of protagonist! So let’s explore this half of Winifred Phillips. The journey with LittleBigPlanet and Sackboy and SimAnimals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Let’s start with LittleBigPlanet, because that’s been a big part of your life as a game composer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That’s so true, yeah.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: And again, those are also big games that require multiple composers, but – you know – Winifred Phillips keeps popping up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I’ve really been happy to be a part of the LittleBigPlanet franchise. I’ve been with the team since the LittleBigPlanet 2 game, and I’ve worked on lots of the different iterations of the game –&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/sWCr_l-r1GM?si=sIxV2Odwa6-TcCrL">LittleBigPlanet 2</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Xa2WPVhUd8s?si=Dm4Oo_X4vFUyOufg">LittleBigPlanet 3</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/hGp8L767-ro?si=ssidQ-GSnI6GZ6Fz">LittleBigPlanet Cross Controller</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Tjof378y_Dg?si=2brhFAEClH3XbhEX">LittleBigPlanet Toy Story</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TmAMsVwVm4">LittleBigPlanet Karting</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/eja8eaq3Z0U?si=1faFUBMUMQ-w6tTf">LittleBigPlanet PS Vita</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and now&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/6E41RxN5oS8?si=Og0UZ1GwWN5bj23f">Sackboy A Big Adventure</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. So it’s been amazing! One of the things that’s really neat about working with the LittleBigPlanet games, and now the Sackboy games, is that we’re encouraged as composers to be eclectic and strange, and try new things. It’s all about mash-ups – about throwing together ideas and instruments that you wouldn’t normally hear within the same track, within the same genre. Just challenging expectations. In the world of Sackboy (for people who aren’t familiar with the game) – you’re playing as this little knitted doll-like character with very loose arms and legs who runs around these environments that look like they might be craft projects. They’re full of buttons, and cardboard, and little stickers, and cut-out clouds, and everything seems like a pop-up book where things fold out. It’s got that feeling to it. It’s enormously whimsical. So the idea of it being crafty is woven into the core of what LittleBigPlanet is.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sackboy lives in Craftworld, so everything is powered by the imagination. That philosophy of Play Create Share (which is at the core of the LittleBigPlanet franchise, and now the Sackboy games) – that also informs the creation of the music. Because the music has to have this idea of throwing together disparate elements. Letting loose your creative juices. Doing things that you wouldn’t have expected would come out of yourself. That’s been tremendously exciting for me. I love how supportive the team at the LittleBigPlanet franchise are of those of us who are creating music for it. Really being urged to stretch and try new things and create new art for their games. I think that’s part of why the games are so enchanting for players. I think everybody really feels that spirit of creative play. It informs every part of these games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That’s a really beautiful opportunity to always be challenged to do the unorthodox. What has been the funniest, strangest, weirdest, most outlandish experiment anyone has ever asked you to pull off? Or you have asked yourself to pull off?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Oh, I think that would have to be Victoria’s Lab from LittleBigPlanet 2. It was one of the first tracks I was asked to create for the LittleBigPlanet franchise. The level stars Victoria, and she is sort of a manic inventor! At least, this is how she was initially conceived by the development team. She’s very creative, as the whole franchise is, but she’s also dangerous, and she’s creating all these robots, and she’s super unpredictable! So the music was supposed to have that flavor to it – essentially finding the danger of Victoria as an unpredictable manic character. That was fun for me!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So I started looking into things that I could do, and I was combining rock guitar with silly vocals and beatboxing and calliope and all kinds of wild instrumentation – pop bottles, and found-sound, and sound design. Just a sense of everything that you could imagine thrown at it! Trying to make that feel really unexpected and surprising. Plus it is very much a vocal driven track. There’s sort of an operatic lead vocal that essentially personifies Victoria herself, and then there’s an almost Andrew Sisters type vocal group behind her that’s keeping an energy going with all of this syllabic singing that’s happening. A lot of elements went into it! It’s almost chaotic, but you have to structure it so that it feels satisfying, so that you can follow the line. And of course, Victoria’s voice really creates a central point of focus. So that was immense fun to create.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwzx9l3tgko" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Then, I submitted it to the team, and it was implemented into the game. As a composer, you don’t have as direct an experience participating in that process. I get a chance to see early concept art and video of the game in action, but I don’t get to see the final product while it’s being implemented. But then later, I was contacted by the audio director of the project, who let me know that they had revised the level a bit – specifically to accommodate the music that I had submitted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That’s amazing!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Incredibly rare! It’s an incredibly rare thing to happen, which I was dumbfounded by. Because when I finally saw the level, not only was she a manic inventor with lots of maniacal robots rolling around, but she’s also now a baker! And we have cookies and cakes and cherries and icing dripping from walls, and roses! It was a garden, there were all sorts of roses everywhere! I think they had keyed in on the whimsy that had been woven with the danger. They’d represented both elements that were in the music, represented them visually in the gameplay – and it was amazing to me!</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCL2J5ttX_4" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I never felt quite as centrally a part of the development process as I felt for that one, because the music essentially had a chance to participate in the game design – without me knowing that was what was going to happen. But it did! And it was just so fulfilling! So that’s a really deeply meaningful memory for me.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That is beautiful! That may be one of my favorite stories! Whenever I hear a composer say that the development team actually changed their level, or changed their game, in response to the music, that to me really speaks volumes about the power of music in video games! Even before it reaches the gamers! That’s just fabulous! I love hearing that! It’s amazing!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: It was really amazing for me. It is a rare thing to happen. And understandably so! Game development is a very complex process. It involves a lot of people. They can be big teams! And it’s a complicated mechanism that’s being created. It has to respond to player actions, so it’s very complex in terms of its internal construction. The idea of a composer being thrown into that mix and influencing the structure of the design is a rare thing, and it’s really special for me that that happened there. So I have very warm feeling about that particular game, and the LittleBigPlanet and Sackboy folks as a whole. They’re magnificent people!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: And in that complex machinery of game development, you decided at some point to help break it down for other people hoping to write video game music, with a book aptly titled&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://a.co/jhK0uR6">A Composer’s Guide to Game Music</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">! What drove that decision for you? To say, “hey you know what? I need to put this out there!”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah. I think part of it was – there wasn’t a book in existence at that time that was pointed towards composers, with a focus just on that discipline. There were books that existed, that would help out someone who was trying to break into the industry, who was a musician or composer… but they tended to focus on the entire discipline of game audio. And a lot of the discussion focused on the art and technology associated with sound design, and audio design. That end of things. Which of course is useful for a composer to know – but it doesn’t really address the questions that we have about what we want to achieve as game composers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: When you’re playing a game, there are two things you’re essentially hearing. I’ll break it down a little further. Three things you’re essentially hearing. You’re hearing the atmosphere of the environment you’re existing in. Say you’re wandering an outdoor location. You might be hearing the wind, and the birds, and any incidental sounds that might be happening there. And then there’s a second layer of sounds – sounds that you’re making, both in your movement, and by interacting with the environment. So they’re more incidental sounds that are being triggered by you – by your agency as a player. And that’s all essentially sound design. There’s a professional on the game development team who is responsible for that, so they’re creating all sorts of audio recordings that can be worked into the structure of the game and can be triggered by your actions, or by where you are in the game. So that essentially weaves an aural universe around you. And then there’s the third element – that’s the music. That music typically tends to be what’s called&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/non-diegetic">non-diegetic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It doesn’t exist in the fiction, so you don’t think the music you’re hearing is coming from something in the environment, unless there’s some overt radio sitting there, and the music is supposed to be coming out of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Like the old Tomb Raider!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Right, absolutely, yeah! That’s a good example of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/diegetic">diegetic music</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in action! But most of the time, it’s non-diegetic. It’s music that’s kind of like a film score or television score. It’s weaving an emotional tapestry for you. It’s giving you a sense of emotional momentum. Maybe it’s helping you out, in terms of what’s important that you need to pursue. It’s telling the story with a musical language, so that you can remain emotionally involved even though a game is typically a longer experience than a film or a tv show – which tends to be a single sitting type affair. Whereas a video game can be tens or hundreds of hours. And music really plays a very important role in keeping a player emotionally invested, and helping them to hang onto the thread of narrative when they are in the game for that long a period of time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So it’s an entirely different discipline. It has its own technical challenges, in terms of getting the music to feel like it’s flowing with your own experience as a player, so that it’s essentially telling your story. So that is a challenge for game composers, and we try all sorts of different techniques and technologies to make that happen. But when I was first coming up as a young game composer, most of the books were focusing on the first two kinds of audio you’d experience: the incidental sounds and the environmental sounds. That’s mostly what these books were about. They might talk about music, but not a lot! I mean, it didn’t feel like the heart of the book was there, it was just kind of an ancillary part of the overall thing. And I kind of yearned for something that was going to guide me, and it didn’t really exist at the time. Around that time, I started thinking maybe I’m the person to write that book, because it didn’t exist then. This was actually right before I was hired for the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu4TNER1Zgw">Assassin’s Creed Liberation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> project. I had started working on the book, and I had an agreement with the MIT Press to turn in a draft of that book, and then I was hired for Assassin’s Creed Liberation. Which was actually unexpected! And so I set the book aside to work on that project, which was massive and amazing! And working with Ubisoft was just world-changing for me!</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfpfhztOBVI" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Then I went back and completely rewrote the book, because of course there was a lot that I had learned from that, and a lot that I wanted to share!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah! (Laughs) I can imagine!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah! When I started thinking I wanted to write the book, that’s why I called it a Composer’s Guide to Game Music, because it really was important for me to stress that this book was pointed towards composers. At least at the time in which I was writing it, there weren’t any books that were pointed specifically towards composers. I think that now as time has gone on, there are more books out there, and there are more that are pointed towards composers, and thinking about our discipline, and the kinds of questions that we ask as we’re trying to do our work. But at the time, there really wasn’t anything very specific, so that’s why I wrote it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>We’ve reached the end of part two of my interview with the Game Show’s Meena Shamaly.&nbsp; I’ll be continuing this transcript in part three, so watch this space!&nbsp; And if you’re enjoying this interview transcript, please tune in to Meena’s series, airing every friday on ABC Classic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/live/classic">and online via the ABC Classic web site!</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
