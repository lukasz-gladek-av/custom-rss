In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/zAyDQducoGatn4IydphOy/dcdb9b3c9f3ce53112b358890acd1196/PR_Company_statement_07102024.pdf">a statement on Monday</a>, Ubisoft said it “regularly reviews all its strategic options in the interest of its stakeholders and will inform the market if and when appropriate.”</p><p>One of the options Ubisoft is considering is taking the company private, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. Tencent, which currently has about a 10 percent stake in Ubisoft, also owns <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/tencent-now-owns-499-per-cent-of-guillemot-bros/">49.9 percent of Guillemot&nbsp;Brothers Ltd</a>.

                <p>Developer 4J Studios has shared the first gameplay trailer of Reforj, an open-world sandbox being developed by the Minecraft co-developer. The people in charge of porting Minecraft to consoles, as well as content packs are now working on their own iteration of the genre, presenting a voxel-crafted world to build, explore, and survive within.</p><p>The gameplay might seem familiar at first glance if you're a Minecraft fan, but there are some subtleties that are already teasing some different novelties. The character has the ability to glide, both outside and inside dungeons, making for a more fast-paced way of traversal. There are first and third-person cameras for gliding, too.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DQVVG7DoTM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9DQVVG7DoTM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The usual resource-gathering actions present some novelty, too. The gameplay showcases being able to manipulate objects and their shapes at a distance while building. You can pick up items quite quickly by destroying an entire tree just by destroying one block near the root, as well as taking down three blocks simultaneously in one go. Crucially, there aren't any specific tools on display while doing these tasks.</p><p>4J Studios formally announced Reforj back in <a href="https://x.com/4JStudios/status/1833899148644659443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">September</a> for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. The engine powering the game, called Elements Engine, was first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wa7rTm56bw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> back on May 22. According to an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-minecraft-studio-and-minecraft-youtuber-looking-to-transform-sandbox-gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, the team has around 50 employees, and not all of them are working on the game yet. Among them is Joseph Garrett, known as a Minecraft YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/stampylonghead" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stampy</a>.</p><p>While Reforj is still in its early days, 4J Studios is adamant on clarifying that the intention isn't to make Minecraft 2. "Everyone has to have a frame of reference," 4J founder and chairman Chris van der Kuyl told GI.Biz. "But it will be a very different gameplay experience, That doesn't mean they will still play the games they play and love every day. They will. That's something we revel in. We still have a marketplace in Minecraft. This is just something brand new for people who love the genre, and we don't think they've had anything new for quite a long time."</p>

			<p>Detroit: Become Human was a game created by Quantic Dream that took the world by storm. This game was released in 2018 and covered some political topics under the guise of a robot vs. humanity-type storyline, which seemed to be a very thinly veiled allegory for real-life issues. Over the years, Quantic Dream has made some very well-known games, such as Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. However, this is most likely the most popular game they've made, boasting beautiful graphics and a star-studded cast. Today, Guillaume de Fondumiere, the CEO of Quantic Dream, <a href="https://x.com/GdeFondaumiere/status/1843335782947532811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1843335782947532811%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on X</a> that Detroit: Become Human has officially hit 10 million units sold on PlayStation <a href="https://wccftech.com/detroit-become-human-sold-over-3-2-million-on-ps4-will-soon-launch-on-pc/">and PC</a>.</p>
<p>Detroit: Become Human was a huge hit for Quantic Dream, with the game originally releasing as a PlayStation exclusive before the game was ported over to PC in 2019, providing the title with even more success.</p>
<p>The game is available via PlayStation 4 and PC, with the ability to play it via PlayStation 5 due to backward compatibility with the disc as well as being able to purchase it from the PlayStation Store. Some are hoping that with the success of Detroit: Become Human, the game will receive a PS5 Pro update, which could do wonders to make the graphics even better. They were never bad to begin with, but they could give the game a whole new level of polish with the use of the new technology on the upcoming PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>With Detroit: Become Human being so popular and overall having an open-ended conclusion, players are hoping that this will lead to a sequel. There are plenty of ways the story can go depending on who lived and who died in your playthrough, with the game having plenty of replayability and opportunities to do 'good' and 'evil' endings. It's possible that there would be some form of a sequel to this game, but considering how much it relies on the choices you make throughout the title. Although it's predominantly open-ended, it seems that it would be unlikely that a sequel could be made, especially if you are someone who kills off all of the main cast. Much like Alien: Isolation receiving an announcement today about a sequel, it's possible that Detroit: Become Human will get one in the future. No one can say for certain right now, though.</p>
<p>Currently, Quantic Dream are working on Star Wars Eclipse, but there are no new details about this title, what platforms it will be on or any form of development details.</p>

But while most dungeons and boss fights are a breeze as long as you've been keeping your collection of Echoes up to date, there's one ultra-challenging roadblock that more and more players are reporting is stumping them. No, it's not a super-hard enemy...it's a horse race.</p><p>Over the last week, player after player has posted on the Echoes of Wisdom and Zelda subreddits complaining about the game's horse races, and specifically the "short race" in particular. The short race, which Zelda can enter once she passes a point in the game where she gets her own horse (as opposed to a rental) is supposed to be simple. Ride the horse around a circular track exactly one time, and do it in under 17 seconds. Basic stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But for some reason, this particular horse race is a nightmare to do in that amount of time. The track is littered with crates (which Zelda's horse can jump) and trees (which it cannot jump) to trip you up, making it hard to gain and maintain speed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fxjds1/this_minigame_is_the_bane_of_my_existence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post</a> after <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fx6z3a/there_is_always_this_one_mini_game_in_a_zelda_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> has appeared with players finishing the race in just over 17 seconds or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fwptdq/u_gotta_be_kidding_me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even 17 exactly</a>...but needing under 17 to win. Even players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1foatlp/help_with_a_certain_mini_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who have passed the other horse races with flying colors</a> are struggling with the short race.</p><p>Fortunately, some players are finding creative solutions. One player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fxqor5/another_trick_for_the_short_race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a clip</a> of Zelda using Echoes of lava rocks to build little staircases allowing the horse to jump over the tree obstacles, meaning they could get past them without swerving and losing speed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fxo2so/for_those_struggling_hope_this_helps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another popular tactic</a> was even simpler: just use Tri to move the trees out of the way as you ride past, avoiding them entirely. That method in particular is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1fxxl9p/eow_i_was_about_ready_to_shove_her_carrot_in_an/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saving other players already</a>:</p><p>If you need more tips to beat the horse races yourself, we've got a <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/Horse_Race_Guide:_How_to_Win,_Tips,_and_Rewards">guide to all horse races in Echoes of Wisdom right here</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Treyarch's Black Ops campaigns are known for having storylines that stray from reality and get a bit weird, and the latest marketing trailer shows <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will likely continue the tradition this year.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Black Ops 6 trailer showcases in-game footage and cinematics from the upcoming campaign. The action featured looks very much like the expected over-the-top Call of Duty experience, but you can blink and almost miss one of the most interesting moments revealed.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Global Launch Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The trailer includes a brief POV of a character falling from the sky, who watches broken bits of land and flying palm trees circle above them. The scene looks like some kind of impossible storm, and it's quite possibly part of some twisty, mind-bending moment of the story.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, we know that the narrative takes place years after the events of Black Ops Cold War, with the Black Ops 6 campaign set in the 1990s during the Gulf War. The trailer footage also showcases political leaders like Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and Saddam Hussein, and it includes familiar Call of Duty faces with Frank Woods and Russell Adler both present. More details about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/">Black Ops 6 campaign can be found here</a>, which also includes multiplayer and Zombies announcements.</p><p dir="ltr">Marketing for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is ramping up as the game launches worldwide on October 25 across Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. A leak from <a href="https://x.com/ForwardLeaksAlt/status/1842888780354666883" rel="nofollow ">ForwardLeaks</a> also suggests that Call of Duty is teaming up with Little Caesars for an upcoming promotion that offers pizza-themed Black Ops 6 rewards, including an operator skin, calling card, and XP tokens.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision hasn't confirmed this potential promotion yet, but <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1843329258359492713" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Treyarch did confirm</a> that a "wealth of information" regarding Black Ops 6 will arrive in these upcoming weeks leading to the game's launch.</p>

		<p>A Commandos: Origins demo has been released today on PC and Xbox Series X|S, Kalypso Media has announced, ahead of the game’s release later this year. The demo itself has its own exclusive mission, which will not be in the main release of Commandos: Origins. Instead, this mission has been designed to give a taste of what to expect in the full release of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Commandos: Origins | Gameplay Trailer (US)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HImqjeqCANo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You can grab the Commandos: Origins from the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/3137720/#:~:text=About%20This%20Demo.%20Cadets,%20%E2%80%9COperation%20Prelude%E2%80%9C%20has%20begun!%20In%20this">Commandos: Origins – Demo on Steam (steampowered.com)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/commandos-origins-demo/9nq8p31k009d">Get Commandos: Origins – Demo | Xbox</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Commandos: Origins demo has players play as the Green Beret and Marine, with the mission being to take out a German radar station on the Channel Islands. The full release of Commandos: Origins will feature six characters to play as, who will be The Sniper, The Driver, The Sapper, The Spy, along with the aforementioned Green Beret and Marine. Missions will give players multiple options to carry them out and complete the objectives, so exploring the environments will be the key to success. This will allow players to plan different approaches and have a plan B in place should plan A fail. The full release will also have 10 missions set against the backdrop of World War II, which will see players go to various theatres of war including Africa and the Arctic. There is also going to be two player co-op, both local and online, so people can tackle missions together.</p>

<p>Set before the original games in the series, Commandos: Origins plainly promises to tell the origin stories of the Commandos and how they were united for their very first missions. Original studio Pyro is long gone, but current IP owner Kalypso Media previously commissioned Raylight Games for the HD remasters. For this new entry in the game – which is effectively a series reboot – they’ve partnered with Claymore Game Studios to develop. The game will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. It will also be on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>

As an added bonus, Eagle builds have the potential to be the most powerful the Spiritborn has to offer.</p><p>If you want to deal lots of fast damage, Jaguar skills are what you need, and the Centipede is for Spiritborn who want to debilitate their enemies with poisons and movement-impairing slowdowns (my personal favorite and one of the more powerful builds).</p><p>Click Next to get comprehensive breakdowns of each animal, and what it offers you in <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ecc8ce6cfe26bb8cb2669971797e3e1f" data-recommend-id="image://ecc8ce6cfe26bb8cb2669971797e3e1f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Jaguar" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Jaguar" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ecc8ce6cfe26bb8cb2669971797e3e1f" data-recommend-id="image://ecc8ce6cfe26bb8cb2669971797e3e1f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Jaguar" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Jaguar skills are the ones you want to choose if you like attacking non-stop, dealing lots of burst damage quickly. This build is best suited to those who want a straightforward combat experience.</p><h3 id="h3192"><a id=""></a><strong>Spiritborn - Jaguar Skills</strong></h3><p><strong>Thrash</strong> is the main basic skill for Jaguar Spiritborn. It lunges towards your enemy and lashes out. Every third use will hit surrounding enemies as well. It generates Vigor (the resource for Spiritborn), as well, meaning this is your go-to when you have no Vigor to spend on more powerful abilities.</p><p><strong>Rake</strong> is your main Vigor spender, doing a swiping attack that deals damage twice to nearby enemies in front of you.</p><p><strong>Ravager</strong> increases your minimum Ferocity (an offensive buff) by three passively, and each time Ravager is used, it adds an extra attack to each Skill you use for the next six seconds. Use it before you spend your Vigor!</p><p><strong>Counterattack</strong> adds an extra 15 percent dodge chance to you passively, and automatically counter-attacks every time you dodge a direct attack (but not area attacks like fire or poison on the ground, etc.). When you use the ability, you’ll dodge every attack for three seconds. It also stacks twice, so you can use them back-to-back for six seconds of dodging, or spread out their use if you prefer.</p><p><strong>Rushing Claw</strong> is a great move for managing groups of enemies. Use it to lunge forward a set distance, striking every enemy along your path twice.</p><p>The Ultimate Skill for Jaguar is <strong>The Hunter</strong>. Use this ability to spring forward and do a ground-slam attack, then lash out at all surrounding enemies with seven additional attacks. If you kill an enemy, there is a 40 percent chance the cooldown will be reset, letting you use it again (although the likelihood the cooldown will be reset will be cut in half each time it is triggered successively).</p><h3 id="h3193"><a id=""></a><strong>Spiritborn - Jaguar Spirit Hall Passives</strong></h3><p>The first passive adds the ‘Jaguar’ label to every Skill, and every fifteenth time you deal damage with Jaguar skills, it’ll add an additional attack to it, equal to 15 percent of the damage you have dealt in the last 0.5 seconds. With how fast the damage can be dealt in Jaguar, this can be a nice bonus.</p><p>The second passive increases maximum Ferocity by 1, and grants you one stack of it when you kill an enemy or damage a boss.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3da5186412c47d8523dd09e33a24e9f6" data-recommend-id="image://3da5186412c47d8523dd09e33a24e9f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Eagle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Eagle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3da5186412c47d8523dd09e33a24e9f6" data-recommend-id="image://3da5186412c47d8523dd09e33a24e9f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Eagle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h3194"><a id=""></a><strong>Spiritborn - Eagle Skills</strong></h3><p><strong>Thunderspike</strong> is your basic ability, rushing forward to deal damage and resetting the cooldown on your Evade (dodge roll) skill during every third strike.</p><p><strong>Quill Volley</strong> is your main Vigor spender, throwing sharpened quills through enemies and dealing damage to each.</p><p><strong>Vortex</strong> is your crowd-control (CC) ability, drawing enemies close to you before hitting them with damage. This isn’t necessary with the most fast-moving Eagle builds, but if you want to hit groups with Quill Volley or Razor Wings, it’s nice to have a way to group them up.</p><p><strong>Razor Wings</strong> throws out a spinning disc of feathers, acting like a boomerang to return to you. You can enhance it with the Invasive Razor Wings skill to cause it to circle around you instead, hitting surrounding enemies instead of ones in a line (and I recommend doing so).<br></p><p><strong>The Seeker</strong> is the Eagle Ultimate. Summon the spirit to swoop down and deal damage both when it arrives and when it departs.</p><h3 id="h3195"><a id=""></a><strong>Spiritborn - Eagle Spirit Hall Passives</strong></h3><p>The first passive turns all skills into Eagle skills too, and gives you the same movement speed bonus you gain from Storm Feathers every time you use an Eagle skill. Evading also throws Storm Feathers at enemies around you with this passive.</p><p>The second passive increases your Critical Strike Chance by four percent for every four meters you move, resetting two seconds after you make a Critical Strike attack. With how mobile Eagle Spiritborn are, you’ll be critting a lot.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f35caf05b55c818cf8e4b4a312d2a9f0" data-recommend-id="image://f35caf05b55c818cf8e4b4a312d2a9f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gorilla." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gorilla." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f35caf05b55c818cf8e4b4a312d2a9f0" data-recommend-id="image://f35caf05b55c818cf8e4b4a312d2a9f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gorilla." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h3196"><a id=""></a><strong>Spiritborn - Gorilla Skills</strong></h3><p><strong>Rock Splitter</strong> rushes at your target, dealing damage and increasing your Block chance as you add a point into the enhancement.</p><p><strong>Crushing Hand</strong> is a skill that is useful across builds. I found it very useful in my <strong>Centipede</strong> build too, because while it slams down with two damaging shockwaves by default, enhancing it can cause any enemy caught by both shockwaves to be knocked to the ground. If you are having trouble surviving or keeping your enemies in one place, and your main Vigor spender doesn’t add something essential to your build, consider switching to Crushing Hand.</p><p><strong>Armored Hide</strong> passively gives you increased damage reduction, with two stacks of the ‘Resolve’ buff (which reduces the damage you take when you Block) every few seconds. When you activate the ability, you become Unstoppable and gain 100 percent Block chance for several seconds. Since Unstoppable keeps you from being stopped, slowed, or otherwise impaired, and it <em>removes</em> those effects, this is a great way to bust out of annoying enemy abilities.</p><p><strong>Concussive Stomp</strong> performs a shockwave that damages enemies and knocks them down for several seconds, and enhancing it can add a Barrier to your health, helping add to your survivability. Additionally, you can grab a second enhancement that deals six times the damage to enemies that are Unstoppable (and to Bosses), meaning it can stay useful in every situation.</p><p><strong>Payback</strong> is a big smash attack that has a 15 second cooldown, but every time enemies hit you, there is a chance to reduce the cooldown remaining. Use this every time it’s available, and consider taking the enhancement where Payback grants you passive Vigor every time you take damage. The other side of that enhancement? It spends all your Vigor when you use Payback, dealing extra damage based on how much Vigor you spent. A nice all-out attack to have.</p><p><strong>The Protector</strong> Ultimate skill slams the area for six seconds when used, dealing damage and generating a protective barrier around you. Great to use when you need to stay alive for <em>just</em> a few more moments to get the kill on a boss or Elite group.</p><h3 id="h3197"><a id=""></a><strong>Spiritborn - Gorilla Spirit Hall Passives</strong></h3><p>The first Gorilla Passive adds the Gorilla tag to every Skill, and every time you use a Gorilla Skill, it will deal 100 percent of your current Thorns (damage enemies take when they hit you) to enemies and give you a Barrier to increase your survivability.</p><p>The second passive increases your maximum Resolve by two, and when you have at least five stacks of Resolve, you’ll also gain Unstoppable.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="008454105f766efe9ee76b56cacc7e9c" data-recommend-id="image://008454105f766efe9ee76b56cacc7e9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Centipede." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Centipede." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="008454105f766efe9ee76b56cacc7e9c" data-recommend-id="image://008454105f766efe9ee76b56cacc7e9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Centipede." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The build I primarily focused on, Centipede is all about poisoning and weakening your enemies, and calling upon the mighty power of the Centipede spirit to execute your poisoned foes. Unlike Jaguar, Centipede is all about damage-over-time. It’s slower to kill than Jaguar, but it’s consistent and synergistic with healing, weakening enemies, and probably the second strongest endgame build right now.<br></p><h3 id="h3198"><a id=""></a><strong>Spiritborn - Centipede Skills</strong></h3><p><strong>Withering Fist</strong> is the basic Centipede ability, but when choosing enhancers, you can go with <strong>Accelerated Withering Fist</strong> if you are having trouble staying alive (it reduces the damage dealt by poisoned enemies) or <strong>Sharp Withering Fist</strong> if you want to maximize damage you deal against groups of enemies.</p><p><strong>Stinger</strong> is what you’ll use to spend your Vigor. Choose <strong>Rampant Stinger</strong> if you want to improve your single target damage (a good idea if you struggle against bosses and elites) and <strong>Advantageous Stinger</strong> if you want to add some Vulnerable debuffs and healing into your play.</p><p><strong>Toxic Skin</strong> gives you a trail of poison behind you, and it adds to your Thorns damage. If you picked Advantageous Stinger, pick <strong>Measured Toxic Skin</strong> to generate Critical Hits every second to foes made Vulnerable by that Stinger enhancement.</p><p><strong>Scourge</strong> is a great way to help keep yourself alive by CC’ing enemies. Feared and slowed, you can pick them off as they flee. Choose <strong>Reinforcing Scourge</strong> to get more Vigor back when you use it, but you can opt for <strong>Adaptable Scourge</strong> if you are having trouble staying alive, as it gives you a chance to be healed for a portion of the damage it deals.</p><p><strong>Touch Of Death</strong> is a strike that unleashes a swarm of insects that cause damage over time. If you kill the afflicted enemy, the swarm will seek out a new host to damage. <strong>Invasive Touch Of Death</strong> adds a pulse of damage to the attack, dealing poison damage to surrounding enemies every second. <strong>Poised Touch Of Death</strong>, however, removes the cooldown on the ability, changing it to cost 70 Vigor per cast. I recommend this option, but you’ll need to generate more Vigor (Reinforcing Scourge is a great way to do this).</p><p><strong>The Devourer</strong> is the lynchpin of the whole Centipede build. Summoning a massive centipede spirit, it will instantly execute any enemy who has had poison build through their entire health bar. It also spreads poison on the ground and shoots poison beams, making it great to call when Elites or Bosses are about. Every rank you add into the ability reduces the cooldown, letting you get it down to nearly 30 seconds at rank 5.</p><h3 id="h3199"><a id=""></a><strong>Spiritborn - Centipede Spirit Hall Passives</strong></h3><p>Your Spirit Hall will be best served by selecting Centipede as well. If you choose the first passive for Centipede, it turns every skill into a Centipede skill, and reduces and slows every enemy hit by Centipede skills (which is now EVERY skill), stacking up to eight times.</p><p>If you are having trouble staying alive, and are running largely Centipede Skills, you can also opt to choose Gorilla’s first passive.</p><p>The second selection in the Spirit Hall will add passive healing. Heal one percent of your Maximum Life for every nearby enemy you Poisoned in the last three seconds (up to five percent).</p><hr><p>Spiritborn are powerful, no matter which way you slice it. They have some of the most satisfying and useful gameplay loops in the game, with tons of viable ways to play them. Regardless of which build you decide to use, I’m sure you’ll have a good time.<br></p><p>As someone who loved the Witch Doctor class in <em>Diablo III</em>, having a similar ‘spirit-based’ class which focuses on close-range combat instead of spell-casting is a heck of a lot of fun.</p><p>Go with the spirits, friend, and put an end to Mephisto’s ambitions. Happy hunting!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is available today for owners of Ultimate Edition and Deluxe Edition. If you want to get into the PvP multiplayer aspect of the game, then you might want to brush up on the game’s combat mechanics. Fortunately, Insider Gaming has you covered, as this Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Attack Guide will provide all the information you need to pound your opponents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, there are four primary ways to attack opponents: Rush Chain Attacks, Lift Strike/ Grand Slash, Speed Move Combos and Follow-ups. These four ways can be further broken down into various approaches; here’s everything you need to know.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-different-ways-to-attack-in-dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Different Ways to Attack in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</h2>



<h3 id="h-rush-chain-actions">Rush Chain Actions</h3>



<p>To attack with a Rush Chain Combo Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, players must press Square/X (up to four times max) with Triangle/Y. Players will deal damage according to the length of their combos. Rush Chain Actions also have Smash Attacks and Power Smashes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smash Attacks and Power Smashes can blow your opponent away; the latter is much stronger than the former. To perform a Smash Attack, hold down Square/X and release. Release after fully charged to execute a Power Smash. Power Smashes can be followed up with Dragon-Homing and Vanishing Attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-lift-strike-grand-slash-nbsp">Lift Strike/Grand Slash&nbsp;</h3>



<p>These two attacks can send your opponents upwards or downwards in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. A Lift Strike is performed using Square/X, D-Pad Up, and Triangle/Y, blowing the enemy away. Grand Slash is performed with Square/X, D-Pad Down and Triangle/Y, sending your enemy towards the ground.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-speed-move-combos">Speed Move Combos</h3>



<p>There are three different types of Speed Move Combos players can use in the game: Vanishing Assault, Step-in Rush and Burst Meteor. Vanishing Assault can be used by pressing X/A + Square/X near the enemy at close and medium distances. Players can perform the Step-in Rush using the following combination: X/A, Square/X, Square/X, Square/X. Lastly, a Burst Meteor can be performed by pressing Triangle/Y + Square/X after a Z-Burst Dash.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-follow-ups">Follow-Ups</h3>



<p>Most Attacks and Dragon Ball Sparking Zero can be continued using Follow Ups. There are 6 Follow-Ups that players can perform in the game: Dragon Dash Attack, Dragon Homing, Vanishing Attack, Lighting Attack, Throw and Ground Throw.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To perform a Dragon Dash Attack in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, press Square/X during a Dragon Dash. Dragon Homing is an excellent move to chase the enemy after being blown away. Press X/A + Square/X along with X/A to perform Dragon Homing. Players can use the Vanishing Attack as a follow-up to Vanishing Assault by pressing Triangle/Y after the latter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the Lighting Attack, players need to press O/B when a follow-up is possible to send the enemy towards the ground. Throws are also an excellent way to create distance between you and the opponent. Players must press R1/RB + Square/X while battling to perform a standard throw. Using the same input when the enemy is downed will cause a Ground Throw. Interestingly, many characters have a unique grab attack in the game. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Months ago, 13-year-old Willis "Blue Scuti" Gibson <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/someone-has-finally-beaten-nes-tetris/">became the first person to "beat" NES <em>Tetris</em></a>, crashing the game after a 1,511-line, 157-level performance. Over the weekend, 16-year-old Michael "dogplayingtetris" Artiaga became the first to reach an even more impressive plateau in the game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhbti5SneE%22">looping past Level 255</a> and instantly rolling the game all the way back to the ultra-slow Level 0.</p>
<p>It took Artiaga a bit over 80 minutes and a full 3,300 cleared lines to finally achieve the game's first near-mythical "rebirth" <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2268738212">live in front of hundreds of Twitch viewers</a>. And after a bit of celebration and recovery on the low levels, Artiaga managed to keep his rolled-over game going for another 40 minutes, finally topping out after a total of 4,216 lines and a record 29.4 million points.</p>

      Artiaga's record-setting game starts a few minutes in, while the "rebirth" rollover happens at 1:21:24.

<p>Artiaga's record does come with a small asterisk since he used a version of the game that was modified to avoid the crashes that stopped Blue Scuti's historic run. Still, NES <em>Tetris</em>' first-ever level rollover is a monumental achievement and a testament to just how far competitive classic <em>Tetris</em> has come in a short time.</p>
<h2>The glitch mountain</h2>
<p>For decades, NES <em>Tetris</em> players considered it practically impossible to pass Level 29, a point where pieces start dropping so quickly that it's nearly impossible to get them to the side of the well by simply holding down left or right on the controller. In the last few years, though, the development of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WLoLhOdkjI">hypertapping</a> and then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/ngdhyh/wr_nes_tetris_first_ever_level_40_by_cheez/">rolling</a> grips has allowed pro-level NES <em>Tetris</em> players to get faster piece movement by tapping the directional inputs up to 30 times per second. With perfect execution of the rolling technique, it was at least theoretically possible to keep a game of NES <em>Tetris</em> going indefinitely, even at Level 29 speeds.</p>
<p>NES <em>Tetris</em> was never designed for play past Level 29, though, which means unintended glitches start to get in the way of any truly endless <em>Tetris</em> sessions. At Level 138, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Lp2yA2wYKI&amp;t=0s">a memory overflow error</a> causes the <em>Tetris</em> pieces to show up in some increasingly funky colors, including palettes that are incredibly hard to make out at Levels 146 and 148.</p>

      A tool-assisted speedrun from May proves that the rebirth rollover is possible on an unmodified copy of NES <em>Tetris</em>.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Then, starting at Level 155, an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpEcjdr_YDo">inefficiency in the game's score-calculation algorithm</a> means most line clears have at least some chance of crashing the game. While it's theoretically possible to dodge those crash-inducing situations with careful play, it's functionally impossible for a human to keep track of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zAQIo_mnkk0c9e4-hpeDvVxrl9r_HvLSx8V4h4ttmrs/edit?pli=1#gid=0">all the complex variables and probabilities</a> that determine whether a crash can happen past that point in the game. Using a modified, crash-resistant version of the game, as Artiaga did, seems likely to be the only way for a human to achieve a rebirth rollover without <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOfsnBQ5i0">the kind of tool assistance seen here</a>.</p>

<p>Even with a modified game, though, Artiaga faced another massive mountain of a glitch before he could achieve rebirth: Level 235. While the <em>Tetris</em> Level counter usually cycles every 10 lines, <a href="https://cohost.org/rgmechex/post/5264863-rgme-article-33-81">vagaries of the game's binary-coded decimal line counter</a> cause the level count to get stuck on 235 for a <em>whopping 810 lines</em>. To make matters worse, the Level 235 glitched color palette is a dull green that is hard to see against the game's black background, making the level a true test of endurance.</p>

<p>Artiaga, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2ZYVsm_mTU">became the second person to ever reach Level 235 back in May</a>, also became the first person to clear Level 235 during his rebirth run after spending 20 grueling minutes of near-perfect play staring at those dim, puke-green pieces. "Oh my god, I've seen the light," Artiaga exclaimed after passing through the Level 235 gauntlet. "The amount of everything... whenever you're on Level 235 for 800 gosh darn [lines], I can not put into words how draining that is, in every single facet of the game," he added after the level counter had finally rolled over.</p>
<h2>“I never want to play this game again, bro”</h2>
<p>Artiaga—who started playing high-level <em>Tetris</em> competitively at the age of 10 in 2019—has won the Classic Tetris World Championship two times, in addition to setting multiple records in the game and dominating many smaller tournaments. Despite all that, he said during his stream that "this is the best thing I've ever done in <em>Tetris</em>, bro."</p>

          
                  </div>

        <div>
          
          
<p>The moment when the game's level counter finally rolled over led to some significant hyperventilating and repeated screams of "Oh my god!" from Artiaga, who jumped out of his seat and put his hands to his head at the enormity of the moment. "There's no way, there's actually no way," he said in disbelief at one point. "It's actually over."</p>

            </figure>

<p>As the game continued to run at extremely slow, lower-level speeds, Artiaga took some time to briefly collapse on his bed and rehydrate (while occasionally nudging falling blocks to beneficial positions). He also took time to scan his Twitch chat and thank the waves of subscriptions and donations that came flooding in after his achievement. Artiaga even broke out his phone for some performative social media scrolling during the "too slow" Level 7.</p>
<p>By the time the game reached Level 19 speed once again, though, Artiaga was back to focus mode, rolling his way to about 20 more minutes of top-level play. By the time his roughly two-hour performance ended—with Level 91 on screen but 347 levels in the rearview mirror— Artiaga was absolutely spent.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, I'm so glad that game is over, bro," Artiaga said on stream. "I never want to play this game again, bro... I was starting to lose my mind."</p>
<p>Now that the <em>Tetris</em> rebirth has been proven humanly possible (with crash-avoidance mods, at least), the community will no doubt move on to see who, if anyone, can complete a double rebirth in a single uninterrupted <em>Tetris</em> session. The prospect of continual rebirth even opens up the possibility of the kind of multi-day marathon play that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/man-vs-snake-a-thrilling-documentary-about-a-boring-game/">characterized some other classic arcade games</a>. One thing's for sure: The classic <em>Tetris</em> scene has certainly come a long way since the days of the Level 29 "kill screen."</p>

			<p>Today, HypeTrain Digital and Ice-Pick Lodge announced Pathologic 3, a new installment in the peculiar series that began with 2005's indie cult and continued with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathologic-2-driving-you-to-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019's reboot</a>. Pathologic 3 will be launched next year on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>).</p>
<p>In the new game, players will again find themselves in a small, remote town struck by a mysterious and deadly disease. This time, however, they will take on the role of The Bachelor, a town doctor known for his relentless battle against death. Invited to the town by the late Isidor Burakh, The Bachelor must navigate the unfolding mystery, striving not only to save the town but to defeat death itself.</p>
<p>For the first time in the series, Pathologic 3 introduces a new time travel mechanic that allows players to revisit key events and alter them to their advantage. While the player still has only 12 days to save the city, this innovative mechanic allows them to explore and influence events in ways that reshape the unfolding narrative.</p>

<p>Game Director Nikolay Dybowski said:</p>
<p><em>We are making a game about how a person develops their mind to learn how to work with things they previously couldn't or didn't know how to notice. Our goal is to understand what this means for the player. Right now, the most pressing issue for me seems to be rethinking our habitual understanding of how our mind works—how to use it without getting into trouble or losing ourselves. That’s why I want to create gameplay that touches on this theme. The Bachelor sees himself as a man of intellect.</em></p>
<p><em>We can describe the concept of this time travel mechanic as surrealist time management. Our goal is to give the player a sense that time is more complex than we typically perceive it—as a linear path. We want to show the player the possibility of existing in a world that is disassembled and functions in a way quite different from what we’re used to expecting.</em></p>

<p>Pathologic 3 will also let players immerse themselves in the role of a physician. They will get to diagnose and treat patients based on examinations, use a microscope and research pathogens to develop treatments and save patients, and even fight the rampant epidemic by implementing quarantines and deploying patrols to lock down the spread of disease.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher HypeTrain Digital have announced&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, a third installment in the relentlessly miserable and fascinating&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>series. It's targeting a 2025 release.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, <i>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</i>offers only one playable character: the Bachelor, a doctor "famous for his fight against death himself". As the Bachelor, you'll explore another disease-ridden town, uncovering its secrets and battling the plague that has the town in its grip.</p>
<p><em>Pathologic 3</em>'s unique twist on the formula that made its predecessors so unique is a time-loop mechanic with which you can "revisit key events and alter them to [your] advantage". You'll still have just twelve days to save the town, but this new time-loop system should make things a bit less punishing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathologic-3-announced-plague-doctor.jpg?itok=S-t4RPcs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathologic-3-announced-plague-doctor.jpg?itok=dUZWT99D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>brings more relentlessly bleak fun next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Ice-Pick Lodge and HypeTrain are promising the same "chilling, immersive world that made&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>a cult hit", now with more "layers of narrative complexity".</p>
<p>As a doctor, you'll be able to diagnose and treat your patients using medical procedures; you'll need to examine patients, use your microscope to identify pathogens, and develop treatments to help patients overcome their illnesses.</p>
<p>You can also battle the plague by "implementing quarantines and deploying patrols", so it sounds like you've got more power than just treating individual patients.</p>
<p>Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>game, you can expect your every choice to impact the story in a meaningful way, and you can also expect to meet a host of characters that you absolutely cannot and should not trust as far as you can throw them.</p>

<p>It seems like&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>grew out of the seeds of an intended update for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced">would have introduced a new Bachelor scenario</a> to that game. Now, however, it appears that Ice-Pick Lodge has spun that route out into an entirely new&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2025.

            <p>Found a dead rat in my inbox this morning. When I examined the entrails it spelled out the following: PaThoLoGiC 3 aNnOuNcEd ToDaY.  Ah, I see. Developers Ice Pick Lodge are working on a sequel to their infamously oppressive plague town simulator, only this time the follow-up will feature "a time-travel mechanic, allowing players to go back and see how their decisions change the lives of the townspeople." It will also put you in the fancy-schmancy shoes of the Bachelor, a doctor fond of quoting Latin phrases, who will have the ability to order quarantines and request patrols of entire areas of town. There's no firm release date yet, but we're told it'll be ready some time next year.</p>

<p>As the Bachelor the player will be more of an academy physician than the previous protagonist, using a microscope and various lab equipment to "research pathogens". Judging from screenshots and the game's description, there's also some sort of management shenanigans going on too. "Fight the epidemic by implementing quarantines and deploying patrols to lock down the spread of disease," say the game's creators.</p>
<p>The "time travel", meanwhile, looks like the Rashomon sort, as opposed to anything mystical or mad sciencey. "No, remember how things <em>really</em> happened..." That kinda thing. The player still only has 12 days to make their mark on the town, say the devs, but the ability to go back and alter some decisions will let you "explore and influence events in ways that reshape the unfolding narrative". </p><p>To clear up any confusion: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a>, despite the number in its name, is not a direct sequel to the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a>, but an extensive remake. In the original Pathologic, players could play as one of three characters - the Bachelor, the Changeling, or the Haruspex. For Pathologic 2 the developers chose to make the Haruspex the default player character at launch, with plans to add the other two characters in later updates. It looks like those plans have changed, and the devs are straight-up slapping another number onto the series. Does this mean players will also need to buy Pathologic 4 some day to see the Changeling's version of events? Who knows.</p>
<p>I wasn't too enamoured with Pathologic 2 when I wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-2-review">our review</a> of the initial release, finding a fascinating world bogged down with an overzealous hunger meter and other survival meters. But later updates allowed players to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-2s-easy-mode-lets-you-soak-in-the-dread-of-an-unwell-town">tweak difficulty settings</a>, which improved things for my run massively. I eventually enjoyed much of the game, like this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-2-train-summoning">wonderfully creepy moment on a derelict train track</a>. </p>
<p>Many Pathologic fans did not seem to care about the harshness of the world at all, though. Noted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNEQs68acww">congressional necksnapper</a> of the Left, "Hbomberguy", made a good argument for the game's merit despite (thanks to?) its bleakness in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsNm2YLrk30">characteristically chunky video essay</a>, never mind that he personally called me out in it, THE BIG POO POO HEAD. Will this third sequel become an extension of our beef? I hope not. I have enough blood in my inbox as it is.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Why yes, that <em>was</em> a micro change in air density you just noticed on your motion tracker. Ten years since the release of horror adaptation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien Isolation</a>, Creative Assembly have announced that they're making a sequel.</p><!--more-->
<p>"On the 10th anniversary, it seems only fitting to let you know that we have heard your distress calls loud and clear," reads a post from Al Hope, the original game's creative director, on <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488">Xitter</a>. "Today, I'm delighted to confirm, on behalf of the team, that a sequel to Alien: Isolation is in early development. We look forward to sharing more details with you when we're ready."</p>
<p>There's nothing more to say, so you'll have to fill the void with your inaudible screaming. Here's a little recap of the 2014 monstrosity to help with that: Alien Isolation casts you as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen, who is stuck on a huge space station with a single, unpleasantly adaptable and essentially unkillable Alien. The whole game is about that relationship, give or take a few bullying androids - as you master various means of distraction and deterrence, the Alien "learns" about you, growing more aggressive and tenacious. The space station itself is a beautiful homage to the film's aesthetics - dare I call it Nostromantic? - though it's perhaps a little larger than it needed to be. At 20-30 hours in length, Isolation does come perilously close to wearing out its welcome.</p>
<p>It's one of my favourite horror games regardless. I remember visiting Creative Assembly's offices in 2011 or so, after they announced an Alien universe collaboration but before they revealed or said anything about Isolation. After asking some highly fishy, leading questions about recent hires and their vision for the franchise, I threw my hands up in exasperation and proceeded to complain for about five minutes that video games take too much inspiration from Aliens and its Colonial Marines, when all I want to do is be trapped in a big, Gothic labyrinth with a persistent nemesis and no actual gunplay at all.</p><p>I was absolutely beside myself when the developers in the roundtable all simultaneously adopted the same expression of glassy-eyed smugness. "We think you will like our game," one of them ventured. I hurried on home and proceeded to eat my hands for three years, until the formal reveal. Today, I begin to eat my hands anew.</p>
<p>Here is our original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-review-pc">Alien Isolation Wot I Think</a>, written by Adam Smith (RPS in peace), who of course is now Duke of Words at Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian. An extract:</p>
<blockquote><p>Isolation is the best Alien game I've ever played, I'm in no doubt about that. Even in its awkward moments it is doing something interesting with the license, exploring the edges of what is possible in its world, quietly and discreetly. I expect the debate about certain design choices to be loud and long. At the centre of the debate will be one of the finest entries in the Alien canon in any medium, and one of the finest horror experiences in ours. </p></blockquote>
<p>The prospect of an Isolation sequel aside, it's nice to see Creative Assembly getting work that isn't Total War. The developers have had a rough year or two, with Sega <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-cancel-hyenas-and-several-unannounced-games-due-to-covid-era-losses">cancelling their first-person shooter Hyenas</a> amid layoffs, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-devs-creative-assembly-to-refocus-on-offline-rts-games-after-ditching-online-shooter-hyenas">shoving their noses ever deeper into the strategy game genre</a>. At the risk of being a negative Nancy here, I'd say the new Alien game has a lot to prove within Sega, and 10 years is a long time - how many of the old Isolation team are still there?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each is filled with mesmerizing characters, tantalizing romances and mysteries, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435">lots of tough choices</a></span> to make. There’s a metric ton of exciting third-person shooter encounters, which often challenge players to make the best of their character classes as well as those of their allies, and strategically deploy the right weapons and skills to survive to see another day. if that’s the kind of thing you look to RPGs for, this seminal series from the mid-to-late aughts delivers in spades.</p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-andromeda-best-worst-citadel-dlc-ending-1849502801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-andromeda-best-worst-citadel-dlc-ending-1849502801"><em>Mass Effect </em>games</a></span> take place in a future where humanity has discovered the means to travel over incredibly long distances across space via these left-behind devices known as mass relays. These mass relays help humanity establish contact with several species of aliens, and they all <em>mostly</em> come together to form a unified society. However, various threats begin to crop up at the time that the first game begins, which set in motion a sweeping adventure across the stars and back to save the galaxy from an ancient and advanced civilization that’s been dormant for a long time.</p><p>You play as Commander Shepard, a decorated war hero and eventual black ops Spectre agent, who finds himself (or herself) caught in the middle of all of this strife and bearing the weight of every living thing on his shoulders. It’s a lot for him to do on his own though, and so across the entire trilogy of games, Shepard comes to rely on many allies, friends, some rivals, and even a handful of lovers or partners. This<em> </em>focus on interpersonal relationships is perhaps the single most enduring aspect of <em>Mass Effect</em>.</p><p>Given that focus, it’s hugely important that <em>Mass Effect </em>has one of the most memorable casts in video games. Over the course of three games, many recurring characters enjoy rather full narrative arcs, which is uncommon these days. Urdnot Wrex and Garrus are two examples of characters that recur throughout every installment, enjoying a bevy of character development in each title against a backdrop of large and complex narratives concerning their shared histories and those of their people. Many of the cast, like Garrus, Thane, Tali, Liara, Miranda, and more, have become objects of romantic and sexual fascination for many players, and the romances and sex scenes that have sprung from the series have imprinted themselves on the impressionable minds of many players since 2007.</p><p>Besides the deep characters and relationships that <em>Mass Effect </em>has traditionally offered players, it’s also just one of gaming’s few real epic sagas. Even if I don’t rate the games quite as highly as many others do, it’s hard to deny the impressively high standard that the series set, as well as the difficulty that many developers, Bioware included, have had in matching it ever since.</p><p><em>Mass Effect Legendary Edition </em>doesn’t just compile all three of those classic RPGs together, it also serves as a remaster. All three games received some visual reworks, though the earliest game receives the biggest facelift of the bunch due to its age. The collection also features most of the single-player DLC that was released for the games, including the widely beloved <em>Shadow Broker </em>and <em>Citadel </em>expansions for <em>Mass Effect 2 </em>and <em>3</em>, respectively. Additionally, there are quality-of-life changes that bring the first and second games into alignment with the final installment, including a rework to <em>Mass Effect</em>’s Mako vehicle handling.</p><p>In short, you’re getting pretty definitive versions of one of gaming’s biggest stories for a measly 10 bucks. Think of the dumb little things you spend 10 bucks on during an average day. Skip the little treat just once and snag <em>Mass Effect Legendary Edition </em>for cheap while you still can. Considering there’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417">sequel coming…eventually</a></span>, I promise it’ll pay for itself down the line. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero goes into early access today, and if you are looking to get into some battles online, here are some tips and tricks to help you out. Bandai Namco’s latest instalment has brought many changes to how you traverse across the massive arenas. Check out the Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Movement guide to learn everything you need to know about this system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, the player’s movement is critical for them to win, whether it is going on the offensive or the defensive. The different ways you can move across the game’s stages include Step/Short Dash, Dragon Dash, Z-Burst Dash, Quick Ascend and Descent.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-different-types-of-movement-in-dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Different Types of Movement in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</h2>



<h3 id="h-step-short-dash">Step/Short Dash</h3>



<p>Step is the new movement mechanic in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, allowing you to move around the stage more quickly. Players Step by pressing the X/A button, which can be used to move closer to the opponent, create distance, or evade blast attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-dragon-dash">Dragon Dash</h3>



<p>Dragon Dash is a high-speed dash in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero that allows players to cover a lot of distance quickly, whether away from the opponent or closer to them. Press the R2/RT trigger and the X/A button to perform a Dragon Dash. Dragon Dashes will use Ki to activate and can be used for Rush Combos or Smash Attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-z-burst-dash-nbsp">Z-Burst Dash&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This movement mechanic makes your dash even faster, allowing players to get behind their opponent during a Dragon Dash. Z-Burst Dash can be performed using the following combination: R2/RT + X/A + X/A. This move will use up your Ki faster than Dragon Dash, but at the same time, it will be harder to guard it.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-quick-ascend-and-descent">Quick Ascend and Descent</h3>



<p>The last movement mechanic in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero can be used to take the battle airborne or bring it back to the ground. A Quick Ascend can be performed by pressing the R2/RT trigger while pressing L1/LB; the Descend, on the other hand, uses the same trigger, R2/RT, but needs you to push the other trigger as well, L2/LT. Both moves will emit Ki Aura and consume the player’s Ki Gauge.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>In <em>Pathologic 3</em>, players once again find themselves in a small, remote town gripped by a mysterious and deadly disease. This time, however, they will step into the shoes of The Bachelor, a city doctor renowned for his relentless fight against death. Invited to the town by the now-deceased Isidor Burakh, The Bachelor must navigate the unraveling mystery, striving not only to save the town but also to conquer death itself.</p><p>For the first time in the <em>Pathologic</em> series, <em>Pathologic 3</em> introduces a new time-travel mechanic that allows players to revisit key events and alter them to their advantage. While the player still has only 12 days to save the town, this innovative mechanic grants them the freedom to explore and influence events in ways that reshape the unfolding narrative.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Step Into the Role of The Bachelor</strong> – A city doctor famous for his fight against death itself, tasked with unraveling a web of dark secrets while battling a relentless plague.</li><li><strong>Doctor, Do No Harm</strong> – Immerse yourself in the role of a physician. Diagnose and treat patients based on examinations. Use a microscope and research pathogens to develop treatments and save your patients. Fight the epidemic by implementing quarantines and deploying patrols to lock down the spread of disease.</li><li><strong>Master Time Travel</strong> – Manipulate time to change events and unlock new outcomes.</li><li><strong>A Dark, Surreal World</strong> – Explore a decaying town on the brink of collapse, where every choice carries weight, and trust is a luxury you can’t afford.</li><li><strong>Haunting Atmosphere</strong>&nbsp;– <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the chilling, immersive world that made <em>Pathologic</em> a cult hit, enhanced with new layers of narrative complexity and eerie, unsettling visuals.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Right now, the most pressing issue for me seems to be rethinking our habitual understanding of how our mind works—how to use it without getting into trouble or losing ourselves,” Dybowski said. “That’s why I want to create gameplay that touches on this theme. The Bachelor sees himself as a man of intellect.”</p><p>Dybowski also discussed the new time-travel mechanic.</p><p>“We can describe the concept of this mechanic as surrealist time <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>,” Dybowski said. “Our goal is to give the player a sense that time is more complex than we typically perceive it—as a linear path.

            <p>

If you've been impatiently awaiting the arrival of Commandos: Origins since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/commandos-origins-revives-the-real-time-stealth-tactics-classic-next-year">announcement last year</a>, here's the next best thing; Claymore Game Studios' revival of the classic WW2 real-time stealth-tactics series now has a PC and Xbox demo ahead of its release later this year.
</p>
<p>
The Commandos series, if your history is a little hazy, first surfaced in 1998 with the release of developer Pyro Studios' classic (and rock-hard) Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines. Since then, there've been five additional instalments, the series eventually fizzling out with the launch of 2006's first-person effort, Commandos: Strike Force.
</p>
<p>
Commandos: Origins, though, takes the series back to its roots, delivering a stealthy World War 2 prequel adventure in which players guide the original six-strong team of commandos through the likes of sabotage and assassination missions as they travel from European coastlines to icy Arctic plains and African deserts - all presented using the series' classic isometric perspective, albeit now rendered in full 3D.

<p>
Commandos: Origins' newly released demo (available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3137720/Commandos_Origins__Demo/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/p/commandos-origins-demo-win/9mtnk7lvk8pc">Windows PC</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/commandos-origins-demo/9nq8p31k009d">Xbox Series X/S</a>) isn't taken directly from the upcoming game, instead being what publisher Kalypso Media is calling an "demo-exclusive test mission". Here, players control squad members Jack O'Hara (Green Beret) and James Blackwood (The Marine) as they attempt to sabotage a German radar system, "against the backdrop of the Channel Islands during World War 2".
</p><p>
The full game will include "more than 10" missions featuring both core and optional objectives - each completable in multiple different ways - with two-player local and online co-op support available for anyone wanting to get stuck in with a friend.
</p>
<p>
Commandos: Origins still doesn't have a release date beyond "2024", but it'll be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Microsoft Store) when it does show up. And if you need to sate your thirst for real-time stealth tactics before then, you could always try your hand at this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sumerian-six-a-pulpy-nazi-bashing-stealth-tactics-treat">pulpy alternate-history WW2 adventure Sumerian Six</a>, or 2023's piratical delight <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-old-school-stealth-gets-a-rip-roaring-pirate-upgrade">Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</a>.
