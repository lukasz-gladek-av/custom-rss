            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-episode-7-review-1851587136<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For those of you who’ve felt like any sense of real meaning was gone from the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise since it was acquired by Disney, you’re in for a real treat. <em>The Acolyte</em> episode 7 offers a kind of emotional intelligence and narrative pacing that I would normally associate more with that other decades-spanning sci-fi franchise, <em>Star Trek</em>. That’s a very good thing, as it yields a sense of realism and intimacy that raises the bar for this series.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194664,194499" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Episode 7,&nbsp;“Choice,” is the flashback episode we’ve been awaiting since the series began, promising the big reveal of the inciting incident that has caused years of remorse and spun the web of revenge all characters are connected to. We open on the planet Brendok with Jedi Masters Sol (Lee Jung-jae), Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo), and Padawan apprentice Torbin (Dean-Charles Chapman). Immediately, we can feel each Jedi’s sense of self with a beautiful wide shot given to us by episode director Kogonada and cinematographer James Friend. The Jedi are in search of a “Vergence”—a powerful centralization of the Force that can create life, such as the lush forests of Brendok. </p><p>This tone of exploration echoes <em>Star Trek</em> in every beat, and affords us a more intimate character portrait for each Jedi. We even get to see them eat together, and without the pressure of any “star war,” we get to see them as people striving for ideals of self mastery and cultivation of wisdom for the benefit of the galaxy. We often hear about these principles when it comes to Jedi, but we don’t often get to feel them without some external pressure distracting us. I absolutely loved this tone, and hope an entire series about the Jedi can be built around it. We don’t always need fighting and chasing to feel something as audience members.</p><p>The search for the Vergence leads Sol to discover the mystical child twins, Mae and Osha (played by real life twin actors Lauren and Leah Brady). Sol sees that Mae has markings of dark magic on her body, while Osha does not, leading him to believe that she may be in danger of being sacrificed by their witch coven, given that a celestial event is about to happen. Sol, who lacks a Jedi apprentice, is bent on making sure the children are safe, and he feels a special connection to Osha, who bears no mystic markings. This desire in the supposedly desire-less Jedi leads to an intentionally muddy web of events that don’t reveal many story points that we haven’t seen in previous episodes. The meaning in this episode has very little to do with what’s happening on the outside and far more to do with what’s happening within each character. It’s this exploration of interiority and character that makes it enjoyable.</p><figure id="" data-id="3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-recommend-id="image://3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo) in The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo) in The Acolyte." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-recommend-id="image://3bee737079c5e164d43cc807be66c110" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo) in The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On the other hand, the episode also suffers from the same Wookiee bias as the original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, missing an opportunity to share Kelnacca’s journey. Whether it’s a member of an alien race or a human being from a marginalized group, writers have to be cautious with underrepresenting characters that are killed off (see the old movie stereotype of the “Black guy dies”) or who get their minds controlled by an outside force, both of which happen to Kelnacca as of this episode. There was an anime trope of deeply exploring characters who would be promptly killed off, and as a kid, I always felt the difference in how much more I wanted to know about the characters that died in those stories. Consistently failing to develop characters in a given race is a writing flaw that leads to—for lack of a better term—the dehumanization of that race, even if they’re alien. And since stories educate us on how to view our reality, this can contribute to a lack of consideration and negative treatment of others. So you see, I can’t stop my campaign for Wookiee equal rights.<br></p><p>Amidst all the conflict in this episode, the most overtly significant moment we see is Sol killing Mae &amp; Osha’s mother, Aniseya (Jodie Turner-Smith). Even here, the filmmaking doesn’t emphasize the action. Rather, we are focused on the emotion of Sol’s reactionary fear that led him to draw his lightsaber on her amongst the air of confusion and defensiveness from both the coven and the Jedi. Sol’s remorse is instant, and we feel it in how he allows himself to be hit repeatedly by Aniseya’s partner, Mother Koril (Margarita Levieva). These moments convey one of the greatest gifts we’ve ever received from the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise—the gift of misunderstanding.</p><p>Misunderstanding is hard to write. But&nbsp;<em>The Acolyte</em> has taken its time to articulate all of the players, the cultures, the differences in perspective, and demonstrates how they can all clash. We understand why they aren’t aligned with each other on a very human level. From my training in martial arts and meditation, I know that a sense of peace can be found in conflict. Now, all I’m left seeking is a sense of purpose and completion to the chaos. Let’s hope the finale in episode 8 delivers.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apex-legends-leaks-possibly-tease-new-%E2%80%98district%E2%80%99-map.924882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-leaks-possibly-tease-new-district-map/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HYPERMYSTx/status/1811415902480699859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X, longtime reliable leaker HYPERMYST teased images of a potential new map for Apex Legends called “District,” also courtesy of leaker Osvaldatore.</p>



<p>The images showcase a circular, neon area full of amusement rides and similar attractions along a coastline. HYPERMYST claims the images reveal “every major POI” from the leaked map. </p>



<p>They also say District is “expected to be released in Season 22.” There are over a dozen detailed images for fans to break down.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Initial fan responses are fairly positive for the “District” map, and new content is always welcome in the game. However, it’s unclear if District will help smooth over interest in Apex Legends, should the map ultimately release in Season 22. </p>



<p>EA faced a lot of fan backlash after announcing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-overhauls-battle-passes-abandons-in-game-ac-currency-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive changes</a> to the Battle Pass system for Season 22. That includes breaking the Battle Pass into two separate purchases, one for each seasonal split. </p>



<p>It will also remove the Apex Coins pricing option, so fans can only buy Battle Passes with real-world currency.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-new-season-new-legend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current season</a> saw the return of Solos, and also introduced the new legend Alter. There was also a recent Double Take Collection Event.</p>



<p>At this time, EA did not officially confirm anything about the District map, nor its potential release window for Season 22.</p>

            <p>"It's going to be a good, good, good, good day," sings Frontier's announcement trailer for just-announced theme park simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>. Not for me it isn't, because now I have to compare my shabby flat, in which there are exactly zero waterslides at the time of publication, with Planet Coaster 2, in which you can expect such aquatic attractions as "meandering lazy rivers", "adrenaline-pumping wave pools", "looping flumes" and "exhilarating water coasters". Please watch the trailer while I yet again revisit the possibility of sneaking into Stoke-On-Trent's Waterworld and trying to pass myself off as the resident ghost.</p><!--more-->

<p>Planet Coaster 2 is due for release in fall 2024, falling being what happens to your chirpy Pixar-plastic guests if you get a bit too excited when plotting out the ole' loop-de-loops. It'll be available on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/planet-coaster-2-983fe9">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/">Steam</a>, and yes, vertiginous watery delights are the major addition, but we can also expect new land-based themepark rides, new park themes such as Viking ("rustic", apparently?) and new flavours of scenery. They're also promising expanded park management tools, multiplayer park-building, and the ability to create "exciting animatronics shows using the new event sequencer tool".</p>
<p>The original Planet Coaster came out in 2016, and was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/planet-coaster-review">hailed</a> by Fraser Brown (RPS in PCGamer) as "a game that inspired me to spend an entire hour constructing a toilet". It features on our lists of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-non-violent-video-games">best non-violent video games</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">best management games</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">best building games</a>. The sequel has big boots to fill, but it's gotten off to a fine start by saturating my eyes and brain with sultry imagery of coruscating plastic tubes of H2O. We'll try to get you one of those "preview" things as soon as we can.</p>

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">Microsoft's big changes to Xbox Game Pass</a>.
</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass for console is gone, unless you subscribe already. In its place: Xbox Game Pass Standard, which will no longer include new day one games from Microsoft, Activision, Blizzard and Bethesda. Oh, and everything's going up in price.</p>
<p>Do these changes mark the end of Game Pass being a must-have subscription for Xbox owners? Or, after an impressive summer presentation painting a rosy picture of Microsoft's 2025 slate, are you now more likely to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, where day one launches will remain. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy to discuss.</p>

			<p>A new PC Starfield mod has been released, which addresses various in-game issues with Bethesda's Creation Engine 2.</p>
<p>Created by odder 'LarannKiar', the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/10457?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield Engine Fixes mod</a> includes various fixes for Starfield's game engine that Bethesda hasn't addressed yet. Mentioned fixes include a fix for player facial expression animation being lost after fast traveling, an NPC headtracking and makeup fix, several fixes for the Papyrus creation engine scripts, fixes for photo mode model facial expressions, player scale, and a fix for an issue that causes the player's spacesuit helmet flashlight to turn off if the player equips/un-equips something while the spacesuit is "hidden" (equipped, but not rendered) in third-person mode.</p>
<p>Being a Bethesda game, issues like these are common, but it's still good to learn that this mod aims to address at least some of the engine issues within Starfield. Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bethesda finally released</a> the long-awaited Creation Kit for the game. The kit allows players to create their own mods for Starfield and share them with the community. The creation kit is the same tool that Bethesda used to create Starfield, &nbsp;and allows for the creation of new quests, environments, characters, dialogue, weapons, and more.</p>
<p>In order to use this mod, users will need the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/106">Starfield Script Extender</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3256"><span>Address Library for SFSE Plugins</span></a>.

Confirming Concord launches in both physical and digital standard editions for $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99, Pam Piscitello, director of marketing and operations at developer Firewalk, said in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/concord-is-now-available-to-pre-order-early-access-and-beta-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> that this full experience includes all 16 playable characters (called Freegunners in-game), 12 maps set on various worlds, and six team-based modes. This will expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates for all players at no additional cost, Piscitello added.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spelling-game-cryptmaster-feels-like-the-opposite-of-homework.924813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/cryptmaster-pc-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.akuparagames.com/game/cryptmaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cryptmaster</em></a> came out back in May, when Chris Person told me it was pretty good, but for various reasons I only got to it over the holiday. It is indeed pretty good! It’s a dungeon-crawling typing game with a strong personality and a ton of unique things to do. Sometimes that can feel like too many things, but luckily, all those things are <em>really</em> fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You control a team of four undead heroes, each with their own archetype: warrior, thief, bard, and sea witch. Guided by the titular Cryptmaster, a floating head who makes a delightful narrator, you travel through different underground towns and their surrounding swamps and caves to try to make your way to the surface, where the Cryptmaster wants to unleash the undead hordes on the world. Along the way, you help out other characters, solve a lot of word puzzles, and fight a lot of guys.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Cryptmaster | Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmWRQLbPmsY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The combat is typing-based: your characters have cards with letters next to their names, and as you fill those letters in (we’ll get to how you do that in a second) you spell words that unlock powers. Joro, the warrior, has moves like “hit” and “boot” that damage or kick enemies away. Nix, as a sea witch, can unleash damage-dealing rains of crabs, fish, and other aquatic life. Characters can also boost each other’s damage, reset each other’s cooldowns, or heal each other. Most combat words cost “souls” to use, meaning if you’re not careful, you can end up only able to use the basic free attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll be honest that combat got a bit out of hand for me. There’s a lot of words to use, and many of them aren’t ones that come readily to mind in a fight (see: “fjord”). I tended to default to the same handful of words, which saw me through most early fights with ease but started to falter in the late game, when I found myself taking too much damage or running out of souls. There’s a lot of things you can do in a fight if you prioritize unlocking as many words as possible, but at the same time, combat can fall into a repetitive trading of blows. It gets mixed up somewhat: Some enemies have armor that can only be broken with a specific word, or can’t be damaged by certain letters, or can <em>only</em> be damaged by certain letters. But these additions never fully rescued combat from sometimes feeling like a grind.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Akupara Games</figcaption></figure><p>Some fights can be avoided by detouring around enemies, which you’ll want to do anyway to unlock new moves, as well as your characters’ memories. You do this through finding letters in a variety of word-based activities you encounter around the map. One of the main ways is finding chests; inside the chests are objects the Cryptmaster has forgotten the name of. You discover what they are through a version of 20 Questions in which you ask the Cryptmaster to do things like “recall,” feel,” “taste,” and “describe.” You then guess the object, and if you guess right, you’ll get the letters in its name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, you find skulls around the world that ask you riddles, which can also give you letters if you solve them. I found these activities way more fun than the combat; they’re clever and playful, occasionally tough, and a real love of language shines through them.&nbsp;</p><p>This love of language is what most stands out to me in <em>Cryptmaster</em>. It’s not a game where you have to <a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-a-dark-souls-typing-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoid typos</a> or write as fast as possible, or where typing is simply a stand-in for a regular button press. Everywhere in the game there are fun things to do with words: a character whom you help write a song, the Cryptmaster’s wry commentary, a spelling-based card game called “Whatever” that you play against other characters. You save your game at altars by defiling them, typing any sort of naughty word you want. Your souls are replenished by typing the names of fantasy bugs and fish. You open doors by guessing their codes. The penultimate level requires some brain-twisting word games to progress. The game’s black-and-white world might be a bit sparse, but all this spelling and guessing and wordplay makes it feel full.</p><figure><figcaption>Akupara Games</figcaption></figure><p>That fullness doesn’t always work in the game’s favor. I sometimes felt like there was <em>too </em>much to do; I barely explored the potion-making mechanic, or the items for sale at various merchants. The need for souls meant I was often tediously hunting for bugs and fish, and the memories and lore fragments you unlock sometimes felt like too much information. When the game throws plot-moving activities into the mix, all this language, though delightful, can also get overwhelming.</p><p>But these dings are products of exuberance. <em>Cryptmaster</em> feels so in love with its core idea, so eager to show you all the different things you can do with words, that wishing it did a little less feels like not wanting to play fetch with an excited puppy. Overall, it’s a completely charming game, showing off its creativity and giving you tons of space to add your own. I’m glad I finally got to it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeon-stalkers-early-access-fall<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Action Square and pubilsher Hybe IM have announced that&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers</em>, a PvPvE dungeon-crawling action RPG that's gunning for&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>'s crown, will launch into Early Access this fall.</p>
<p>In a press release, the studios say that after tests throughout last year and in May of this year,&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers&nbsp;</em>will undergo "several beta testing rounds" for the rest of 2024 before being released sometime in fall.</p>
<p>A number of changes have been made to the game since its initial debut in testing, and I'm assuming these changes will make an appearance in the final game. They include the introduction of a tutorial, a number of character and skill balance changes, and quality-of-life improvements, plus lots more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeon-stalkers-early-access-release-window-combat.jpg?itok=f3QH-10b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeon-stalkers-early-access-release-window-combat.jpg?itok=M-M3gEbc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dungeon Stalkers&nbsp;</em>is another multiplayer action RPG gunning for&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>'s crown.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with announcing the release window, Action Square and Hybe IM have also released a new making-of video that shows off behind-the-scenes looks at the development process for&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers</em>.</p>
<p>The video, which is in Korean with English subtitles, sees chief producer Daehoon Han discussing&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers</em>' combat, its lore, and the reasons behind an Early Access release, among other things.</p>
<p>If you've got any interest in&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers</em>, it's worth taking a look at this video, as it provides some pretty interesting insights into how Action Square is bringing its dungeon-crawling vision to life. You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers&nbsp;</em>making-of video right here.</p>

<p><em>Dungeon Stalkers&nbsp;</em>is a multiplayer action-RPG with a focus on PvPvE dungeon crawling and strategic combat.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-and-darker">other games</a> in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-playtest-early-access">the genre</a>, your goal is to explore a dungeon, combing it for loot and defeating any enemies you find before attempting to escape with what you've amassed.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unique twist on the genre you'll find here is the Witch's Curse mechanic, which "periodically bestows curses" on players in order to add an element of randomness and keep you on your toes.</p>
<p><em>Dungeon Stalkers&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2468730/Dungeon_Stalkers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> sometime this fall. Watch this space for more info.</p>

It was only last year that we played <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons/tag-team-turmoil">Double Dragon Gaiden</a>, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.</p>

<p>This next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/aew-fight-forever/stuck-in-the-mid-card">AEW: Fight Forever</a>. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.</p>

<p>Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iQiA3sCuqIs" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>For a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/02/20/double-dragon-the-forgotten-bad-video-game-movie">head here</a> to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.</p>

            <p>
Frontier has officially announced Planet Coaster 2, the sequel to its popular theme park management game.
</p>
<p>
The studio has been teasing news for the past couple of days on its <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/frontier">Twitch channel</a>, with an ongoing stream of park noises. Now it's shown a short in-engine teaser and revealed water parks will be a major new inclusion.
</p>
<p>
The game will be released this autumn, with a full gameplay reveal set for 31st July.

<p>

Players will be able to create lazy rivers, flumes, wave pools, and water coasters, plus changing rooms, sunbeds and lifeguards will be required.
</p>
<p>
The sequel will also include enhanced tools that build on its predecessor, to allow players to create rollercoasters piece-by-piece, as well as enhanced pathing tools, and an enhanced event sequencer tool to combine animatronics, smoke, water jets, sound and more.
</p>
<p>
The game will consist of three modes: Career mode to complete various scenarios; Franchise mode to build a global park network; and a freestyle Sandbox mode.

Players will also be able to visit other players' parks to test their rides, compete in the Franchise mode leaderboard, or share building responsibilities in Sandbox mode one at a time. Blueprints and full parks will also be available in the Frontier Workshop.
</p>
<p>
Planet Coaster 2 will launch across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. New details will be revealed on the last Wednesday of each month ahead of release during Frontier Unlocked livestreams.
</p>
<p>
The first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-review">Planet Coaster</a> was released in 2016 and proved immensely popular for its detailed creation tools. Frontier followed this with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-zoo-releases-for-consoles-in-march">Planet Zoo</a> in 2019, as well as two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-evolution-review-a-beautiful-overly-brutal-park-sim">Jurassic World Evolution</a> games.

            <p>Sony has opened up the early access beta for its upcoming 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord to all PlayStation Plus users.</p>
<p>Initially, this beta access was only going to be available to those who had already pre-ordered the game (you can find out more about the editions available and pricing in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-sonys-live-service-sci-fi-shooter-concord-will-launch-with-a-35-price-tag">Matt's story here</a>).</p>
<p>Those in the UK interested in trying out the early access beta can get it pre-downloaded from 6pm this evening (11th July). It will then be available to play from 6pm tomorrow, with cross play support for PS5 and PC. Sony said PS Plus users should look out for the option to download and play the Concord beta when they start up their PlayStation 5s.</p>

<p>"During the early access and open beta, all 16 of our launch Freegunners will be unlocked and available to play and customise," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/11/concord-beta-early-access-preload-and-server-times-pc-specs-and-more-detailed/">developer Firewalk</a> said in a blog post accompanying today's news.</p>
<p>"Whether you want to snipe from afar, lock down an area, provide support for your teammates, or... just dive head-first into the fight, our roster of Freegunners has something for everyone."</p>
<p>There will also be four maps to try out during the early access beta, and three modes: Clash Point, Trophy Hunt and Cargo Run.</p>
<p>When Firewalk then hosts Concord's open beta weekend (which runs from 18th - 21st July), it will add another new mode known as Area Control, and a new map called Bone Mines.</p><p>

"If you plan on joining us for both early access and open beta, your progress will carry over between the weekends," the team said. "However, please keep in mind that your progress from either beta will not carry over to our official launch on 23rd August."

<p>Our Chris went hands on with Concord earlier this year. "Concord can't help but feel like many of the other competent games made by other highly competent former-developers of other big, successful multiplayer games," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">Eurogamer's Concord preview</a>.</p>
<p>"In other words: a game that places individual moments of that high-level competency within its various disciplines - diverse, fleshed-out characters! Satisfying gunfeel! Intelligently-limited verticality! Sensible environment design! No gameplay-affecting microtransactions! - above an overall uniqueness of vision that binds it together."</p>

We meet the characters separately, but the short scenes reveal a great deal about the nature of each character, and by the end of the episode, we see them cross paths, at least casually.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Supacell</em> is an exploration of survival and synchronicity. While the initial episode focuses on the character of Michael (Tosin Cole), we observe the emergence of each superhero throughout. As indicated in the teaser for the show, you can tell someone’s superpowers are activated or currently active by their eyes—they turn yellow.</p><h2 id="h1711"><a id=""></a>Red vs. blue and complementary lyrics, too</h2><p>Most scenes in <em>Supacell</em> feature a prominent color, either in the lighting or in an object in the scene. One scene features a blue car, for instance, in which a man tells his partner that the blue is her color and her skin looks good next to it. </p><p>Red is also an important color in the show, relating to the prevalence of violence, the presence of Sickle Cell Disease in the Black community (see below), and the untapped vitality of the community. <em>Supacell</em> isn’t shy about showing the consequences of violence, even in the first scene, which, without much context, shows a sinister white man drinking out of a mug in a facility where Black people are imprisoned in cells.</p><p>In a scene set in a club where gang members are present, “Talkin’ da Hardest” by Giggs plays, and the song’s lyrics mirror what the characters experience. “Everyone’s suit same color as Batman” references both the importance of tones and skin color to the show, but also foreshadows the awakening of superpowers for the characters.</p><p>The song goes on to mention being covered in red, implying violence, and the entire scene as well as the clothes the characters are wearing add more red to the scene. Their opposition gang shows up wearing blue, as do many of the initially unconnected characters, such as a healthcare worker and a delivery man.</p><h2 id="h1712"><a id=""></a>Black as the norm</h2><p>Almost every character in the show is Black. When white characters do show up, it’s typically as a symbol of oppression or oversight, and they have a sinister feel to them even if they’re not openly exhibiting racist or otherwise problematic behavior. There’s also sometimes a mystery to them; whereas the Black characters share feelings and emotions with each other, the white characters appear calculating and deliberate. </p><figure id="" data-id="f261115226abd79e2289b78d606f4cde" data-recommend-id="image://f261115226abd79e2289b78d606f4cde" data-format="jpg" data-width="2279" data-height="1283" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vibrant blue BMW on a London city street, with a Black woman in the passenger seat and a man standing next to it.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a white viewer, I noticed the perspective shift: the sense of alarm I felt for the Black characters every time a white character walked by. When white characters observe Black characters, take notice of them, or recognize them as people in any way, there’s a possibility of bad intent or suspicion. I appreciate the clear view of distrust coupled with the obvious reasons it’s necessary.<br></p><h2 id="h1713"><a id=""></a>The system is rigged, surveillance is reality</h2><p>The prevalence of drugs and other alternative economies in the show is depicted as clearly a product of a rigged system. Characters never randomly engage in illegal activity— there’s always a reason, and it usually has to do with making a living in a racist society. Overall, white characters observe and “supervise,” but life has to go on for the Black characters in this framework.</p><p>If white people aren’t actually present and observing, there are sometimes surveillance devices, some of which pick up superhuman activities. Hopefully, we will learn more about who is watching as the series goes on.</p><h2 id="h1714"><a id=""></a>Everyday marginalization and Black identity</h2><p><em>Supacell</em> opens a discussion about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/sickle-cell-trait&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/sickle-cell-trait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the prevalence of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and the sickle cell trait</a></span>, which is more common in Black populations. We learn about Michael’s mom, and the ways she’s been marginalized by the medical system, which treats her like a junkie for asking for pain management for her medical condition. We also hear characters discuss getting promoted more slowly at work due to racism, and talk about how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/12/05/1137193397/missing-persons-of-color-news-coverage-disparities&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/05/1137193397/missing-persons-of-color-news-coverage-disparities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a missing Black person won’t get as much media coverage</a></span> as a white missing person. Most impactful is how this is all presented in a grounded, realistic way: this is BS, but it’s daily life for the characters.</p><p>The character Taze (Josh Tedeku) sums the systemic power imbalance up well when in need of an opportunity: “Money, power, and respect: it’s all there for the taking.”</p><h2 id="h1715"><a id=""></a>The Emergence of superpowers in <em>Supacell</em></h2><p>In the last half of the episode, characters begin to experience superpowers. Some of them realize it, some of them don’t—which makes their eventual connection even more interesting. The show opens up about the nature of the characters’ superpowers in a big way, revealing why Michael’s power is critical to the group. </p><p>My criticism of the show is that thus far, it’s largely male-centric and focusing on the needs of male characters. The women in the show range from soft to tough, which I appreciate—but I’d like to see more of them.<br></p><p>I recommend <em>Supacell</em> to fans of shows like <em>Sense8</em>, which emphasize connections and community between characters who might otherwise be unlikely to cross paths. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChxrl60x8Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Frontier revealed a new trailer announcing that Planet Coaster 2 will launch sometime in Fall 2024.</p>



<p>The new trailer doesn’t feature any gameplay, and it doesn’t provide a concrete release date for Planet Coaster 2. However, the announcement does tease that a first look at gameplay is coming on July 31, 2024.</p>



<p>Frontier’s trailer also warns fans that it only includes “pre-alpha engine footage.” So, although the visuals already look solid, they are still subject to change and improve by the time of release.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>The announcement trailer showcases a variety of potential rides, items, and settings that players may find in Planet Coaster 2. </p>



<p>That includes some classic coasters, as well as a focus on water parks content, such as pools and water slides. Fans quickly praised the new revealed features, which are sure to increase the scope of the game.</p>



<p>Planet Coaster 2’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/">Steam page</a> teases everything from “meandering lazy rivers to adrenaline-pumping wave pools, looping flumes to exhilarating water coasters.” Players can combine these with their coaster rides.</p>



<p>Fans will also get to share their creations, build with friends across platforms, and visit other parks after Planet Coaster 2 launches in Fall.</p>



<p>The first Planet Coaster originally launched nearly 10 years ago in 2016. Fans may also recognize Frontier Developments for the Jurassic World Evolution series, and it recently announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-jurassic-world-game-is-coming-from-frontier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Jurassic World game</a>.</p>

		<p>Frontier Developments has revealed Planet Coaster 2, a sequel to their hit theme park management game coming out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in autumn 2024.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/UChxrl60x8Y</p>


<p>Planet Coaster 2 will look to take your parks further than ever with the introduction of water-based attractions. These range from lazy rivers and calming pools to flumes that loop around, tower over the surrounding park, and wave pools. There’s even water coasters, that will combine both sides of the game.</p>
<p>There will be a whole host of new rides, some new themes and plenty of customisable scenery pieces that will let you make your amusement park match your dreams. That goes from new ride smoothing in the creation tools, to customising colours and set dressing for individual carriages or all at once, and a new event sequencer to make animatronics take place at just the right time.</p>
<p>There will be four new themes included in the game, with the Mythological Theme, California-inspired Resort Theme, the wet Aquatic Theme and rustic Viking Theme, and you’ll naturally be able to pick and choose from everything in the game, combining things together to create your own scenery and blueprints.</p>

<p>Behind the new themes and water rides are new management tools. You’ll have to look out for the health of your guests with lifeguards, shade and sunscreen, and can delve into new heat maps to see better what is and isn’t working in your park.</p>
<p>Alongside the career and sandbox is the leaderboard challenge of Franchise, and you can share a save file with other players to go building and adapting, though this is a one-at-a-time kind of experience.</p>
<p>It’s wild to think it’s been eight years since Planet Coaster first launched on PC in 2016, though that’s partly because <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/10/planet-coaster-console-edition-review-ps5-ps4-xbox-one-series-x/">Planet Coaster: Console Edition</a> only arrived in 2020. Either way, this was the game that reinvigorated the genre, and in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/29/planet-coaster-review/">our original Planet Coaster review</a>, Dave said, “Planet Coaster feels like a step into more modern times for the genre. There are bugbears when it comes to the camera and the subsequent patience required to build your perfect theme park, but should one have the stamina to intricately design features for their park, the possibilities are nigh on endless.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-reportedly-cancels-unannounced-smash-bros-competitor.924744/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report,&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>developer Riot Games has canceled an unannounced&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em>-style platform fighter by the name of&nbsp;<em>Pool Party</em>.</p>
<p>This report comes from <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" rel="noopener" target="_blank">former Washington Post reporter Mikhail Klimentov</a>, who cites "current and former Riot Games employees familiar with the decision". According to Klimentov and his sources,&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>was canceled in late May.</p>
<p>Klimentov says that around 70-80 Riot employees were working on the project, and that of those staffers, around half of them have "received an offer to be reassigned within the studio", while others are seeking new positions via Riot's "internal job board".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-smash-bros-ultimate-riot-games-pool-party.jpg?itok=BTBLn_Qm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-smash-bros-ultimate-riot-games-pool-party.jpg?itok=_PoyBRCH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Riot Games' apparently-canceled&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>would have been a competitor for&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em></figcaption></figure><p>A further ten employees weren't offered work elsewhere within Riot and didn't apply for internal jobs either, according to Klimentov, which presumably means they either left or were laid off. It <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-laying-off-530-employees-riot-forge-will-cease">wouldn't be the first round of layoffs</a> within Riot this year if that was the case.</p>
<p>According to Klimentov's report,&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>began life as a hardcore fighting game before morphing into a more casual-friendly project that aimed to compete with&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros</em>., particularly in light of Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riptide-super-smash-bros-project-tournaments-canceled">strange relationship</a> with that game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smash-bros-hurt-community">esports scene</a>.</p>
<p>However, Klimentov says Riot was "spooked" by what the studio perceived to be the "failure" of Warner Bros' platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-release-date-full">released in full earlier this year</a> after an extensive beta period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This "failure" caused Riot to reassess whether there was a public appetite for a&nbsp;<em>Smash Bros.&nbsp;</em>competitor, and with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is">more hardcore fighter&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>in the works</a>, it's clear Riot decided to shift its priorities, assuming the report is correct.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/multiversus-riot-games-pool-party.jpg?itok=9wVjZOFO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/multiversus-riot-games-pool-party.jpg?itok=zTc_Rs16 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>According to Mikhail Klimentov, Riot canceled&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>after it got "spooked" by the "failure" of&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Klimentov quotes Riot's senior comms director Joe Hixson as saying that the studio "always ha[s] a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D", and that "spinning projects up and down" is a regular occurrence.</p>
<p>Still, it's a shame to think that whatever work Riot's staff did on&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>will be lost forever. Not for the first time, I think it'd be a good idea for the studio to release what it had, just so we can see what&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>might have been like.</p>
