            <p>
Five months after bursting into PC early access, Hades 2 - the sequel to Supergiant Games' much-loved 2020 roguelike action-adventure - has just received its first major content update, adding a new region, weapon, and so much else its patch notes weigh in at over 3,500 words.
</p>
<p>
Hades 2's Olympic Update ("practically mountain-sized!", exclaims Supergiant) starts with the addition of a brand-new region - one you'll probably already have guess based on the name of today's release. If it's concrete information you want, though, we'll need to delve into spoiler territory - so <strong>turn back right now</strong> if you're sensitive to that kind of thing, otherwise I'll just get on and confirm Hades 2 players can now explore Olympus, the mountain of the gods.
</p>
<p>
Olympus consists of multiple new locations, and Supergiant notes today's update also adds new locations to several other existing regions. That's alongside an "otherworldly" new weapon - Xinth's Black Coat, to be more specific - plus two new allies with unique Keepsakes, and two new Animal Familiars (Raki the Raven and Hecuba the Hound) to find.

<p>
Elsewhere in Hades 2's Olympic Update, those looking to spruce up the Crossroads a little now have access to "dozens" of new cosmetic items, while Supergiant also promises "hours" of new dialogue (spanning 2,500 new voice lines) as the game's plot picks up the pace thanks to the arrival of Olympus and its denizens. Other key additions include a new world map that appears as protagonist Melinoë moves between regions, plus native support for Apple's M1 Macs.
</p><p>
Supergiant's full patch notes are appropriately supergiant in nature, so I won't be appending the whole thing to the bottom of this page. Instead, you'll find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/7057794870234137716?l=english">all 3,500+ words covering Hades 2's latest additions</a> over on Steam; alternatively, Supermassive has brilliantly released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQtih_yy6IA">nearly 27-minute long dramatic reading</a> of the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
Hades 2 is currently expected to leave early access next year, and a release for unspecified consoles is also on the cards. Already, though, it's a bit of a treat, with Eurogamer contributor Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">calling it</a> "comfortable and familiar" and armed with the "power of surprise".

Previously, Lightning Lane Multi Passes, which let you skip the line on multiple rides, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyland.disney.go.com/lightning-lane-passes/#faqItem2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/lightning-lane-passes/#faqItem2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost $32 a day</a></span> per person, though the price could increase for various reasons. These passes forced guests to select a time to arrive for their “line skip,” which could cause problems if you were late. This newly announced tier of line skipping, Premier Pass, does away with that restriction, but at a steep cost. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-worlds-new-line-skipping-service-charges-up-to-450-per-day/1100-6527195/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-worlds-new-line-skipping-service-charges-up-to-450-per-day/1100-6527195/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>GameSpot</em></a></span>, the new “Premier” pass—which will be available later this month—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/lightning-lane-passes/lightning-lane-premier/#faqItem1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/lightning-lane-passes/lightning-lane-premier/#faqItem1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will cost up to $450 a day per person at Disney World</a></span>. The price varies depending on the park and when you go, with Disney saying that the highest prices will be found on a “limited number of days over peak travel periods.” </p><p>Here are the prices for each park, but keep in mind that you still need to buy a ticket to the park, and at Disney World, only folks staying in Disney World hotels on property will be eligible to buy these new, limited passes. </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Disney’s Animal Kingdom: $129 to $199</li><li>EPCOT: $169 to $249</li><li>Disney’s Hollywood Studios: $269 to $349</li><li>Magic Kingdom: $329 to $449</li></ul><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://people.com/disney-lightning-lane-premier-pass-costs-449-how-to-buy-8729064#:~:text=Disney%20World's%20New%20'Premier%20Pass,on%20Top%20of%20Park%20Ticket&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://people.com/disney-lightning-lane-premier-pass-costs-449-how-to-buy-8729064#:~:text=Disney%20World's%20New%20'Premier%20Pass,on%20Top%20of%20Park%20Ticket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meanwhile, at Disneyland</a></span>, the Premier pass will cost $400 per person until December 31.

And sure, you can argue that people don’t <em>need</em> to buy these passes, that they can just wait in line, but ride queues can get quite long and waiting sucks. Besides, the big appeal of Disney World and Disneyland is the rides! And making it more expensive to actually enjoy them seems like the opposite of making your parks more accessible to more people.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-pixel-perfect-secret-lair-brings-retro-vibes-to-table<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-camp-totally-safe-secret-lair-brings-tricks-and-treats" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Secret Lair</a>. The aptly named Pixel Perfect Secret Lair contains card artwork inspired by 16-bit pixel art games. Furthermore, proceeds from the drop will go to Extra Life.</p>

<p>The Pixel Perfect Secret Lair was announced <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/extralife2024#filter-product-1018598|sort-availability_wotc,featured">via blog post</a> on the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> website. It is a limited time drop available in both foil (MSRP $49.99) and non-foil (MSRP $39.99). According to the drop's description, 50% of the drop's sales will go to the fundraising program Extra Life.</p>

The cards in the drop are <em>Mana Geyser</em>, <em>Lightning Bolt</em>, <em>Fierce Guardianship</em>, and <em>Delayed Blast Fireball. </em>Each of these four cards contains pixel art by Mike Burns. That artwork depicts the Fbithp braving a lava-filled dungeon to do battle with the powerful dragon planeswalker Nico Bolas.</p>
<p>The pixel art is packed with small but important details. Background details like Nico Bolas' symbol. Fbithp having a heart gauge in the upper left corner. Nico Bolas having a large boss health bar. The card descriptions depicted as textboxes by planeswalker Ajani. It all comes together to sell the retro sidescroller aesthetic.</p>
<p>Extra Life was founded in 2008 as a fundraising program of Children's Miracle Network hospitals led by the gaming community. Since its inception, the program has raised $120 million for critical pediatric needs at local hospitals across the United States and Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wizards of the Coast has helped donate money to their cause in the past through similar <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-partners-with-extra-life-2022" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Secret Lair</a> events. Specifically, their proceeds go to support the Seattle Children's Autism Center.</p>
<p>The Pixel Perfect Secret Lair is available for pre-order right now. The Secret Lair will be available until November 18, 2024.</p>

Maybe it’s all leading up to another big trailer at the next Game Awards this December.

Don't Nod - the studio behind the likes of Jusant, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> 1 &amp; 2, and the upcoming Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - has announced 69 jobs are at risk as it initiates a "reorganisation project to ensure the company's long-term future" amid "deteriorating" financial results.
</p>
<p>
Signs the studio was facing difficulties <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-bets-on-lost-records-bloom-rage-as-multiple-projects-fail-to-meet-expectations">emerged earlier this year</a> when it announced it would be partially writing down €24m following the underperformance of Jusant and Banishers: Ghost of New Eden. It also confirmed it would be cancelling the development of one unannounced project, codenamed P10, while two additional Paris-developed projects (codenamed P12 and P13) had been temporarily put on hold in order to "prioritise resources and maximise the chances of success for the most promising titles at present." Despite all this, it remained upbeat regarding the prospects of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, and noted it had two additional in-house projects in the works, both scheduled to release by the end of 2027. 
</p>
<p>
But in its newly released <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278">2024 half-year results update</a>, Don't Nod has acknowledged "strongly negative results despite [these] performance-enhancing measures", and has announced a "reorganisation project to safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem" that may affect up to 69 jobs. "An initial exchange took place today with the employee representative bodies," it noted, "and an information-consultation process with these same bodies will subsequently be initiated regarding this project."

<p>
In a statement accompany today's news, Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert wrote, "Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic, as well as the accounting impact of the decisions we had to take. The initial performance support measures announced last spring no longer seem sufficient to maintain the company's competitiveness. As a result, today we presented a reorganisation project to the employee representative bodies, which could set Don't Nod on a new development trajectory. I am fully conscious of the impact this project may have on all our employees. Securing our company's resources and restoring its ability to perform more in an increasingly competitive and selective industry is extremely necessary."
</p><p>
In addition to its in-house projects, Don't Nod is providing support for two external publishing projects due for release in 2025, but Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage will be the company's next major own release when it launches for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S next year - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-lost-records-launches-in-two-parts">first part arriving on 18th February</a> and its concluding half releasing a month later on 18th March.

Unreal Engine has a lot of features for this, but for our game, we really had to squeeze up every megabyte from every piece of system content we could, and now we did it,” said GSC.</p><p>According to the interview, the studio’s devs now believe that it should be possible for any modern game to work on <em>Series S.</em> However, the developers did acknowledge that not every team or studio gets enough time to optimize for the weaker Xbox.

However, in many cases, we have managed to hit 60 FPS, but it’s not as consistent as the Series X. But we’re looking to get a performance mode for Xbox Series S, to get it to 60 FPS. We think it’s possible,” explained GSC. <br></p><p>Performance modes aren’t as common on Xbox Series S, due to its lower specs, so if GSC can actually pull it off I’ll be curious to see what was cut or downgraded to make <em>Stalker 2</em> run at 60FPS on the weaker Xbox.

As part of the event, players can complete challenges to unlock rewards like toppers and decals inspired by Spider-Man villains like Venom, Mysterio, and Green Goblin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=025TMNQHWV0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/025TMNQHWV0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spider-Man superfans might be interested in buying the Spider-Man Mega Bundle (about $25 USD), which comes with everything, including a Venom-themed goal explosion, decals for Spider-Gwen and Spider-Punk, a Web-head boost and trail, Spider-Man and Symbiote wheels, and a Spidey sense topper, among other things. Check out everything available in the bundle below. Players don't have to buy the mega bundle, though, as individual items and bundles are available as well for separate purchase.</p><p>In addition to the Spider-Man content, Rocket League is adding two limited-time modes for Halloween, including Spooky Cube and Haunted Heatseeker. Spooky Cube is normal Rocket League except the spherical soccer ball is replaced with a cubical jack-o'-lantern. In Haunted Heatseeker, the field is invaded by ghosts who try to steal the ball and score--but there is a catch. If your opponent blocks a ghost's shots, the ball will ricochet back toward your own goal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385913" data-ratio="0.56035889070147" data-width="1226" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385913"></a><figcaption>Spider-Man comes to Rocket League</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385914,1300-4385915,1300-4385916,1300-4385917" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png"></figure><p>For lots more on Haunted Hallows, be sure to <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/its-a-spider-man-spooktacular-in-rocket-leagues-haunted-hallows" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">read the full blog post on the Rocket League website.</a>⁠</p><h3>⁠⁠⁠Spider-Man Mega Bundle (3000 Credits, or about $25 USD)</h3><ul><li>We Are Venom Goal Explosion <i>(2000 Credits individually)</i></li><li>Spider-Man Octane Decal Bundle <i>(900 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Classic Spider-Man Octane Decal</li><li>Spider-Gwen Octane Decal</li><li>Spider-Punk Octane Decal</li><li>Scarlet Spider Octane Decal</li></ul></li><li>Web-Head Boost + Trail Bundle <i>(600 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Web-Head Boost</li><li>Web-Head Trail</li></ul></li><li>Symbiote Fennec Bundle <i>(500 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Spider-Man Symbiote Suit Fennec Decal</li><li>Scream Fennec Decal</li></ul></li><li>Spider-Man Wheels Bundle <i>(500 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Spider-Man Wheels</li><li>Spider-Man Symbiote Wheels</li></ul></li><li>Spidey Sense Topper</li><li>Spider-Man’s Bag Topper</li></ul>

Sombra will now gain Stealth for five seconds after activating Translocator, though hacking enemies or taking damage will no longer end Stealth but instead will temporarily reveal her. Blizzard has also added back her Opportunist passive, allowing her to see critically injured enemies through walls and deal more damage to hacked targets.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 - Season 13: Spellbinder Event Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24148443/director-s-take-tricks-tweaks-and-treats-for-season-13/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> going over the update, game director Aaron Keller said the changes were in order to make it so Sombra can't take any position she wants in Stealth while giving her a new gameplay loop that "increases her lethality."</p><p dir="ltr">Several Tank heroes have received changes as well in Season 13, namely Ramattra, Reinhardt, and Mauga. Ramattra's Pummel ability no longer pierces shields, though it will deal 2.5x more damage to them to compensate, with the patch notes stating that the ability being able to damage through shields was a "source of frustration for players trying to protect themselves or their allies."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of shields, the health of Reinhardt's Barrier Field has been reduced by 100, which Keller said should lead to players having to make a choice between blocking attacks with their barrier or taking the hits themselves. Mauga, on the other hand, received a nice buff, with his ignite damage from his incendiary chaingun now dealing damage over four seconds instead of three. That should give him more power against "smaller, harder to hit targets," Blizzard said.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-12-introduces-juno-lets-players-become-egyptian-gods/1100-6525795/" data-ref-id="1100-6525795">Juno, the game's newest Support hero</a>, received a nerf to her healing both in terms of the amount healed and the falloff range of her Mediblaster. The change will require players to make better use of her mobility abilities in order to maintain proper positioning, Blizzard said. Other heroes got small updates as well, ranging from increased cooldown for Brigitte's Repair Pack to a slight health buff for Hanzo.</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-season-13-battle-pass-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-5867/" data-ref-id="2900-5867">Overwatch 2 Season 13</a> include a number of adjustments to various maps. Four maps--Circuit Royal, Havana, Dorado, and Numbani--have seen various tweaks, ranging from added cover and adjusted sightlines to new pathways and changes to spawn locations. A full before-and-after breakdown can be viewed in the official patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to all the various map and hero changes, Clash, the newest Overwatch 2 game mode added during Season 12, received adjustments. Blizzard said it's looking to "reduce the number of one-sided stomps" in the mode, and as a result tweaked capture times as well as made it easier for Attackers to secure at least one segment of the final objective point.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-new-halloween-game-mode-mutates-heroes-for-brutal-pvp-action/1100-6527094/" data-ref-id="1100-6527094">Overwatch 2 Season 13 introduced a new PvP Halloween game mode</a> alongside bringing back previous PvE event modes like Junkenstein's Revenge and Wrath of the Bride, and will soon offer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-getting-another-anime-crossover-this-time-with-my-hero-academia/1100-6526743/" data-ref-id="1100-6526743">My Hero Academia-themed skins</a>.

So we're scaling it back for now.</p><ul><li>Role Delta tuning tightened, to try to match Ranks on the roles on each team more closely.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We believe that match quality improves significantly when you are matched closely with one of the members on the opposing team in the same role. We believe we can tighten this preference without significantly impacting queue times.</p><ul><li>Role Delta has been updated to prioritize the Tank Role above other roles.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We've been thinking about how to improve the Tank experience from every angle, to give them more even matchups and reduce 1-sided matches for the whole team further.</p><ul><li>At higher Ranks the effects of MMR Decay, Winning Trend, Losing Trend, and Calibration have been reduced.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: At our highest ranks these modifiers could sometimes allow very high skill players playing on new accounts to get lucky and surpass their peak ranks considerably, without actually earning their new rank like other players that have played more on their accounts.</p><ul><li>At higher Ranks the matchmaker now takes into account the benefits of grouping when constructing matches.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: At the highest ranks, groups have had noteworthy advantages against teams composed of all solo players for some time now. Our aim with this addition isn't to remove the advantage of grouping at higher ranks entirely, but we'd like the advantage of grouping at higher ranks to be less extreme.</p><p dir="ltr">Public Custom Games</p><ul><li>Hosting Public Custom Games now requires Endorsement Level 3.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: A reminder that we've been actioning accounts that post disruptive content in the Game Browser and we're serious about removing problematic players that don't follow our Code of Conduct. Whenever an account is actioned for a social penalty, they're reduced to Endorsement Level 0, so the combination of social actions and this feature will allow for one chance to change their behavior before they're permanently banned.

As a reminder, the "Hide My Name" feature does not prevent disruptive players from being punished when they're reported since we know their actual battle tag behind the scenes.</p><p dir="ltr">Challenge Updates</p><ul><li>Select challenges are now visible in the Main Menu.</li><li>Challenge Rewards can now be inspected in detail in the Challenges Menu.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: Challenges are now in the main menu to highlight their rewards, primarily for new Event Challenges.</p><p dir="ltr">SHOP UPDATES</p><ul><li>Mythic Skin Aspects Add-on Cosmetic is now added to the Mythic Shop.</li><li>Overwatch League Store tab was removed and replaced by a separate button in the bottom of the main Shop tab.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">COMPETITIVE UPDATES</p><p>The requirements to appear on the Top 500 Leaderboard have changed:</p><ul><li>Win requirement per season reduced from 50 to 25.</li><li>The Seasoned Competitor challenge (750 lifetime wins in Competitive Play) is now required to be completed to be eligible for any Top 500 Leaderboard starting in Season 12.</li></ul><h4>Hero Updates</h4><p dir="ltr">General</p><ul><li>Swapping your hero hides your selection on the enemy scoreboard for 15 seconds.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: This change adds a more friction to counterswapping, especially in the extreme case where two players on opposite teams are both sitting in spawn with the scoreboard open and rapidly switch their heroes in response to each other’s choices.</p><h4>Tank</h4><h5>Mauga</h5><p>Developer Comment: Increasing the duration of Mauga's burn effect will help better reward going for the smaller, harder to hit targets.</p><p dir="ltr">Incendiary Chaingun</p><ul><li>Ignite damage over time duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Ramattra</h5><p>Developer Comments: Ramattra's Pummel projectiles passing through barriers was a source of frustration for players trying to protect themselves or their allies. With these changes enabling Ramattra to deal critical damage to barriers, he will still be a valuable hero choice against barrier mechanics, but won't immediately apply damage to players on the other side.</p><p>Pummel</p><p dir="ltr">Pummel</p><ul><li>No longer pierces barriers.</li><li>Now deals 2.5x more damage to barriers.</li></ul><h5>Reinhardt</h5><p>Developer Comments: This is just some fine tuning for the barrier health and regeneration rate as it had become slightly too tough to break through.</p><p dir="ltr">Barrier Field</p><ul><li>Barrier Field health reduced from 1600 to 1500.</li></ul><h4>Damage</h4><h5>Hanzo</h5><p>Developer Comments: We are reverting Hanzo back to his previous health now that it's possible to take out an opposing Hanzo with a well-aimed headshot thanks to the weapon damage changes.</p><ul><li>Base health increased from 225 to 250.</li></ul><h5>Sojourn</h5><p>Developer Comments: These Railgun changes swap out the 25 minimum energy it decays to for a longer time before it begins to degenerate which alleviates some of the pressure to quickly use the secondary fire.

It still enables Sombra to cross through dangerous areas unseen, but to really hang around in the enemy backline will require moving from cover-to-cover similar to other flanking heroes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-turn-based-rpg-andy-serkis-1851674347<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With its reveal buried in the middle of Microsoft’s mammoth Xbox showcase over the summer, you could be forgiven for not being aware of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, a fantasy RPG from French studio Sandfall Interactive that looks like a mashup of <em>Dragon Age</em> and<em> Final Fantasy</em>. The turn-based adventure continues to look stunning though, and it just announced an all-star voice cast to boot that includes Andy Serkis.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,196055" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is a dark fantasy RPG inspired by the French Belle Époque (think French Impressionism and the Lumière brothers) about a group of explorers trying to take on a god called the Paintress who’s terrorizing the countryside with arbitrary mass killings. The turn-based combat mixes in real-time elements, while the gorgeous menus and evocative UI look like a cross between <em>Persona</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>. If the actual game can live up to its early trailers, we could have something really special on our hands. </p><p>And despite coming from a brand-new studio, the just-revealed cast for the game is full of top-notch talent. In addition to Serkis, best known as Gollum in Peter Jackson’s<em> Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy and as <em>Andor</em>’s Kino Loy in the single best episode of <em>Star Wars</em> TV ever produced, <em>Expedition 33</em> also features the voice talents of <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s Clive Rosfield (Ben Starr) and<em> Baldur’s Gate III</em>’s Shadowheart (Jennifer English). Here’s the full cast list so far:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Andy Serkis </strong>(<em>13 Going on 30</em>) as a man trying to save his family named Renoir</li><li><strong>Charlie Cox</strong> (<em>Daredevil</em>) as the lead engineer Gustave</li><li><strong>Ben Starr</strong> (<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>) as the dangerous stranger  Verso</li><li><strong>Jennifer English </strong>(<em>Baldur’s Gate III</em>) as the shy loner  Maelle</li><li><strong>Kirsty Rider</strong> (<em>Sandman</em>) as chief researcher Lune</li><li><strong>Shala Nyx </strong>(<em>The Old Guard</em>) as the cheerful warrior Sciel</li></ul></blockquote><p>The newest trailer features the talents of both Starr, who helped carry <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s uneven story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637">to hell and back on his shoulders</a></span>, and Serkis, who we still love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/andy-serkis-ai-characters-project-gollum-lord-of-the-rings-1236096832/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/andy-serkis-ai-characters-project-gollum-lord-of-the-rings-1236096832/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite his saying some dumb stuff about AI</a></span>. The gameplay footage also gives a wider look at <em>Expedition 33</em>'s unique world and massive monsters. A giant clockwork golem fight demonstrates the game’s timing-based combat mechanics, and a grappling hook-like power shows off one of the game’s many traversal abilities. </p><p>Devora Wilde (<em>Space Marine 2</em>), Tracy Wiles (<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>), Rich Keeble, and Maxence Cazorla are in the game as well. “The actors were phenomenal to work with (and just all-around great people),” wrote <em>Clair Obscur </em>lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the PlayStation Blog</a></span>. “We had a lot of fun during the recording sessions. The cast beautifully conveyed the complexity of the characters, who have each been shaped by the harshness of their world. Every character has been affected by deep and constant loss and has dealt with this in their own way.”</p><p>  <em>Expedition 33</em> doesn’t have a set release date yet, but it’s supposed to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC early in 2025. So far the Unreal Engine 5 game looks like it’s shaping up nicely. I wouldn’t be surprised if it still gets one or two minor delays, but I’m looking forward to it whenever it finally arrives. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Per the company, the decline is the result of Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant not performing as well as expected.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/17/banishersthumb-1708181723447.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden didn't perform as well as expected, Don't Nod says.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic, as well as the accounting impact of the decisions we had to take," said CEO Oskar Guilbert in a statement. "The initial performance support measures announced last spring no longer seem sufficient to maintain the company's competitiveness. As a result, today we presented a reorganization project to the employee representative bodies, which could set Don't Nod on a new development trajectory. I am fully conscious of the impact this project may have on all our employees. Securing our company's resources and restoring its ability to perform more in an increasingly competitive and selective industry is extremely necessary."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic</p></div><p>The company has already taken some restructuring measures to reduce costs, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-creator-dont-nod-has-rough-start-to-the-year-presses-pause-on-two-projects">including "pressing pause" on two unannounced projects</a>. However, this seems to not be enough, as Don't Nod is also expecting to lay off a number of individuals in the coming months. The exact number is still in flux, as Don't Nod management must negotiate with employee union representatives and may implement other measures such as a voluntary redundancy plan. Notably, earlier this year, the representative French union Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV) <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/02/dont-nod-ascension-or-free-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused the company</a> of mismanagement, claiming employees were facing burnout due to the ongoing reorganization and that communication, understaffing, and shifting deadlines were endangering the workforce.</p><p><strong>Update 2:22pm PT: </strong>STJV has issued a statement condeming the layoffs, saying the company broke the law by not providing any information to employees beforehand about today's meeting agenda where the layoffs were announced. The union also accused the company of ignoring workers asking for clearer communication about the state of the company, saying that "alarm bells have been ringing for months."</p><p>"The Don’t Nod union section, as well the whole of the STJV, cannot tolerate the company rejecting the responsibilities of its own failures on its workers," <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/10/at-dont-nod-the-only-plans-for-the-future-are-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the statement reads</a>. "We warned them long ago, but they ignored us and accused us of being too agressive to speak with. With this layoffs plan, they are creating an atmosphere of extreme violece. We are calling on all workers at Don’t Nod to mobilise to save their jobs and working conditions."</p><p><strong>Original story continues:</strong></p><p>According to a <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">games industry layoff tracker</a>, over 13,000 game developers have been laid off just this year (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-lays-off-more-league-of-legends-developers-while-promising-to-increase-team-size">including 32 just yesterday at Riot Games</a>). Over 10,000 developers were laid off in 2023 and over 8,000 in 2022.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World: Aeternum</a>, Amazon Games' MMO, is set during the Age of Exploration, on an island where no one can die--but immortality isn't always a gift. For some, living forever leads to madness, while others lose their souls. Some corpses are long since hollowed out but live on, unable to find peace.</p><p dir="ltr">That idea gets pretty dark pretty fast, but in the episode of animated anthology series Secret Level that's based on New World, the focus is on a slightly different take on the material.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLihxsmI_OU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gLihxsmI_OU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"[New World: Aeternum is] not quite as light as [the episode] presents it," said New World: Aeternum narrative director Rob Chestney, during a question-and-answer session with press following a recent screening of Secret Level's first episode. "We talk about it as grimdark. We talk about it as supernatural, rather than fantasy."</p><p dir="ltr">The video game conceit of players dying is baked into the fiction of New World: Aeternum, giving an in-universe reason for players to die and resurrect frequently. In the game's fiction, Chestney said, that often gets treated seriously. The Secret Level episode, however, puts a darkly humorous spin on all that death and how it alters consequences for characters, resulting in a short that's a comedy, rather than a dark fantasy. It's a take on New World: Aeternum that utilizes the same ideas but to a very different effect than the game itself.</p><p dir="ltr">The New World episode might be a good example of creator Blur Studios' process in making Secret Level, which has episodes based on 15 different games from 11 different developers. The episode focuses on a key element of the game it's based on, teasing out something that can resonate with viewers regardless of their familiarity with that world. But it also means shrinking down an entire game world that might take players tens of hours to experience, like New World, into something with a few characters and a few minutes of story.</p><p dir="ltr">"Especially with this episode, but any game that is that vast and there's so much to draw from, especially with the sort of an unindoctrinated audience, you want to distill it down to something personal that people can connect to," Secret Level executive producer Dave Wilson said. "So, with everything that was available to us, that's why it got distilled down to a handful of characters that you could, in 10 minutes, you can actually feel something for. One of the mantras that we've attached to all this sort of storytelling is, people remember what they felt, not what they saw."</p><p dir="ltr">The process for creating Secret Level episodes sounded pretty intense, though. To get that distillation of a particular idea or aspect of a game in the first place, Blur Studios, the animation studio behind the series, spent time with developers to immerse themselves in the games.</p><p dir="ltr">As Secret Level creator and executive producer Tim Miller explained, Blur developed massive documents, or "decks," about each one.</p><p dir="ltr">"We do a really deep dive with the lore, with the game developers, we build a huge f**king deck. These decks are massive, you know? Like 70 pages of, like, dos and don'ts about the game, here's what's interesting," Miller said. "And of course, we ask the developers, what's interesting about the lore and the characters? What do you feel is territory worth exploring? And sometimes the answer is, let's just make something cool. Sometimes it is, predictably, 'Well, we have a game coming out that focuses on this,' and that's also cool."</p><p dir="ltr">Blur took all the material about the games they created and passed them onto writers, Miller said, who then pitched story ideas--like the one about the funnier side of living forever.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because there's so many [writers], and because they come from such varied backgrounds and it's such a wide variety of POVs, we get a really wide variety of stories, much better than Dave and I sitting in a room, you know, whatever two white guys would come up with," he continued. "It's a much more interesting and broad spectrum of stories. I love that aspect. And we get a lot of unexpected things we would not have come up with."</p><p dir="ltr">New World: Aeternum hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S this week, and is also available on PC, so while it'll be a bit until viewers can see Secret Level's take on Aeternum--the series releases in December--the grimdark fantasy MMO is available for players right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> - the team behind the rather brilliant (in my humble opinion) Hitman games - hopes its upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">IGN</a>, IO boss Hakan Abrak said the team feels like it's had "20 plus years of training for the agent fantasy", thanks to Hitman. Indeed, Agent 47 is very Bond-like with his seemingly endless talents and ability to handle any weapon under the sun.</p>
<p>"But obviously James Bond is a different IP. It's a huge IP. It's not our IP. It's actually the first IP that is not our original IP from the ground up," Abrak told the publication, adding one of the most exciting parts of the upcoming release is that it will be an original story for the British spy.</p>

<p>"So it's not a gamification of a movie," Abrak continued. "It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is... to work on this together with the family [and create] a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><p>"It's been, what, almost 15 years since the last game. So it's been a long time," Abrak added. "It definitely is something that is not overexposed in gaming. We actually see that as a strength... There's a lot of people out there who think about GoldenEye as the classic... I don't want to speak too big about it, but I just hope we'll do a thing that will define James Bond in gaming for years to come. And that is not only one game, but that we create a universe for gamers to own for many years to come that we can grow with that next to the Bond on the movies."</p>
<p>As for when we'll all get to see the fruits of the studio's labours, that's still a mystery for now. "I don't have an update today, but believe me, it's itching here as well to be talking about it soon," Abrak admitted. "So we are following our plans. The production's going amazingly well and we will soon be talking more about it. I know it was a little teaser, not a lot of information, but there's a lot of cool stuff coming up."</p>

<p>IO first announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">James Bond game back in 2021</a>. Very little has been shared on it since, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-io-opens-up-a-little-about-its-james-bond-007-game">our Bertie managed to tease a few extra 00-details out of the team last year</a>.</p>
<p>But while we may have to wait a little longer to hear anything more concrete on IO's James Bond, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">has also announced it's taking on publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, the big-budget action adventure in the works from former Rockstar exec Leslie Benzies.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In light of this, the union, STJV, has denounced company leadership and called for workers to mobilize and defend their jobs.</p><p>Don’t Nod has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-creator-dont-nod-has-rough-start-to-the-year-presses-pause-on-two-projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously said</a> that its latest releases, <em>Jusant </em>and <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, fell short of “commercial expectations,” leading it to “temporarily” pause two other in-development projects. Despite a focus on the upcoming and thus far well-received <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, Don’t Nod <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now says</a> that “amid deteriorating results” it has been “compelled to consider a reorganization project to safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>STJV, which earlier this year <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/02/dont-nod-ascension-or-free-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a post criticizing Don’t Nod</a> for a burnout-inducing work environment in which "each project erratically follows another," has <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/2024/10/a-dont-nod-le-seul-plan-pour-lavenir-est-le-plan-de-licenciement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deemed</a> the layoff plan “the climax of a series of catastrophic decisions,&nbsp;denounced for a long time&nbsp;by workers' representatives.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Management is hiding being 'the state of the economy' and 'a very competitive market' as excuses for its failures, without ever questioning its inconsistent decisions, which have been harmful to the studio and its workers,” wrote Don’t Nod’s STJV union section in a post published today.</p><p>Workers, they say, must fight back. Specifically, they cite mass mobilization at Ubisoft, which <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-strike-france-pay-yves-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has included strikes</a> – something STJV also helped organize.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Don't Nod union section, as well as the whole of the STJV, cannot tolerate the company rejecting the responsibilities of its own failures on its workers. We warned them long ago, but they ignored us and accused us of being too aggressive to speak with,” the Don’t Nod STJV union section wrote. “Faced with executives who have decided to mock their workers, a social movement like the one currently happening at Ubisoft is necessary. It is up to us to establish the necessary balance of power to save our jobs. We will not pay for our bosses' mistakes."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A former member of renowned Texas-based support studio Certain Affinity has confirmed frequent reports the team was working on a battle royale mode for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a>, calling the cancelled project a potential "game changer".
</p>
<p>
Certain Affinity has worked on multiple major franchises since its founding in 2006, supporting development on the likes of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a> series, Call of Duty, and Doom 2016. One of its most intriguing projects, however, was the frequently rumoured and oft alluded to - but never officially confirmed - Halo-themed battle royale mode.
</p>
<p>
Whispers of the project began circulating in early 2022, when Certain Affinity <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-battle-royale-rumours-swirl-as-certain-affinity-confirms-it-has-joined-project">announced</a> it was "deepening" its relationship with Halo series stewards <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/343-industries">343 Industries</a> and working to 'evolve' Halo Infinite in "new and exciting ways" - later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/studio-rumoured-to-be-making-halo-infinite-battle-royale-offers-fresh-tease">confirming</a> over 100 employees had been developing the mysterious "something" since at least 2020. But despite the massive amount of time and resources invested in the endeavour, reports surfaced this January that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-battle-royale-reportedly-cancelled-after-years-of-work">Microsoft was pulling the plug</a> - news that was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-call-of-duty-support-studio-certain-affinity-confirms-its-laying-off-25-employees">25 layoffs at Certain Affinity</a> two months later.

<p>
But while Certain Affinity and Microsoft have never publicly confirmed the succession of reports from reliable sources claiming the canned project was a battle royale mode for Halo Infinite, former Certain Affinity design director Mike Clopper - who recently joined Call of Duty studio Raven Software as a design director - has now done just that.
</p><p>
"I led a large team of designers working on a cancelled Battle Royale mode for Halo," Clopper wrote in an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-clopper-9300811/">update to his LinkedIn profile</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dev-claims-cancelled-halo-infinite-battle-royale-could-have-been-game-changing/">VGC</a>), adding, "I believe this product could have been a game changer for the franchise. We loved playing it and working on it, was a fantastic experience in spite of its cancelation."
</p>
<p>
Since the project's cancellation at Certain Affinity, Microsoft has announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-is-introducing-a-third-person-mode-for-the-very-first-time">third-person mode for Halo Infinite</a> - which is due to arrive next month - and has also shared its future plans for the Halo series. 343 Industries, now rebranded Halo Studios, is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">working on multiple new Halo games</a> - and the studio recently released some experimental footage showing how the series might look once it transitions to Unreal Engine 5. Digital Foundry, if you're curious, shared its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-halo-is-moving-to-unreal-engine-5-and-the-first-footage-looks-impressive">first impressions</a> of that "impressive" footage last week.

As files and information gradually surface, most of what we’ve seen so far has been early assets and concept art for old games over the franchise’s many years. But there have been a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1845560379428024713&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1845560379428024713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few details about upcoming games</a></span> being rounded up by every <em>Pokémon </em>leak and fan account, including next year’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and beyond. Here’s a rundown of what we know based on the leaks, but it is important to note that all this information should be taken with a grain of salt, as projects may have changed, been canceled, or this information could be otherwise proven false.<br></p></div><div><p>There isn’t too much information about upcoming games yet, but a few details about next year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a></span> have been released that aren’t story spoilers. Specifically, the fact that the game will include Mega Evolutions for Zygarde and Zeraora. The former isn’t surprising, as Zygarde will likely play an important role in <em>Legends: Z-A </em>story, which takes place in the Kalos region from which the legendary Pokémon is based. Zeraora is more surprising, however, because it has no connection to the region, as it was introduced in Generation VII.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-recommend-id="image://0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-recommend-id="image://0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We do know a little bit more about the next generation of <em>Pokémon </em>games thanks to the leaks, though they haven’t been officially announced as of this writing.

These Generation X games will apparently take place in an archipelago of several islands.

The project has apparently been in development hell since 2021, but was pitched as a reboot for the movie universe and would feature a different protagonist from original hero Ash Ketchum or current leads <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-netflix-liko-roy-captain-pikachu-1851326504&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-netflix-liko-roy-captain-pikachu-1851326504">Liko and Roy</a></span>.

<p>Bethesda Game Studios is collaborating with Fallout for Hope to bring gamers a special ‘Fallout Day 2025’ broadcast on October 23. Known in the Fallout universe as ‘Bombs Drop Day’, October 23 has been an important date for fans for many years.</p>



<p>Fallout for Hope is a charitable endeavour that sees hundreds of fans, cosplayers, streamers, and creators join forces once a year to raise money for St Jude Children’s Hospital. It has grown exponentially over the years and is preparing to celebrate the fifth iteration of the special event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-apocalypse-isn-t-all-bad">The Apocalypse Isn’t All Bad</h2>



<p>In 2020, Fallout for Hope hosted its first fundraising event, using Fallout as a creative platform. Today, the ecosystem has blossomed, and more than 750 creators and personalities take part in raising money for an extremely deserving cause once a year. </p>



<p>This year, on ‘Fallout Day’, Fallout for Hope will roll out a four-hour showcase spanning everything from cosplays to in-game fanmade films.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s being put together hand-in-hand with Bethesda Game Studios. Also on October 23, the creative team at BGS will host a broadcast diving into the future of Fallout 76, which saw massive growth this year because of the success of the Fallout TV show.</p>



<p>Creators are being invited to <a href="https://falloutforhope.com/join/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">join the Fallout for Hope stream team</a> and help make a difference by hosting their own fundraising initiatives. To date, Fallout for Hope has helped to raise more than half a million dollars for charity, and the network that supports the event is made up of representatives from more than 80 countries.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios is preparing to go big for Fallout Day this year. It’s already more invested than in previous years, and some fans are holding out hope for an announcement of some kind. Perhaps Fallout 3: Remastered is on the horizon…</p>



<p>Are you going to tune in on Fallout Day? Let us know in the comments.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</a> adds a ton of new content to the loot-driven dungeon crawler, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-all-tenets-of-akarat-locations-in-nahantu/1100-6527052/">new region</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-all-mercenaries-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6527178/">mercenaries</a>, and Runewords. Runewords are created when you combine two runes in an item with two sockets, giving you powerful bonuses. These new items are only available if you have the expansion and there is a large variety, giving you plenty of options, once you unlock them.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to unlock Runewords</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4385804-diablorunewords.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4385804" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4385804-diablorunewords.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4385804"></a><figcaption>Ritual Runes gather offering, which activates the ability of the invocation rune when the required amount is reached.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4385804-diablorunewords.jpeg"></figure><p>You unlock Runewords during the main Vessel of Hatred questline, during the Madman, Crowned quest that takes you to speak to Ormus in the Council Chambers. After speaking to him, you'll receive a briefing on the Runewords mechanics, and an initial set of Runes to begin experimenting with. <strong>Runewords don't start dropping as loot until you complete this quest, </strong>so you try and prioritize getting through the Vessel of Hatred campaign, or at least through this mission<strong>.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">How Runewords work and where to find more</h2><p dir="ltr">For a Runeword to work, you need to combine two halves into a single item. This means it needs to be an item that can have two sockets, a two-handed weapon, pants, chest, or helm. There are ritual Runes and invocation Runes. The ritual Runes create offerings by performing a specific task. For example the Yul Rune grants 50 offering each time you use a skill with a cooldown. Invocation runes activate a special ability when enough offering is collected. Sometimes it's something as simple as reducing any active cooldowns you have, but it can also activate an ability from another class. Combining one of each Rune in a single item creates a Runeword. <strong>You can only have two Runewords activated at once, </strong>but you can unsocket them at a Jeweler at any time to make changes or swap Runes.</p><p dir="ltr">Farming for specific Runes isn't possible currently, but you can farm for Runes in general. Runes can drop from any loot source, but they seem to drop more frequently from activities with a large chest as a reward. Infernal Hordes and summoned bosses seem to typically offer at least one if not a few, and activities like Helltides can drop them as well. While they can drop from almost anywhere, the best place to farm them is the Undercity in Kurast.</p><p dir="ltr">Using Tributes that specifically state they will drop Runes will reward you with Rune for completing an Undercity run, so long as you reach attunement level 1 by clearing enough enemies across the three floors prior to the boss fight. These also drop randomly, although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-whispers-grim-favors-guide/1100-6514621/">Tree of Whispers</a> caches seem to drop them the most consistently and in the largest quantity. Once you have four of the same Rune, you can reroll them at the Jeweler for a random Rune, with a decent chance for it to be a higher rarity than the Runes you rolled. <strong>Be careful rerolling Runes, </strong>as Runes are required for crafting specific Mythic Uniques. You can check with the Jeweler to see which Runes are required for which Mythic, so you can save them.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/facebook-marketplace-has-incredible-deals-and-i-despise-it.1011531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/facebook-marketplace-is-not-fun-to-use<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>People who know me know that I love a good deal, whether it is <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-best-gaming-chair-is-a-used-office-chair-from-craigslist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1000 dollar office chairs I found on the street</a>, or surprisingly well made C<a href="https://aftermath.site/chinese-fountain-pen-hongdian-jinhao-asvine-delike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hinese fountain pens</a>. Thrifting is in my blood, and there are few resources for deals quite as robust as Facebook Marketplace. It is also one of the single worst shopping experiences ever devised by god or man. There is no incentive for Meta to fix it, and at this point it should either be destroyed or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22456313/facebook-marketplace-european-commission-formal-antitrust-investigation-eu-uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavily regulated</a> by the government, because it has taken the ambient flow of good deals and funneled them into an evil, impossible to navigate labyrinth.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Welcome to the Marketplace, it sucks real bad in here man. Credit: Meta.</figcaption></figure><p>Before I got into Marketplace, my Facebook account had been largely dormant for the better part of a decade. As a platform, Facebook has deteriorated so aggressively that it has become supremely irritating to use. Everyone under the age of 40 moved over to Instagram. Though the endless fountain of <a href="https://aftermath.site/facebook-ai-tiny-house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI slop</a> grabs the most <a href="https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headlines</a>, the bigger issue is that you are constantly forced to interact with feeds you do not subscribe to. In addition to the feeds of your grandma and a guy from high school you don’t talk to anymore because he moved to New Hampshire to become more racist, you now have a random assortment of strangers, niche fan groups, influencers, and an endless stream of content that even TikTok would not touch. While this deterioration – a forced intrusion into your digital life by strangers and grifters to juice interaction –&nbsp; is not unique to Facebook, Facebook manages to take all of the worst algorithmic choices from other platforms and somehow deliver them to you with none of their benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>That Facebook can have any redeeming qualities given its precipitous slide is a testament to how good Facebook Marketplace can potentially be. What makes this possible is that the best deals are often from people who are either clueless or apathetic about what their belongings are worth. This usually takes the form of bored rich people, who are either too lazy or old to use Google. What makes Facebook Marketplace an engine for finding those people is that those are the exact demographic who still actively use Facebook. Putting a big button on it that says “sell that stuff you’ve been meaning to donate to Goodwill” is an incredible engine of commerce, because nobody involved in the process has to register a new account.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately it is a Meta product, and as a result the process of using it is like an ironically designed torture in hell. I loathe it deeply for the following reasons.</p><h2>I do not want to buy a couch in Salem.</h2><p>The process of using Facebook Marketplace is a lot like Craigslist if Craigslist lied to you constantly. If you ask Facebook Marketplace for results for “Milo Baughman couch” within a 20 mile radius of your house, you will get whatever results match that, plus several other listings hundreds of miles away, plus a bunch of stuff you were searching before that are unrelated to what you are currently searching for. This is not unique to Facebook, but it is the core of the experience that Facebook helped usher in. The modern internet abhors a void, and so any product designed by an evil tech startup will never say “sorry, we don’t have any of those.” Instead it will provide an endless stream of OK results mixed with slightly imprecise suggestions algorithmically tailored to your online profile.&nbsp;</p><p>You can technically narrow this down by distance, price or date listed, but the second you do any other search, it will reset these suggestions. Mercifully, you can save searches with filters, but this feature is nowhere near as intuitive or exact as Craigslist’s.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Eventually if you ask it for a vintage designer it will give you a horse. Credit: Meta</figcaption></figure><p>Most infuriating of all, it will almost always ignore any distance parameters you give it, insisting that all of its out-of-the-way listings are “worth the trip”! Really, Facebook? Is it “worth the trip” to drive to Philly to pick up an OKish bookcase I would need to refinish? No other app like this (like Craigslist, Mercari and Offerup) manages to so aggressively fight and attempt to bamboozle the user every step of the way, and I hope that one day government regulators decide that this behavior is illegal, because it feels like the shit that would cause you to get a class action check in the mail for 25 cents eight years from now.&nbsp;</p><h2>You have to go on Facebook to use it.</h2><figure><figcaption>I don't know who any of these people are but I think they meant to quote H.G. Welles. Credit: Meta</figcaption></figure><p>When and if government regulators<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265983/doj-google-search-remedies-monopoly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> finally break up Google</a>, I need them to come for Facebook Marketplace next. This is because Facebook Marketplace itself requires that you interact with the Facebook app or website in order to use it. Unlike Messenger, there is no dedicated app that lets you ignore every other part of the site. And while there are some shockingly useful Facebook groups, having to go through the worst skinner box on the internet to get to the deals feels like going into a particularly dead mall because there’s one solid thrift store sandwiched between the shell of a Suncoast Video and a TJ Maxx that looks like it just survived a flood. There are many unpleasant ways to buy things from the internet, but nothing crawls in your gut and dies like logging into Facebook. This is also exacerbated by the fact that contacting strangers for deals is not just done in Facebook Messenger, but in an easy to miss sub-tab of Facebook Messenger, thus confusing any person you would theoretically wish to contact. Even though Meta owns Instagram and WhatsApp, it boggles my mind that such a clearly broken site as Facebook still has perceived value and is allowed to operate the way it is.</p><h3>It makes me realize how much I miss what Craigslist and junk stores used to be.</h3><figure><figcaption>I should have never doubted you. Credit: Craigslist.</figcaption></figure><p>In an ideal world, none of us would have ever left Craigslist, but unfortunately Craigslist as an ecosystem can be a mixed bag. This is a shame, because the actual experience of using Craigslist rocks – it doesn’t lie to you (although the people do) and it treats you like an adult, allowing you to have precise control over what you are searching for. There are still deals to be had, but a lot of the time if you are on Craigslist you probably know what your stuff is worth. The golden years of Craigslist feel distant. Perhaps some of this is the convenience of not just Facebook Marketplace, but also competing marketplaces like Mercari and Offerup. Part of it feels like they never got over <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/23/596460672/craigslist-shuts-down-personals-section-after-congress-passes-bill-on-traffickin" target="_blank">the loss of the personals section</a> following the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/13/17172762/fosta-sesta-backpage-230-internet-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passing of FOSTA-SESTA</a>, an ineffective bill package that did nothing except make the lives of sex workers actively more dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook Marketplace’s dominance is made worse by the fact that many of the good thrift and junk stores I used to go to are long dead. There are a few holdouts I still frequent and love, particularly far away from the city center, but the ones that remain are often overpriced and over-curated. A good junk store should look like a hoarder’s house that just so happens to have a cash register set up. It should smell like water damage and black mold. These kinds of junk and vintage stores are too low margin to exist in any place with high commercial rent. What’s more, the topography of most cities has been thoroughly mapped – everywhere is a known quantity ruined by overexposure. This is not Facebook Marketplace’s fault. But every single time I log into it, I am reminded of the joy of digging through crates and getting low level lung damage to find a jewel. Maybe one day, if the real estate market collapses violently enough, we will return to those days.</p><figure><figcaption>This is what bliss looks like: The Thing in Greenpoint. Credit: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cv4499yrPwW/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Thing.</a></figcaption></figure><p>None of this is a recommendation for Facebook Marketplace. This is an unfortunate statement of where we are at. You can buy some incredible stuff on that site (I do regularly) but every single time you do, it will take a little part of you. To be on Facebook Marketplace is to experience that feeling of trying to run through mud that permeates every single engagement-optimized platform, that lack of precision that feels like your mind is slipping. Maybe Marketplace should be reformed, but honestly it’s probably best if it continues to spiral due to neglect until the entire thing becomes so precarious that nobody logs on any more.&nbsp;</p><p>I pray that one day we will all be forced to return to Craigslist. But until then, there’s a guy near me with a pretty good looking vintage bookshelf and I hope he remembers to check his inconveniently-placed Marketplace inbox.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
