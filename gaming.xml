			<p>Today, FromSoftware <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916855058097938564" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that global sales of its most acclaimed game, Elden Ring, have topped 30 million units. The news comes three years and a couple of months after the February 2022 launch of the open world RPG, which later won many Game of the Year awards (<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-22-best-games-of-2022-and-most-anticipated-of-2023-from-staff-and-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including ours</a>). Elden Ring also received a perfect score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from reviewer Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>I tried hard to find any faults in Elden Ring, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find any outside of some technical issues that the developers could fix via patches. I firmly believe that perfection doesn't exist and that it is always possible to improve, but I really couldn't think of anything that Elden Ring could have done better. As such, the game wholly deserves a perfect score, an honor I would have given only to a couple of other modern games, not only for its extremely high quality but also for what it accomplished with its open world and for how it will surely influence video games as a whole in the future.</em></p>
<p>The combination of the perfected Soulslike formula in an open world and the worldbuilding by G. R. R. Martin enthralled millions of fans, who finally got more content last year with the release of the big <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a>. FromSoftware hasn't provided updated sales figures for the DLC, but we know from a previous report that Shadow of the Erdtree had sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-sold-5-million-units-in-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five million copies in just the first three days on the market</a>. At this rate, it's likely to be approaching ten million, for a potential attach rate of one-third.</p>
<p>More Elden Ring is coming soon to fans, albeit with a wholly different flavor. The cooperative multiplayer spin-off Nightreign is set to launch in about a month, and the developers have just <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the official PC system requirements. Meanwhile, you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our hands-on preview from the recent beta test</a>.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has also <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a brand-new IP called The Duskbloods, which will be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2. They later clarified to worried fans that Nightreign and The Duskbloods (which also features multiplayer) <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are not a hint at the studio's desire to abandon single player games</a>.</p>

                <p>In the wake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> launching day on on Game Pass recently, some wondered if the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/" data-ref-id="1100-6531155">1 million sales figure</a> could have been even higher had it not launched into the subscription service. This is not a new debate, as people have been discussing the economical merits of Game Pass for years, but Expedition 33 (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/" data-ref-id="1100-6531155">and Oblivion Remastered</a>) coming to Game Pass recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">reignited the chatter.</a></p><p>Palworld communications and publishing boss John "Bucky" Buckley <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1916636430992052706" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">weighed in on social media</a>, writing that Expedition 33 is just the latest game to be "unwittingly dragged" through online discussions about Game Pass. Buckley said he has more knowledge than most on this topic given Palworld launched day one into Game Pass back in 2024 to great success.</p><p>"I'll just say yes, yes it is very worth having your game on Game Pass," he said.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1916710392778350762" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow-up post</a>, the developer reminded people that he's speaking from the perspective of an independent game developer, so his comments should be understand from that context. Buckley said he has no experience in the AAA space and can't speak to "what sort of deals are cooked up there."</p><p>But Buckley said Palworld developer Pocketpair has brought two games already to Game Pass--Palworld and Craftopia--and the studio is "very happy with both."</p><h2><strong>"Subscriptions are certainly not THE future of gaming"</strong></h2><p>Much of the discussion around Game Pass has centered on whether or not a subscription service like Game Pass could take over and become the dominant form of game consumption in the future. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella said he doesn't see that happening, at least not soon.</p><p>He <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lnsxkebdjk24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed out</a> that spending on video game subscription services in the US experienced growth in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID and a little more at the end of 2024 thanks to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass. But in general, spending on subscription services has been "basically flat" lately.</p><p>As such, Piscatella said, "Subscriptions are certainly not THE future of gaming (although they can continue to be part of it)."</p><p>Not everyone is as optimistic about Game Pass as Buckley from Pocketpair when it comes to launching games into the service. Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said this kind of strategy for big new releases has never made sense, and instead represents a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">"lost opportunity" for a game sale.</a></p><p>Take-Two might consider bringing older titles to Game Pass, like Take-Two recently did by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-and-enhanced-version-out-now-on-game-pass/1100-6530881/" data-ref-id="1100-6530881">bringing GTA 5 back to Game Pass</a>, but for new releases, it doesn't make business sense for Take-Two, Zelnick said. Take-Two has one of the most highly anticipated games of all time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, coming up soon, and no one should expect it to come to Game Pass at launch or soon thereafter. Experts believe the game could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and drive $3 billion in revenue in its first year alone</a>, so it's not hard to understand why Take-Two wouldn't want to put the game into a subscription service out of the gate, or ever.</p><p>Every company operates differently and has different goals in mind, and Take-Two's business approach doesn't have to line up with what other companies are doing.</p><p>For example, Rebellion just recently launched Atomfall into Game Pass on day one, and it led to Atomfall experiencing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-release-atomfall-is-devs-most-successful-game-in-32-years/1100-6530519/" data-ref-id="1100-6530519">biggest debut for any game in Rebellion's 32-year history. </a> A key thing to know here, however, is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925">Microsoft paid Rebellion for this</a>, thus mitigating some of the cannibalization risk. Rebellion's own CEO said the company might have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925">lost out on game sales by launching into Game Pass</a>, but on balance, it was the right thing for his company in this particular situation.</p><p>Even Microsoft itself has admitted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-does-decrease-base-game-sales-microsoft-says/1100-6511473/" data-ref-id="1100-6511473">games that launch into Game Pass are known to experience decreased game sales.</a></p><p>This discussion and debate is not going to be resolved soon, or ever. Game Pass represents <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/" data-ref-id="1100-6498307">a paradigm shift in the gaming landscape</a>, and was always going to elicit passionate responses from fans and pundits.</p>

			<p>Like many other creators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-is-working-on-a-game-that-might-or-might-not-be-nier/">Yoko Taro</a>, creator and director of Nier Automata,&nbsp;fears that generative AI technology will advance to the point where it could replace game creators.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40366">Famitsu</a>, Taro admitted his fears that game developers and creators could find themselves out of work in the next five decades, with how generative AI technology is evolving.</p>
<p>While speaking to Yoko Taro, Kotaro Uchikoshi, and Jiro Ishii, the topic of generative AI came up regarding how it could influence the video game industry and what its impact will be on creative industry's overall.</p>
<p>Uchikoshi began saying, "There are<em>&nbsp;a lot of new games I want to create, but with AI technology evolving at such a high speed, I fear that there is a possibility that AI-generated adventure games will become mainstream</em>."</p>
<p>Taro added, "<em>I, too, believe that game creators may lose their jobs because of AI. There's a chance that in 50 years, game creators will be treated like bards...I think that in the future, we will move from an era where we have to imitate the style of our favorite creators to an era where we can have our favorite scenarios generated.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>AI will determine the preferences of users and skillfully generate route branchings that they would want to read, and the recommendation capabilities will continue to improve</em>."</p>
<p>It's understandable that Taro would have these fears, as it is for any creative to share these concerns, though it's not an inevitable fate. Generative AI may be constantly improving, but it's still a pipe dream to imagine that it would, in any genuine way, replace the best artists of our time. For video games, Yoko Taro is one of the best artists in the industry.</p>
<p>He'll still be regarded as such 50 years from now, and there will be a whole new crop of creators pushing the industry forward. Generative AI technology can and will improve as much as possible. Still, it won't ever be able to create anything new in the same way artists like Yoko Taro can.</p>

Great news, fans of suffering in company. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>’s PC system requirements are upon us. If you have at least 30 GB of storage, 12 GB of RAM, a processor or graphics card from approximately this decade, and some willing or easily subjugated friends to serve as co-op partners, then you <em>too</em> will be able to savour the experience of getting your arse chewed off by a three-faced wolf made of swords and fireballs. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Those minimum specs, without further ado:
</p>
<blockquote><p>

Operating System - Windows 10
</p>
<p>
Processor - Intel Core 15-10600 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500
</p>
<p>
Memory - 12GB RAM
</p>
<p>
Graphics - Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3 GB or AMD Radeon RX 580 4 GB
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And here are some recommended PC specs, for you cosmopolitan elites who don’t enjoy getting your arse chewed off unless you can see all of your arse textures in pristine detail, with minimal lag. Goodness knows I need a steady frame rate when the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> Centipede Demon is eating my head. Could be a steady frame rate will even help you defeat that Centipede Demon, but come now, don’t be ridiculous. This is a From Software game. Nobody’s ever defeated a From Software boss. No, don't refer me to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> guides section - it's a house of lies. The point of From Software games is to perish in despair. And leave messages describing random objects as dogs.
</p>
<p>
Those recommended specs, anyway:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Operating System - Windows 11
</p>
<p>
Processor - Intel Core 15-11500 or AMD Ryzen 5 5600
</p>
<p>
Memory - 16GB RAM
</p>
<p>
Graphics - Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB or AMD Radeon RX Vega 56 8 GB
</p></blockquote>
<p>
You might be wondering why there are Dark Souls bosses in Nightreign. The answer is that Nightreign is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-to-get-dlc-bosses-and-characters-in-yet-more-evidence-that-its-a-from-extended-universe-game">sort of Elden Ring: Across The Fromverse</a>, with creatures and characters from several previous games. It’s out on 30th May, and will probably be solid work. Personally, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-multiplayer-is-best-when-its-a-secret">I dislike the idea of From making multiplayer a boxfront feature</a>, but I'm consoled by Hidetaka Miyazaki recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-arent-abandoning-single-player-in-favour-of-games-like-elden-ring-nightreign-says-miyazaki">swearing on his mum</a> that the developers will carry on making singleplayer games.

Despite middling ratings and reception when it originally aired in Japan, the anime found new life in North America several years later thanks to its after-school time slot. The show, with its dramatic mech-on-mech action and even more dramatic sci-fi melodrama, almost single-handedly established a foothold for the entire Gundam universe in the West. In the process, it created an entirely new generation of Gundam fans eager for more, helping to bring more Gundam shows overseas and creating a new market for the franchise's popular Gunpla plastic model kits.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 - Official Gundam Wing Collaboration Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Flash forward to 2025, and Gundam Wing is celebrating its 30th anniversary in a number of ways, among them crossing over with Blizzard's free-to-play shooter with four premium skins that pay homage to some of the show's most popular Mobile Suit designs. Mercy takes on the starring role as Gundam Wing Zero, while Soldier: 76 transforms into the iconic Tallgeese piloted in the show by the masked Zechs Merquise. Ramattra, meanwhile, transforms into the fearsome Gundam Epyon. And, of course, Overwatch's designated edgelord himself, Reaper, adopts the mantle of none other than Gundam Deathscythe.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot had the chance to talk with Overwatch 2 art director Dion Rogers and associate director of product management Aimee Dennett on how the crossover came to be, what it was like to work with Bandai, other Gundam Wing characters didn't make the cut, and the role Gunpla model kits played in both the selection of which Mobile Suits to feature and in the actual look of the skins themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said it has long wanted to collaborate with Gundam, as it's one of the most-requested IPs among the staff. When it reached out to IP-holder Bandai about a potential crossover, the pieces began to fall into place for Gundam Wing's 30th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">Among the first decisions Blizzard had to make was which version of the Gundam Wing's various Mobile Suit designs it wanted to use: those from the show, or ones from its sequel movie, Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz. Blizzard opted for the latter, though it wasn't an easy decision.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was a big debate around do we use the Gundam Wing show designs, or do we use the Endless Waltz film designs?" Dennett said. "So that kind of doubled the amount of possibilities. We did a lot of the characters in both the film design and the show design. We wanted to pick one or the other. We didn't want to do a mix, so we ended up liking the collection of the film."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483286-overwatchxgundamwingreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483286" data-ratio="0.56256684491979" data-width="1870" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483286-overwatchxgundamwingreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483286"></a><figcaption>Some pairings, like Gundam Deathscythe and Reaper, were an obvious choice.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483286-overwatchxgundamwingreaper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When deciding on which Overwatch characters would get skins, Rogers said it came down to a number of factors. First and foremost, the team narrowed down which characters would seem like a strong fit or ones who would seem odd not to include. The team then looked at factors like whether or not a particular character hadn't received a skin in a while or which ones might surprise players to use. Some combinations were obvious for thematic reasons, like Reaper and Deathscythe, or for visual reasons, like Wing Zero and Mercy due to them both having wings.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Blizzard eventually landed on the four Mobile Suits and Overwatch heroes mentioned above for the collaboration, there were others that didn't make the cut. Rogers said he really wanted to make something work for D.Va due to her already being a mech pilot and the opportunity to have her cosplay as one of the show's human characters, but that Blizzard couldn't quite make it work.</p><p dir="ltr">Ana, for example, was originally proposed for Tallgeese but didn't come together. Gundam Heavyarms, a fan-favorite featured prominently in the show, was a shoe-in for the gatling-gun wielding Mauga that also didn't pan out in the end, with Zarya being another potential candidate. Dennett said Mauga's Heavyarms weapon looked "unbelievable," but that overall, the skin just didn't look right on the character.</p><p dir="ltr">"For Heavyarms, he was actually in the lineup," Dennett said. "We tried him on Mauga just because their weaponry is so similar. It's funny, you always have in your head, 'Oh, these are obvious combinations,' but once you see it on paper, it's not. Some don't look as great and some look absolutely amazing. We never planned Tallgeese on Soldier: 76, but once we saw the design, it was the opposite of Mauga Heavyarms. We were like, 'Oh, that looks so cool.'"</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483338-overwatchxgundamwingsoldier76.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483337-overwatchxgundamwingmercy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483330-overwatchxgundamwingramattra%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483329-overwatchxgundamwingreaper%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483338,1300-4483337,1300-4483330,1300-4483329" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483338-overwatchxgundamwingsoldier76.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483337-overwatchxgundamwingmercy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483330-overwatchxgundamwingramattra%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4483329-overwatchxgundamwingreaper%281%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483338-overwatchxgundamwingsoldier76.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483337-overwatchxgundamwingmercy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483330-overwatchxgundamwingramattra%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483329-overwatchxgundamwingreaper%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Deciding which Mobile Suits to ultimately feature as part of the collab was its own process, one Blizzard said was informed not only by fans of Gundam Wing on the Overwatch team but with help from Bandai. The company also collaborated with Blizzard on how each character should look.</p><p dir="ltr">Rogers said Overwatch crossover skins always take the approach of the game's heroes "cosplaying" as their favorite characters. Blizzard initially worked hard on making each skin appear more Gundam and less Overwatch due to player feedback from previous collabs, while still trying to maintain each hero's unique and recognizable silhouette. Bandai came back to Blizzard and instead wanted to see more of each Overwatch hero, like Ramattra, in the designs.</p><p dir="ltr">"Bandai felt like they didn't want us just slapping Gundam Wing on top of Overwatch," Rogers said. "They wanted to really feel super collaborative and they really leaned in on that idea that our characters are still there, but their IP."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483328-overwatchxgundamwingramattra.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483328" data-ratio="0.56273358248799" data-width="1873" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483328-overwatchxgundamwingramattra.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4483328"></a><figcaption>Ramattra as the popular Gundam Epyon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4483328-overwatchxgundamwingramattra.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Bandai also had cold, hard data to help inform which Mobile Suits might be best to include for the collab--specifically, data related to Gunpla model kit sales. A Bandai artist who does artwork for Gunpla kits even contributed the collab's in-game lobby artwork.</p><p dir="ltr">"They didn't mandate we do anything," Dennett said. "It was all suggestions, but they did share a ranking of Gunpla sales and that did factor into the equation…That's not to say Gunpla sales were the factor, but it definitely helped us inform which were a pretty obvious choice and which ones weren't."</p><p dir="ltr">Gunpla played a role in the creation of the actual skins, too. Rogers said the team examined the actual Gunpla models for each Mobile Suit and looked to mimic their internal structure in their respective skin.</p><p dir="ltr">"On the actual models in-game, we tried to match pretty closely the skeletal work, within reason, the internal structure of the Gunpla, onto the actual hero," Rogers said. "Obviously they're human, so you can do only so much, but it's pretty authentic."</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2's Gundam Wing collab goes live April 29, with its four Mobile Suit-inspired skins joining the in-game shop alongside free Gundam-themed challenge rewards, including unique Pachimari weapon charm. Bundles for each skin (and corresponding items like sprays and Play of the Game animations) will cost 2,800 Overwatch Coins, with a mega bundle containing everything going for 5,900 coins.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Meta is laying off over 100 employees from its Reality Labs division, which focuses on VR, AR, and wearable hardware, an unnamed source recently revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">The layoff has primarily impacted Reality Labs employees who were working on VR software for the company's line of Meta Quest headsets, along with employees who were focused on hardware, (including VR headsets), <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/meta-lays-off-more-than-100-staff-across-reality-labs-unit?embedded-checkout=true" rel="nofollow ">the source shared with Bloomberg</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the source--who asked not to be named due to the fact that they were sharing details that had not yet been made available to the public--Meta's goal is to combine and streamline tasks being worked on by the two teams within Reality Labs. In June 2024, it was reported that <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metas-reality-check-inside-the-45-billion-cash-burn-at-reality-labs-125717347.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Labs had lost nearly $50 billion</a> over the course of the previous four years.</p><p dir="ltr">Meta has confirmed that layoffs have taken place, but refused to elaborate or provide details on exactly how many employees had been affected.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size," Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said when asked to comment on the layoffs. "These changes are meant to help studios work more efficiently on future mixed-reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today."</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the content Meta has evidently deemed as expendable includes <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/supernatural/?srsltid=AfmBOop7SLuRXUollXinrhtzlvqbhia_JeGP90rgo-2m0Nn3XnzqZYYn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Supernatural</a>, a VR-based fitness app that gives users access to training content from various fitness coaches and personal trainers, including a stretching program led by Jane Fonda and a "Boxing With Bon Jovi" workout. Supernatural was initially created by Within Unlimited (formerly Vrse), which Meta attempted to acquire in 2021. After a drawn-out fight with the FTC, Meta ultimately won its case and acquired Within (and its products, including Supernatural) in February 2023 for a grand total of $400 million. </p><p dir="ltr">Now, just over two years after the acquisition, Supernatural's future is up in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're deeply saddened to share that these changes have resulted in the loss of some of our incredibly talented team members," Supernatural <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/getsupernatural/permalink/9571469649572696/">said on Facebook</a> last week, adding that the number of workout releases each week would be reduced going forward as a result of the layoffs.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Meta, Clayton claims that the company is "committed to investing in mixed-reality experiences including fitness and games."</p><p dir="ltr">"Our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged," Clayton said.</p><p>The Reality Labs layoffs are far from the first to hit Meta's workforce. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-lays-off-11000-workers-after-stock-slides-nearly-20/1100-6509047/">laid off 13% of its staff</a> (roughly 11,000 employees) back in 2022, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-14/meta-is-planning-to-cut-5-of-lowest-performers-memo-shows" rel="nofollow ">laid off another 5%</a> (~3,600 employees) earlier this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nexon-not-blizzard-will-reportedly-be-making-the-next-starcraft-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A report from Korean outlet <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025042808165242317">MTN</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/new-korean-starcraft-rights-ip-nc-soft">VG247</a>) marks the end of a rights battle between Nexon and Blizzard, seemingly resulting in Nexon, not Blizzard, leading development on the next major entry in the StarCraft series.</p>
<p>Blizzard will be working alongside Nexon to create this new StarCraft game, which could potentially be something besides a new RTS game, if Nexon really wanted to shake things up, that is. RTS games are incredibly popular in Korea, as is the StarCraft series. Moving away from the genre is a huge gamble, since the players who are looking for something to follow up 2013's Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm are probably looking for another RTS game, not a different game set in the StarCraft world.</p>
<p>Nexon didn't just win the ability to make a new StarCraft game in its rights battle though, it also won the opportunity to make a mobile version of Overwatch for Japan and Korea, which has immense potential considering the popularity of mobile games in Asia.</p>
<p>In both cases, this amounts to a big loss for Blizzard, with Nexon now having the keys to what could be a very lucrative castle that Blizzard has arguably fumbled. Of course, we're still a while away from seeing if Nexon will be able to capitalize on its chance here properly, but the potential is still undeniable at this stage.</p>
<p>Especially if Nexon does come out with a StarCraft game that shows how Blizzard's behind in the genre. That both companies collaborated on the game won't matter to players if Nexon can demonstrate that it was their influence that helped make the next game a success, should it be a success, that is.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate for Blizzard that its track record of late has been other studios showing that they can take something Blizzard did and do it better. It arguably happened with <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-adds-in-match-perks-the-biggest-gameplay-innovation-since-overwatch-launched-in-2016/">Overwatch</a> and how hero shooters have evolved since then. Many would argue that's what <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/">Path of Exile</a> has done with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo</a>, and Nexon coming in to do the same with StarCraft would be the next nail in the coffin.</p>

Well… their most willing and cheapest, at least. You’re not the first crew that Roachard has sent down to the surface, and it’s probably best not to ask why…</p>
<p><iframe title="Mycopunk | Reveal Trailer | Four-Player Co-Op Chaos in a Fungal Future ????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nT4jTAMY7m8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So what kind of game is this? Well, it’s a co-op mission-based shooter. There’s shades of Helldivers 2 to one of the missions in the demo, as you are tasked with dropping down a railgun, setting it up, aiming and then blasting a rival space station out of the sky, with a gloriously huge explosion as your main reward, but that’s maybe more of a thematic overlay. The better comparison, though, would be Deep Rock Galactic for the game’s overarching structure.</p>


<p>You can see that most clearly between missions, where you head to Saxon’s orbital dropship and find a little playground to mess around in while you wait for everyone to lobby up or get their gear sorted. There’s a drop pod right in the middle where you pick your mission and head down to the planet surface, but surrounding it in the main hall is a bunch of elevators up to the rafters, a weird live action TV screen, a tesla pole, a blurred out section (which is amusingly strange), and more. But there’s also a bunch of locked doors and rooms that you want to find secret passages to get around to open up a rail-filled firing range, or gain access to race cars which, if you want, you can actually take down on missions with you by just driving it into the dropship!</p>


<p>There’s a scrappy, grungey style to Mycopunk that I love, its visual style reminiscent of games like Sable, Void Bastards and other cel-shaded games of the last half decade, though with the true roots coming from classic graphic novels and comic artistry of Moebius. It’s all about the thin black lines around objects and differently coloured details, adding a noisiness to simple geometry as you get further away from it.</p>
<p>But then there’s the world and the bizarre aliens that you’re battling once you drop down to the surface. Spawning in from gently waving flame tendrils, they’re all about sinew and slimy limbs sprouting from a central point, often holding up weapons and shields to shoot back at you. For smaller enemies, you can just blast away at their core to defeat them, but their limbs are detachable, which comes in mighty useful when fighting the larger many-limbed Abominations, where you can whittle down the number of sniper rifles, shield domes, smashing arms and everything else that they have before attacking their heart. Just beware that smaller enemies can actually pick these weapons back up and start using them, while the Abominations can sprout new arms if you don’t finish them off.</p>
<p>Combat can become pretty frantic because of this, especially as many enemies will tower over you, though in the demo’s missions it rarely felt like we were truly at risk. OK, so Dom did die once or twice, and when that happens your character is split in half, needing teammates to grab the top or bottom and reunite it to revive you.</p>
<p>There’s four characters to choose from, each with a different movement ability and special skill. Wrangler has a rocket lasso that you can use to drag enemies to you or you to fixed objects, and an air dash, Bruiser has a bullet reflecting shield and slam attack, Scrapper can great a grapple pull for all the team to use and a jet pack, and Glider has rockets that heal allies and a wing suit that lets them fly. The Glider has a clear advantage when getting around, letting them race ahead to objectives, but I’m kind of OK with that not being particularly balanced. Just make sure that you play with people that aren’t going to just abandon you, I guess?</p>

<p>The weapons can put their own twist on things as well. Sure, there’s a standard-ish assault rifle, there’s a shotgun with fire damage, there’s a gun that looks an awful lot like one of Halo’s Covenant sniper rifles, but then there’s the Swarm Launcher. This fires out bullets that then hang in the air until you let go of the trigger and then all drop at once. It’s just such an intriguing weapon that feels immediately satisfying to use.</p>
<p>You can quickly race through the ammo it gives you for your weapon, but thankfully you always have two guns and can just switch to the other. Dealing damage with one weapon restocks the ammo of the other, so you won’t be away from your favourite or better gun for too long.</p>
<p>Mycopunk also dips a toe into that pool of looter shooter upgrades, though with an intriguing twist of its own. Sure, you’re grabbing upgrades that are dropped in missions and earning them from successful completions, and then spending currency to unlock them, but the magic comes from how you slot these together. There’s a 7×7 hexagonal grid where you slot these upgrades together, but they’re not taking up a single slot and instead look more like diagrams of chemical compounds. Standard upgrades will just be a few hexes joined up, while Epic and Exotic upgrades will branch out and sprawl, forcing you to figure out how best to slot multiple upgrades together.</p>
<p>These upgrades also try to stay away from being basic percentage power boosts, in favour modifying how weapons behave. OK, so that might be that a burn effect is beefed up, but it can also be that the Swarm Launcher’s bullets now automatically home to enemies or follow your crosshair, or that you have infinite ammo at the cost of shooting too long hurting you.</p>

<p>From its two mission demo, Mycopunk gives a good first impression. It’s light, it’s fast, it’s a little bit scrappy, and there’s that great art style. As it looks first to a Steam Early Access release, there’s definitely room to grow, and to reveal more of what’s planned. There’s multiple regions down on the planet, there’s more mission types to come, more modifiers, more of a narrative to wrap around things. If you’re looking for a new co-op blaster, this is one to keep an eye on.</p>

Chief among them: a door.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potential spoilers for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has to do with the door to the Dark Brotherhood’s Cheydinhal sanctuary entrance. It is at the centre of an iconic moment in Oblivion, one that players who took on the excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/The_Dark_Brotherhood">Dark Brotherhood quest</a> will probably remember well. In the original Oblivion, the glowing door has a heavy mood aesthetic and a relief showing the Night Mother (who members of the assassination obsessed Dark Brotherhood worship) murdering five children. The Oblivion Remastered version of this door has no glow, is light on atmosphere and, weirdly, has two extra children.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see a comparison with accompanying complaint in the reddit post from alvaro-elite, below:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some are upset that this new door is a lot less moody than the one in the original, The Elder Scrolls lore fans are pointing out that the addition of two kids on the relief doesn’t make a lot of sense when you consider what we know about the story of the Night Mother.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This moment in time is meant to represent the Night Mother’s murdering of the five children she conceived with Sithis, the Elder Scrolls deity who represents emptiness and the Void. As the story goes, the Night Mother is murdered by the locals for murdering her kids, which turns her into the immortal Night Mother in the first place. In fact, in Oblivion, the Night Mother’s tomb includes skeletal remains of one adult and five children, reinforcing this lore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why are there seven kids in the scene now, where there were five before? That’s the question fans are asking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have no clue why someone just decided to copy/paste two more children on there,” commented redditor AutisticAnarchy. “I guess the larger texture looked ‘better’ with it or something and the artist working on it didn't understand the lore.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m still really confused by the thought-process behind it,” added TurboDelight. “Where’d the extra kids come from? Who thought to change what the mural was actually depicting? I can understand not knowing what the figures are meant to represent, but why change an objective detail like that?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“inb4 it's a lore retcon because something about the Dark Brotherhood questline in TESVI is based around lore written about these two extra figures, be they her sixth and seventh children or otherwise,” suggested ConstantSignal..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Or the digital artist tasked with recreating the door just didn't know it was meant to depict significant lore and felt the extra figures filled the space better lol.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is whether Bethesda and developer Virtuos will patch Oblivion Remastered to change the door to be lore compliant, or is this is all part of some masterplan that leads into fun story shenanigans in future games or DLC?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Oblivion Remastered, including a report on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-player-escapes-the-confines-of-cyrodiil-to-explore-valenwood-skyrim-and-even-hammerfell-the-rumored-setting-of-the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>a player who managed to escape the confines of Cyrodiil to explore Valenwood, Skyrim, and even Hammerfell, the rumored setting of The Elder Scrolls VI</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil"><u>Interactive Map</u></a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Main Questline</u></a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds"><u>Guild Quest</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide"><u>How to Build the Perfect Character</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion"><u>Things to Do First</u></a>, every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/PC_Cheats_and_Console_Commands"><u>PC Cheat Code</u></a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k9itf6/i_feel_really_very_disappointed_with_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>alvaro-elite / reddit</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>When player housing arrives in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>, players will be retroactively rewarded for past achievements in the form of housing decor, with Blizzard stating "all the time spent in Azeroth is worth something."</p><p dir="ltr">In a new <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24196547" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Blizzard continues to pull back the veil on WoW's long-awaited player housing system, confirming that players will be able to earn housing decor in a number of different ways. Common items like chairs, shelfs, beds, etc. will be widely available from vendors, quests, or other players via the auction house.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Some decor, however, will take more time or effort to unlock. Blizzard described these as "investment" items that may require more time or a significant cost to earn. Housing decor can also come in the form of "Trophies," rewards from long-term achievements or completing specific feats that require skillful play, with Blizzard comparing them to current Mythic+ or raid rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard confirmed that new decor rewards tied to past achievements or feats will be rewarded retroactively the first time a player logs in, and that some decor will be integrated into past expansions for players to unlock using expansion-specific systems or currencies.</p><p dir="ltr">Professions from each expansion, too, will play an important role. All non-gathering professions will be able to craft items for housing, with Blizzard laying out a few examples. Blacksmiths will be able to make objects made primarily of metal, enchanters will be able to create magical objects, and jewelcrafters will craft stone-related objects and gem-studded decorations. Decor from previous expansions will require corresponding reagents and the relevant profession level from that expansion, giving players more reasons to go back into the game's past.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said the goal of decorating a home properly shouldn't be difficult, but it does want to give players some "reach-goals" throughout the game to shoot for.</p><p dir="ltr">"That said, it should be easily possible to kit out your home on day one to strike the vibe you're looking for without too much effort," Blizzard said. "Your decor journey should start out awesome and continue to be that all along the way."</p><p dir="ltr">Other details shared by Blizzard include that decor items are shared across a player's entire account, so if they have four chairs total and use three of them in the house for one of their characters, other characters will only have one left to use. Some items will also be limited to how many copies players can have, with an example being that it doesn't make sense to have nine copies of Onyxia's head mounted on the wall.</p><p dir="ltr">For WoW players looking for something more to do ahead of housing's arrival, Blizzard hinted that leveling up professions from previous expansions, as well as completing meta-achievements, might be goals worth pursuing for those looking to get a head start on decorating their homes.</p><p dir="ltr">This is just the latest glimpse at WoW's player housing system, which still does not have a release date but is said to be coming alongside the arrival of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">MMORPG's next expansion, Midnight</a>. Blizzard previously stressed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">housing in WoW will be available to everyone</a> and won't come with "exorbitant requirements." It also revealed the systems players will be using to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">decorate their homes</a>, as well as how its neighborhood housing system will work.</p>

<p>Elden Ring first released in February 2022, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-review">Aoife Wilson calling it "a glorious game" in Eurogamer's review</a>.

<p>"Much of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is more of the same gruelling beauty - but a shift to explicit storytelling and signposting means its essence as a living, evolving shared text is lost," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Eurogamer's Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>.</p>

            <p>
If you're in the mood for a bit of mayhem, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> would like a word. The publisher's just unveiled Mycopunk, a new limb-slicing, robo-leaping mission-based co-op FPS that's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3247750/Mycopunk/">coming to Steam</a> from developer Pigeons at Play later this year.
</p>
<p>

Mycopunk's very silly action whisks players to a far-flung sci-fi future, where, as employees of space travel company Saxon, they're ordered to go investigate a distant moon and find out why communication has been lost. It's probably not much of a spoiler, given the title, to reveal the answer to that "why" is a fungal catastrophe, and it's up to players - as a rag tag team of extermination robots - to clean it all up.
</p>
<p>
What you have, then, is a mission-based co-op FPS inspired by the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/risk-of-rain">Risk of Rain</a>, with a focus on movement, weird guns, and an outlandish upgrade system that - as Pigeons at Play explained during a recent press showing - is designed to create cool builds that break the game "in a good way". To that end, Mycopunk features four distinct characters, all pretty agile, that offer synergies when used together, but are all powerful enough that they'll work solo. And with no character limits, all four players can use the same character if they desire.

<p>
There's the Wrangler - the most agile of the bunch - that has an air dash and a rocket lasso they can use to yank themselves in different directions, even grab parts or other players. The Bruiser, meanwhile, is more about up close and personal combat; they come armed with a shotgun and projector shield that can push enemies back, deflect bullets, even be slammed into the ground, causing everyone - including allies - to launch violently into the air.
</p>
<p>
The Scrapper, meanwhile, is the most team-orientated character, capable of deploying a pole all players can grapple onto from a distance, while the Glider has a flying wing suit and a rocket salvo that can be used to terrorise enemies or heal friends.
</p>
<p>
This motley crew of amenable scrap starts each mission on the deck of their rickety space ship orbiting the moon, which serves as Mycopunk's hub and a focus of plenty of between-mission silliness. You can visit your boss, for instance - a giant cockroach who'll provide assistance during missions - rail grind in the Recreation Sphere, or just smack each other around trying out different builds in the hangar. You can even summon vehicles - ranging from individual race cars to four-person rides - and take them on missions. Pigeons at Play is even looking to install working arcade cabinets on the ship, but that might not make it in for launch.
</p>
<p>
As for the mission themselves, they're accessed seamlessly from the ship's drop pod, taking players down to the moon's surface and one of several different biomes. As you might expect, missions come in a variety of flavours, such as planetary defense missions where players are required to power up a large gun then use it to take down the ship of a rival company - and additional layers of variety are introduced through random and even weekly modifiers. 
</p>
<p>
The common theme, though, is one of chaotic combat and carnage as players traverse the large open biomes and face off against swarms of alien creatures and mini-bosses. Mycopunk's twist is that enemies are made up different pieces you can chop of individually - something you'll need to do in order to reach the vulnerable core at their centre. However, dismembered limbs can also be a liability, given other enemies can pick up and use them for themselves. And if that wasn't chaotic enough already, there's also talk of other hazards players will need to contend with, including rare weather events, such as sulphur rain that can turn the ground into goo.
</p>
<p>
But if you manage to survive the chaos, finish off enemies, and complete missions, you'll aquire fistfuls of upgrades to install back on the ship. There are upgrades for guns, grenades, even individual characters' abilities, meaning there's a lot of build flexibility. The wrinkle, though, is that upgrades must be installed Tetris-style in a grid of limited size, with the ability to rotate upgrades only becoming available later on.
</p>
<p>
Upgrades span four different tiers - standard, rare, epic, and exotic tiers - and provide a wide range of effets. They can increase grenade charging speeds, for instance, turn grenades into cluster bombs, imbue weapons with infinite ammo that'll start burning you if you hold fire down too long; you'll find upgrades that let you shoot double the bullets, or charge up ammo then fire it all out at once, and on it goes. And given 40 upgrades can be installed for every weapon, build tinkers should have a whale of a time.
</p>
<p>
And big plans are afoot for Mycopunk post-launch, with Pigeons at Play already thinking about new narrative content, new weapons, new enemies and enemy parts, and new upgrades - with the studio saying it wants to build the latter based on player's desires. Devolver hasn't yet revealed when Mycopunk will launch, beyond a vague "2025", but if you're suitably intrigued, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3581750/Mycopunk_Demo/">Mycopunk demo is coming to Steam</a> soon.

			<p>New Battlefield 6 footage leaked online, providing a new look at the impressive destruction elements of the new entry in the series, ground vehicles, massive maps, and more.</p>
<p>The new footage, recorded during a recent alpha playtest conducted via the new testing environment Battlefield Labs, provides a great look at some of the features and mechanics that will be found in the next entry in the series, which has yet to be officially announced. The destruction mechanics, in particular, look quite impressive, as does the jet gameplay set in a map that looks outright massive.</p>

<p>The destructible elements have always been a very important part of the Battlefield experience, and they will be just as important as in the yet-to-be-officially-announced Battlefield 6. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/">Earlier this month</a>, the development team provided an update on them, saying that their goals for destruction are <em>"centered around adding further gameplay depth by allowing you to reshape the environment and transform your surroundings toward a tactical advantage."</em>&nbsp; As highlighted by the new leaked gameplay, destruction is being designed around easily identifiable visual and audio language that will allow players to immediately understand what can be destroyed and altered, creating an intuitive and rewarding environment that players can easily shape.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 is currently in development for unspecified platforms. A release date has yet to be confirmed, but the game should launch before the end of publisher Electronic Arts' fiscal year (March 2026).</p>

			<p>The Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916839982842450100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC system requirements</a> have been revealed today, detailing the system specifications needed to run the game at launch.</p>
<p>As expected for a multiplayer game aiming to get as many players on board as possible, the next game developed by FromSoftware is not going to be particularly demanding, as the developer recommends dated CPUs like the Intel Core i5-11500 and AMD Ryzen 5 5600 and GPUs like the GTX 1070 and Radeon RX Vega 56 to play the game, although it's not specified what resolution and framerate should be expected with the recommended specifications. Elden Ring Nightreign will also not require a lot of free storage space, as the game will only be 30 GB in size.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The minimum and recommended PC specifications for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> are now available. <a href="https://t.co/pgfsTZzO1M">pic.twitter.com/pgfsTZzO1M</a></p>

<p>When Elden Ring Nightreign was announced<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/"> last year</a>, I wasn't particularly excited about its multiplayer approach, but the Closed Network Test held earlier this year made me more interested in the game. The experience was extremely easy to get into and fun, especially when all involved players properly worked together, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>The basics of Elden Ring Nightreign are really straightforward. From the iconic Roundtable Hold, players can decide to undertake expeditions with three other players, picking one of four Nightfarers, which will become eight in the launch version, all coming with unique special abilities, before getting thrown into one of the game's maps, where they need to survive for three days. At the end of the third day, the squad will get to fight one of the main bosses and will be rewarded with relics that represent the game's permanent upgrade system, which improves characters with a variety of different perks. Relics can also be obtained if the squad fails to get to the third day and defeat the final boss, so players still get something for taking part in expeditions.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 30th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-sales-top-30-million-bandai-namco-announces.1175421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's time once again to cast your gaze to the Lands Between, as publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware have revealed another major&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>sales milestone has been passed.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916855058097938564" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has managed to pass the 30 million sales mark, which means the open-world Soulslike action RPG has picked up another five million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">since June last year</a>.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this figure refers to sales across all platforms, and it also appears to include both digital and physical shipments. Additionally, the figure doesn't include sales for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">hit five million after just three days</a>&nbsp;on its release last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-sales-30m-cliff.jpg?itok=3_--U5rJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-sales-30m-cliff.jpg?itok=Nbh0jMGK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has managed to cross the 30 million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say that by any metric, this new milestone further cements&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s remarkable success. The figure puts the game in the same league as Warner Bros' phenomenally popular&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">crossed the same milestone back in November</a>.</p>

<p>Given&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s huge success, then, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's decision to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">create a followup to the game</a> in the form of the multiplayer-focused&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>makes a lot of sense, at least from an intellectual property-focused perspective.</p>

<p>Even if you're not feeling up to trying out&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s formula-departing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-inspired gameplay, though, you needn't fret.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is also making its way to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a> this year, complete with the&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>expansion and some special new armor.</p>

<p>The game isn't even the only FromSoftware title in development for Nintendo's new console; it's joined by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The Duskbloods</em></a>, a PvPvE-focused title coming to the new machine in 2026.</p>




<p>While you wait for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>to land on Switch, you can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/elden-ring/9p3j32ctxlrz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-dev-says-community-built-on-lies.1175418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular Wii homebrew tool Wii Homebrew Channel has been shut down, and its developers have launched an excoriating attack on the originators of the software on which the channel is (or was) based.</p>

<p>As spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557212509478946" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OatmealDome</a>, the Wii Homebrew Channel <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow/hbc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> has now been archived, and homebrew group Fail0verflow has blamed the shutdown on the discovery that the libogc library, on which Wii Homebrew Channel is based, contains stolen code.</p>

<p>According to Fail0verflow, "large portions of libogc were stolen directly from the Nintendo SDK (software development kit) or games using the Nintendo SDK". The group says it "thought that at least significant parts" of the library "were original", and so "reluctantly continued to use the project".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-github.jpg?itok=WcPtCnIt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-github.jpg?itok=KWi5liHs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is what you'll find if you visit the Wii Homebrew Channel GitHub page (at time of writing).</figcaption></figure><p>However, Fail0verflow says it was recently revealed that certain parts of libogc were "stolen from RTEMS", an open-source real-time operating system for which the library "remove[d] all attribution and copyright information".</p>

<p>According to the group, libogc's developers' actions go "far beyond ignorance about the copyright implications of reverse engineering Nintendo binaries" and stray into "outright deliberate, malicious code theft and copyright infringement".</p>

<p>Fail0verflow says libogc's developers are "not interested in tracking this issue, finding a solution, [or] informing the community of the problematic copyright status of the project", going as far as to say the Wii homebrew community as a whole is "built on top of a pile of lies and copyright infringement".</p>

<p>As OatmealDome further <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557214904430754" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a>, libogc serves as "the core of all homebrew apps" when it comes to GameCube and Wii homebrew solutions, so Fail0verflow's accusations aren't small potatoes in this regard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamecube-libogc-homebrew.jpg?itok=0DIBWMLl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamecube-libogc-homebrew.jpg?itok=2n6xU0zE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>libogc also forms the basis of GameCube homebrew.</figcaption></figure><p>The shutdown of the Wii Homebrew Channel, or rather the cessation of ongoing development, is a massive blow to the Wii homebrew scene, but unfortunately, Fail0verflow says it can't encourage further development as it's "impossible to legally and legitimately compile this software".</p>

<p>Some might say Fail0verflow is being hypocritical given emulation is a common usage for Wii homebrew software, but I don't think that's entirely fair. Modding a Wii with homebrew software is far from illegal; it's playing copyrighted games or software that crosses that particular line.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll have to wait and see what impact this has on the Wii homebrew scene as a whole, but it's not likely to be a positive one. Stay tuned for more.</p>

        <p>Hello darkness my new friend.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
At long last, dark mode is finally available on RPS. We’ve wanted to bring a dark mode to the site for ages, and many of you have been politely, passionately, and persistently asking for it for quite a while. Thank you for your patience while we reconfigured our stylesheets.
</p>
<p>
You’ll find a new toggle in the site's footer which allows you to switch between light and dark modes at your leisure. Choose what works best for you. Set it to "Auto" and the site will match whatever colour preferences you have set in your computer or phone's operating system. We'll remember your settings for next time, too.
</p>
<p>
We’ve tested the new theme across the site, from long reads to hardware breakdowns to the blessed comment section, but you might spot the odd bug. If anything looks weirdly luminous or hauntingly invisible, feel free to let us know.
</p>
<p>
As ever, thanks for reading, supporting, and enjoy the new look (and extra battery efficiency).
