In celebration, Sandfall Interactive took the stage to announce that its previously-announced DLC for the game is out...now. Right now!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We learned back in October that this update - which is free, by the way - was happening, we just didn't know when. At the time, Sandfall said it would include a new dungeon, enemies, bosses, and more, new language localizations, new costumes, and "even more surprises." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also shared the following image at the time, which seems to hint at what story the DLC might cover...and we've got a few guesses from staring daggers at it, but we'll let you speculate yourselves. Or, just go play it now.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/unnamed-5-1759855788093-1765512708622.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the news, Sandfall dropped a "Thank You" update trailer that seems to cover a little more of what to expect. There's a colorful new environment full of toys, balloons, and assorted bits and bobs that seems to be an Act 3 location, and comments from Verso about how "Kids have quite the imagination," suggesting that this has something to do with- okay, I don't want to spoil it. It's an Act 3 thing. If you get it, you get it. We get a look at a number of new fantastical enemies, some of which look pretty brutal, and several new costumes that seem to include Maelle in a top hat. There's also a <em>sick</em> photo mode that lets you get down to a granular level of detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer concludes with a rather creepy-sounding clip of Esquie, and a quick glimpse of a boss fight - is that Simon, again?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the full list of what the update includes, per Sandfall's press release:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to 'Verso’s Drafts’ - a whimsical storybook adventure with ties to a young Verso. Players will encounter celebratory Gestrals, surprising new locations and an encounter with a sinister, powerful presence... </em></li><li><em>New music tracks by Lorien Testard, the award-winning composer behind the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack, which are also now available on digital streaming platforms.

It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,032 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,060 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via Steam and <a title="Companies > Epic Games [354 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/epic-games">Epic Games</a> Store in spring 2026. Users who own <em>TankHead</em> for PC via Epic Games Store will receive <em>TankRat</em> as a free upgrade.<span id="more-1014638"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Kepler Interactive:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Fact Sheet</strong></p><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In the aftermath of a war that reduced the world’s most fantastic city to ash, the Event Containment Area (ECA) stands as a monument to humanity’s ambition and ruin.</p><p>A wasteland of twisted metal husks, the remnants of mankind’s greed spread like mechanical cancer across the world. Only steel remains, humans having to project their consciousness into mechanical “Shells,” powerful drones that can salvage and control armored tanks of a lost age.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You are Whitaker, a Sleepwalker—a digitized consciousness inhabiting a Needle, a hardened drone built to endure the storms and <a title="Genres > Horror [792 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s of the ECA. And your <a title="Genres > Survival [495 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> will be earned, one kill at a time.</p><p>Welcome to the end of the world, it’s time to hunt TankRats.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Become What You Break</strong> – Shift seamlessly between the agile Needle and powerful combat Tanks as you explore the ECA’s Dead Zone. You must traverse what remains of a once advanced society to scavenge all the materials you can to upgrade your machine. Dismantle enemies, strip their wreckage for weapons, armor, and tech, and graft their parts onto your own rig. Every trip through the wasteland is a chance to rebuild, respec, and come back stronger.</li><li><strong>Tear Through <a title="Platforms > Meta [165 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>l</strong> – Blast through swarms of corrupted drones and mech-monsters in fast-paced, brutal vehicular combat across shifting battlefield conditions. The Dead Zone’s greatest terrors are the TankRats, wandering remnants of lost Sleepwalkers, twisted by the Shroud and time itself. You’ll need to exploit every weakness to bring these metal titans down. The only way out is through, and the only way through, is to destroy everything in your path.</li><li><strong>Rise Above the Ruins</strong> – The fabled city in the sky, Highpoint. A whispered truth buried in the ashes of a lost civilization. You don’t know why, but you know with absolute clarity that the only reason you fight is to uncover the truth behind the Shroud, a radioactive storm that warps time, memory, and reality itself. What are you willing to give to make it to the promised land, and what will you do if you don’t like the truth you find there?</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_1014642"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>■ FAQ</strong></p><p><strong>What if someone already owns <em>TankHead</em> on Epic Games Store?</strong></p><p>If you already own <em>TankHead</em> on the Epic Games Store, you will receive a free upgrade once <em>TankRat</em> releases, giving access to all the new features and content. The game’s page will be updated to reflect this update and name change later in Spring 2026.</p><p><strong>Why the name change?</strong></p><p>We changed the name because the game has evolved so much, and we wanted to signpost that really clearly. We believe it provides a clearer throughline to the scavenger-driven identity at the heart of the player character, and an ode to the colossal enemies you’ll be fighting to the death against on your journey through the wasteland.</p><p><strong>What can be expected for <em>TankRat</em> compared to <em>TankHead</em>?</strong></p><p>A lot of work went into <a title="Genres > Crafting [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> <em>TankRat</em> as the ultimate evolution of <em>TankHead</em>. We added more story content, more bosses, more biomes, more customization options, a refined battle system as well as many more surprises that we can’t wait to tell you more about. Stay tuned for more information on our channels!</p><p><strong>Is <em>TankRat</em> single-player or <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [658 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>?</strong></p><p>TankRat is single player.</p><p><strong>What languages will <em>TankRat</em> support?</strong></p><p><em>TankRat</em> will be voiced in English, and feature subtitles in French, German, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and Simplified Chinese.</p><p><strong>Who are the main characters in <em>TankRat</em>?</strong></p><p>Whitaker is a Sleepwalker, someone who has the capacity to teleproject his conscience into machines. This is the only way humans can survive in the wastelands of the ECA. Driven by a thirst to reach Highpoint, he will fight to the end to uncover the mechanical mysteries of the world.</p><p>In his journey, Whitaker is guided by Cyril, a mysterious and charming “fixer,” occupying a mechanical body. Cyril probably knows more than he shares, and his lure for profit makes him a difficult character to trust.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

        <p><em>Orbitals</em> captures the warmth and style of classic Japanese anime, brought to life with authentic detail and clear reverence by the Tokyo-based development team at Shapefarm. The artists and developers at the studio have lovingly created a brand-new original world inspired by retro anime from the early ’90s and brought the artform to life in a way never before seen. Additionally, the developers have partnered with Studio Massket, the animation house behind hundreds of some of the most beloved and popular Japanese anime, to create hand-crafted cutscenes for the game for that extra layer of authenticity for fans of the anime medium. Combined with both full Japanese and English audio dubs, Shapefarm intends to honor the anime artform with a cooperative playable adventure that fans can fall in love with.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

<p>"I am going to be in Tomb Raider," the actress revealed to <a href="https://x.com/DEADLINE">Deadline</a> while on the red carpet for her new film, Avatar: Fire and Ash. "I'm very excited. The scripts are incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty, as we have come to expect from Ms Waller-Bridge."</p>
<p>Weaver added she has been a fan of Waller-Bridge's for a while now, so is "delighted" to be a part of the Tomb Raider series.</p>
<p>The actress also revealed the character she will play is called Wallace. "A famous English name," she closed, "not always very popular, wouldn't you say."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>’s promised free expansion is available to download right now, developers Sandfall Interactive have announced at this evening’s Trial by Keighley, aka the Game Awards. </p>
<p>The update includes new enemies and bosses, a new dungeon, enemies, new language support and costumes. The extra environment appears to be toy-themed and accessible later on in the game. If you’re concerned about spoilers (I myself still haven't finished this), I would skip the below trailer. I would also skip the below trailer if the prospect of death by lollipop strikes you as a bridge too far even for Clair Obscur, a game of many disarming eccentricities.

<p>The update includes a photo mode, all the better to check out the assortment of extra headgear and outfits. Why don't I wear a top hat like that, eh? Because I have neither the money nor the audacity, that's why. Anyway, let me weep in peace. Catch the full feature breakdown below, care of my old friend Monsieur Blockquote.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to 'Verso’s Drafts’ - a whimsical storybook adventure with ties to a young Verso. Players will encounter celebratory Gestrals, surprising new locations and an encounter with a sinister, powerful presence…</li>
<li>New music tracks by Lorien Testard, the award-winning composer behind the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack, which are also now available on digital streaming platforms. You can listen to the playlist on YouTube here.</li>
<li>Challenging boss battles for late-game players to overcome within the Endless Tower. Besting these powerful adversaries will reward players with powerful new Pictos, costumes and gear.</li>
<li>A much-requested official Photo Mode, allowing players to pause the action and commemorate their favorite moments from the game’s story and battles.</li>
<li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19. </li>
<li>Added FSR 4 support, including AMD temporal upscaling for sharper visuals and frame generation for smoother gameplay on compatible GPUs.</li>
<li>New Quality of Life improvements, other new features and further improvements to the game’s performance across platforms, including on handheld PC systems. </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>We here at Rock Paper Vinegar Dot Com regard the awards section of the Game Awards as so much flaking greasepaint for a very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-reportedly-charges-over-1-million-for-a-three-minute-trailer-while-just-a-minute-can-run-up-nearly-half-of-that?preview_key=pMAvYLie7_Gilad_GyovTCtVBAFwDlQZ&amp;preview_device=desktop">expensive</a> marketing machine, but I will grudgingly note that Clair Obscur won a lot of gongs tonight, and that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">deserves the praise</a>. Today’s update looks to be a fitting victory lap.

Fittingly, Flute Guy once again got his moment in the spotlight this year, showing off his strangest flute variant yet.</p><p>Ever since he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26w76OmzEKI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went viral in 2022</a> for enthusiastically playing the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 medley on a strange-looking tenor flute, Eustache has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528392/" data-ref-id="1100-6528392">been a regular feature of The Game Awards</a>. Each year he seems to get more dedicated airtime during the orchestral section, playing bigger and more unusual flutes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621613" data-ratio="0.56235294117647" data-width="1700" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621613"></a><figcaption>Pedro Eustache playing a strange new flute during the Clair Obscur tribute</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg"></figure><p>2025, of course, is no different, with Eustache even getting his own announcement video on The Game Awards' <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1997327335725596961" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media pages</a> in the lead up to the show. His appearance in the orchestral section didn't disappoint, with his flute part highlighted through the Death Stranding 2 arrangement, and his part in the Clair Obscur section played on a strange new flute that appears to be made out of PVC pipe.</p><p>Flute Guy, and the whole orchestral mix, added some needed drama to one of the most obvious Game of the Year announcements The Game Awards has seen. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 became the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">most award-winning game</a> in the awards show's history when it picked up nine awards, including Game of the Year. It had previously secured the record for most nominated game, receiving 13 total nominations. Clair Obscur has also been revealed as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">GameSpot's Game of the Year for 2025</a>.</p><p>For all the rest of the winners, losers, and surprises from The Game Awards 2025, check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">all the biggest announcements</a> from the show, as well as our roundup of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">all the 2025 winners</a>.</p>

			<p>Former Criterion developers who worked on series like Need for Speed and Burnout at Fuse Games have announced a different kind of fast-paced arcade racer at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a> with Star Wars: Galactic Racer, a game that doesn't seem to entirely rely on pod racing with a mix of pods and classic speeders, arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>Developed by Fuse Games and published by Secret Mode, Star Wars: Galactic Racer was the second Star Wars game to be revealed at The Game Awards tonight, and is the sixth Star Wars game in development that we know about.</p>



<p>Compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/">Star Wars Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kotor-remake-developer-revealed-full-kotor-ii-remake-also-planned/">Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-a-single-player-rpg-spiritual-successor-to-knights-of-the-old-republic/">Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic (the other newly announced Star Wars game)</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-set-in-the-clone-wars-and-due-next-year/">Star Wars Zero Company</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/">the third Star Wars Jedi game</a>, Galactic Racer appears to be bringing a bit more variety to the Star Wars games we have to look forward to.</p>

<p>"<em>For us, </em><em>Star Wars</em> has always represented the power of wonder—and <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> is one of its most thrilling expressions," said Matt Webster, chief executive officer at Fuse Games, in a press release. "<em>With Star Wars: Galactic Racer, we wanted to reinvent what a racing game can be: adventurous, spectacular and exhilarating. We want every race to feel alive with dynamic risk-reward choices, and every victory to feel incredible</em>."</p>



<p>Vice president and general manager at Lucasfilm, Douglas Reilly, added, "<em>From the beginning, Star Wars has drawn inspiration from racing culture, from podracing to high-speed chases across the galaxy. With Star Wars: Galactic Racer, the team at Fuse Games has captured that spirit and elevated it into a wholly new form of racing adventure. We can't wait for fans to experience it.</em>"</p>



<p>You'll be able to build and customize your ride as you join the Galactic League to rise from your state as a lone racer in the Outer Rim to a household name among racing fans across the galaxy. It's a runs-based racing game "<em>where no two runs are the same</em>." </p>

It's September 9, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news came alongside a brand new trailer for the game, which showed off more of the game's story and combat. We get a look at Phantom Blade's mysterious metal masked antagonist stealing a baby and doing some real flashy sword moves, followed by plenty of shots of the protagonist, seemingly a wanted man. He's got some pretty swanky moves himself, highlighting further how cool Phantom Blade's combat promises to be. There's also a young woman who gives the hero a good luck charm, then turns into a weird hollow monster or something. Lots going on here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We've seen Phantom Blade a number of times since its original announcement, both in the form of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pc-and-ps5-action-rpg-phantom-blade-zero-gets-slick-trailer-but-still-no-release-date">trailers</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phantom-blade-zero-plays-more-like-ninja-gaiden-than-dark-souls">hands-on previews</a>. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phantom-blade-zero-is-a-delightfully-punishing-action-rpg">most recent look at it this past October</a>, we found the game to be delightfully difficult, with our previewer saying, "It never felt cheap; it just demanded more from me. In just over an hour of play, I was easily ten times the player I was when I started. It’s a feeling of achievement that is reserved for the very best action games on the planet. If the rest is anything like what I played at TGS, I feel like there’s a real chance that Phantom Blade 0 might be one of those games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Phantom Blade Zero is a wuxia action RPG by Chinese studio S-Game that follows Soul, an assassin framed for a murder trying to uncover the truth of what happened.

And indeed, the game is set after the Empire's fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a runs-based, high-stakes reinvention of racing born in the lawless Outer Rim of the Star Wars galaxy," an official blurb reads. "With the Empire gone and the galaxy rebuilding, The Galactic League is formed: an underground, unsanctioned circuit where syndicates bankroll chaos and champions are forged. "No Force. No prophecy. Just skill, strategy, and the will to rise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced tonight at The Game Awards 2025, the project will be published by Secret Mode, the newly-independent publisher that previously handled Still Wakes the Deep.

Indeed, at first glance, No Law looks a bit like CD Projekt’s own Cyberpunk 2077, although there are key differences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Law is an open world first-person shooter role-playing game with immersive sim elements, due out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S published by PUBG company Krafton. A release window has yet to be announced.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s set in a cyber-noire called Port Desire, and sees the player assume the role of Grey Harker, an ex-military veteran who left his war-torn life behind for a much more peaceful existence tending his plants. Unfortunately for him, trouble comes knocking, and he must lean on his black ops instincts to survive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neon Giant said to expect a rich story drenched in neon, colorful characters, and big choices to make. If you play through multiple times you’ll find alternate paths and new outcomes. You can mix things up with gameplay, too, focusing on stealth or going in guns blazing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Law is a single-player only game, with no multiplayer, and it has nothing to do with The Ascent, Neon Giant insisted. This is a new fictional world, and from the trailer you can see it’s a more grounded cyberpunk aesthetic, compared to the more sci-fi, alien-packed world of The Ascent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

He’s not just a man with power; he is a man who has to fight for every inch of it. Bringing that energy into 007’s world felt incredible.”</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak added, “Lenny brings an extraordinary presence to 007 First Light. He is a one-of-a-kind performer, with unbelievable charisma, who fits perfectly with the character of Bawma. He captured exactly what we envisioned: a formidable man who commands both fear and loyalty, which will have a profound impact on Bond’s journey into the world of espionage.”</p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>Grammy Award winner Lenny Kravitz has joined the ensemble cast of <em>007 First Light</em> as The Pirate King Bawma, the charismatic and unpredictable leader of a powerful black-market arms network. Featuring the likeness and voiceover work from Lenny Kravitz in a video game for the first time, Bawma will be a figure who blurs the line between ally and adversary in Bond’s journey.</p><p>During The Game Awards, the Pirate King Bawma appeared in a brand-new trailer, holding James Bond as well as Bond’s mentor at MI6, John Greenway, in a delicate situation, aiming to remove any outside interference. Lenny Kravitz takes on the role of Bawma, providing both the voice and physical likeness of the character, his first major performance in a video game. Bawma is the enigmatic leader of Aleph, a vast black-market arms network operating across the Western hemisphere. By 17, he had risen through the ranks of modern piracy, transforming an abandoned ship graveyard in Mauritania into the foundation of his empire. </p><!-- AD: content -->

Another portion of the trailer highlights one of the duo using a levitating beam to help transport some important piece of a puzzle, while the other navigates a series of dangerous platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Not much else is known about the game, only that it's being published by Kepler Interactive and developed by the Tokyo-based developer Shapefarm.

            <p>
Mega Man! It turns out Capcom hasn't forgotten about the blue robo-dude with the 'tude - last seen in his own mainline game seven years ago - after all. The publisher has unveiled a brand-new entry in its beloved action-platformer series, but you'll need to be patient as it's still a while away from release.
</p>
<p>
Mega Man: Dual Override, as Capcom's newly revealed instalment is officially known, takes a similar 2.5D approach to 2018's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mega-man-11">Mega Man 11</a>, marrying the series' classic side-scrolling action to a 3D (and very pastel) artstyle. All this is coming to Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox, and Steam.
</p>
<p>
If you were hoping for any additional information, however, you're out of luck. Capcom's reveal offered a few seconds of presumably early in-game footage and little else. According to the tiny bit of text accompanying its trailer, though, it'll see players "override challenges and blast down legions of robots while springboarding across a new array of futuristic frontiers".

<p>
Mega Man's return is, of course, long overdue, and the main downside to all this is the wait. Mega Man: Dual Override isn't set to release for PC and consoles until 2027 - just in time for the series' 40th birthday.

            <p>The Game Awards 2025 have come and gone, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">Clair Obscur coming away with the coveted GOTY accolade</a>. But, among the awards at the awards show, there was also a very generous smattering of trailers and reveals. And rounding out those trailers and reveals as part of Geoff's big finale was Highguard.</p>
<p>Highguard is a shooter from Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio made up of a number of ex-Respawn developers who worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>. It sees players using blasters and such while also riding on the backs of spectral beasts, which I found quite jarring at first I won't lie. But, unlike quite a few things we saw this evening (morning), Highguard did come as a surprise!</p>
<p>"From the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall, comes Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">Steam page's official description</a>. "Battle rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter."</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for Highguard below.</p>

<p>Mario &amp; Luigi vs. Bowser Jr.</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At The Game Awards, Nintendo and Illumination surprised fans with another look at the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>.</p>
<p>It features Bowser Jr. taking on Mario and Luigi in a very brief teaser. Some not-so-pleasant introductions are exchanged, and before you know it, the younger Bowser is smashing everything in sight. Fortunately, Luigi steps in to save the day (and Mario).</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is scheduled to arrive in theatres next year in <strong>April 2026</strong>. This latest teaser follows the announcement of the new movie in November, along with an official trailer reveal. You can see the first video in our previous story.</p>
<p>This wasn't the only video game movie trailer shared at The Game Awards this year. Capcom also showed off a first-look at its live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter">Street Fighter</a> movie.</p>
