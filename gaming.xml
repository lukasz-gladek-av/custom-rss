              <p><span>When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched this summer, a cheaper, Japanese-only version of the console was made available domestically. Some speculated the more affordable console (which cost around $340 compared to the multi-language Switch 2’s $480) was offered to address a weak yen or the cost of living in Japan, but whatever the reason, it helped: the Switch 2 was Japan’s biggest ever console launch, according to </span><i><span>Video Games Chronicle.&nbsp;</span></i></p> <p><span>In June, the other Japanese gaming behemoth, Sony, said it was keeping an eye on the Switch 2 in terms of competition, but wasn’t all that concerned because of the PlayStation 5’s “differentiated strategy,” </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/606826/sony-ps5-vs-switch-2-sales/"><span>as reported by </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Hideaki Nishini said that the PlayStation 5 was “the best place of play.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“We believe PS5’s level of performance is required to achieve a great experience on big screens. And in this way, we have provided a unique offering to players and creators in this current console generation,” Nishino said.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But over the last few weeks, Sony has displayed a renewed interest in its Japanese market, holding a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049"><span>Japan-centric State of Play on November 11</span></a><span> that focused on games developed in the region, and also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-thats-only-for-japan-2000643085"><span>announced a cheaper PS5 that</span></a><span>, similar to the Switch 2, is only for use in Japan. It’s the first region-locked console Sony has released since the PlayStation 2, and a new report suggests this maneuver may be because Sony is finally considering Nintendo a proper competitor.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000643118" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643118"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643118">©Sony</figcaption></figure> <p><span>According to a report from </span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/playstation-ceo-pushed-through-cut-price-ps5-in-japan-after-seeing-system-slump-against-switch-2"><i><span>Push Square</span></i></a><span> (based on a translation from </span><a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/threads/media-create-sales-week-45-2025-nov-03-nov-09.4147/page-7#post-367685"><span>Install Base user Hartmann</span></a><span>, which lines up with machine translation of the segment), Japanese media outlet </span><a href="https://txbiz.tv-tokyo.co.jp/original2/vod/post_329817"><i><span>TV Tokyo</span></i></a><span> discussed the price drop with local experts, who suggested that Sony wasn’t bothered by PlayStation’s shrinking market in Japan until hearing of Nintendo’s cheaper Switch 2. According to the </span><i><span>TV Tokyo </span></i><span>segment, Sony executives decided to ape Nintendo’s approach, and allegedly approved the PS5 price cut in just four months. The reporters also suggest that Sony president Nishino, who stepped into the role this past April after taking over for Dutch-born Hermen Hulst, felt so strongly about PlayStation’s flagging brand in Japan (Nishino is Japanese) that he helped push the region-specific console to market.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Japanese-only digital version of the PS5 goes on sale on November 21.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A third season of Peacock’s Twisted Metal, based on the PlayStation racing series, has been announced. However, the renewal does come with the news of a change in showrunners.</p>







<p>Debuting in 2023, Twisted Metal loosely adapts the games from the early PlayStation era. Featuring fan-favorite characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sweet-tooth-is-a-violent-man-in-twisted-metal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweet Tooth</a>, the show was a surprise success for Peacock. It helped that the show sported massive talent like Captain America’s Anthony Mackie and Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s Stephanie Beatriz. A second season was quickly greenlit and released earlier this year to decent reviews. Now, Peacock has revealed that the action show is coming back for another season, but not without some creative changes.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Variety first covered the news that Twisted Metal is being <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/twisted-metal-renewed-season-3-david-reed-showrunner-1236584674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">renewed for a third season</a>. Apparently, the second season was a hit for Peacock, being the second returning original scripted season with 993 million minutes watched. However, it isn’t without changes, as show creator and showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith is exiting. The Cobra Kai creator’s reasons for leaving has not been discussed. In his stead, writer and director David Reed will join current showrunners Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. No other details, like casting or release, is available.</p>



<p>David’s resume is quite a good one, from a glance. His most notable project is as a writer for Prime Video’s The Boys, which is releasing its final season in 2026. Other titles he has worked on include Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and Supernatural, among others. While Michael Jonathan Smith’s departure is a sad one, Reed does seem like a great substitute. </p>

And if you’re a fan of board games, you’ll probably want to have an idea of what to expect deal-wise on popular tabletop titles. You’ve come to the right place. I’m the board game editor at IGN, and I’ve been following all the Black Friday board game deals for years. Let’s dive in.</p><p id="buy-1-get-1-half-off-live-now"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Buy 1, get 1 half off - Live now">Buy 1, Get 1 Half Off on Board Games Right Now</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't actually have to wait for Black Friday to save on board games. Right now, both <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7NOL?object_uuid=dbf6e013-25fa-4772-8a91-36f95d8a53bd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdp0jv?object_uuid=dbf6e013-25fa-4772-8a91-36f95d8a53bd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target</a> have sales that get you <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-half-off-board-game-sale-ahead-of-black-friday-2025">half off a board game</a> when you buy one at regular price. This applies to a decent number of popular games for board games, including Catan, Splendor, and Horrified. But tons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">classics</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a> are also eligible, like Scrabble and Mouse Trap.</p><p id="what-games-will-get-discounts"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What games will get discounts?">What Games Will Get Discounts?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to Black Friday board game deals, such a wide swath of games go on sale each year that basically nothing is off the table (please excuse the pun). If this year is like years past, you’ll be able to save on just about every board game on the market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The discounts we saw last year ranged from 20% off games all the way up to 65% off. You could save on popular standards like Azul and Pandemic. You could save on family-friendly games like Exploding Kittens and UNO. You could save on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror-themed board games</a> like Alien: Fate of the Nostromo and Arkham Horror: The Card Game. Whatever games you're interested in, you can likely find something on sale that you'll want to pick up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, for Cyber Monday last year, Amazon ran a “Buy 2, Get 1 Free” sale. Since many of the games were already discounted, that was like a deal on top of a deal. So keep an eye out during Black Friday 2025 for opportunities to stack discounts.</p><p id="which-retailers-will-have-sales"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Which retailers will have sales?">Which Retailers Will Have Board Game Sales?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the retailers where the deals can be found, the main ones to look at are Amazon, Walmart, and Target. If you want to branch out a bit, Barnes and Noble is usually a good place to look for discounts as well. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2025-start-date-and-sale-predictions">Amazon's Black Friday sale</a> kicking off on November 20 this year, that will likely be the first place you should start looking for deals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

<p>If you’ve ever tried to hook an old Nintendo 64 up to a modern HDTV, you know the results can be less than ideal. Assuming your original hardware still works and your flatscreen even has the requisite R/F and/or composite inputs to allow for the connection, the N64’s output will probably look like a blurry mess on a flatscreen that wasn’t designed with those old video signals as a priority.</p>
<p>The Analogue 3D solves this very specific problem very well, with a powerful FPGA core that accurately replicates a Nintendo 64 and well-made display filters that do a good job of approximating that cathode-ray tube glow you remember from decades ago. But the lack of easy expandability limits the appeal of this $250 device to all but the most die-hard fans of original N64 hardware.</p>
<h2>A beauty to behold</h2>
<p>As a piece of physical design, the Analogue 3D is a work of art. The gentle curves of its sleek black shell evoke the original N64 design without copying it, coming in at a slightly smaller footprint and height. Plus, there’s no ugly power brick.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>3D COMPUTER GRAPHICS SYSTEM.</span>
                    <span>

                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>This is a solidly built device, with a nice grippy underside and springy, elegant power and reset buttons. The shell has a lot of small, thoughtful touches, too, like a front power indicator that doubles as a Bluetooth sync button and lights on each controller port to indicate when a wireless controller is connected to that slot (the Hall Effect joysticks on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Analogue-Windows-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DK6VCGBC">8bitdo’s wireless “64” controller</a> are a joy compared to the crunchy mechanical sticks on your old N64 controller).</p>
<p>The one downside to this design is that the hardware can get slightly hot after running for a while, and it emits some noticeable fan noise when stressed. The welcome screen when you first boot the system recommends you give the vents adequate space to breathe, so be careful if you plan to place it directly on the carpet or something.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>I saw the TV glow</h2>
<p>The Analogue 3D’s custom 3DOS software automatically detects the game cartridge you’ve placed into its top-loading slot and displays basic info like player count, developer/publisher, and release date on-screen (you can also load your own custom cartridge images onto an included SD card). The system maintains this info in a scrollable list of every cartridge you’ve ever inserted, allowing for a quick way to browse through your library without the need to dig out your actual cartridges. You do have to plug in the cartridges to actually play the games, though, which limits the usefulness of the on-screen library more than a little bit.</p>



<p>Before you launch a game, you can also configure the Display Mode between five preset options (these can also be swapped during gameplay using controller hotkeys for an on-screen menu). Of these, you’ll generally want to stay away from the “Clean” option, which upscales the N64’s 320×240 image by simply blowing up each individual pixel to fit the display. The result is an incredibly blocky image with lots of jagged edges and blobs of color that refuse to blend well with nearby elements. It’s a look that’s especially unsuited to the low-resolution textures on most N64 games, which exploited the gentle blur of a CRT to create some vivid effects.</p>
<p>Switching over to the “Scanlines” display option helps a bit in rounding out those jagged N64 polygons, but things really start to look better if you activate one of the system’s three different CRT emulation modes. With these, 3DOS does its best to recreate the look of an electron beam actually scanning across the phosphors on an old tube TV. These filters do an admirable job of softening the hard edges of polygons and sprites while subtly and accurately blending the colors on those low-res textures.</p>

          </p>
  </div>

<p>The Analogue 3D has three tube TV emulation modes, each representing consumer CRTs and the kind of Pro/Broadcast Video Monitors you’d usually only find in TV station control rooms. You can go into the menus for each mode and tinker with settings like “beam convergence” and “edge hardness,” and you can toggle N64 hardware effects like anti-aliasing and de-blurring (you can also stretch the 4:3 image to fill a 16:9 display if you’re a specific kind of monster).</p>
<p>In general, though, I didn’t see much upside in this kind of settings tinkering. Using the system’s default “CRT” settings created a visual experience that was surprisingly authentic to the actual CRT sitting in my home office. The only thing really missing is an option to simulate the curve of a classic CRT; the hard square edges of the Analogue 3D output are a bit lacking on that score. But that’s a minor complaint for a filter that does such a good job mimicking an old TV on new display technology.</p>

<h2>Open and shut</h2>
<p>Like previous Analogue hardware, the Analogue 3D uses <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/100dw5h/for_dummies_what_is_fpga_what_is_it_used_for/">FPGA</a> to accurately recreate the inner workings of an N64 at the level of individual logic gates. This time, the Analogue 3D’s Altera Cyclone FPGA sports a whopping 220,000 logic elements. That’s a big step up from the two FPGAs on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/analogue-pocket-review-the-greatest-game-boy-ever-made/">2021’s Analogue Pocket</a>, which have just 49,000 and 15,000, respectively.</p>


<p>That powerful FPGA allows for perfectly accurate and lag-free N64 emulation in all of our tests with original cartridges (Analogue’s Christopher Taber warns us that “flash carts and unofficial 3rd party products can be a bit of a wild card”). But players hoping to emulate other gaming systems with that powerful hardware may run into some problems. That’s because the Analogue 3D doesn’t support the OpenFPGA standard that Analogue itself <a href="https://www.analogue.co/developer">rolled out in 2022</a> as “the future of video game preservation.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>That standard has allowed a vibrant community of OpenFPGA developers to create <a href="https://openfpga-library.github.io/analogue-pocket/">dozens of free “cores”</a> that can recreate everything from classic arcade games to 16-bit consoles with amazing fidelity. Currently, though, those cores will <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/flurry-of-firmware-updates-makes-analogue-pocket-an-even-better-retro-handheld/">only work on the Analogue Pocket</a>&nbsp;and not subsequent hardware like the Analogue 3D or <a href="https://www.analogue.co/duo">2023’s Analogue Duo</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a shame because the OpenFPGA community would certainly be happy to get their hands on the new, larger FPGA in the Analogue 3D to build out core support for even more classic gaming consoles. And we’re sure Analogue 3D owners would be happy to use their purchase to play existing OpenFPGA cores on the big screen, complete with 3DOS’ great display options.</p>

<p>“If we wanted to offer Analogue 3D with OpenFPGA (which is not the purpose or focus of the product), it would require not only a second FPGA, but an even more powerful base FPGA, therefore increasing the price to a price that doesn’t suit our goals,” Analogue founder Christopher Taber <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/analogues-hardware-emulated-nintendo-64-fpga-console-will-arrive-in-2024/">told Ars</a> when the system was first announced back in 2023.</p>
<p>It seems likely that hackers and tinkerers will be able to expand the Analogue 3D’s emulation capabilities in the future. As it stands, though, it’s hard to recommend the hardware when options like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/youtuber-faces-jail-time-for-showing-off-android-based-gaming-handhelds/">Android-based, emulation-focused handhelds</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/building-a-retro-gaming-super-console-with-100-and-a-raspberry-pi-2022-edition/">Raspberry Pi-based emulation consoles</a>, and even (more expensive) <a href="https://retrorgb.com/mister.html">MiSTer FPGA boxes</a> offer able support for much more than just N64 games.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a simple, plug-and-play way to use your original N64 cartridges and accessories on a modern display, the Analogue 3D offers pretty much everything you could hope for. If you want a single device that can handle more, though, you should look elsewhere.</p>

                <p>As of November 18, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Crew is now an included benefit with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. That certainly appears, on its face, like a pretty solid deal, but on the other hand, Game Pass Ultimate got a significant price bump at the same time Fortnite Crew was added, so there are some other factors you might want to take into account before signing up.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's take a look at the details to see what kind of value this really is.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#What_you_get_with_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_and_Fortnite_Crew">What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite Crew</a></li><li><a href="#What_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_with_Fortnite_Crew_costs_">What Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costs </a></li><li><a href="#Do_I_need_to_have_an_Xbox_console_to_get_Fortnite_Crew_on_Game_Pass_Ultimate_">Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?</a></li><li><a href="#What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_Xbox_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?</a></li><li><a href="#What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_a_different_platform_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_you_get_with_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_and_Fortnite_Crew">What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite Crew</h2><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes a large library of games for both Xbox and PC, including most titles published by Microsoft and its subsidiaries, which include Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. Yes, that includes the newly released Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The Ultimate plan is the only version of Game Pass that is guaranteed to include new games published under the Xbox banner on day one, and it's also the only tier to include subscriptions from two other publishers--Ubisoft Classics, and EA Play. </p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite Crew benefits are exactly the same if you subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate as they would be if you bought a standalone Crew subscription. You get access to the current battle pass, music pass, OG pass, and Lego Pass as long as you're subscribed, you'll receive 1,000 V-Bucks and a Crew skin each month you're subscribed, and you'll also get the premium Rocket Pass for Rocket League.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate_with_Fortnite_Crew_costs_"><span>What Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costs</span></h2><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now costs $30 a month, a sizable jump from its previous price of $20. By itself, Fortnite Crew costs $12 per month.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Do_I_need_to_have_an_Xbox_console_to_get_Fortnite_Crew_on_Game_Pass_Ultimate_">Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?</h2><p dir="ltr">There are many ways to play Xbox these days, including consoles, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, and on handhelds like the ROG Xbox Ally--and all Game Pass games are playable via any of those methods. To receive your Crew benefits, you'll need to log in to Fortnite on any of the above-mentioned Xbox platforms at least once each month, and then you can use those benefits while playing on any other platform.</p><p dir="ltr">But it wouldn't make a lot of sense to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate unless you plan to play some of the other games that are included. It's not a good value to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate <em>just </em>for Crew.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_Xbox_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?</h2><p dir="ltr">If you sign up for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate while you have an active Fortnite Crew subscription through Xbox, the Crew subscription will automatically be canceled. The <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/fortnite-crew-xbox-game-pass-faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official FAQs</a> do not say whether you'd receive a pro-rated refund or credit for additional time that might have been remaining on your Crew subscription in that situation, but it would be standard practice to do so.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_if_I_already_have_Fortnite_Crew_on_a_different_platform_">What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?</h2><p dir="ltr">If you're subscribed to Fortnite Crew through, say, the PlayStation Store, you won't get any additional bonuses in Fortnite from being subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate until the subscription on PlayStation ends. So you may want to cancel your existing Crew subscription and let it run out before signing up for Game Pass Ultimate, if the Crew subscription is one of the deciding factors in your purchase.</p>

Because of the momentous occasion, we spoke to Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii, who still works closely on the franchise, about the mainline series' history. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">You can read my full deep dive into that very history here</a>, but I mention all this because Horii is 71 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>By now, many developers have retired or at least stepped back to produce or consult on games in the series they're closely attached to. But Horii is still deeply involved in the creation of each new mainline Dragon Quest, including the in-development <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/05/27/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-announced-a-darker-turn-for-the-series">Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate</a>. I close out my 90-minute interview with Horii by trying to politely ask why he's still working on Dragon Quest to this day. I mention that fellow Japanese game developer with a perhaps similar level of stature in the industry Hideo Kojima, who directed this year's Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, recently stated he's going to develop games until he dies; he apparently even has a USB stick with game ideas for his team to use following his death one day, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-staff-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-after-he-dies/#google_vignette"><em>VideoGamesChronicle</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I ask Horii if he feels the same about game development and why he continues to make Dragon Quest games.

<p>Just in time for the holidays, the Epic Games Store is now allowing gifting on the storefront. The feature has been a highly requested addition from fans and couldn’t come at a better time.</p>







<p>Epic Games Store is a fairly new service, only launching in 2018. As a competitor to Steam, the storefront houses many popular releases like Battlefield 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-maps-quests-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and Epic Games’ own Fortnite. However, one factor that Steam had over Epic Games Store was gifting. On Steam, you can gift a code or a copy of a game to another user. Despite a large game selection, the Epic Games Store had yet to implement the system. Now, the joy of gifting has arrived and right before the Holiday season.</p>



<h2 id="h-gifting-now-available-to-users-on-epic-games-store">Gifting Now Available to Users on Epic Games Store</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gift games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 on Epic Games Store!</figcaption></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/gifting-now-available-on-egs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on the Epic Games Store, the company revealed that gifting has been added to the storefront. To do the process, pick a game you want to buy for someone and choose “Buy as a Gift”. From there, choose who you’ll gift the game to from your Epic friends list, and you can pick to schedule it or do it ASAP, then purchase. From there, the recipient has two weeks to accept the game. If not or rejected, you’ll get a refund. </p>



<p>The gifting service extends to paid games (including certain editions), add-ons, and bundles. However, in-game currency, subscriptions, free games, and pre-purchase offers are not allowed. A more step-by-step guide can be found <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/features/gifting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p>Now, you can surprise your friends with new games without any hassle. While it seems like something that should’ve been there since the start, it couldn’t have come at a better time of the year. Plus, with so many great games in 2025 like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you can gift the best of the best to friends and finally convince them to play it. </p>







<p>Are you happy to see gifting come to the Epic Games Store? Will you be gifting games to your friends? What games? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

"I honestly have no idea," he admitted. "Something about it being a prime number?" He said someone tossed out the number in the early days of developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the team at Capital Games has maintained it as a target lifespan for the Star Wars-themed mobile role-playing game.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given that the oldest still-running online games are around 28-29 years old (a casual search says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://cms.furcadia.com/">Furcadia</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> may be the oldest one?) that's an ambitious timeline to set, especially in the world of online mobile games. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is celebrating its 10th anniversary this month, meaning it's outlived a number of other EA-published Star Wars free-to-play games and seen the release of five films, seven live-action series, and about six animated shows. The Star Wars name </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/three-reasons-star-wars-outlaws-might-have-undersold">isn't always enough to attract players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. So what has Capital Games done to survive for so long?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Larsen of course gushed about the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> player community and their loyalty for sticking with the game for so long—but if you want some practical takeaways for your live service team, you'll want to follow him back to 2018, when we were all reeling from backlash to the objectively best (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>editor's note: this is not objective but Bryant insisted we keep this</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">)</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">film in the series: Star Wars Episode VII: The Last Jedi...</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/mobile/google-to-reduce-play-store-fees-after-settlement-with-epic-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Google to reduce Play Store fees after settlement with Epic Games</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Capital Games used new game modes to make ">Capital Games used new game modes to make <span>Galaxy of Heroes</span> development more sustainable</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Last Jedi actually has very little to do with this story—neither does Solo: A Star Wars Story, the other major film release of 2018. According to Larsen, 2018 was instead the year that high-ranking guilds began messaging Capital Games that they were feeling the effects of slowing player growth. "We're not getting enough new players coming in and progressing fast enough to backfill players that are leaving," Larsen recalled them saying.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the same time, Capital Games was feeling the strain of making new content with four-year-old tools. Around this time, the studio determined that the way it worked was "too heavy and manual," requiring developers to hand-author all aspects of new content—content that could be consumed quickly and leave players spinning their </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tsmeu-6_personal_wheel_bike">wheel bikes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This was when the team conceived of the "Conquest" and "Galactic Challenges" game modes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As much as they were modes, they were [also] attempts to force ourselves to evolve the way that we operate and create some new procedurally generated content," he said. "I think we were kind of frustrated as a team that in having to go fast and try to get more track in front of the team that we weren't making some of those investments in early years."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/mobile/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-eclipsed-150-million-downloads" target="_self" data-discover="true">Pokemon TCG Pocket has eclipsed 150 million downloads</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Releasing these modes and making a number of other changes opened up space for the Capital Games team to plan further ahead, a challenge that's particularly tricky with a license like Star Wars. Disney's infamous secrecy with upcoming projects means some companies like EA aren't privy to plot points or characters from upcoming projects—making it challenging to plan for content that can be timed to new Star Wars stories. Larsen said he personally learned this in the run-up to the 2016 release of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. "I think it sensitized me to that movie development to be a fluid process," he said. "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vJZjqmmL-24">Cuts can get made on the editing floor.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">"&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So what do you do when you're missing key information most other studios would be able to make themselves? Larsen nodded to the upcoming Ryan Gosling vehicle Star Wars: Starfighter as an example of how the studio is "planning ahead" while working with limited information. "We're thinking how ships are probably going to be really notable in there. What can we pull off? How can we start getting ahead of that?" </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">already has spaceship-friendly systems, but just knowing those basic details can let the studio begin planning technical and high-level design concepts to have content ready when the movie comes out.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/mobile/-a-new-way-to-get-discovered-apple-pitches-its-new-game-app-to-developers" target="_self" data-discover="true">'A new way to get discovered:' Apple pitches its new game app to developers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there's the "season" format (one used by many live games now) that lets the developers shape meatier content from the new films months or years after their release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But let's double back to Larsen's comment about speaking with player guilds. They played a key role in helping Capital Games update its development strategy. What can we learn from the kinds of players who stick around for the 10-year run of an online RPG?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Some early ">Some early <span>Galaxy of Heroes</span> players are now raising kids of their own</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Larsen said he officially realized he was working on a "generational" game when he saw some players describe how they'd started playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in high school and are now introducing it to their own kids. For some back-of-napkin math, if a 17-year-old began playing in 2015 and had a child at age 22, their five-year-old might be old enough to watch the films...or at least ask their parents if they have games on their phone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of these players were early adopters who dipped from the game in the years after launch, only to return later and find a veritable feast of play modes available on their return. Even though the game is called a "role-playing game," Larsen said its most dedicated players find the most fun in on resource management. "It's about expressing [their] intelligence," he said. Marketing director Fabien-Pierre Nicolas-Kim said this has made the game popular in France and Germany, two regions with strong affinity for tabletop and digital strategy games (among other regions of course—he namechecked India, the Philippines, and Eastern Europe as regions with strong playerbases).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That means these players aren't so concerned about "role-playing" Star Wars characters per se, they're interested in collecting the various characters, upgrading them, and mixing/matching them to win battles and head up the leaderboards.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">10 years of development has meant there are a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>lot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of characters to choose from (Larsen's personal favorites include Knights of the Old Republic fan favorites Darth Revan and Darth Treya) Larsen said the 37-year battle plan involves making sure these players feel like their investment in the game—be it time or money—is "respected," and that new content can still be challenging without rendering older parts of their collection invalid.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair did say they work hard to ensure low-spending (or zero-spending) players are as rewarded for their time in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as possible. Larsen said since his early days on the team, he's watched his coworkers prioritize what he referred to as "the right decisions for players," even if it meant "leaving money on the table" or "not extracting value." He mentioned the team doesn't always "get it right," but did say there's always been a desire to center those investments even when they've missed the mark.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How can mobile RPGs evolve over time?">How can mobile RPGs evolve over time?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is one of many free-to-play mobile RPGs where players collect characters to power them up and upgrade their power levels. It'd be fair to say the format's a little calcified, and unlike their competitors, Capital Games can't easily tap into the "collaboration" market that lets them mix-and-match characters from other franchises. With 27 years left on the clock, where can the series go from here?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Larsen played it coy here, but he said the trend he's followed since his earliest days at EA have been the efforts to make it possible for players to play games wherever they want, on whatever platform they want. He recalled an experiment where EA's social team making Facebook games had been "embedded" with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Space 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team to try and make a multiplatform experience. The game got canceled, but he said the trends of the years after, where players can play games across mobile, console, and PC platforms, makes him think they were onto something. "It was like Betamax," he said. "We're always looking for what's new—where we go find fandom and bring the ability imagine your own Star Wars experience, wherever it is that you want to be playing." The team is, interestingly enough, apparently experimenting with controller-friendly game modes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We've got versions of the game that are wrapped to controllers and we've created synchronous PvP modes that we haven't released yet where it actually works quite well," he said. "I don't know that that moment lasts forever, but I think there's something there for us to be exploring currently."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA's made multiple statements about wanting to get out of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-shutters-battlefield-dev-ridgeline-games-torches-respawn-s-unannounced-star-wars-shooter">licensed games business</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so it's not impossible that in 27 years, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Galaxy of Heroes </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">will be the last game standing at the now </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/saudi-arabia-is-taking-ea-private-alongside-other-investors">partly-Saudi-owned publisher</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It'd be a testament to Capital Games if they make it through what will surely be another two-plus decades of game development chaos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But you know what they say.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> creative director Guillaume Broche of Sandfall Interactive would very much like to play a remaster of Lost Odyssey, the mournful 2007-released Xbox 360 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and development studio Mistwalker. He feels the game was cruelly dinged by reviewers of the era for adhering to certain conventions. He also reckons it’d have done better if it had released for hardware other than the Xbox 360, which was trying to make in-roads among Japanese consumers at the time.
</p>
<p>
"It became a cult classic because few people played it, as it was available only on Xbox 360 while its core audience was probably more used to PlayStation consoles," Broche told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-the-last-game-that-made-me-cry-clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-on-the-iconic-xbox-360-rpg-lost-odyssey-and-its-unexpected-legacy">Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale</a> in a retrospective interview, published earlier today. "But that core audience who did play it loved it. The critical reception at the time was very unfair in my opinion, as the game was criticised for being 'old school' at a time where it felt like every game that was not an open world was viewed as 'old school' by the western press.

"I didn't share that opinion at all and its linear structure, coupled with a world map, an amazing story, and fantastic music, made it one of the best games of its kind,” he added.

I’m not sure I’d go that far, but sure, Lost Odyssey is very good and deserved more eyeballs than it got. There are a few aspects I dislike, such as achingly long treks between save points, and yes, it has random battles, which used to rustle the jimjams of European and North American critics, but have been out of fashion for so long among big budget RPG developers that they've sort of become an exciting novelty. Ah, remember when you couldn’t reach the end of a mountain path without hallucinating 12 fishbowl punch-ups with one and the same giant beetle/harpy duo.
</p><p>
The combat is quite elegant, mixing questions of duration and positioning with a magic ring QTE system. But I liked the game more for its absorbing visual novel interludes – memories reclaimed by your immortal protagonist Kaim - and its faded industrial fantasy setting, which feels like a post-apocalyptic edition of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-x">Final Fantasy X</a>’s Spira.
</p>
<p>
Broche says the game "never had any real successor", which is perhaps overlooking Sandfall’s own Clair Obscur, though I’ll leave it to you to debate the resemblance. "Justice for Lost Odyssey," he told EG. "Remaster it now so more people can play it, please."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Back in June, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-mcdonalds-job-application-boosting-smurfing-dev-riot-games-2000616955"><span>Riot Games</span></a><span> canceled </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Minecraft-</span></i><span>inspired survival game by Hypixel Studios. This was five years after the </span><i><span>League of Legends </span></i><span>company acquired the studio in 2015, and the team was shut down as a result. A lot can change in five months, though, ands Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme recently revealed some good news: he’s been able to get the rights to the project back from Riot to continue making the game.</span></p> <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved"><span>blog post</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>’s</span> <span>official site, Collins-Laflamme says Hypixel has rehired “more than 30” developers who were part of the original development team, with more expected to follow. The studio is fully independent now, and is “committed to funding </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span> for the next 10 years.” But the exact terms of the deal with Riot and the source of funding for </span><i><span>Hypixel 2.0</span></i><span> haven’t been shared, beyond the fact that Collins-Laflamme and co-founder Philippe Touchette are co-funding the project.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span> from Riot Games,” the announcement reads. “While it didn’t make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what’s best for players, and that’s for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Riot </span><a href="https://x.com/riotgames/status/1990480588797849881"><span>confirmed the news</span></a><span> as well, saying the deal is “giving this community its best shot” with a revised version of </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>. Collins-Laflamme spoke more candidly about the deal </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1990479580088435017"><span>on his personal X account</span></a><span>, saying that the game may have some “rough edges” right now, but the team wants to get it out to players sooner rather than later. That should come as a relief to fans who have been waiting years for something to actually ship.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This game has always been close to my heart, and I’m excited to bring it back home,” he writes. “Real talk: </span><i><span>Hytale </span></i><span>isn’t some polished AAA release waiting in the wings. It’s messy. It’s janky. And there’s a lot of work to be done. My plan? Get it out to you as soon as possible. No more waiting. You’ll get to play it, rough edges and all. It won’t be perfect on day one. My hope is that together, we’ll shape it into something truly special.”</span></p> <p><span>Hypixel says it will be rolling out its full early access plan, along with some transparent behind-the-scenes communication, so people know more about the state of the game following its recent cancellation saga. For now, the team asks that fans “be patient when things break and trust the long-term vision.” Hopefully, it all turns out well for everyone involved, and this can be a win for both game preservation and keeping developers employed. God knows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-revive-fan-servers-mod-sony-playstation-dmca-2000644800"><span>we need more stories</span></a><span> like that these days.</span></p>

                <p>A game industry legend, Rebecca Heineman, has passed away due to cancer on November 17, 2025. She was 62 years old. Friends of Heineman have mourned her across <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmcd.bsky.social/post/3m5u7i37gns2u" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media.</a></p><p>Heineman had a prolific career in the game industry that included both game design and high-level competitive play. She won multiple Atari 2600 Space Invaders tournament, including the Atari VCS Space Invaders National Championship held in New York. She became the first national video game tournament champion in the United States.</p><p>"I had two strategies. One was "slow and steady", which won the L.A. tournament, and the other was "kill everything on the screen ASAP," which won me the NYC finals," she said in a 2006 <a href="https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/interviews/rebecca_heineman/interview_rebecca_heineman.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a>. "In the finals, I took an hour and 45 minutes to get the highest score. I lost one or two bases because my strategy was riskier, but faster. It paid off and I won."</p><p>Heineman was a founder or co-founder of video game companies Interplay Productions, Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sküül. She worked on hundreds of games, including classics like Dragon Wars and The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate. She also wrote for Electronic Games and worked with major publishers and studios like EA and Sony. Her work touched several major parts of the gaming world.</p><p>Heineman witnessed several changes throughout her time in the game industry, including major innovations in gaming visuals. She recalled how games had become similar to movies, complete with voice actors and scripts. Her approach to game design remained steady, though.</p><p>"The easiest for me is coming up with how to implement a game," she said in 2006. "I always envision in my head what the game should look like on the screen before a line of code is written. Then I design the code to work with that. It allows me to get the game up and running in a very short period of time."</p><p>For more on Rebecca Heineman’s early gaming accomplishments, she was featured in a segment of the Netflix gaming documentary <em>High Score</em>. A GoFundMe is currently underway to assist with funeral arrangements.</p>

                <p>For the last two decades, Yoko Taro has found success with the Drakengard and Nier franchise(s), but he hasn't had a new game since the Voice of Cards trilogy several years ago. However, the creator of the NieR games insists that he's remained busy in that time, but his games keep getting canceled.</p><p>According to a report on <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">4Gamer</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Yoko addressed the issue while appearing on a panel at the G-CON 2025 video game convention in Korea. He told the audience that his most recent projects fell apart during development.</p><p>"I often get told stuff like, 'Why aren’t you making a new sequel to Nier' or 'Yoko Taro isn't doing anything,' but that's because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development," said Yoko. "I've actually been working on some stuff, it's just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven't been doing anything just because none of the work I've done is being released."</p><p>Yoko didn't explain why his projects were canceled or offer any additional details about what they were. He did note that he'd rather see games get canceled than release something that fails to live up to the standards he set with his previous games.</p><p>In 2023, Yoko facetiously said the next Nier game could come out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yoko-taro-says-new-nier-could-come-tomorrow-or-35-years-from-now/1100-6510815/" data-ref-id="1100-6510815">tomorrow or 35 years from now</a>. Nier Reincarnation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-reincarnation-is-shutting-down-but-more-content-is-coming-first/1100-6520531/" data-ref-id="1100-6520531">was shut down in 2024</a>, but Yoko released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nier-tie-in-books-written-by-yoko-taro-releasing-this-month/1100-6521653/" data-ref-id="1100-6521653">two Nier tie-in books</a> that year. Last year, Hiroyuki Kobayashi implied that he's collaborating with Yoko and composer Keiichi Okabe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yoko-taro-is-working-on-new-game-with-nier-producer-and-composer/1100-6523481/" data-ref-id="1100-6523481">on a new project</a>. Earlier in 2025, Yoko shared his prediction that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-director-yoko-taro-says-ai-will-make-all-game-creators-unemployed/1100-6531185/" data-ref-id="1100-6531185">AI will put human game developers out of work</a> in 50 years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For centuries, vampires have checked a lot of existential (and down bad) boxes as a perfect foil for our darkest cravings and existential dread. From Park Chan-Wook’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762073/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Thirst</u></em></a>, Tomas Alfredson’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Let the Right One In</u></em></a>, Neil Jordan’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1531901/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Byzantium</u></em></a>, and Ryan Coogler’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/grace-sinners/"><em><u>Sinners</u></em></a>, I’ve enjoyed contemporary vampiric teas, imbibing the malignant and intoxicatingly self-destructive codependency monsters that make the horror myth so alluring. Yet, like the monster, I craved more.&nbsp;</p><p>On impulse, I recently followed that gothic rainbow of vampiric yearning back to its origin. Not <em>Dracula</em>. Not <em>Nosferatu</em>. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmilla?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Carmilla</u></em></a>–more specifically, writer&nbsp; <a href="https://electricliterature.com/carmen-maria-machado-carmilla-lefanu-vampire-interview/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Carmen Maria Machado’s version</u></a> of the 1872 Gothic novella by writer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sheridan-Le-Fanu?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu</u></a>. Having emerged from an afternoon reading the novel from cover to cover, I realized that every iteration inspired by it, like Powerhouse Animation’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/castlevanias-final-season-gets-there-in-the-end-1846825280?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Castlevania </em>Netflix series</u></a>, were just watered-down versions, a realization inspired by Machado’s version rage-baiting me into queer enlightenment.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr">!!!!!!!! <a href="https://t.co/YHgotQvp4K?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/YHgotQvp4K</a></p>— 𝑳𝑰𝑽𝑰𝑵𝑮 𝑫𝑬𝑨𝑫 𝑮𝑰𝑹𝑳 🦇 (@screamnhorror) <a href="https://twitter.com/screamnhorror/status/1989129304094200151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>As <a href="https://pshares.org/blog/reading-carmen-maria-machados-update-on-carmilla/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Amelia Brown wrote in her Ploughshares essay</u></a>, Machado’s version of <em>Carmilla </em>is unquestionably “both playfully reclaiming a story that was never stolen while also reclaiming a history that definitely was; the literary history of queer desire.” In the introduction to <em>Carmilla</em>, Machado mentions a real-life event first noted by scholar Professor Leight, who posited that Laura and Carmilla were based on an affair between two women, Marcia Marén and Veronika, one which <a href="https://electricliterature.com/carmen-maria-machado-carmilla-lefanu-vampire-interview/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Electric Literature</u></a> curiously notes no version of <em>Carmilla </em>had ever mentioned before Machado’s. The implication is that Le Fanu took the queerness (and low-key plagiarism) of a correspondence between one Dr. Hesselius and his patient, Veronika Hausle, and turned it into the foundational vampiric novella. In doing so, he excised parts that would’ve made the whole “Is <em>Carmilla</em> queer text” of it all crushingly obvious.&nbsp;</p><p>But Machado’s introduction is also a lie. She made up Leight, Marcia, and Veronika; Dr. Hesselius is cited in Le Fanu’s prologue, and is presumably a fiction, but without any of the queer context Machado adds. Or better put, Machado’s introduction is a flex of “manuscript fiction” as folks on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/xjxxft/im_having_trouble_verifying_carmen_maria_machados/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>r/books subreddit</u></a> I quickly flocked to put it. Machado, for my estimation, was using the same benefit of the doubt introduction Le Fanu used in his equally dubious 19th-century prologue, to (perhaps too cutely) reclaim <em>Carmilla </em>as an inalienable queer tale with vague gestures at made-up figures to give credence to that fact.&nbsp;</p><p>Put simply, I was reading a version of the book at war with itself, and one where I arrived at my own truth about the intent, and lack thereof, of its original author and the state of queer texts being a collective hallucination of starved readers or some slight of hand by the author to obscure its original meaning. It’s the embodiment of “I love spreading misinformation on the internet” housed in the perceived sanctity and empirical truth of a book. Still, like a vampire’s familiar putting up with hickies on their neck, I gave in to the lucid, Mandela effect reading experience that Machado’s <em>Carmilla </em>was inviting me into and found the pieces I walked away with to be beautiful enough to be my own truth about the work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix/Powerhouse Animation</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Carmilla </em>is delightfully riotous. A slow-burning mystery, it follows Laura, a rich girl who, after insisting that her wealthy father let a mysterious girl named Carmilla stay at their secluded mansion, experiences a strange sickness as she, her father, and housemaids piece together that her unbearably pretty roommate has been treating her like a Capri-Sun pack for weeks. Machado’s edits exist as footnotes gingerly spread throughout the book, and despite the deception of the introduction, don’t rearrange words for modern audiences.&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite (and very loud) “excisings” among Le Fanu’s omissions of Veronika’s correspondence to her doctor that Machado places in her introduction is a letter where Veronika writes, in no uncertain terms, that the Victorian gals consummated their affair: “I descended the valley of her, over and over, until neither of us could locate our breath.” Contrast that with Le Fanu’s portrayal of Laura and Carmilla’s relationship, where Laura registers Carmilla’s toxic affections as merely sinister—never as the site of a conflicted, inchoate sexual awakening. Machado treats this tension not as subtext but as text, both inventing and excavating the erotic charge buried beneath Le Fanu’s pearl-clutching editorializations of Veronika’s letters to Le Fanu’s doctor. Letters, mind you, that Le Fanu dared to preface in his 1871 prologue by noting that the author of these letters (in this edit, Veronika) was already dead—and thus, in his words, “she probably could have added little to the narrative which she communicates, with such fastidious detail, in the following pages”—before proceeding, in Machado’s casting, to redact her correspondence with a smug confidence that omits all the most revealing parts.&nbsp;</p><p>Machado’s fabricated reasoning not to include excised text from Veronika’s letters into <em>Carmilla </em>as told from Laura’s perspective (which, again, don’t exist), while admittedly “petty,” felt to me like reading one of those “this you” quote retweets while also dunking on the original poster:&nbsp;</p><p>“I wished this edition to bear LeFanu’s shame. I wish the reader to come to the book with a complete understanding of its inadequacy…I hope you will enter into <em>Carmilla</em> thusly, using your fingertips and mouth and mind to locate the lacunae where Le Fanu excised pieces of Veronika’s account, the hallways haunted by the specters of truth and phantoms of passion. See if you cannot perceive what exists below: the erotic relationship between two high-strung and lonely young women. The shared metropolis of their dreaming. An aborted picnic in the ruins.”</p><p>But, like a vampire's familiar, I decided to give in to the fantasy of <em>Carmilla</em> secretly being a glinted queer text that I was getting in on the ground floor of. And boy howdy was I picking up what Machado was putting down.&nbsp;</p><p>Machado’s <em>Carmilla </em>seeps with imaginary contempt and is cattily packaged. The footnotes explain the story like a friend candidly recounting drama from the night before. They provide shorthand annotations explaining what fancy words mean to the everyman while also removing the veil of elegance by spelling out things for what they are. Machado vividly enunciates the danger and desire coursing through Laura and Carmilla's roaring romance by reframing its gothic gestures as intimate, juvenile dramas. Carmilla's nightly visits become the secretive scurrying of a girl hiding under her friend's bed. Meanwhile, a passing mention of Cleopatra's tapestry transforms into a sly metaphor for erotic vulnerability. A breast bared not for pocket watch-flexing bling but for creatures to be drawn to the pulse beneath its bosom.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix/Powerhouse Animation</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a kept promise of Machado’s shrewd, lean addition to Le Fanu's <em>Carmilla </em>enduring as a shame in delighting in the Gothic yearning and sapphic doom of its text, Machado’s notes cut through the flowery language about rapid breathing and “a sobbing, that rose into a sense of strangulation, supervened, and turned into a dreadful convulsion” to write frankly, “If this isn't an orgasm, nothing is.” All of this, naturally, takes place on the sixty-ninth page of the 139-page novel. Sensational.</p><p>By the end of Machado’s <em>Carmilla</em>, I witnessed my perception of <em>Carmilla</em> transform from an empty vessel of plot proportion and danger to a Promethean flame that sets Laura ablaze, her blood running with the most tremendous excitement of her boring, rich girl life. I also was left gazing, hands folded behind my back, wondering if Veronika/Laura—the spitting image of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Sorrows?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows</u></a> by the climax of the novel—ever writhed in agony knowing her lovely creature would never cup her face in her hand, plant butterfly kisses on her cheeks and eyelids, or say her name again. Carmilla, Laura’s ferociously alive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Wabi-sabi</u></a>, overnight transitioned into a story she must tell to someone, anyone, to keep alive. In Machado’s telling, her real-life counterpart sought to sort it out by seeking counsel from Dr. Hesselius, before having her tale told by Le Fanu for profit and paraded in homages that didn’t know the original source to whom they were riffing.&nbsp;</p><p>The main trait of any vampiric tale is that of doomed yearning and excess. To that end, Machado invites readers to savor the curated meal she has prepared, even if it means transforming Le Fanu into a blithering idiot of a sous chef, where his every perceived sapphic omission acts as the excess fat that makes the marrow of Machado’s dish all the more savory. Whenever queerness rises to the surface of Le Fanu’s text, Machado nudges it into the open while practically looming over your shoulder to nod at your inquisitive glance at that line you just read being gay AF.&nbsp;</p><p>Machado’s <em>Carmilla </em>lets readers who want <em>Carmilla</em> to be a queer text to say that it is: a black rainbow of a formative horror novella. A four-car pile-up where megalomania, hubris, yearning, and infatuation crash. A book that's one-size-fits-all and sapphic as hell for all the languishers of the world to let out a heavy sigh of relief, feeling seen by a take on the vampiric tale that nudges queer subtext into the sunlight for all to see. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Waiting for a reincarnation</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoko Taro, the creator of the Nier and Drakenguard games, has been awfully quiet lately. Though he's worked on some smaller projects (writing scenarios for Voice of Cards, and a few mobile games), the lack of a proper Nier follow-up or other new major game from him has been getting under fans' skin. But according to Taro, he <em>has</em> been working on projects. They just keep getting canceled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from his remarks at Korean gaming convention G-Con 2025, which were <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on by 4gamer</a> and <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">translated by Automaton</a>. The panel, which featured Taro and Bayonetta and Okami director Hideki Kamiya, saw the pair asked for updates on recent projects. Kamiya mentioned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-okami-2-from-our-exclusive-interview-with-its-creators">the upcoming sequel to Okami</a>, while Taro said he'd been very busy with new projects, they just keep getting canceled partway through.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to NieR’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t  doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day. I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Taro isn't discouraged by this, apparently. He continued, saying he'd rather fail repeatedly and eventually create something good, rather than put out multiple mediocre works. “I believe that if I’m going to release something weird, I’d be better off not releasing anything at all.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/18/gettyimages-477373540-1-1763485628367.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoko Taro introduces Nier during the Square Enix press conference at E3 2015.

Especially since Nier: Reincarnation, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">was effectively a sequel to Nier: Automata</a>, is still completely unplayable by virtue of being a mobile gacha game that's since been taken offline with seemingly no plans to rerelease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So good luck to Taro, hopefully we see a new project from him that makes it to release sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the summer of 2012, ROUTINE was revealed at the largest video gaming convention in the world Gamescom, but after well over a decade later it has yet to make it into the hands of players. In the coming weeks, that’s all about to change, and as I sat down with two of the game’s three developers, Aaron Foster, head of art and design and project lead, and fellow artist and designer Jemma Hughes, it was all smiles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ll have gone gold in just a few days,” Aaron told me with a grin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Theirs is a classic indie developer story, a handful of developers setting out to work on a project they were passionate about, learning every difficult lesson along the way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Routine started as a very simplified, atmospheric, slight-horror game. I started it on my own, and was actually inspired originally by the simplicity of Dear Esther,” Aaron said. “I wasn’t a programmer at the time. I was an environment artist, actually, and wanted to use my experience to make a game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I grew up in the 80s watching VHS's and it left a big impression on me.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I grew up in the 80s watching VHS's and it left a big impression on me. Now that I’m an environment artist, I’ve never stopped loving that aesthetic. I love the weathering and the hum of fluorescents and little details like that. When making Routine, I thought, ‘if I made this game in the 80s, what would I imagine it like?’ and so, sorta took that and ran with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When Jemma and our programmer, Pete, came on that really opened a lot of doors for us. We started showing a few screenshots and eventually got help on audio, so that’s when we were ready to show the trailer.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aaron and Jemma’s environmental art chops were more than enough to catch the attention of masses, and when they released their reveal trailer in 2012, their self-published little endeavor left an impression on people. But then work on the project suddenly halted, and wouldn’t pick back up again until 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There was quite a long delay that was due to personal reasons, actually. We were dealing with almost going personally bankrupt and had to pause and work on other projects to make ends meet,” Aaron said, with the difficulty from those years apparent in his voice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually their situation improved, though, and there was still a lot of passion among their small, but mighty team to pick the project back up. However, doing so after a years-long hiatus proved no easy task. The first obstacle was that the development landscape had completely changed, including, most consequentially for their team, the tools used to make them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“When we picked up development again, we actually had to start from scratch, because we’d worked on the game for 4 or 5 years in Unreal 3 Engine, then came back in 2020 on Unreal 5 using a completely different code – C++ instead of Unreal Scripts.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so the team took the opportunity to make ground up changes to Routine that spanned gameplay, art, and more. Having learned a lot from their time developing on Unreal 3, the team decided to refocus gameplay around a less combat focused design, give the story a complete overhaul, and change the way AI worked, expanding on ideas in some places and trimming back in others to bring the project more in line with the team’s renewed vision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When we weren’t paused, we were mostly gutting stuff that didn’t work. The C.A.T. was originally primarily a weapon. That was removed and turned into what felt more like an actual tool. You saw a lot of that in the demo you played. It even has an off button!”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Routine - 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The C.A.T., also known as the Cosmonaut Assistance Tool is the primary way the player interacts with the world around them. A boxy, retro-looking multitool, you pick this handy item up early on and it evolves over time as you find new modules for it. It was one of the big focuses during the rework after they started working on the game again, and Aaron’s eyes light up when he talks about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn’t want to make a bunch of modules, so instead we decided to make each module multipurpose. For instance, the ultraview module is a blacklight, but also a flashlight, so while the other one helps you defend yourself, it doesn’t have a flashlight, so there’s more than one reason to have one module equipped at any time,” he told me.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“The C.A.T. does cool things like lets you connect to terminals, so it’s kind of like your cell phone, a camcorder, a flashlight – a multitool.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“It also does cool things like lets you connect to terminals, so it’s kind of like your cell phone, a camcorder, a flashlight – a multitool,” Jemma added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are more modules than what you’ve seen though. There’s one more later in the game. It may or may not help you defend yourself,” Aaron said with a laugh.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There were more changes beyond the C.A.T too, including a refocusing on the setting, which takes place on the moon. The moon is something of a fascination for Aaron, and something he wanted front and center. Before the pause in development, they’d increasingly built indoor environments where players couldn’t be blamed for forgetting they were on the moon at all – a state the team found unacceptable. Having played the demo recently, the moon is almost omnipresent, especially early on when they take every opportunity to shove the moon’s desolate vistas in your face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Narrative was also a huge change. The stuff we had before took away from the setting of the moon, we thought, and so we wanted to refocus on that,” Aaron explained. “I’ve always just been drawn to the moon. I think it looks just beautifully barren, and mysterious, and a bit creepy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of creepy, as you explore the space station, you’re never far away from the game’s primary threat – the Type 5 robots that attack you on sight and which cannot be dealt with using force. These heavy, metal Terminator-looking monsters are a sight to behold, and make the most alarming noises when they’re around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The AI got a rework too. Actually, you may not have noticed this, but the Type 5 robots are only ever active one at a time. That got changed at one point for reasons related to the narrative.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I’ll admit, I didn’t notice this, and actually spent minutes on end hiding from robots I had no idea were deactivated and unable to see me. Aaron and Jemma found this pretty amusing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, usually there’s this moment in some of the playtests where they’ll notice the robot just standing there and sort of peek out and then go ‘oh, he’s turned off’ and then you can walk right in front of them and see they don’t notice you at all,” Aaron said. “Just don’t be there when they come back on!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked about the design behind these terrifying monstrosities, Aaron explained there's a completely rational explanation for why someone built them to look like the stuff of nightmares, and also for how these could exist in the same universe as the tiny, boxy helper robots you’ll find scurrying about on the same space station.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Type 5s are actually repurposed riot control robots from Earth, so that’s why they look intimidating and a bit scary as you saw. The purpose of the IC robots is to be helpful, so they look cute.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked how Routine stands out in 2025, where we’ve enjoyed an absolute tidal wave of awesome games to play, Aaron spoke to the philosophy of letting players learn for themselves – a practice that’s less common in the age of in-game characters explaining puzzle solutions to you a few seconds after you encounter them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s just a very different kind of experience. We don’t hold your hand and make the player figure stuff out and there’s just not a lot of stuff like that out there at the moment.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who spent about 20 minutes beating my head on a single puzzle during the demo, I can attest that this is certainly true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before wrapping my call with the team, I paused to ask them what advice they would give to indie developers setting out to make their first game as they started to do all those years ago. Aaron’s answer came after only a second or two of thought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the most important things is just work on something you care about, regardless of scale. If you care about it, you’ll be able to see it through. We knew we wanted to finish this game and we did. It took a while, but we all cared about it, and here we are.”</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/routine-is-an-indie-horror-game-over-a-decade-in-the-making-developer-interview-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

California Resistance most notably adds new map Eastwood into the mix, but these new bonus adjustments aren’t exactly anything to scoff at, and they’re already live.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Topping the list is a change players have been looking to see for one specific Battlefield 6 game mode: Escalation. BF Studios confirmed the tweaks, which increase objective capture time by about 20%, are a direct result of fan feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This change gives your squad more time to react, reposition, and coordinate vehicle spawns while maintaining the mode's fast-paced intensity,” the message says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lower on the totem pole of fixes is yet another fine-tuning for challenges. Where past updates have added clarity to and reduced requirements, this smaller, backend change implements a fix for completed challenges that failed to give players their rewards. Finally, BF Studios says player profiles will no longer reflect Portal kill and death statistics in the full kill/death count. Instead, only human kills will be recognized here, with an area for Portal kills set to arrive in a future update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are small but necessary changes for many, with Battlefield 6 players still enjoying all of the more substantial tweaks delivered with update 1.1.2.0 and California Resistance earlier today. In addition to Eastwood, new guns, and new features, the update reverts aim assist settings back to those seen during the August open beta while also continuing to tackle weapon bloom and dispersion.

Currently, players have to decide between the $20 Guild Wars: Game of the Year Edition, the $30 Guild Wars Trilogy, or buying each individual campaign for $20. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guild-wars-is-celebrating-20-years-with-a-new-and-deeply-discounted-complete-edition/1100-6530852/" data-ref-id="1100-6530852">Guild Wars celebrated its 20th anniversary</a> with a $40 "Masterpiece Collection" bundle that brought together all of the original Guild Wars content under one roof.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Guild Wars Reforged - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now, ArenaNet is doing something similar once again. Reforged will include the original game's Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall campaigns (but doesn't seem to include the Eye of the North expansion) for one price. It will additionally come with some new bells and whistles to improve the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">First up is controller support, which should make the game Steam Deck verified (though that official designation is still pending, according to the Guild Wars Reforged website). It will also bring some graphical improvements like better rendering, ambient occlusion, enhanced bloom effects, new HD skill icons, and larger text options. High-DPI support is also being added for high-resolution monitors.</p><p dir="ltr">On the audio front, Guild Wars Reforged has been "rebuilt" with 3D environmental audio. In terms of actual gameplay, the only real change is a new quest-tracking and direction system that will better guide players to where they need to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, it's far from a full-fledged remaster, but does look to update Guild Wars for the modern age and make the actual act of purchasing Guild Wars simpler for prospective players. All the improvements found in Reforged will be a free update to those who already own previous versions of Guild Wars.</p><p dir="ltr">While Guild Wars continues to celebrate its legacy, its sequel continues to forge ahead. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guild-wars-2-sixth-expansion-arrives-in-october-with-a-new-beachside-housing-option/1100-6533145/" data-ref-id="1100-6533145">Guild Wars 2 saw the release of its sixth expansion</a> in October--one that added new elite specializations to the game's professions, new housing options, and more.</p>

<p>Check out the first trailer</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Netflix's animated series, <strong>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</strong>, is returning to the streaming service next month, with season two kicking off on <strong>11th December</strong>. And look, we even have a trailer!</p>
<p>This second and final season, which once again stars Hayley Atwell in the titular role, sees Lara and co. race across the globe to get their hands on some ancient masks that pack some mysterious powers. There's an uber-rich "techno-visionary" trying to hunt the relics down too, so no prizes for guessing who the goodies and baddies are in this situation.</p>
<p>The all-new trailer (above) gives a taste of the animated action we can expect to find in December, with super-powered headwear, globe-trotting escapades and a fight with a shark — yes, really.</p>
<p>The first series was met with mixed reviews on release last year, but with a live-action adaptation in the works at Amazon and the 2013 game making a surprise appearance on Switch and Switch 2 today, perhaps there will be more interest this time? Somehow, we doubt it, but hey, it's a good time to be a Tomb Raider fan!</p>
