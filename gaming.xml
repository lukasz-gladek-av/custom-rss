            <p>Hopoo Games, the studio who made chewy roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain">Risk Of Rain</a> and its moreish 3D sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk Of Rain 2</a>, are shutting up shop and taking jobs at Valve. They're no longer working on a previously unannounced game called "Snail", say the developers <a href="https://x.com/hopoogames/status/1830763152818217461">on Xitter</a>. Instead, the studio co-founders Paul Morse and Duncan Drummond (plus "many other talented members") are taking up game development roles with the Steam owners. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It's been an exciting and transformative 12 years," say the developers. "We feel lucky for the opportunities we've had, and deeply appreciate both our team and fans that have supported us and our games.</p>
<p>"We love making games - and will continue to do so, for years to come. We're excited to be working side-by-side with the talented people at Valve. But for now - sleep tight, Hopoo Games."</p>
<p>This is not the first time a small indie team has been absorbed into the opaque Valve hivemind. As our Eurogamer colleagues <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/risk-of-rain-developer-cancels-next-project-to-join-game-development-at-valve">point out</a>, Campo Santo, the creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a>, effectively canned their next adventure game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-the-valley-of-gods">In The Valley Of The Gods</a> to go work at the studio. Even if it still has a release date of, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/campo-santos-in-the-valley-of-gods-has-a-probably-meaningless-2029-release-date">December 2029</a>. </p>
<p>The dissolution of Hopoo happens in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-2-creators-still-believe-that-gearbox-is-heading-in-the-right-direction-despite-troubles-with-recent-dlc">a poor reception to Risk of Rain 2's most recent DLC</a>. Though it should be noted that Hopoo Games aren't the custodians of that series anymore, since they sold the rights to Gearbox in 2022. And Drummond, for one, sympathised with the Gearbox development team now working on the roguelike, saying they "did the best they could with what time and resources they were given."</p>
<p>As for precisely what the (ex) Hopoo crowd will be working on, we don't know. We know Valve is working on multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>, so that's one possibility. Otherwise, there are likely other game ideas floating around the company, gaining or losing traction according to the unpredictable internal psychic weather of Valve's offices. </p>
<p>Working for the big V has the reputation of being a mystery, yes, but there have been plenty of glimpses into its unusual non-hierachical management structure. That includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9aCwCKgkLo">a video investigation by People Make Games</a>, a company handbook that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2964991/valves-handbook-for-new-employees-leak">leaked in 2012</a> (which might be out of date by now), and more recently <a href="https://medium.com/@monicah428/the-early-days-of-valve-from-a-woman-inside-bf80c6b47961">an account from a marketing manager</a> who was there in its earliest days. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA is heading to Sapporo, Japan for Apex Legends Global Series’ Year 4 Champs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As announced yesterday, Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) Year 4 will be hosted between January 29 and February 2, 2025, at Sapporo, Daiwa House Premist Dome. This momentous occasion will mark the title’s first LAN event in the Asia-Pacific region. Between these dates, the 40 teams will gather in Sapporo, Japan, and battle for the most significant chunk of the $2 million prize pool.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://algs.ea.com/split-2-2024/news/year4champs-venue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement post</a> explained that finding a venue for Apex Legends Global Series Champs was a ‘long-pondered question’; however, once the team visited the Daiwa House PREMIST DOME, they knew this was the perfect place to host the tournament. Daiwa House Premist Dome is a stadium in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, commonly used for Football and Baseball events. The venue can house more than 42,000 audience members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, while waiting for Apex Legends Global Series Champs to debut in Japan next year, the fans can catch some action in the new open-format competition series, BLGS. The BLGS Open Tournament will include five tournament weekends starting this October. The tournament will feature a prize pool worth $400,000, and the stream will feature ALGS B-Stream casters NiceWigg and Greek as the hosts.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I can't read the title of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oneshot">OneShot</a> without hearing Eminem singing "do not miss your chance to blow" immediately afterwards. But this mental deficiency is probably not shared by the thousands of folks who fell in love with the purple-tinted puzzle <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in 2016. If you are among that number, and fancy a handheld way to replay the game, then good news. OneShot: World Machine Edition is a remastered version that is Steam Deck compatible, and it's coming out on PC this month.</p>

<p>This edition has been available on Nintendo Switch since 2022, but it's coming to Steam on September 30th. It has been "completely rebuilt for modern portable consoles," say developers Future Cat. "With an entirely new engine, new UI, new hidden collectibles, support for more platforms, and more." Owners of the original game will get it at a 50% discount <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2915460/OneShot_World_Machine_Edition/">on Steam</a> (but only during the first week after launch). There's also a gallery with character backstories, a "music box", a viewer for game art, and a selection of wallpapers for a fictional operating system that will now exist in-game. </p>
<p>OneShot was originally made in RPGMaker, and pushed the scrappy DIY engine to strange limits that - at the time - felt novel and sometimes vaguely unsettling. It exists in the same realm as self-aware games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pony-island">Pony Island</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doki-doki-literature-club">Doki Doki Literature Club</a>, repeatedly breaking the fourth wall and reaching out to you as a player and controller of your computer's environment. But these PC-centric quirks meant it wasn't playable on consoles. This edition is basically a remaster to address that.</p>
<p>"I've never played a game like OneShot", said John in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oneshot-review">our review</a>. "It's also been a really long time since I've cared about a game's main character quite so much, to the point where decisions really mattered to me. Which is rather a lot to say of a game made in RPGMaker. But then this is a game that does stuff with that cutesy engine that I would never have thought possible."</p>
<p>It's possible that some of that magic might be diluted by this edition. In the original game you had to sometimes navigate the file directories of your own desktop as part of the story. But the fictional OS portrayed in this edition's trailer is intended to be a stand-in for your own folders. Again, this makes sense for Steam Deck and Switch. I don't know if it'll be worth the asking price if you already own the original, but for new players who want to lie in bed while they adventure, it's probably the way to go.</p></div>

            <p>Funcom - the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> - has admitted that getting the game ready for Microsoft's lower-powered Xbox Series S will be a "challenge".</p>
<p>Speaking with Connor Makar from <a href="https://www.vg247.com/bringing-dune-awakening-to-the-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-according-to-funcom-chief-product-officer">VG247</a>, Dune: Awakening's chief product officer Scott Junior said "there's a lot of optimisations we need to do before we release on the Xbox". He noted this is "one of the reasons we're coming out on PC first".</p>
<p>As revealed last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-out-next-year-on-pc-heres-a-first-look-at-gameplay">Dune: Awakening will debut on PC early next year</a>, however console versions for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S are yet to secure a release date. But, if you are keen to give Dune: Awakening a go on your Series S, don't worry just yet. Later in the conversation, Junior said the Dune: Awakening team would "be able to do it", and work was progressing.</p>

<p>Funcom is not the only developer to admit that the Series S has added an extra layer of challenge during development. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-out-now-on-xbox">Baldur's Gate 3 famously released several months later on Xbox</a> due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-xbox-version-still-coming-but-compromises-may-have-to-be-made">difficulties with split screen co-op</a> on the less powerful Series S console.</p>
<p>More recently, former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> and Rocksteady developer <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1827081865863557464">Del Walker</a> said he wished "the Series S never existed", calling the console "annoying to optimise for" (although he did not specify any games within this post).</p>

            <p>
Hopoo Games, the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/risk-of-rain">Risk of Rain</a> and Deadbolt, has announced it will be joining Valve to work on game development.
</p>
<p>
The Seattle-based indie has cancelled its unannounced next project, a game named "Snail", as a result.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/hopoogames/status/1830763152818217461">statement</a> posted to X, Hopoo Games described the news as "exciting", and said its small team would continue to make games "for years to come".
</p>
<p>
However, the statement also reads as something of an obituary for the studio. It ends: "for now - sleep tight, Hopoo Games". 
</p>
<p>
The news brings to mind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-acquires-firewatch-developer-campo-santo">Valve's 2018 acquisition of Campo Santo</a>, the talented team behind cult indie fave <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a>. The studio's in-development and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-developer-reveals-next-game-in-the-valley-of-the-gods">much-anticipated Ancient Egyptian adventure In the Valley of the Gods</a> was subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-devs-egyptian-adventure-in-the-valley-of-gods-officially-on-hold-at-valve">put on permanent hiatus</a>, and nothing has been heard of it since.
</p>
<p>
What will the team behind Risk of Rain now be working on within Valve? Well, all signs point to the company behind Half-Life, Portal and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> currently having multiple projects in the works. There's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">Deadlock</a>, the up-and-coming hero shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend">Valve has been not-so-quietly testing on Steam</a> for the past few months. But there's also signs of other projects in more familiar franchises - including, whisper it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">a new Half-Life</a>.
</p>
<p>"Today, we have an exciting update: Duncan and Paul, alongside many other talented members at Hopoo Games, will now be working on game development directly at Valve," Hopoo Games wrote. "We're incredibly grateful to Valve for their partnerships in the last decade, and are excited to continue working on their awesome titles. However, this does mean that we are stopping production on our unannounced game, 'Snail'.</p>
<p>"It's been an exciting and transformative 12 years. We feel lucky for the opportunities we've had, and deeply appreciate both our team and fans that have supported us and our games. We love making games - and will continue to do so, for years to come. We're excited to be working side-by-side with the talented people at Valve. But for now - sleep tight, Hopoo Games."</p>
<p>Would you drop development on a game named Snail to work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">something that may be Half-Life 3</a>? Yes, probably. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was featured in an hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDsvw-WPBfU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Andrea Rene at PAX West, speaking on several subjects mostly related to his history in the gaming industry. Arguably, the most interesting tidbit is that Spencer admitted passing on some major exclusivity opportunities for games like Bungie's Destiny and Harmonix's Guitar Hero.</p>
<p><em>There are so many mixed emotions and stories for me around Destiny. Obviously, Bungie was part of Microsoft. When I started at Xbox, Bungie was already part of Xbox, and I shared a floor with Alex copian</em></p>
<p><em>Jason Jones in the building that we were in Redmond and I learned a ton from just being around Bungie and how to build games and Alex's approach and Jason's approach to design. I would spend a ton of time down in their offices talking to them about stuff I was working on and getting their feedback. So you know Bungie both as part of Microsoft and then spinning Bungie out seeing getting the pitch for Destiny on.</em></p>
<p><em>‘Do we want to sign this?’ We ended up not signing Destiny. It obviously went with Activision, and to seeing what it grew into, like from a business kind of Xbox standpoint, I can look at it as it's just a really interesting journey in terms of what Bungie built.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m not a big PvP player. If somebody looks at my player history, it’s not a lot of what I do, and I was a little worried that I was going to get thrown into a PvP world. It turns out that's not what it was at all, and when House of Wolves came out, it definitely landed me.</em></p>
<p>Regarding Guitar Hero, Phil Spencer didn't think the concept would resonate at all with the gaming audience.</p>
<p><em>Alex Rigopulos pitches a game where they're actually going to make plastic guitars and they're going to plug into consoles and then they're going to sell tracks where you’re gonna play Simon on this guitar. I'm like, 'Really? Do we really think that's going to work'?</em></p>
<p>Destiny is, of course, very much still alive, especially after the most recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-gets-launch-trailer-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansion</a>, albeit following ups and downs. Guitar Hero, on the other hand, hasn't received a new installment since 2015's Guitar Hero Live.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[UFL Launch Suddenly Pushed Back To December By Strikerz]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ufl-launch-delayed-strikerz/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ufl-launch-suddenly-pushed-back-to-december-by-strikerz.970482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ufl-launch-delayed-strikerz/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>UFL, a free-to-play football game from Strikerz Inc., was set to be released in just a few days, on September 12. However, it has suddenly been delayed by three months by the developer, being pushed back to December 2024. It was cited that the pushback is because of concerns about the game’s quality, with Strikerz Inc. wanting to deliver the best experience possible.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-already-popular">Already Popular</h2>



<p>Several weeks ago, UFL underwent a massively successful open beta test that pulled in more than two million players. Many of them opted to throw some cash at UFL to secure early access to the full game, which was due to commence in the coming days. </p>



<p>It’s these players that are most irritated by the delay, as their early access period now won’t arrive until the end of November.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.uflgame.com/en-en/blog/ufl-release-date-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement published</a> on the UFL site, it was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Having analyzed your feedback and a lot of game data, we’ve decided to reschedule the UFL release. We’d like to explain why we made this decision and what it means for you. While we could release the game as scheduled, we believe taking a little more time will allow us to provide the best experience possible. </p>



<p>The majority of issues are related to polishing and fine-tuning the features that contribute to the game’s overall feel.<strong> </strong>We understand that there’s no recipe for a perfect football game, but it’s essential for us to ensure the game meets our high standards — and your expectations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>UFL will now be released on December 5 and <strong>not </strong>September 12, as previously announced. If you’ve pre-ordered and paid cash money for the game, you’ll get access on November 28.</p>



<p>Many have slammed this decision as irresponsible, explaining that UFL will now be forgotten as EA Sports FC 25 will be released at the end of September and will be the priority title for soccer fans. </p>



<p>Were you looking forward to playing UFL?</p>

<p>In a recent segment that aired at PAX West, Phil Spencer spoke at length about his time in the gaming industry, leaning on some of the choices he regrets making many years ago. In the ‘Story Time with Phil Spencer’ presentation, the Xbox leader revealed that he mourns ‘passing on’ games like Destiny and Guitar Hero.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-worst-game-choice-decisions">‘The Worst Game-Choice Decisions’</h2>



<p>Over an hour at PAX West, Phil Spencer divulged his intimate experiences with the games industry, touching on anecdotes dating back more than twenty years. During his segment, he revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve passed on some of the worst… Like, made some of the worst game-choice decisions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Expanding on that, Spencer revealed that he never secured Destiny effectively at Xbox, missing the opportunity to make it an Xbox exclusive. He admitted it ‘didn’t click’ with him when he played it. It took months for him to be swayed by Destiny, which at the time was naturally close to Microsoft thanks to Bungie being under the firm’s umbrella.</p>



<p>He then spoke about dropping the ball with Guitar Hero because he didn’t think the concept would work:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>An interesting one is when this team came down to Redmond and Alex Rigopulos, he pitches a game where they’re actually going to make plastic guitars, and they’re going to plug into consoles, and then they’re going to sell tracks where you’re going to play Simon on this guitar and I’m like, really? Do we really think that’s going to work?</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-made-some-of-the-worst-game-choice-decisions-says-xbox-boss-phil-spencer">Eurogamer</a> for the quotes</em></p>



<p>Activision ultimately picked up both Destiny and Guitar Hero from a publishing perspective, and both became remarkably successful titles. In 2009, Activision claimed that Guitar Hero 3 was the highest-grossing game of all time, and when it was released, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2011-03-25-npd-guitar-hero-3-is-this-generations-highest-grossing-game.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABT5B4QkI_KEyu55Ptwv1eO_J4F2Q4xxJNL6VOHfLmlYg3qB6GTnQ8gqtoc5cDG_4e77-bn2_bqc1OdmpHZ5bwTnsr6Sa8mhaEnZJyHvS6c7olBcJz_Lu7C9_1NJEELkwYWSN-jjoRZSrkCWTMsmjCmMM90P0oZCNM7NgAQ08TrA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it beat the likes</a> of Wii Fit and Black Ops in gross sales.</p>



<p>In dollars and cents figures, it was claimed that Guitar Hero 3 grossed almost $1 billion.</p>



<p>In Phil Spencer’s words, ‘I heard that turned into a pretty good game…’</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/future-warfare-beta-build-leaks/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In January, gameplay surfaced from a cancelled Call of Duty project that would have been developed and released by Neversoft in 2013. It was dubbed ‘Future Warfare’ and compiled under the codename ‘NX1’, and several months ago, snippets of gameplay were leaked online.</p>



<p>Now, a full Xbox 360-based beta build for Call of Duty: Future Warfare has surfaced online. It was spotted by eagle-eyed Reddit users, with several users on social media posting images and clips of the Call of Duty title sadly lost to the depths of time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prototype-ghosts">‘Prototype Ghosts’</h2>



<p>Both the leaks that surfaced in January and the gameplay leaks that have appeared in recent days bear striking similarities to Call of Duty: Ghosts, the title that was eventually released in 2013. Neversoft was a supporting studio in the development of Call of Duty: Ghosts, with the lead studio being Infinite Ward. </p>



<p>That might go some way to explaining why there are a few resemblances between the two games.</p>



<p>On the Gaming Leaks and Rumours Reddit, images and videos were posted showcasing the leaked beta product, but owing to the terms of service of the site, no download links were provided. However, in the thread that followed, several users advised on how to find and download the build – which we advise you to do with <strong>extreme caution</strong> if you decide to go down that path.</p>



<p>Below is one such clip uploaded to Twitter:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-future-warfare-leaked/">In January’s leaks</a>, we learned the names of several maps, modes, and a bit of context about the story. It was eventually scrapped, but not before Neversoft had pieced together a few campaign missions and some multiplayer content.</p>

            <p>
Enotria: The Last Song, the "summer Soulslike" from Italian indie developer Jyamma Games, has been delayed indefinitely on Xbox - just weeks before its planned 19th September release - with the studio claiming Microsoft has "decided to ignore us" as it attempts to navigate certification.
</p>
<p>
Enotria - a third-person action-adventure set in a sun-lit world inspired by Italian folklore - has had an erratic relationship with Microsoft's platform so far. Back in March, Jyamma revealed it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/italian-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-delayed-avoiding-elden-ring-dlc">no longer be launching Enotria on Xbox</a> at the same time as other platforms, so it could focus its efforts on creating a "superior experience for PC and PS5 players".
</p>
<p>
However, two months later, it announced a revised release date - shifting the game's launch from August to September - with an Xbox version suddenly back on the cards. But Jyamma is now slamming the brakes on once more, delaying Enotria: The Last Song indefinitely on Xbox as a result of what it initially <a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/news/enotria-the-last-song-official-announcement">only referred to</a> as "challenges".

<p>
As <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/they-dont-care-about-enotria-and-they-dont-care-about-you-jyamma-games-ceo-blasts-xbox-amidst-indefinite-delay">spotted by Windows Central</a>, though, Jyamma CEO Jacky Greco later went into additional detail on Discord. Following a community manager's statement dismissing speculation the studio had been "paid by Sony", Greco shared his own frustrations relating to the delay. "You can ask Xbox why they haven't answered us for two months," he wrote. "Obviously they don't care about Enotria and they don't care about you... We've Xbox Series X/S version ready, but we can't proceed with submission and release, I spent a lot of money for porting and they decided to ignore us."
</p>
<p>
A similar statement also <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830673938311250263">appeared</a> on Enotria's X/Twitter feed. After a fan inquired about the "main challenge" holding up release, Jyamma wrote, "Communication with Xbox. The game works fine on Series S and X but we cannot go through the submission process and they can take even two months to reply to us."
</p>
<p>
Greco later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/enotria-xbox-release-delayed/">shared</a> a little more on the issue the studio had enountered, explaining it was unable to open Enotria's Xbox store page and submit the game - something Microsoft's support teams reportedly initially took responsibility for, before further communications were ignored. "We really want to release the game on Xbox ASAP," Jyamma <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830670151106338864">added</a> elsewhere, "but with lack of communication on their side it is a hard task indeed."
</p>
<p>
The suggestion seems to be things might be resolved pretty quickly if Jyamma could get a response from Microsoft, but in the meantime, Enotria: The Last Song will only be available for PlayStation 5 and PC when it launches on 19th September.

<p>Fortnite is soon entering the third week of Chapter 5, Season 4, and players are worried about whether they can collect all battle pass rewards before the season ends. One of the best ways to gain XP and jump through tiers in the battle pass is by completing weekly quests, as completing a set of them can net you loads of XP. This guide will explain how to complete Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4’s Week 2 Quests.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-week-2-quests">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 2 Quests</h2>



<p>The game releases new weekly quests every Tuesday, each granting 20,000 XP to players. Fortnite’s Week 2’s quests for the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/be-a-marvel-hero-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-4-absolute-doom?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Absolute Doom</a> season are as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Eliminate opponents with the Striker AR (3)</li>



<li>Sprint distance after taking damage (100)</li>



<li>Use a Mod Bench in different matches (2)</li>



<li>Damage opponents within 5 seconds of receiving damage (150)</li>



<li>Hire Characters or recruit defeated Henchmen (5)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-fortnite-week-2-quests">How to complete Fortnite Week 2 Quests?</h2>



<h3 id="h-eliminate-opponents-with-the-striker-ar">Eliminate opponents with the Striker AR.</h3>



<p>The first Quest for Fortnite Week 2 can be done quickly. All you need to do is land at one of the new POIs and look for the Striker AR. Alternatively, you can also take on Emma Frost at The Raft and defeat them to acquire the mythic Striker AR. Once you have found the weapon, eliminate 3 NPCs or opponents to complete the quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-sprint-distance-after-taking-damage">Sprint distance after taking damage</h3>



<p>The next one is also an easy task. For this Fortnite Week 2 quest, pick up a fight with one of the NPCs, let them shoot you once and then run like there’s no tomorrow. Keep on running until you receive a ‘Quest Completed’ pop-up.&nbsp;Players have to run for 100 meters to complete this quest. </p>



<h3 id="h-use-a-mod-bench-in-different-matches">Use a Mod Bench in different matches</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 2 quest is challenging, but not for the reasons you think. The main issue with using a mod bench is that it is only available in limited areas: vaults and the floating island. Moreover, these areas are only accessible halfway through the match, so surviving for that long can be challenging for some. However, once you can access the mod bench, you must add one or more attachments to any weapon across two games to complete the quest.</p>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-within-5-seconds-of-receiving-damage">Damage opponents within 5 seconds of receiving damage</h3>



<p>The next one is another challenging quest requiring you to engage in battle. Fortunately, similar to all the other quests, you can complete this quest, too, by damaging NPCs. So just head on over to one of the NPCs, let them shoot you first and reply instantly with a shotgun to the face. One or two tries should be enough to finish the quest. If you feel confident, try completing this against a real player.&nbsp;To compete with this question, you must inflict 150 damage in the first 5 seconds of receiving damage. </p>

<h3 id="h-hire-characters-or-recruit-defeated-henchmen">Hire Characters or recruit defeated Henchmen</h3>



<p>The last Fortnite Week 2 quest has players hiring other characters and henchmen to do their dirty work. Players can find many characters across the map who can be employed with gold bars. On the other hand, Henchman needs to be knocked down first, and then you can interact with the downed Henchman to recruit them.&nbsp;Hiring or recruiting 5 of them should do the trick. </p>

<p>It’s another week, so more headlines about Xbox are due to hit the internet. Enotria: The Last Song has taken the spotlight this time and claimed in its recent press release that it will have to delay its Xbox version due to encountering challenges with Xbox.</p>



<p>As always, social media erupted with wild theories and accusations, with the usual console war bullshit spreading, such as the game had to be delayed due to the Series S. </p>



<p>I managed to talk a little more in-depth to Giacomo Greco, CEO of Jyamma Games, about the issues and why the game has been delayed for Xbox. The TL;DR answer is that the game has been postponed due to a lack of communication from Xbox regarding an issue where the developer can not open its store page and submit the game. Greco tells me that the issue has nothing to do with the hardware limitations of the Series S. In fact, Greco assures me that everything on the Series S runs fine and that there have just been some minor tweaks to the graphic settings.</p>



<p>Greco says that the company has had this issue for months [not allowing them to create a store page] and has been back and forth with various Xbox support teams and people. Still, none of them have figured out the issue and have admitted the problem is on their [Xbox’s] end. In the end, Jyamma Games’ requests eventually fell on deaf ears, meaning that they had to postpone the Xbox version.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Xbox will resolve this issue so that Enotria can be released soon, but Greco said, “We will do our best to make the release [on Xbox] as soon as we can.”</p>



<p>For now, though, Jyamma Games has no answers and a significant hole in its bank from spending on an Xbox port.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Xbox for comment.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-do-you-complete-fortnite-week-1-quests">How do you complete Fortnite Week 1 Quests?</h2>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-while-airborne">Damage opponents while airborne</h3>



<p>The first one is simple: players only need to inflict 500 damage while airborne, and there are two ways to do so. First, you must get your hands on War Machine’s Hover Jets. Then, head to any location with NPCs, fly up in the air, and start riddling them with bullets. Alternatively, you can jump while shooting, and the damage in the air will count towards this Fortnite Week 1 quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-eliminate-an-opponent-with-doctor-doom-s-monarch-pistol-nbsp">Eliminate an opponent with Doctor Doom’s Monarch Pistol&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 1 quest is pretty simple; however, acquiring Doctor Doom’s Monarch Pistol might be challenging. To do so, you must head to Castle Doom and square off with Doombot. Defeating him will grant you the Monarch Pistol and the Doom Gauntlets. Once you have acquired the Monarch Pistol, beat a player or an NPC to complete the quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-reach-10-players-remaining">Reach 10 players remaining</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 1 quest is purely skill-based and may need some tries. Reaching 10 players remaining can be difficult in solos, so consider inviting your friends for this quest.</p>

<h3 id="h-travel-distance-while-airborne-in-a-vehicle">Travel distance while airborne in a vehicle</h3>



<p>For this one, players need to travel 100 meters while airborne in the vehicle, and you can do this in one go if you find the correct slope and use the boosts at the right time. One good strategy would be to drive it off a cliff as the long descent would also help towards the meters travelled. Alternatively, you can also visit the welding tower near Castle Doom and use the wind to get a jump start and then boost away in any direction to complete the Fortnite Week 1 quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-search-chests-in-named-locations-eliminate-opponents-and-collect-common-or-uncommon-weapons-nbsp">Search chests in Named Locations, Eliminate opponents and Collect Common or Uncommon weapons.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The following 3 Fortnite Week 1 quests are pretty simple. The first one needs players to search for 25 chests across all named locations, which can be completed across multiple matches. The next one needs you to eliminate three opponents. For the last one, you must collect 15 common or uncommon weapons. None of these three quests require individual effort and might be completed as you play the game.&nbsp;</p>
