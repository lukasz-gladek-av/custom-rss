			<p>The PlayStation 6 will sport significantly better ray tracing performance than the base PlayStation 5, a performance uplift in line with the current generation system's rasterization performance improvement over the PlayStation 4, which somehow signals a change in focus for the company.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of the Broken Silicon podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> provided additional comments on last week's <a href="https://youtu.be/x9WV8r-T6LI?si=sp3489uSdifLvgTt&amp;t=3327">P</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">layStation 6 leaks</a>, revealing that while specs may have been changed since that presentation, the fundamental idea behind the next-generation system hasn't changed. While the two to three times the PS5 rasterization performance estimation has been confirmed, Moore's Law is Dead provided some additional details on the system's ray tracing performance, saying that it will be five to ten times the current generation system ray tracing performance. </p>



<p>The rasterization and ray tracing performance uplift that the PlayStation 6 will deliver over that of its predecessor makes sense, according to the leaker. Rasterization performance has essentially been saturated, and with the PlayStation 5 already delivering framerates in the 80s range in some titles at 4K resolution, it makes sense to have a limited rasterization performance to hit a reasonable 4K, 120 FPS target for the most common TVs while keeping costs down and still offering a significant performance improvement where it matters more. James Prior, former AMD Senior Product Manager, agrees with this sentiment, as the focus has shifted from rasterization performance to other things like ray tracing and AI upscaling. Additionally, a 4K, 120 FPS capable machine capable of delivering RTX 4080, 5080 performance is going to be a very enticing proposition at anything below $900, especially considering some of the typical console advantages over PCs like smaller form factor, plug and play convenience, power draw and more and the fact that the system is never going to compete with gaming PCs, unlike what the next-generation Xbox could be doing with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">flexibility offered by the Magnus APU</a>.  As such, <span>Sony going the other way </span>in a market with a "$1000 fatigue"&nbsp;with devices like smartphones and GPUs costing $1000 or more would be very interesting.</p>

<p>Going from what has been leaking online in the past few weeks, the next console generation promises to be extremely interesting in some unexpected ways. Hopefully, what the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox will offer will be put to good use to deliver some truly next-gen experiences that could impress even those like Hideo Kojima who are feeling a sort of stagnation with games that <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/">look and play the same.</a></p>

            <p>A brace of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> reporting has treated us to the first details of the game's combat system. Here are the headlines: counter attacks, weapon degradation and an energy bar that lets you perform power moves and dodge in slow motion. It's apparently reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> in that you have a stamina system and the dodge and counter timing can be tricky - a summary I would say also describes Punch-Out! from 1984, if I wanted to be a snarky little shitlord. There are no guns, just melee weapons that range from scavenged baseball bats to naginata polearms, looted from a spirit world of shrines and masked figures. </p><!--more-->
<p>Lob a naginata into an online gaming forum roundabouts now, and there's a one in six chance you'll seriously injure somebody who's miffed about all this. It's possible, mind, that they are miffed because some previewer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours">innocently suggested that Soulslikes might be an influence</a> (the devs haven't spelled this out, as far as I know) and this fleeting observation has been internet-telephoned into the argument that Silent Hill f is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> with schoolgirls. But also, they will be miffed because resenting Silent Hill's combat is integral to enjoying Silent Hill. It is the Silent Hillite's most treasured pastime.</p>
<p>I've held forth in the past about why the series absolutely doesn't need a combat system, and why any and all efforts to "improve" it with more complex mechanics are akin to putting wing mirrors on Pyramid Head. Lately, though, I've found peace in the idea that Silent Hill needing a combat system is Silent Hill's original curse. That need will always haunt the town's hospitals and schools - the ghost of a 'real' action game, tethered to this plane by the whims of commerce, trying to make sense of itself in a story about unschooled protagonists and squishy manifestations of self-loathing, doomed forever to be an uncertain mixture of pretty bad or fine but out-of-place.</p>
<p>It's not like Silent Hill f developers Neobards are breaking terrifying new ground for the series: Silent Hill 4 had weapon degradation already. The strangest aspect of the combat is a special move gauge that's tethered, Amnesia-style, to your character's mental wellbeing. The more spooked she is, the less slow-mo power attack juice she'll have at her disposal. This could be either a bruisingly artificial or clever way of raising the stakes during boss battles. Anyway, I remain more fascinated by the setting and story, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/konamis-first-proper-new-silent-hill-in-an-age-is-a-welcome-change-of-scene-after-the-silent-hill-2-remake">read about here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-a-big-combat-focus-with-weapon-degradation-and-you-know-what-im-sure-itll-be-fine]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Shut up and take my 25 cents!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After almost 20 years of the MCU's dominance—where characters like Gamora and Groot have miraculously become household names and command the careers of A-list actors—we've suddenly found ourselves in a period of nostalgia for Marvel's ramshackle 1990s era. This was first felt with the warm reception that found Disney+'s hugely charming <em>X-Men '97 </em>series, a show that was completely disconnected from any overarching multiversal storylines whatsoever. And the same principles apply to <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion, </em>which is a throwback in every conceivable way. The retro-themed arcade-style spiritual successor to X-Men: The Arcade Game intends to be a back-to-basics brawler, teleporting everyone behind the controller to a simpler time—a dilapidated arcade, deep in the bowels of a suburban mall, right after school lets out for the summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Cosmic Invasion </em>is developed by Tribute Games, the Canadian studio best known for their work on the 2022 revival, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. </em>The two projects clearly share the same DNA. Like Tribute's turn with the Turtles, <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>is gorgeously rendered in beautified pixel art, with all the sprites popping off the screen with vibrant primary colors. There is hardly any story to speak of, at least in the demo I played. (The intergalactic villain Annihlus has unleashed a universe-spanning conquest, and we're here to fend him off.) It's a plot that could fit on the back of a cereal box, and I think that's the point. <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> is not a grimdark, Synder-fied vision of Marvel. Our superheroes have been brought to life exactly as they were found in the comics three decades ago. Captain America looks resplendent in his red white and blue, Wolverine wears a spiky black cowl, while She-Hulk—as she ought to be—is lime green. Too many Robert Downey Jr. monologues have detracted from the fact that these characters are <em>cartoons, </em>at the end of the day. And in that sense, <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>attempts to correct the record.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Cosmic Invasion </em>won't take anyone by surprise with its gameplay. If you are a veteran of quarter-gobbling brawlers—<em>Streets of Rage, Armored Warriors, </em>or my personal favorite, <em>The Simpsons</em>—you know what you're getting into here. A stream of baddies enter from the right side of the screen, and all of them are quickly dispatched with a cocktail of punches, kicks, and grapples until they blink out of existence for good. Once they're clear, you'll move onto the next battleground and rinse and repeat. Eventually you'll encounter a boss at the level's conclusion, which is usually dispatched by standing outside of whatever screen-filling ability they unleash every 20 seconds or so. Like <em>Shredder's Revenge, </em>the controls are simple enough that pretty much everyone can pick up a gamepad and become a useful member of a winning team. (Beat-em-ups are historically amenable to button-mashing younger siblings, and this one is no different.) </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Cosmic Invasion does seem eager to provide a few more opportunities for strategy compared to its forebearers.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But with the expanded roster of 15 unique superheroes at launch, <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>does seem eager to provide a few more opportunities for strategy compared to its forebearers. Our Marvel superstars here have loosely defined roles, corresponding to RPG-esque arrangements. Captain America and his vibranium shield functions like a tank, while Rocket Raccoon—and his arsenal of grenades and laser pistols—excels at taking down enemies from farther away. Across the board, everyone has what you could call an "ultimate" that can only be dispatched when an energy bar ticks full. Yes, <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>is a retro experience, but it has taken a few important cues from the previous decade of game design.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For what it's worth, I was most drawn to She-Hulk. Tribute just announced that she would be joining the roster, and I found her powerhouse offense exactly what I was looking for. The tight acrobatics of Spider-Man and eldritch deep-space assaults of the Silver Surfer are all fine and good. But, sometimes, all I want to do is grab an enemy by the throat and drive them into the ground, snuffing out any chance of a comeback. I imagine <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>will inspire that same feeling in a lot of players. This is a game where it's possible to claim a "main." Don't be fooled by its featherweight exterior. It is very much possible to master all the nuances of your preferred character, and carry the rest of the team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's no surprise <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>seems designed to be a co-op experience first and foremost. That is where the genre historically tends to shine—four buddies on a couch, burning off a Saturday night by fighting through the Negative Zone. But Tribute Games has smartly introduced a mechanic that makes the adventure surprisingly adaptable to a solo campaign. Players select <em>two </em>superheroes at the character select screen, and they can swap them out at will during the levels—like a tag-team from <em>Marvel vs. Capcom. </em>Time the swap correctly, and you'll be able to chain together some truly flashy combos that look like a triumphant splash panel. I like the idea of being able to mess around with my own builds, and construct some devastating synergies, without necessarily having someone join me on our quest to crush Annihilus. It may offer <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>more staying power than the delightful but transient <em>Shredder's Revenge.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I only saw two levels of <em>Cosmic Invasion</em>. I carved up the streets of Midtown Manhattan—in front of Spider-verse locales like the Daily Bugle, and billboards for the in-universe soap opera <em>Secret Hospital. </em>(If there's one thing Tribute Games truly excels at, it's populating their licensed products with the sort of references that only superfans will get.) Later we explored a helicarrier that seemed to exist primarily so that I could toss hapless soldiers off the edge and to their death. (It also was the site of an elevator battle, which remains one of the great beat-em-up traditions.) It remains to be seen if <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>will be able to sustain its magic across a full campaign. Will tearing apart the legion of evildoers be as joyful during hour six as it is during this glorious prelude? It's tough to say for sure. But if nothing else, <em>Cosmic Invasion </em>makes an indelible first impression.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-cosmic-invasion-is-exactly-what-90s-kids-want-it-to-be]]></content:encoded>

That's a very loose description if we're being honest, as this new teaser is essentially a highlight reel of gore that shows off a variety of methods for inflicting brutal damage on the infected around you. If you're squeamish and you don't want to lose your lunch, then you might want to look away, as this sizzle reel of ultraviolence doesn't hold back.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyhySFnQpmg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SyhySFnQpmg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Techland says that the "primal brutality" of Dying Light: the Beast isn't just for show, as it's meant to mirror protagonist Kyle Crane's thirst for revenge. After being imprisoned for a decade and subjected to brutal experiments, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-smashes-through-the-zombie-horde-in-august/1100-6532167/">Crane's got some pent-up frustration</a> that he needs to let go of, and it looks like carnage is his catharsis, thanks to his new rage-fueled powers.</p><p>"We've dramatically increased the body horror to give you this feeling of fighting for pure survival and Kyle's hunger for revenge," Dying Light franchise director Tymon Smektała said in a press statement. It's one thing to see a health bar go down; it's another entirely to see the flesh peel away from bone or have a burnt and destroyed faces only inches away from you--that’s how nightmares are made!"</p><p>To amp up the bodily harm in the game, Techland says that the art team did extensive research to improve all of the visuals of wounds and injuries. These also match with the various infected bodies seen on the streets, and to create realistic blood splatters, <a href="https://youtu.be/1JQ7bUrOka0" rel="nofollow ">the studio brought in gallons of fake blood</a> and recreated what it needed in real-life with an actor. "I just hope no one ever looks up my browser history," lead character artist Dominik Wasieńko said.</p><p>Originally scheduled to launch in August, Dying Light: The Beast will be out on September 19 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Make sure to check out our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-find-diamonds-in-minecraft-best-diamond-mining-level/1100-6531708/">Minecraft diamonds</a> for tips on how to easily find enough for crafting your armor.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting, <strong>Chainmail</strong> is an armor set that can't be crafted. Chainmail can only be obtained through mob drops, chest loot, and trading. It's recommended to use the Looting III <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-enchantment-guide-roundup-everything-you-need-to-know-about-enchanting-your-gear/1100-6497408/">enchantment</a> on your sword or other tool to increase your chances of these drops.</p><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Netherite armor</strong> set is actually an upgrade to the diamond armor, so you can't actually craft a set of this type. Instead, you'll need to complete a more complicated process, which we guide you through below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528306-fulldiamondarmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528306" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528306-fulldiamondarmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528306"></a><figcaption>Full diamond armor</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528306-fulldiamondarmor.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_craft_armor_pieces">How to craft armor pieces</h2><p dir="ltr">You can place leather, gold, iron, or diamond materials in the crafting grid to create sets made of those four material types. No matter the type, each set piece will need a specific amount of materials.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft a helmet, you'll need five of the same material. For the chestplate, you'll need eight of the same material. The leggings require seven of the same type, and the boots require four.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Netherite_armor_upgrade">Netherite armor upgrade</h2><p dir="ltr">The Netherite set requires a few steps before you can upgrade, but this is the best armor in Minecraft and a recommended option if you're planning on fighting the boss-like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-warden-spawns-drops-and-how-to-beat/1100-6531623/">Warden mobs</a> or taking down the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-ender-dragon-boss-guide-where-to-find-and-how-to-beat/1100-6531625/">Ender Dragon</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Upgrading to a suit of Netherite armor takes Netherite Ingots and smithing templates to upgrade. First, we'll start with the ingots.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Netherite">How to get Netherite</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528304-ancientdebris.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528304" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528304-ancientdebris.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528304"></a><figcaption>Ancient Debris block</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528304-ancientdebris.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Netherite is a material found by mining Ancient Debris found in the Nether. Ancient Debris can be found between levels Y-8 and 24, but level 15 is one of the most abundant for this block type. These blocks can only be mined with a diamond pickaxe, so make sure you have one equipped. The blocks look like brown versions of cobblestone and an example can be seen in the image above. They won't just be visible from the surface of the nether, you'll need to mine blocks away to reveal them.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_make_Netherite_Ingots">How to make Netherite Ingots</h3><p dir="ltr">Ancient Debris can be smelted in a furnace to make Netherite Scrap. These scraps can then be crafted into Netherite Ingots. One block of Ancient Debris makes a single Netherite Scrap, and you need four scraps and four gold ingots to make one Netherite Ingot. Four ingots are needed to upgrade a full set of diamond armor to Netherite, and this math means you need 16 ingots total.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_a_Netherite_Upgrade_Smithing_Template">How to get a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template</h3><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Netherite Ingots, you'll also need to head into the Nether in search of a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template item. These are found by looting a Bastion, which are the castle-like structures with Piglins. These are mostly random finds in the chest, but the Treasure Room variant of the Bastions has a guaranteed template spawn. Head all the way down into the bottom of this bastion and loot the chest found in the gold room. This is a guaranteed spawn for the Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template.</p><p dir="ltr">You need <strong>one template for each armor piece</strong> in the set. It's tedious to search for four of these in the Nether, but you can duplicate them at a crafting table. You'll need to place the Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template, a block of Netherrack, and seven diamonds into the crafting grid in order to duplicate the item. Repeat this process until you have at least four, and you might want to duplicate a fifth time so you have one saved for a future upgrade.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528307-smithingnetheritearmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528307" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528307-smithingnetheritearmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528307"></a><figcaption>Smithing the Netherite armor upgrade</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528307-smithingnetheritearmor.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_upgrade_to_Netherite_armor">How to upgrade to Netherite armor</h3><p dir="ltr">Once you have your templates, ingots, and diamond armor pieces, you can then head to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-craft-and-use-a-minecraft-smithing-table/1100-6531944/">smithing table</a> to upgrade your armor set.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_repair_armor">How to repair armor</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Anvil_method">Anvil method</h3><p dir="ltr">It can be a lot of work to craft armor sets, and you'll want to maintain your set pieces after you've battled against mobs. Damaged armor can best be repaired by using an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-an-anvil-in-minecraft/1100-6524993/">anvil</a>. The anvil can be used in two different ways, and while <strong>both of these methods cost XP</strong>, the anvil will preserve any enchantments on your armor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528309-repairinghelmetatanvil.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528309" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528309-repairinghelmetatanvil.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528309"></a><figcaption>Repairing an iron helmet at an anvil</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528309-repairinghelmetatanvil.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One way is to add two items of the exact same type into the anvil. An example would be to place a diamond helmet with the lowest durability into the first slot and an additional diamond helmet into the second slot.</p><p dir="ltr">The second way requires you to cover the cost of repair with a material. Add the item you want to repair into the first slot, and then add the corresponding material into the second slot. So, for repairing a diamond helmet this way, you'll need diamonds to pay the material cost.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Combining_method">Combining method</h3><p dir="ltr">You can technically repair armor pieces by combining them with another armor piece of the exact same type. Example: An iron helmet is needed to combine with another iron helmet.</p><p dir="ltr">This method isn't recommended if you have enchantments on your armor because the process of combining it will <strong>remove the existing enchantments</strong>. However, this can be the cheaper alternative if you don't have any enchantments to preserve and you have extra armor pieces you're looking to reduce in your inventory.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_customize_armor">How to customize armor</h2><p dir="ltr">If you care about how you look in battle, the smithing table also lets you add a colorful flair to your set with armor trim.

In particular, it's a frustrating point when considering how much fandom drives the success of certain productions.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking at FanX's Tampa Bay Comic Convention (via <a href="https://collider.com/baldurs-gate-3-aliona-baranova-game-adaptations-actor-inequality/" rel="nofollow ">Collider</a>), Baranova said that it's "a shame that the video game audience is being overlooked when it comes to screen projects. We see from you guys how dedicated you are … and I feel like that's been neglected at the moment by filmmakers [and] studios."</p>

<p dir="ltr">She went on to note how dedication from fans, particularly from queer communities, can really lift a film or show up. "There was a medical drama I did in the UK … Maternal. I’ve seen that it’s been translated into Chinese, all my scenes have been found, translated into Chinese, and put on Bilibili and watched thousands of times," Baranova said. She also noted how other Baldur's Gate 3 stars have found a lot of support, like the voice of Shadowheart, Jennifer English, who "had a short film at the BFI that premiered … she posted a story on Instagram, and last minute, 60 people travelled to come and support her."</p><p dir="ltr">In turn, because of how fans of video game actors can show massive amounts of support for various projects they're involved in, Baranova finds it frustrating when they get overlooked, pointing to how "Ashley Johnson was the number-one-most-looked-up person on IMDb," when her episode of the live-action adaptation of The Last of Us came out. "Why is more of that not happening? Why was Doug Cockle not in the TV series, The Witcher? Why are we not being considered when there's video game adaptations? Even animated adaptations like Arcane, we would love to be part of those."</p><p dir="ltr">It's probably worth noting that in the case of the live-action Witcher series, that one is a separate adaptation of the books, even if it can't be denied it might not exist without the success of the games. The point still stands that adaptations of games do often leave out the people that helped make them, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-composer-of-dk-rap-goes-uncredited-in-super-mario-bros-movie/1100-6512983/">in all sorts of ways</a>. As Baranova put it, it's a "shame that that's being overlooked. It's being slept on."</p>

The game's Steam page revealed that the game requires between 55GB and 80GB of storage space, which, even at the high end, is smaller than some modern games.</p><p>A spokesperson for EA told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/bucking-the-trend-of-triple-digit-installs-ea-confirms-battlefield-6s-file-size-can-be-as-low-as-55-gigs-you-will-be-able-to-pick-and-choose-which-components-of-the-game-you-install/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> that the discrepancy in file sizes for Battlefield 6 on Steam comes down to how players can pick and choose which components of the game they want to install. For example, players can choose to only install single-player or multiplayer, if they wish.</p>

      </div>
<p>The exact file sizes for Battlefield 6's various installable components were not made clear, nor do we know if the same option will be available on console, or the file sizes for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. GameSpot has contacted EA in an attempt to get more details.</p><p>Battlefield's main competitor in the FPS space, Call of Duty, is known for its gigantic file sizes and storage space requirements. Like Battlefield, though, players can pick and choose what elements of a Call of Duty game they want to install, whether that's the campaign, multiplayer, or other parts.</p><p>Call of Duty HQ, the launcher that includes the newest Call of Duty games, just got significantly smaller, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-two-call-of-duty-games-are-being-removed-from-cod-hq-today/1100-6533512/" data-ref-id="1100-6533512">two major Call of Duty games leaving the launcher.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6's open beta begins August 7 for a limited group of players before expanding more widely later in the month. Preloading is available now on all platforms, and you can find out more in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">GameSpot's Battlefield 6 open beta guide. </a></p>

<p>Sign of the times</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a brand new overview trailer for the catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, and it has given us our first look at a new batch of Mouthful Mode transformations.</p>
<p>We first locked eyes on Spring Mouth way back at the game's Switch 2 reveal, but Gear Mouth and Sign Mouth are completely new! Gear Mouth gives Kirb some sweet rolling abilities, granting him the power to stick to walls and roll across moving platforms with ease. Sign Mouth, meanwhile, turns the pink puffball into a makeshift sledge for top-speed downhill racing. Side note: we're a little bit in love with Sign Mouth.</p>
<p>Outside of these newbies, the trailer provides a bit of clarity on the game's Star-Crossed World expansion, making clear that you'll be able to dive right in after you've finished the first area. It also highlights the new Colosseum mode, Ultimate Cup Z - EX, which looks to provide a more challenging Boss Rush for those after an extra slice of difficulty.</p>
<p>We're also pleased to see the confirmation that the Switch 2's improved graphics and faster frame rates will be put to good use in the main game and not <em>just</em> the expansion — we're looking at you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, this one arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>28th August</strong> as both a stand-alone purchase and an upgrade pack.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Quake III Arena Remaster May Be In The Works]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/quake-iii-arena-remaster-works/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Quake III Arena remaster may be in the works by Nightdive Studios, judging from a not-so-subtle tease from the developer itself.</p>



<p>As spotted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/quake/">Quake series subreddit</a>, the developer has pinned a comment on its livestream that reads: <em>"All eyes, I mean Orbbs, will be on that announcement."</em> For those not in the know, Orbbs is the name of one of the bots available in Quake III Arena for offline play, so the developer pinning this comment definitely sounds like a tease for one of their upcoming announcement.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/remaster-experts-nightdive-studios-stand-ready-to-take-on-remastering-ps3-and-xbox-360-games/">Nightdive Studios</a> working on a Quake III Arena remaster wouldn't be surprising at all, considering how the development studio has brought several classic first-person shooters like System Shock to modern platforms and has worked with other developers to modernize classics with new content, including the first entry in the Quake series. Unlike these other titles, however, Quake III Arena is a multiplayer-focused title, so it will be very interesting to see how the studio will go about remastering one of the most influential competitive first-person shooters ever made.</p>



<p>Quake III Arena was launched back in 1999 on PC, and, despite being very different from its predecessor, it's regarded as one of the finest FPS ever released. With its multiplayer-only formula that did away with a traditional single-player campaign, the third entry in the series by id Software has influenced countless competitive FPS games, including Unreal Tournament and even more modern games like Overwatch. Hopefully, soon enough, even those who never had the chance to try the game out will be able to see for themselves how the game changed first-person shooters as a whole back in the day.</p>

            <p>A stickfellow in a top hat's just burst through a twentieth story window, taking a fatal tumble down the corporate ladder, and all because I lobbed a parcel at him. This kind of thing happens all the time in Stick It to the Stickman, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">beat ’em up</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anger-foot">Anger Foot</a> devs Free Lives are set to release in early access form later this month.</p>
<p>It's glorious enough to forgive any frustration you might have been left with when publishers Devolver Digital <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-have-delayed-baby-steps-skate-story-stick-it-to-the-stickman-into-2025">announced late last year</a> that the corporate slapfest had been delayed into 2025.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you can probably make out from the trailer below, Stick It to the Stickman's premise is cathartically simple: "Stickmen need jobs, but more importantly, shareholders need growth. Climb to the top of the tower to crush your boss's nuts, and please note that 50% of office work is kicking stickmen out of windows." Once you brawl your way to the roof of the office in simply cathartic fashion, you fight the existing CEO for the honour of leading the corporate megastructure, and the power to choose between spitting in the face of or bowing before the cabalistic corpoverlords which rule all.</p>
<p>The game's finally set to come out in early access form on August 18, but you can get a taste of its floppy fisticuffs by giving a freshly-revamped Steam demo a go. I have, and as my first exposure to sticking a fleshy wrench in the gears of capitalism, it gets a big thumbs up.</p>

<p>You start off sitting on a park bench, then beat your way through a throng of job applicants gathered around the lobby of a skyscraper. Naturally, you're asked to provide a reference in the form of the name of a friend who already works at the firm. Once you're hired, your first task is to beat this old friend and Fortnite buddy senseless via slapstick scuffle. Then, it's off up the tower, climbing ladders and entering lifts that sound suspiciously like toilets flushing to reach ever new levels of suited sticks in need of dragon punching, spin kicking, or just having a coffee mug lobbed at their bonce.</p>
<p>Free Lives seem to have gotten the mix of hilarious body floatiness once a stickperson gets smacked and the weighty punch you want inflicting such a blow to have pretty close to the sweet spot. Much like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gang-beasts">Gang Beasts</a>, the cartoony physicality's top notch. The jokes about capitalism are pretty damn funny to boot.</p>
<p>The devs are aiming to have Stick It to the Stickman's early access last for "approximately 12 months", with fresh additions being made each month. "We plan on expanding the corporation to include manufacturing, marketing, a science center and a doomsday bunker, as well as corporate lobbying," they write. "Each new job within the game will have unique gameplay. And each new job will take the player one step closer to the final chapter of the story."</p>
<p>I'm pretty hooked on booting execs out of windows thanks to the demo, so this is definitely on my radar going forward.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unleash-blunt-force-castration-on-execs-when-stick-it-to-the-stickman-finally-launches-in-early-access-this-month]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Today’s Morning Checkpoint–<em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about–is filled with some good news, like new awesome retro game music being added to the Nintendo Music app, and also some bad news, like <em>IGN</em> losing more staff members as parent company Ziff Davis continues to make cuts. We also have some new and intriguing data on how popular (or not popular) video game engine Unity is in 2025, and more.</p> <h2>Stop Killing Games Enters Its Next Stage: Waiting</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Stop Killing Games: Wrap up" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNkwxlLdkSo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>For the past year, Ross Scott’s campaign against game publishers shutting down online games completely and making them unplayable has been quite active. But now, the Stop Killing Games campaign has entered a new phase which is mostly about waiting to see what happens. That’s because the campaign’s biggest focus, an EU petition asking for lawmakers to pressure publishers into keeping games playable, is no longer accepting signatures. Now, in a new “wrap-up” video for Stop Killing Games, Scott says he’s going to take a break while he waits to see what happens, but he has assured supporters that he’ll pop back up if and when he’s needed.</p> <h2>More layoffs at the biggest gaming site, <em>IGN</em></h2> <p>On August 4, <em>IGN</em> parent company Ziff Davis laid off eight more staff members, as confirmed by the IGN Creator’s Guild Union. This follows additional layoffs at Ziff Davis and comes months after the multibillion-dollar company pushed some employees out via buyouts. Last year, three <em>IGN</em> staffers were laid off.</p>

 <p>“The company has told us that the reason for this layoff stems from a Ziff Davis-mandate to cut costs despite several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases, to which IGN Entertainment responded by coming for our members’ jobs,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a">explained the IGN Union in a message posted to social media</a>. “This is perplexing to us, as we are told again and again that IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far thanks to their hard work.”</p> <h2>All the songs from <em>Pilotwings</em> games are available on Nintendo’s music app</h2> <p>Nintendo continues to update and expand its Nintendo Online subscriber-only music player app. On August 5, the company added the full soundtracks from the entire <em>Pilotwings</em> series, which includes<em> Pilotwings, Pilotwings 64, </em>and <em>Pilotwings Resort</em>, to the Nintendo Music app. As with most other songs in the app, these tracks can be extended and looped for up to an hour. Finally, you can listen to the excellent song “<a href="https://youtu.be/s1vfrMel8iI?t=15">Flight Club</a>” for as long as you desire while doing something else.</p> <h2>The Switch 2 might be getting smaller game cart sizes</h2> <p>Taiwanese tech company Marconix, which is the company responsible for creating the game carts used by Nintendo for the Switch 2, <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/taiwanese-manufacturers-fiscal-update-could-hint-at-more-storage-sizes-for-switch-2-game-cards/">revealed in its latest fiscal update</a> that it is planning to produce carts in more capacity sizes. Currently, there is only one large 64 GB option, which is handy for big games like<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but is a very expensive option for smaller games that don’t need all that space. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-survey-game-key-carts-2000614465">This has likely contributed to the high number of third-party publishers opting for game key cards</a> on Switch 2. Hopefully, these new size options from Marconix will mean fewer publishers use the controversial game key card option in the future.</p>

 <h2>Unity is becoming a less popular engine for game devs</h2> <p>In 2021, around 60 percent of game devs who participated in the Game Maker’s Toolkit Game Jam were using Unity. Now, new data from the popular YouTube channel reveals that in 2025, only 41 percent of the submitted games are using Unity. Many devs seem to be moving to Godot, a free and open-source game engine that has become more and more popular following some really dumb moves by Unity.</p>   <p>Back in 2023, Unity announced a series of controversial runtime fees that would cost devs a lot of money if their games became popular and were installed by many users. The company eventually walked back some and <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-install-runtime-fees-canceled-ceo-blog-post-price-1851647405">then eventually all of these plans</a>, but the whole ordeal left a sour taste in the mouths of many developers. And while this is just data from one game jam, it still seems to show that Unity might have to do a lot to win back smaller devs who don’t trust the company anymore.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-elder-scrolls-mod-remake-remaster-2000614628">The Other, Fan-Made <em>Oblivion</em> Remake Just Got An Awesome New Trailer</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/and-roger-review-tearyhand-studio-pc-steam-switch-2000614568">One Of 2025’s Most Special, Emotional Games Is $5 And Will Take You An Hour To Finish</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-director-teases-next-crazy-thing-sequel-2000614546"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> Director Teases Studio’s ‘Next Crazy Thing’</a></li> </ul>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tmnt-goes-turn-based-in-tactical-takedown-skating-onto-switch-next-week</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Well, here's an unexpected bit of news! After launching on PC earlier this year, Strange Scaffold has announced that its turn-based take on TMNT will be flipping onto Switch on <strong>14th August</strong> — wait, that's next week!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a> is all about turn-based action. You'll play as Leo, Raph, Donnie, or Mikey, as you flip, punch, and dash your way through a campaign that sees both Shredder and Master Splinter dead and gone, leaving the heroes in a half-shell to find their own way in the world.</p>
<p>It's a different, more strategic approach to the Turtles than we've seen from the IP before, but the developer promises an "innovative turn-based beat-em-up combat", so there should be just enough combo-focused Cowabunga-ing to keep the old and new Shell Heads happy.</p>
<p>All of this is presented in an almost tabletop visual style, which sees the Turtles moving across the grid on stands as if they are cardboard cutouts. In short, it looks awesome.</p>
<p>As if that wasn't enough, the Switch version will launch with the all-new Remix Mode, which throws in more enemy variety, higher difficulty, and an increased importance on your Turtle's loadout. This mode will unlock for each level once you complete it, so you don't even need to wait until the end of the game to get involved.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a couple of screenshots from the Tactical Takedown Steam Page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 20 action-packed levels, divided into campaigns focusing on individual characters.<br>
- A unique take on the world of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the minds at Strange Scaffold (Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, I Am Your Beast).<br>
- Innovative turn-based beat-em-up combat, complete with mutating arenas.<br>
- Gorgeous graphic novel-inspired art style, with paint splatter, figurines, and diorama setpieces.<br>
- Customizable movesets to shape each Turtles' playstyle.<br>
- Thumping multi-genre soundtrack from award-winning composer RJ Lake (Unbeatable, I Am Your Beast).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have been keeping our fingers crossed to see this one on Switch for a good few months now (heck, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/we-really-want-to-see-this-turn-based-tmnt-game-come-to-switch">did we manifest it</a>?), so let's hope it's every bit as <em>totally tubular</em> as it seems.</p>

<p><em>Will you be picking this one up on Switch next week? Skate down to the comments and let us know.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tmnt-goes-turn-based-in-tactical-takedown-skating-onto-switch-next-week]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I'd love to say that Bloodgrounds plunged me into a crimson mist, but in practice, this arena tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with town-building feels as cosy as a pair of soft leather socci on a frosty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>. The setup: you are a gladiator from a Roman-themed fantasy world, who has recently won his freedom in the arena. How is he celebrating his freedom? By becoming a gladiator manager himself, as he continues his quest for vengeance upon the Emperor who slaughtered his father.</p>
<p>I guess this is the optimal Russell Crowe career path, but still, imagine if he'd hung up his sword and reinvented himself as a carpet salesman. Instead of continuing the cycle of violence that was so cruelly forced upon you, you'd have to educate clients on pile density and antistatics while politely parrying their requests to hear about the time you ripped that Scandinavian's ears off with your toes.</p>

<p>People would point out that you sure have a lot of <em>blood-red</em> carpets in your carpet shop, har har, and you would smile delicately and consider your wine goblet and say "maroon and rose, actually". For every query like this, another maroon or rose carpet would appear in your shop and another townsperson would mysteriously go on holiday for the rest of their lives. Anyway, I forget why I'm talking about carpets. Oh yeah, that gladiator game.</p>
<p>Gladiators need to win the crowd, and Bloodgrounds is very much playing the hits (5% critical chance). Its tussles take place in handsomely decked pixelart stadiums boasting such ornamental fixtures as flaming torches and crucified bodies. Your characters and enemies move around according to an initiative bar along the top. There's a no-nonsense distinction between movement points and action points, which are used to perform regular attacks and special abilities, while consumables can be played for free.</p>
<p>The character classes seem both familiar and busily outfitted. There are helmeted thuggoes who can rope-dart people and stun them with a pommel; strutting retiarii equipped with throw-net and trident; archers who can set exploding traps from afar. Leering, scarred and eye-patched humans aside, you'll dally with mythical beasties such as spectral reapers and brazen quadrotor automatons. The arenas themselves have terrain fixtures such as mounted crossbows, and yes, the audience may lob in a power-up or two if they like the cut of your gibs. Preferably, your enemy's gibs.</p>
<p>Between clashes, you retire to your landscape-view villa where you can hire fresh meat and send any less than fresh meat to the infirmary. Much as in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Dankest Sturgeon</a>, you'll add and upgrade buildings with your winnings at other arenas, scattered across a world map of escalating difficulty. Each town facility has its talking head, and I find the writing and characters quite charming so far. Your architect, for example, is a sarcastic ghost sheep who probably began life in an Ovid story somewhere. Good for him.</p>
<p>Bloodgrounds launches this year. Developers Exordium Games are them wot did spacey shmup Last Encounter and horror comedy mystery <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bear-with-me">Bear With Me</a>. It's published by Daedalic, who seem to have a thing for Romans lately - this January, they launched 4X strategy game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1561960/Yield_Fall_of_Rome/">Yield! Fall of Rome</a> from Billionworlds into early access.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-win-the-crowd-in-bloodgrounds-a-gladiator-tactics-rpg-with-darkest-dungeon-style-town-management]]></content:encoded>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a> is singlehandedly saving August 2025 from being a sleeper month for Game Pass. The stealth blockbuster arrives alongside some smaller games in a surprisingly good month for the Xbox subscription service’s cheaper tier. If you’ve only been subscribed to Game Pass Standard, some of the year’s best games are about to fall into your lap.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/05/xbox-game-pass-august-2025-wave-1/">full schedule</a> for Game Pass games arriving in the first half of August 2025:</p> <blockquote><p><em><strong>Rain World</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard) – August 5<br> <em><strong>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard) – August 6<br> <em><strong>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard)&nbsp;– August 6<br> <em><strong>MechWarrior 5: Clans</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard)&nbsp;– August 6<br> <em><strong>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Standard) – August 6<br> <em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 7<br> <em><strong>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 12<br> <em><strong>9 Kings</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Preview, PC-only) (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 14</p></blockquote> <p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> is a decent return to more old-school stealthing with a bit less of the modern-day RPG bloat that’s come to define the recent open-world entries in the series like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. Meanwhile, <em>9 Kings</em> is a neat, top-down strategy roguelike that came to Steam Early Access back in May. Then there’s <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>, a good-enough co-op shooter that arrives back on Game Pass after leaving the service years ago.</p>

 <p>The real winners this month, however, are Game Pass Standard subscribers. <em>MechWarrior 5: Clans</em> is one of 2024’s more overlooked gems, nailing the in-universe mood and storytelling and backing it up with solid action and mech customization. <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> and <em>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</em>, both out earlier this year, are strong GOTY runnerups. Folks on the cheaper Game Pass tier should be eating well for a bit, even as August is a quieter month overall for paying Ultimate customers on console. The arrival of <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> later in the month should offset the current doldrums for them, though.</p> <p>Sadly, August 15 is also when <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> finally leaves Game Pass. Good luck finishing it by then if you haven’t already!</p>
