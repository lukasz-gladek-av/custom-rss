<p>It is a sad day for the Valorant scene, after the popular competitor, TenZ, announced his official retirement. In a long video posted on Twitter, the pro Valorant player gave his reasons why he was ready to walk away from competitive Valorant.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tenz-announces-retirement-from-valorant-still-on-sentinels">TenZ Announces Retirement From Valorant; Still on Sentinels</h2>



<p>The famous pro Valorant player shared all of his thoughts on walking away from the competitive Valorant scene earlier today on Twitter in a two-minute video.</p>



<p>“It’s not really easy to say, but I am retiring from competitive play,” said TenZ on Twitter. “I’ve known since the start of this year, I told myself this is my last year, and it was definitely a moment for me to give it my all and play without any regrets.</p>



<p>Known as one of the greatest Valorant players in the world, TenZ and the Sentinels team just recently finished fourth in Valorant Champions 2024, while also finishing first back in March during the VCT 2024: Masters Madrid event.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“Playing as a pro player is definitely a big time commitment. You’re committing your entire life to be the best. It is a lot of work and can be quite tiring. There is just a lot of stuff I want to do outside of the game.”</p>



<p>TenZ has already made Valorant history as one of the most decorative players within the game. His skill and competitive gameplay has had a massive impact on quite a few players and fans. Watching him walk away will be tough for many.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-tenz-still-will-stay-with-sentinels-in-the-meantime">TenZ Still Will Stay With Sentinels in the Meantime</h2>



<p>Just because he is retiring from Sentinels, does not mean the famous pro Valorant player will be leaving his beloved team, Sentinels. TenZ also made sure that everyone knew he was still a part of the organization and will be around if they ever needed to sub him in for a tournament.</p>



<p>“They have really created something beautiful here,” said TenZ when talking about the fans behind Sentinels. “There is such a huge backing behind Sentinels. “And overall, it was amazing just being able to play in front of a crowd that was always wearing red and cheering for us in the stands.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>With Valorant Champions having just ended a few weeks ago, TenZ’s retirement comes as a shock to many. However, it seems as if the player is set on new things in life and plans to live every day forward to the fullest. Now, who can be upset with that?</p>

            <p>Back in June, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-game-called-one-million-checkboxes-has-sparked-a-terrible-online-war">Edwin covered One Million Checkboxes</a>, a website with one million checkboxes that players could check or uncheck, with any change visible to all other visitors of the site. It became an obsession for some in the two weeks the website was online, as players fought to fill all the boxes, or undo the work of their peers.
</p>
<p>The fight was far more complicated than it seemed, as the developer recently explained, with some players finding ways to encode hidden messages in the checkboxes.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Half a million people visited the site within days of launch. Folks checked 650,000,000 boxes in the 2 weeks I kept the site online," wrote Nolen Royalty <a href="https://x.com/itseieio/status/1829268247105138764">in a recent Twitter thread</a>. 
</p>
<p>With so many people playing, Nolen was concerned that people would use the checkboxes to spell out offensive messages on such a vast public canvas. His solution was to make the rows of checkboxes scale to the size of your browser, meaning messages spelled out via checked boxes would only align and be readable at certain widths. 
</p>
<p>"This meant that if you drew something on your phone it wouldn't show up for me on my laptop and vice-versa. I think this worked well; we didn't get bogged down in gross graffiti and since the constraint was subtle most people didn't even notice," he writes.
</p>
<p>This wasn't the only way to create messages in the checkboxes, however. Each checkbox was effectively a bit - the most basic unit of information in computing. A bit is either a 0 or a 1, much like a checkbox is unchecked or checked. 
</p>
<p>At some point, Nolen re-wrote the backend to keep the website online while so many players were using it simultaneously, and he decided "dump the database in ASCII." ASCII is basically the code that stores text in computers. "I have no idea why I did this. I just did it."
</p>
<p>What you'd normally expect to see in this situation is total gibberish, as the checkboxes are converted to random strings of letters and numbers. Instead Nolen found messages - specifically website URLs.
</p>
<p>"A URL with 'catgirls' in it was sitting there in my database and I PANICKED. I thought I'd been hacked! I started searching through my code, searching through my logs, trying to find the problem."
</p>
<p>The website hadn't been hacked, however. Instead, while some players were battling one another to check and uncheck boxes, some others were using the checkboxes to spell out messages in binary. Seemingly they'd written a bot to recreate these message should anyone come along and check or uncheck a vital box. The URL? It pointed to a Discord called "Checking Boxes", where a small number of players had gathered. The players are understandably excited when suddenly the game's creator showed up in their server.
</p>
<p>One of the Discord members then asks Nolen if he's looked at the game as a 1000x1000 image yet. When he did, it looked like this:
</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">So there's a lot going on here! In addition to the drawings, we've got some secrets. There's the binary message I found, but above that is a base64 version of the same message. And we've also got a QR code (with full error correction) that linked to the discord. <a href="https://t.co/DWXhY4yRQq">pic.twitter.com/DWXhY4yRQq</a></p>— nolen (@itseieio) <a href="https://twitter.com/itseieio/status/1829270474964304284?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
<span data-position="2"></span></p><p>"The Discord was full of very sharp teens, and they were writing this message in secret to gather other very sharp teens," writes Nolen. "And it totally worked!! There were 15 people when I joined the discord but over 60 by the time I shut down the site. (the discord is now hidden)"
</p>
<p>Over the course of the two weeks, these players used their bots to create a blue screen of death image that <a href="https://x.com/itseieio/status/1829270643596292230">almost filled the entire play area</a>, covered it <a href="https://x.com/itseieio/status/1829270706405638560">in other memes and logos</a>, and even managed to create an animated rickroll:
</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>"It was sick. It was so cool. And I found this so moving," writes Nolen. "I spent my childhood doing dumb stuff on the computer. People mostly didn't get mad at me when I, for example, repeatedly broke my school mail server.
</p>
<p>"There's no way I'd be doing what I do now without that encouragement.
</p>
<p>"So getting to provide some encouragement of my own - providing a playground like this and seeing what folks were doing and telling them how much I loved it - was so deeply meaningful to me."
</p>
<p>"Many people were mad about bots on OMCB. I totally get that. Bots can be frustrating. But the people in this discord were so creative, so talented, so cool! The mischief makers of today will make the games of tomorrow," he concluded. "I can't wait to see what this discord goes on to make".
</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="https://eieio.games/">Nolen's work</a>, which includes the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lets-have-a-staring-contest">staring game</a> we've written about previously, because it evokes an older, more experimental, more playful version of the internet. The tagline of his site is "The internet can still be fun!" and players doing dumb, mischievous stuff is part of that same spirit. Well done, everybody.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Team Liquid is officially the first team to advance to The International 2024 (TI13) Grand Finals after the team swept Gaimin Gladiators with a 2-0 score. While they may be headed to the Finals, other teams, such as Tundra Esports, are still fighting as the gaming organization officially moved towards the Lower Bracket Finals.</p>



<p>For Tundra Esports, the chance of winning The International twice is in their grasp. Team Liquid, however, is proving to put up a worthy fight against any and all of their opponents.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-team-liquid-advance-to-ti13-finals-winning-against-gaimin-gladiators">Team Liquid Advance to TI13 Finals, Winning Against Gaimin Gladiators</h2>



<p>It was a glorious day for Team Liquid in Dota 2 competition, after the esports team was victorious against the Gaimin Gladiators, winning 2-0. The competition was a best-of-three, with Team Liquid’s win advancing them to the Grand Finals.</p>



<p>As of now, we do not know who they will be competing against for the Finals, which is set to take place tomorrow, September 15.</p>



<p>However, the competition may not be settled between Team Liquid and Gaimin Gladiators, as the Gladiators are set to play against Tundra Esports in the Lower Bracket Final later today.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-tundra-esports-advance-to-lower-bracket-finals">Tundra Esports Advance to Lower Bracket Finals</h2>



<p>Tundra Esports also began the day strong, with a victory against Team Falcons, sending the popular esports team back home. Like Team Liquid’s victory today, Tundra Esports also swept the floor, winning 2-0.</p>



<p>But since this was the Lower Bracket, it did not automatically move Tundra Esports to the Grand Finals. The team now has to play against Gaimin Gladiators in the Lower Bracket Finals. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The good news? Tundra Esports is one step away from the Grand Finals. The bad news? Gaimin Gladiators are not going to want to lose again, making their momentum increasingly strong. </p>



<p>Tundra Esports will have to put up quite the fight if they want to make it to tomorrow’s Grand Finals. </p>



<p>Will we see Gaimin Gladiators make a comeback? Or is this it for the popular Dota 2 team?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-the-shire">Tales Of The Shire: A The Lord Of The Rings Game</a> has been delayed into early 2025. The cosy life sim set in the home of the hobbits had initially been aiming for a late 2024 release, but developers Weta Workshop Game Studio announced they need more time.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"All of us here at Weta Workshop are excited to have you join us in the Shire, a peaceful corner of J.R.R. Tolkien's world. When a new Hobbit steps into Bywater for the very first time, we want that moment to be everything you're hoping for," reads the announcement <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1834336184639820240">shared via X</a>. 
</p>
<p>"To ensure we deliver that vision, Tales Of The Shire will now be launching early 2025."
</p>
<p>A Tales Of The Shire showcase stream will show more of the game in action on September 22nd, broadcast on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@talesoftheshire">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/talesoftheshire">Twitch</a>.
</p>
<p>Edwin already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-is-so-jolly-and-joyful-it-creeps-the-hell-out-of-me">had the chance to play Tales Of The Shire</a> at Summer Game Fest back in June, where he found it so relentlessly winsome as to be uncanny. 
</p>
<blockquote>"Playing Tales Of The Shire at Summer Game Fest has reminded me that the point of the Shire is to be a departed paradise, perpetually eroded by dire events in the East, insert World War-era colonial subtext here. It’s Tolkien’s Green Hill Zone, a gust of sunshine before the plunge into Moria and Mordor. Take away the plunge, and the gust of sunshine grows sinister – intriguingly so, like a hearty overture that’s always threatening to switch to a minor key. I don’t mean any of the above as criticism. This seems as fine and diverting and inconsequential a cosy life sim as any – hardly inventive as a collection of minigames and cottagecore DIY linked by dialogue and some very gentle exploration, but with LOTR fittings to tempt you away from the likes of, say, Dave The Diver. What captivates me about it, though, is what it isn’t, and how it relentlessly thwarts my instinctive sense that everything is about to go to hell. As Sylvia Plath wrote, the flowers are too vivid, too excitable. The air is too balmy."</blockquote>
<p>What a treasure Edwin is. I'm a simpler mind and therefore disturbed solely by the game having the subtitle, "A The Lord Of The Rings Game". There should be a the price to pay for mixing definite and indefinite articles like that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem">Toem</a> is a black-and-white photography puzzle adventure that delighted us back in 2021. Next week it's going to be free to keep from the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It's just fun, isn't it?" wrote Alice B in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/toem-review">Toem review</a>. "It's not groundbreaking, Toem, but it's somehow nostalgic and modern at the same time, a silly world that you can just enjoy, guilt-free. No overwrought commentary on modern society. No hidden meaning. Occasionally some hidden socks, or ghosts you can only see when you're wearing magic sunglasses, yes. Mostly having fun and taking pictures. I was here, I played Toem. It was good."
</p>
<p>Which sounds certainly good enough. Toem will be free to keep between September 19th and September 26th, and you'll be able to grab it from its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">Epic Games Store page</a>. You'll need an Epic Games account to do so.
</p>
<p>Toem will be joined by The Last Stand: Aftermath, a roguelite zombie shooter with which I'm unfamiliar. 
</p>
<p>Until Toem appears, there are two other games free to keep from Epic, as usual. Those are <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/super-crazy-rhythm-castle-e3b464">Super Crazy Rhythm Castle</a>, the name of which sort of tells you what you need to know, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/rugrats-adventures-in-gameland-737402">Rugrats: Adventure In Gameland</a>, which is a new platformer based on the old cartoon. Perhaps you could say this is somehow nostalgic and modern at the same time - and I have unabashedly fond memories of Rugrats - but I do not want to play this, sorry.
</p>

The company is charging $25.98 for the kit, which it says is a simple, solderless mod.</p><p>8BitDo has made a few of these in the past for old Nintendo controllers, including those for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/2/23746491/8bitdo-nintendo-64-n64-diy-wireless-mod-kit-bluetooth">N64</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/17/17568436/8bitdo-diy-wireless-game-controller">earlier consoles</a>, and now it’s the GameCube’s turn. The kit replaces your controller’s existing PCB with a drop-in board that has Hall effects joysticks and a USB-C-rechargeable 300mAh battery attached. It also comes with a trigger pack, and 8BitDo says the battery will get 6 hours of playtime between charges. It’s compatible with the Switch and Android, according to the product page.</p><p>The catch is that you’re replacing its wired controller option, and you’ll have to pick up a separate, $25.98 8BitDo “<a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/mod-kit-for-original-ngc?variant=44610072412337">Retro Receiver for GCN</a>” to connect it to your GameCube. Undoing the conversion could be a little tricky — a video installation guide on the page includes a step for cutting the cable that powers the vibration motor — so you’ll want to consider that if you prize gaming hardware preservation.</p><p>Still, plenty of GameCube controllers have endured abuse in the last two-plus decades; I’d certainly consider it if I had one lying around that had drifting analog sticks or a cord that’s been chewed up by pets or cut off by scissor-happy children. For a less invasive wireless controller transition, though, there’s always <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/12/10/18135010/8bitdo-gbros-wireless-adapter-gamecubue-controller-switch-review">8BitDo’s GBros. adapter</a>. </p><p>8BitDo says it will start shipping the new mod kit on September 25th. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-will-start-banning-%E2%80%98waiting-room%E2%80%99-channels.981243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-waiting-room-ban/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed by Twitch Support that ‘waiting room’ channels will be banned going forward, under the regulations that rule them as ‘Impersonation’. The team said that elements such as stream title and channel bio will be considered when moderating such streams and that the ruling is mostly aimed at profiles re-using other creators’ content.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stealing-revenue">Stealing Revenue</h2>



<p>In recent months, Twitch has seen a sharp rise in the number of ‘waiting room’ streams that will re-broadcast the content of larger streamers to a smaller audience. They’ll often pose as ‘waiting rooms’ in the sense that you can watch their content until the <strong>actual </strong>streamer goes live on the platform.</p>



<p>In the regulatory update, it was confirmed that reaction streams, even ones that see you react to another user’s live stream, won’t violate the policy. That’s because there’s still an element of active engagement and commentary.</p>



<p>Also, hosting a waiting room stream that’s on hold in anticipation of a new expansion or a ‘character release’, for example, will be fine.</p>



<p>Here’s what Twitch Support said on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To help ensure we enforce accurately, we’ll look at different factors such as stream title and channel bio, as well as whether we’ve received a report from the channel being impersonated. </p>



<p>Our goal is to take action against streams that position themselves as “waiting rooms” – for example, channels that largely re-use other channels’ content without offering commentary or other creative content, and that pull views and potential revenue from the original channel owners.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think this is a good rule change, or are you a fan of waiting room streams?</p>

<p>It has been reported that ‘around 20’ former Ascendant Studios developers have joined Absurd Ventures, a multimedia organisation set up by Rockstar Games co-founder, Dan Houser. This news comes following a year of strife for Ascendant, which released Immortals of Aveum in August 2023, a game that promptly fell flat in the market.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ascending">Ascending</h2>



<p>Absurd Ventures, which is led by Dan Houser, will open a new studio called Absurd Marin, which’ll be based in California. It was stated that the team of around 20 former Ascendant Studios employees will be working on an unannounced ‘story-driven action-adventure title’.</p>



<p>Recently, the team at Absurd Ventures revealed two multimedia universes – A Better Paradise and American Caper. It’s intended that Dan Houser’s company won’t make just games, but instead, it’ll start by publishing a graphic novel and a podcast. </p>



<p>Per the reports, Absurd Marin will be picking up the firm’s first videogame-based project. All we know so far is that it’s a third-person, open-world game — which sounds a bit on the nose considering it comes from the man partly responsible for the creation of Grand Theft Auto.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, things aren’t looking good for Ascendant Studios. This news comes following broad layoffs and the widespread furloughing of the remaining members of staff. It could easily be the next studio to close its doors.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Dan Houser’s first new game away from Rockstar?</p>

            <p>A modder who'd worked to turn cult hit Human Fall Flat into a VR game has revealed that the "creators of the game bought it".</p>
<p>In a handful of tweets on X/Twitter, modder Raicuparta said No Brake Games was "so excited" about the mod, they are now releasing it as an official VR port.</p>

<p>"You might remember some videos of my Human Fall Flat VR mod. And wondered why it was never released," said modder Raicuparta on X/Twitter.</p>
<p>"That's because the creators of the game bought it! They were so excited about it that they are now releasing an official VR port with the same concept."</p>
<p>They then appended a video of their "old mod" to the message:</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>"To clarify: I had no involvement in the actual development of this official port, and neither did Flat2VR Studios," the modder added. "They just bought all the rights to the concept and code of the unfinished mod (which tbh they didn't really need to do), and then did it all themselves."</p>
<p>As yet there's no formal release date for Human Fall Flat VR, but Steam hints it's "coming soon", whilst the team itself <a href="http://v/">tweeted</a> that it "will be available to purchase from the Meta Store, the PlayStation Store, or on Steam at launch".</p>
<p>The idea for Human: Fall Flat came, at first, via a prototype developer Tomas Sakalauskas who had been commissioned to develop projects for Intel's RealSense camera - a high-end Kinect, effectively, for the PC market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-human-fall-flat-rose-up-to-become-a-smash-hit">In an interview with Eurogamer back in 2018</a>, Sakalauskas says the idea flourished beyond the limitations of the RealSense camera until, eventually, it found its home as a more traditional game - a slapstick action game with physics-enabled comedy powering its puzzles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After stating the interview "was conducted several months ago", at a time when the team was "discussing internally" Palworld's future, the team says it ultimately decided "that the F2P/GaaS approach is not suitable for us".</p>
<p>"Palworld was never designed with that model in mind, and it would require too much work to adapt the game at this point," the statement continued. "Additionally, we are very aware that this just isn't what our players want, and we always put our players first.</p>

However, there are a handful of novels that follow other factions of the Imperium, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Y6PMP8?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_bx_tpbk&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Eisenhorn series</a> by Dan Abnett. The series follows Gregor Eisenhorn, a member of the Imperial Inquisition investigating demonic forces threatening the Empire. Many fans consider the series to be one of the best in the franchise. It's also just four books, making it one of the shortest sub-series in the 40K canon, and an excellent starting point.</p><p dir="ltr">Another well-regarded series is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ciaphas-Cain-10-book-series/dp/B07HPHWW4L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ciaphas Cain saga</a>. These books are slightly more humorous in tone, centering on the Imperial Guard commander Ciaphas Cain and the 597th Valhallans unit as they take on deadly missions across the galaxy. It's a longer series than Eisenhorn, but each novel features the Imperial Guard locked in epic battles against various other Warhammer 40K factions, making them an excellent way to familiarize yourself with the setting's endless warfare.</p><hr><h3 dir="ltr">Other faction novels: Chaos, Eldar, T'au, and more</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4365244-otherbooks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365244" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4365244-otherbooks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365244"></a><figcaption>Night Lords, Rise of the Ynnari, and Shadowsun: The Patient Hunter</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4365244-otherbooks.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are also a handful of novels that focus on non-Imperium factions.

Dawn of War 3 is a hybrid that brought back base-building but has a much smaller scope with fewer playable factions and a more narrow strategy focus compared to the first game.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwarhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-master-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-40000-beginner-guide-for-tabletop-books-video-games-for-space-marines-2-players%2F1100-6526368%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dawn of War: Master Collection</a> -- $34 (<del>$38</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwarhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii-grand-master-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-40000-beginner-guide-for-tabletop-books-video-games-for-space-marines-2-players%2F1100-6526368%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dawn of War II: Grand Master Collection</a> -- $72 (<del>$80</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwarhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-iii-game&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwarhammer-40000-beginner-guide-for-tabletop-books-video-games-for-space-marines-2-players%2F1100-6526368%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dawn of War III</a> -- $36 (<del>$40</del>)</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Turn-based tactics - Battlesector, Machanicus, and Chaos Gate: Daemonhunters</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4365250-sector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365250" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4365250-sector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365250"></a><figcaption>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4365250-sector.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Dawn of War is great, but its real-time strategy gameplay is a departure from the turn-based design of the original tabletop game.

This turn-based tactics game is the most faithful adaptation of the tabletop game's rules and gameplay flow. Unfortunately, that also extends to the way the game offers its content. The base game only includes the Blood Angels Space Marine faction and the Tyranids as the only playable factions. Other factions and even additional playable units must be purchased via DLC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/14/24244073/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-review-capcom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><p>Capcom’s<em> Ace Attorney Investigations</em> <em>Collection</em>, the spinoffs to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18306762/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-remastered-review-xbox-ps4-switch">the popular if wildly legally inaccurate <em>Ace Attorney</em> series</a>, are finally out. The two-game collection includes a long-awaited gift for <em>Ace Attorney</em> diehards: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180987/eureka">the official Western release of <em>Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit</em></a>. And though <em>Investigations </em>suffers from gameplay issues that run counter to the spirit of the overall series, the characters and story make the collection a must-have for any <em>Ace Attorney</em> fan.</p></div><p>Though there are two games in the collection, I’m going to focus exclusively on <em>Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>. Despite getting a Japanese release on the DS in 2011, the game never officially made it to the West until now. <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> puts you in the cravat of prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, Phoenix Wright’s childhood friend, opposing counsel, and, if you subscribe to certain parts of the fandom, longtime lover. (Not me, though, I’m firmly a Gumshoe / Edgeworth girlie.)</p><p>The game plays similarly to <em>Ace Attorney</em>. Somebody gets murdered, somebody innocent gets accused, and Edgeworth must investigate crime scenes for clues. Once the necessary information has been gathered, Edgeworth interrogates people, pointing out contradictions in their testimony with evidence to eventually determine someone’s guilt or innocence.</p><div><p>I often visited the game’s bonus content just to rewatch all the outrageous, “Oh no, I’ve been found out!” animations</p></div><p>In <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>, the characters are wonderfully colorful, and it’s always a treat to watch them fall apart whenever Edgeworth discovers their lies. I often visited the game’s bonus content just to rewatch all the outrageous, “Oh no, I’ve been found out!” animations.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>“Oh no, I’ve been found out!”</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Capcom</cite></p></div><p>Because <em>Ace Attorney Investigations</em> is a spinoff series, you don’t need any knowledge of the main games to understand what’s going on. But if you do, oh man, are you rewarded. I was geeking out playing a case that has a massive — and I mean <em>massive </em>— impact not only on the events of the first <em>Ace Attorney</em> game but also on Miles Edgeworth’s entire reason for being.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the game’s story and characters are just as charming as they are in the main series, <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> sets itself apart with its unique gameplay features, both of which are a bit lacking. New in <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit </em>are the Mind Chess and Logic minigames. The Logic game requires putting together two pieces of information found during an investigation to create new clues. During an investigation at a prison, Edgeworth learns that a critical piece of evidence — a key — has gone missing. He also knows that a metal detector went off in the vicinity of the prison’s alligator enclosure. (Listen, in any <em>Ace Attorney</em> game, things can get very... <em>quirky.</em>) You very literally smash those two pieces of information together to deduce that the alligator swallowed the key. Armed with new information, the game can progress.</p><div><figcaption>An example of the Logic mini-game in Ace Attorney.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Capcom</cite></p></div><p>Completing Logic games is exceedingly easy, demanding none of the deductive puzzle-solving skills that make <em>Ace Attorney</em> games so enjoyable. They’re so simple that they’re actually a waste of time. It’s as though the developers needed to add something to make this game distinct from the main series but couldn’t figure out anything interesting, so they came up with what is essentially evidence gathering with superfluous steps.&nbsp;</p><p>Mind Chess, however, suffers from the exact opposite problem. It’s a worthwhile gameplay addition, but the logic required to beat it is completely impenetrable. In Mind Chess, a subject has a piece of information they don’t want to give up, and Edgeworth must pick from a rotating selection of dialogue options to wear them down until they spill the beans.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with Mind Chess is that, unlike anywhere else in the game, you’re not using evidence to pick apart false statements. Rather, you’re trying to read and respond to an opponent’s… <em>vibes</em>? If you pick a dialogue option that doesn’t jive with your opponent’s emotions, you fail. The game does try to help you out with clues. In one case, Edgeworth notes that a mentally weak opponent will clam up if I pick aggressive options, so when they inevitably got all weepy on me, I correctly remained silent. However, those clues didn’t work in every situation, leaving me floundering. I lost that game of Mind Chess because I once again stayed quiet when that weepy opponent got even more weepy.</p><p>The great thing about both <em>Ace Attorney</em> series is that I’m rewarded for being thorough. I feel like a genius when I catch someone in a lie because I took the time to learn everything about every piece of evidence, which often involves noticing the tiniest or most cleverly obscured detail. And when I’m wrong, it’s not difficult to revisit my case files to find what I missed.&nbsp;</p><p>Guessing until you get to the right answer is the antithesis of that — no brain power, just button mashing. And since Mind Chess relies on what the player can somehow intuit (from a bunch of pixels, no less!), instead of what they concretely know, I wound up guessing in every instance. I might as well have been playing <em>Cookie Clicker</em>.</p><p>But suffering through Mind Chess is well worth the clues you get to solve the game’s greater mysteries. In the main <em>Ace Attorney</em> series, most cases aren’t too closely related, and if they are, the connections are incidental. An important character from one case will show up as a brief cameo in another, or one murder might have minor implications for a later one. But <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> is the first time I’ve seen every single case and every single character (even the dead ones!) have a direct and major impact on the game’s climax.</p><p>All of those connections did muddy the story and create a voluminous record of evidence that was difficult to sift through. But when I finally uncovered the grand mastermind, my body did that slow transition from relaxed and reclined to straight and alert. It was exactly like a scene in a murder mystery when the detective happens upon the one perfect clue that cracks the case, something that playing every <em>Ace Attorney</em> game should feel like.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Do you fondly remember coming home from school in 2006, sitting down with your Xbox 360 controller in hand, and attempting to save a few survivors in the original Dead Rising? I was starting high school, and games like Dead Rising helped make those early days bearable. But here we are, nearly two decades later, with Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. Here is everything we know about Dead Rising Deluxe remaster!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">What is Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster? </h2>



<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, as its name suggests, is a full-blown remaster of the original story of Frank West and the Willamette shopping mall overrun by zombies. As a photojournalist, you’ll infiltrate the mall in search of a story but stay to help uncover the mystery of the zombie apocalypse and help save as many survivors as possible. </p>



<p>But that’s the more serious aspect of the game. While in the mall, you can dress up in whacky outfits, including cocktail dresses and lego-like helmets, wield outrageous weapons, and snap photos of obscene situations to earn PP, which allows you to level up your skills and become a more formidable survivor.</p>



<p>This version of the game features brand-new controls, better graphics, quality-of-life tweaks, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-achievements-and-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new achievements to unlock</a>!</p>

Sony now faces the unenviable task of convincing its most engaged consumers that the console is worth the investment. But with many feeling the PS5 generation has yet to really get started, the PS5 Pro’s problems appear to go beyond price.</p><p>This was perhaps best evidenced by Lead System Architect Mark Cerny’s decision to spotlight <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/last_of_us_part_ii_remastered" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Last of Us: Part 2 Remastered</a> during his PS5 Pro presentation – a re-released version of a PS4 game from 2020, albeit an undoubtedly handsome one. While it’s good to know the game will run at an unflinching 60fps in its full 4K fidelity mode on Sony’s new supercharged system, there are few who will feel the astronomical $700 price point is justified by an enhanced last-gen title.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/13/push-square-ps5pro-poll-1726227275980.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>89% of Push Square readers think PS5 Pro is too expensive.

Tentpole first-party titles like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/pc/god_of_war_ragnarok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">God of War Ragnarok</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/horizon_forbidden_west" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gran_turismo_7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gran Turismo 7</a> all look and play great on the PS5, but they’re also available on the PS4, raising questions about whether they’re even stretching the capabilities of Sony’s base hardware to begin with.</p><p>An extended cross-gen period, which has continued to see titles release across both the PS5 and PS4, has left early adopters feeling short-changed, as they expected the PS5’s power to be fully explored much sooner. Older consoles are ordinarily left behind within one or two years, but bloated development budgets and pandemic-induced stock shortages have meant that last-gen systems remain very relevant today. We’re fast approaching the PS5’s fourth anniversary, and yet many major titles continue to be developed with the decade-old PS4 in mind, including upcoming releases like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How can [PS5 Pro's] expensive existence be justified when games are still being built with last-gen machines in mind?</p></div><p>All of this puts the PS5 Pro’s value proposition in a precarious position: how can its expensive existence be justified when games are still being built with last-gen machines in mind?

The timing of the system’s release coincided with an upswing in 4K television adoption, making the promise of improvements to existing 1080p content more tantalising.

Development cycles have extended to such a degree that we may only get one true native PS5 title from the first-party favourite – a marked change from the PS3 era, where it released the entire <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/uncharted_legacy_of_thieves_collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncharted</a> trilogy and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/last_of_us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Last of Us</a> in a single console cycle.</p><p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GTA 6</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvels_wolverine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> will be expected to test current-gen hardware next year, but they’re just two upcoming examples in a generation that’s been unusually slow to get started. Those who podded out for the PS5 in 2020 won’t have expected to wait this long for titles that truly stretch the capabilities of their consoles, and that makes the PS5 Pro’s existence feel all the more unnecessary.</p><p>Sony will argue that PS5 Pro is simply about giving players flexibility, and the option to experience higher fidelity graphics and smoother frame rates if they prefer.
