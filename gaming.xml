            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/adaptive-frame-generation-is-lossless-scalings-latest-feature/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The software Lossless Scaling was updated this week to support a new feature called Adaptive Frame Generation. As you may recall, Lossless Scaling <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-adds-universal-frame-generation-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made the news in early 2024</a> when it introduced a universal frame generation feature that worked practically on all GPU and PC games. The developer continued to improve the feature by adding more generated frames with <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-2-1-can-now-triple-your-frame-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X3</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-2-3-adds-x4-fg-mode-initial-nvidia-g-sync-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X4 modes</a>, not to mention last month's 3.0 beta update that improved latency and reduced artifacts.</p>
<p>Now, with beta version 3.1, Adaptive Frame Generation can be selected to dynamically adjust fractional multipliers to maintain a set frame rate picked by the user, regardless of the base game frame rate. According to the developer of Lossless Scaling, this provides a smoother frame rate than fixed multiplier mode. It is particularly beneficial for games that are hard or soft capped at framerates that aren't aligned as integer multiples of the screen refresh rate (e.g., 60 → 144, 165 Hz) or for uncapped games.</p>
<p>There is a downside, however. Adaptive Frame Generation will generate most of the displayed frames, increasing GPU load and potentially slightly decreasing image quality compared to fixed multiplier frame generation. Latency is also very slightly increased, as seen in the comparison below.</p>

<p>To support Adaptive Frame Generation, the capture engine of Lossless Scaling had to be tweaked significantly. The GDI capture mode is no longer supported, and WGC capture is no longer available before Windows 11 24H2 and will default to DXGI on earlier versions if selected.</p>
<p>There is a 'New Queue Target' option that users will find, with the following recommendations provided by the developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 - Unbuffered capture, which always uses the last frame captured for the lowest latency. However, performance may suffer under high GPU load or with an uncapped base game frame rate.</li>
<li>1 - (default) Buffered capture with a target frame queue of 1. Maintains low latency while better handling variations in capture performance.</li>
<li>2 - Buffered capture with a target frame queue of 2. Best suited for scenarios with an uncapped or unstable base frame rate and high GPU load, but may introduce higher latency. It is also the recommended setting for frame generation multipliers below 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Lossless Scaling will disable frame generation when the base frame rate drops below 10 FPS. This prevents excessive artifacts during loading screens and reduces unnecessary GPU load when using AFG.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lossless Scaling - Adaptive Frame Generation Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dB8sxLr4n3k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to the first user impressions, Adaptive Frame Generation offers better frame pacing compared to the fixed multiplier option. It'll never be quite as good as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-support-75-games-apps-rtx-50-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> or the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR 4</a>, but it's still impressive what the developer of Lossless Scaling has been capable of achieving without relying on any specific hardware technology.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-rental-programs-roll-out-in-japan-and-united-kingdom/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sony and PlayStation have unveiled a new leasing program for users in Japan and the United Kingdom. The new program, called Flex, allows users to rent a PlayStation 5 or one of several other PlayStation products, for 12, 24, or 36 months at a time.</p>



<h2 id="h-players-can-rent-or-lease-the-ps5-in-japan-or-the-uk">Players Can Rent or Lease the PS5 in Japan or the UK</h2>



<p>In the UK, users can <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/leasing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lease one of several PS5 models</a>, the PlayStation Portal, PS VR2, or even a DualSense Edge Wireless Controller through Raylo, a tech leasing company. As with any other lease, you can lock in a lower monthly rate the longer your lease term is. 36 month leases offer the lowest monthly cost, and there’s a monthly rolling lease that can be canceled at any time that’s much more expensive. For example, the PS5 Pro costs £35.59/month under a rolling monthly lease, but a 36 month lease lets player pay just  £18.95/month. Currently, a PS5 Pro is retailed at £699.99 in the United Kingdom.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is not a rent-to-own plan, but the Flex FAQ section does note that players “may have the option to purchase the device at the end of [a] lease, subject to Raylo’s discretion and pricing at that time.” While the service leases controllers as well, each PS5 comes with at least one controller included, as well a “fair” wear-and-tear policy that covers minor scratches or dents.</p>



<p>In Japan, video game retailer GEO launched its own PS5 rental service at the end of February. Players in Japan have the option of renting a PS5 for an eight-day or 15-day window for just a few dollars. However, according to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-new-ps5-rental-is-massively-popular-with-service-fully-booked-across-all-regions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automaton</a>, the service is already completely booked until mid-April.</p>



<p>Would you consider leasing a PS5 instead of buying one? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

The team has also published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN0mNkrXHJc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer deep dive</a> with a more detailed look at what the team is planning for combat, exploration, and optional investigation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside these trailers, Frogwares has launched a Kickstarter today to help get the game over the finish line. In a statement, CEO Wael Amr explained that the Kickstarter funding was necessary due to the ongoing war in Ukraine:</p><blockquote>After 3 years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we've learned to adapt, though it has never been easy. In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Frogwares has faced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sinking-city-2-revealed-after-messy-legal-battle-finally-comes-to-an-end-xbox-partner-preview-2024">numerous challenges</a> over the years in its work on both the original The Sinking City, and now its sequel. In addition to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ukrainian-game-developers-persevere">immense challenges of developing games during wartime</a>, Frogwares was locked in a publishing rights struggle over the first The Sinking City with original PC publisher Nacon that resulted in the game being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sinking-city-disappeared-frogwares-nacon-bigben-royalties">pulled from some platforms back in 2020</a>. Fortunately, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sinking-city-developer-frogwares-now-sole-publisher-after-long-legal-battle">Frogwares won full publishing rights last year</a>, and announced it had settled its disputes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1741278322505880&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jsHgYaXpv_7u6Q5W5NCnZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter for The Sinking City 2 is live now</a>, with a target of $105,000 USD.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

You'll need to think about timing and plan your routes, and at one point, you'll even find yourself on the back of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-escape-the-sandfish/1100-6529814/" data-ref-id="1100-6529814">sandfish</a>.</p><h3 id="Farmlife">Farmlife</h3><p>One of the funniest side stories in the game, Farmlife sees Mio and Zoe transform into pigs.

No happy ending for pigs in this story.</p><h3 id="Mountain_Hike">Mountain Hike</h3><p>This is one of the trickier side stories to locate. When you find an area that you'll need to interact with some portable toilets, pause. Mio will need to enter the toilet, and Zoe needs to use her grab skill to pick it up and throw it at the ladder hanging from the roof to the left. This will drop the ladder down, revealing the path to the side story. It can also be easy to miss as it doesn't have the audio cue that other side stories have. When you do find it, it's totally worth it. Mio and Zoe will spend some time traversing a mountain, trying to dodge the footsteps and wrath of giants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454766" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454766"></a><figcaption>Exploding Star side story</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Hopes_of_Spring">Hopes of Spring</h2><h3 id="Train_Heist">Train Heist</h3><p>Train Heist is less of a heist and more of a chase, with Mio and Zoe returning to some side-scrolling action, fighting The Conductor, a large orb-like boss who isn't super happy about them being there.</p><h3 id="Gameshow">Gameshow</h3><p>This was one of the tricker side stories we experienced, as you're at the mercy of a deranged robot gameshow host who insists on creating entertainment out of forcing Mio and Zoe to handle ticking bombs. Each bomb can only remain in your hands for a few seconds before you need to pass it to your partner. The arena gets more complex each time, with fire, electricity, and disappearing platforms adding additional danger.</p><h3 id="Collapsing_Star">Collapsing Star</h3><p>During this side story, Mio and Zoe find themselves staring into the sun, quite literally. The sun is dying, and as it does it sends lethal waves of light through the world. You'll need to find areas to hide behind. A huge tip for the end of the story is Mio and Zoe should use one shield to cover them both, and alternate between whose shield to use. If you try to complete this side story just using your own shield to protect yourself, you'll never escape the collapse of the sun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454764" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454764"></a><figcaption>Kites Side Story</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Final_Dawn">Final Dawn</h2><h3 id="Kites">Kites</h3><p>This side story is a race between Mio and Zoe as they traverse the skies via tunnels, kites, and wind sockets. Who will win? It can be tricky to aim for the circles that give you a boost through the air, and if you miss one you'll fall to your death. Our tip is to not move the camera angle as it quickly becomes disorienting.</p><h3 id="Moon_Market">Moon Market</h3><p>It's time to rescue some cats! Mio and Zoe have a total of four cats to rescue in order to open some gates that reveal the path forward. When you get the Moon Market itself, make sure to interact with the many elements around the town square, especially the potions.</p><h3 id="Notebook">Notebook</h3><p>This beautiful sketched art level sees Mio and Zoe on a quest to rescue a prince. It's easily located within the Factory level, as Zoe will point it out with an audio cue. As you traverse the level, Zoe will rewrite the story, and areas of the level will appear, disappear, and be modified.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454757" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454757"></a><figcaption>Birthday Cake</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Rise_of_the_Dragon_Realm">Rise of the Dragon Realm</h2><h3 id="Slopes_of_War">Slopes of War</h3><p>This is one of the most fun side stories in Split Fiction.

The grappling hook mechanic from earlier in the game returns with a twist as the two wrestle with zero gravity. There isn't a time limit, despite the fact Mio encourages Zoe to work as quickly as she can, but if you take too long the gravity meter will deplete so it's best to hurry along anyway.

                <p>The music world lost a legend this week, when Roy Ayers passed away at the age of 84. The jazz-funk pioneer was also the voice of Fusion FM, the in-game radio station in GTA IV.</p><p>Rockstar Games paid tribute to the late "Everybody Loves the Sunshine" musician in a social media post, saying, "Rest In Peace to the pioneer of Jazz Funk and host of Fusion FM, the legend Roy Ayers."</p><p>Ayers hosted <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_FM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fusion FM</a>, one of many in-game radio stations for GTA IV, and he was known for his passionate and exuberant presentation style, and quotes like, "Try to be happy all the time." Some of the songs featured on Fusion FM included Ayers' own "Funk In The Hole," along with tunes like "The Edge" by David McCallum and "Holy Thursday" by David Axelrod.</p><p>You can listen to more of the songs from Fusion FM through the Spotify playlist below.</p><p>Ayers' family <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RoyAyers/posts/pfbid0c4uWZoookuetVWmeuKdhskTEEcBCEYyzfYfsRqmT27iH1tbnASY48GWD83pNZ1bdl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a statement</a> this week confirming he passed away on March 4 in New York City after a long illness. "He lived a beautiful 84 years and will be sorely missed. His family ask that you respect their privacy at this time, a celebration of Roy's life will be forthcoming," the family said.</p><p>"Everybody Loves the Sunshine" is Ayers' most enduringly popular song, and it was sampled more than 100 times by artists like Dr. Dre with his song "My Life" and "The Dream" by Outkast.</p><p>Music is expected to play a major role in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>.

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' release finally almost upon us <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">after multiple delays</a>, Ubisoft is rattling through its remaining announcements - with its latest update detailing the various enhancements <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> owners can take advantage of come launch on 20th March.
</p>
<p>
As per a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/">post on the PlayStation Blog</a> (hence the absence of details relating to the Xbox version), Assassin's Creed Shadows features a choice of three different graphics modes - Performance, Fidelity, and Balanced - and can played at up to 2160p and 60 FPS on both PS5 and PS5 Pro when Performance mode is selected.
</p>
<p>
In all cases, ray tracing is supported, but your machine and selected mode will determine exactly what kind of raytracing you can expect. PlayStation 5's Performance mode, for instance, features "selective" ray tracing, which Ubisoft defines as computing "global illumination for diffuse lighting in the Hideout portion of the game".

<p>
Standard raytracing, meanwhile - applied in Fidelity or Balanced modes on PS5 and Performance mode on PS5 Pro - is "used to compute global illumination for diffuse lighting throughout the game world". And that just leaves PS5 Pro's "extended" ray tracing, which computes "global illumination for diffuse lighting and reflective surfaces throughout the game world" when applied in either Fidelity or Balanced modes.
</p>
<p>
The full breakdown of supported resolutions, frame rates, and ray tracing options per console and mode is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>PS5 – Performance Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 60 FPS, Selective Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 – Fidelity Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 30 FPS, Standard Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 – Balanced Mode (requires 120/240hz display and HDMI 2.1)</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 40 FPS, Standard Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 Pro – Performance Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 60 FPS, Standard Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 Pro – Fidelity Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 30 FPS, Extended Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 Pro – Balanced Mode (requires 120/240hz display and HDMI 2.1)</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 40 FPS, Extended Ray Tracing</li>
</ul>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">left a positive impression on Eurogamer's Katharine Castle</a> earlier this year - launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 20th March. But if you're looking for a more granular release breakdown, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-global-launch-times-detailed-pre-load-live-now-on-xbox">detailed its global launch times</a> too.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is getting a major patch on 13th March, developers Warhorse have announced. It will enhance the bracingly mucky <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with modding tools and a "trove of updates", including what the devs ambiguously refer to as Barber Mode. Going by <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1897316277355757987">the promotional image</a> they've knocked together, this is just a selection of beards and haircuts for protagonist Henry. But it is not yet 13th March, so let us dare to dream. Let us imagine that the update will let Henry <em>become</em> a barber, cutting a swathe through the innumerable fringes of 15th century Bohemia.</p>
<p>I had not realised till writing this post how much I want to play a game in which you play a travelling barber, perhaps departing each day from my salon to groom the magnates of the realm. A game in which I, Quiff Sideburn, Texturizer At Law, must carefully organise different sizes of scissors in my roll-out velvet barbering kit. A game in which my choice of do has a bearing upon international politics. In which I mull my own beard oil from juniper berries and slaughtered moles. In which I can recruit three side characters and form a barbershop quartet, then butcher them all because Quiff Sideburn is secretly Sweeney Todd.</p>
<p>A quick glance at Steam reveals that there is, very tentatively, such a thing as the "barber sim genre". There's the forthcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682260/Barber_Party/">Barber Party</a> from Second Wind, for example, which is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a> except that you're rounding necklines rather than plating the pasta. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1206910/Bizarre_Barber/">Bizarre Barber</a> for the VR crowd, in which you are a hairdresser who's gotten their Diet Coke mixed up with the shampoo and is now hallucinating magic fish on a train platform. And there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2809250/The_Midnight_Barber/">The Midnight Barber</a>, a visual novel in which you coiffure werewolves, which is designed for ASMR but is also about a political revolution in Barcelona. The barber sim is a richly confusing genre. But alas, an underpopulated one. Mostly, that search term turns up games featuring BBQs, barbarians or women called Barbara.</p>
<p>Barbering would fit naturally into Deliverance 2. The game already lets you practice a range of medieval trades, from brewing to cooking to tanning and smithing. I'm pretty sure Henry's smithing skills would translate naturally to giving Hans Capon a Pompadour - though this would of course be anachronistic, because that particular style is from 18th century France. See, I'm already an expert on hair. Don't make me have carried out all this research for nothing, Warhorse. Don't let me down on 13th March.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I, like plenty of other millennials growing up in the ‘90s, have a lot of good memories of watching the Cartoon Network show following three superpowered sisters, and not only did I think CW’s pitch of a more “mature” version of these characters going through adult problems sounded like the basis of a YouTube parody, but I’d also wasted enough hours of my life watching CW’s DC Comics universe shows to know that this company’s version of melodramatic campy riffs on legacy characters only works half the time. Today, March 6, a trailer for the scrapped show has been published online, and <em>Powerpuff Girls</em> fans are both glad the show never saw the light of day and morbidly curious about what it could have been.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The trailer was posted (then subsequently taken down by Warner Bros.) by Lost Media Busters, a YouTube channel that posts videos from canceled, deleted, or otherwise not publicly available shows, movies, and video games. The one good thing I will say about it before we start dragging the three-and-a-half minute clip is that it sounds like CW got Tom Kenny (who most know as the voice of SpongeBob) to reprise his role as the narrator for the trailer. Either that or they got a really convincing soundalike. And that does it for the positive because, holy shit, this looks <em>terrible</em>.</p><p>It looks like <em>Powerpuff </em>(there’s no <em>Girls</em> in the title because they’re grown women now, of course), would have started the same way the original cartoon did, with <em>Scrubs </em>actor Donald Faison playing Professor Utonium as he accidentally created three superpowered girls who fought crime and were generally considered heroes to the city of Townsville. Their heroism led to a wave of popularity, including merch lines and even a cartoon riff on their exploits (the original show which, in a bit of meta-humor, live-action Buttercup says “completely whitewashed” the trio), and things were going well for the girls. That is, until something happens that turns the public against them. We see protests against the girls, and eventually the three of them do something that gets Townsville mayor Mojo killed, paving the way for his son Jojo to take over. (The pair’s names are clearly an homage to Mojo Jojo, a monkey with human intelligence who was one of the cartoon’s main villains.)</p><p>After this, the girls go their separate ways, and this is where the show goes from what looks like an okay YouTube parody video to a bad <em>Saturday Night Live</em> sketch about the girls crashing out in their young adult years. Blossom runs away, Buttercup becomes a firefighter, and Bubbles becomes a burnout who drinks her nights away and tries to cash in on her lost fame. Eventually, the girls regroup in Townsville and Jojo hatches an evil scheme they must band together to stop.</p><p>But, my god, this whole thing is a hard watch. The three minutes of curated footage amounts to a series of unfunny jokes, awkward and stilted action, some of the worst green-screened flying you’ve ever seen, and a signature CW needle drop of the most popular song on the radio at the time, Dua Lipa’s “Levitating.” It oozes focus-tested flavorlessness with a slight pinch of edgy toilet humor so people know this time the Powerpuff Girls are Not For Kids. If you’ve got the stomach for it, check out the full trailer below.</p><p>CW’s campy shlock can sometimes work. <em>Riverdale </em>managed to take its self-seriousness and morph it into something enjoyable over several seasons. The company’s decade of DC Comics extended universe shows produced some real garbage, but <em>Legends of Tomorrow </em>was pretty exceptional before it was unceremoniously canceled in its seventh season. But I see no such spark here. Fans of the original show are mostly celebrating that the show was canceled before it had a chance to sully the <em>Powerpuff</em> name, though some admit they probably would have hate-watched it and others think the adaptation could have had potential.</p><p>Well, I’ll leave you with the one laugh I’ve had through looking at this all day. The top YouTube comment on the trailer right now comes from @SarilingMundo, who posted a slightly altered version of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KrBZrVQ7XU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KrBZrVQ7XU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original show’s episodic sign-off</a></span>: “And once again the day is saved, thanks to whoever decided to cancel this.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ahead of the game’s release on March 20, Ubisoft has released 20 minutes of new Assassin’s Creed Shadows gameplay.</p>



<p>The new gameplay shows both Naoe and Yasuka “infiltrating Nijo Palace, the castle complex (also known as a tenshu) in Kyoto, a major city in the larger region of Yamashiro.”</p>



<p>“Castles in Assassin’s Creed Shadows are strongholds, filled with hostile guards, valuable resources, and one precious loot chest,”  Ubisoft’s Youssef Garcia-Maguid wrote on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/?sf276574441=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog.</a> “Conquering a tenshu means eliminating any Samurai Daisho on the premises, which unlocks the loot chest, giving you powerful gear. You can see the contents of these chests when you hover over the castle icon in the map.”</p>



<h6 id="h-related-exclusive-ubisoft-is-confident-on-releasing-assassin-s-creed-shadows-on-march-20-2025">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXCLUSIVE – Ubisoft is Confident on Releasing Assassin’s Creed Shadows on March 20, 2025</a></h6>



<p>Garcia-Maguid added that Castles are “just one of the many activities” in the game that players can complete in order to increase their Knowledge Rank. Increasing your Knowledge Rank will let players learn higher-level abilities.</p>

            <p>If you were one of the many Eurogamer readers who lamented the fact that Sorry We're Closed didn't release on consoles as well as PC, well I'm pleased to say I have good news.</p>
<p>Developer à la mode games' eccentric story-driven survival horror game about demons, angels and what happens when both sides collide is now available across Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>You can check out the console launch trailer below.</p>

<p>Along with its console debut, the Sorry We're Closed team has also added some new features to the game, including New Game+ and gyro controls for those playing on Switch or PlayStation.</p>
<p>Here are all the new features coming to Sorry We're Closed, which are available for both PC and consoles today:</p>
<ul>
<li>The demon world is now more accessible than ever with rebalanced combat areas, improved controller sensitivity, aim assist options and new difficulty modes.</li>
<li>Restart the adventure in New Game+ to keep your upgrades and collectables as you explore alternate story paths.</li>
<li>Race against the clock to improve your combat level scores in Time Attack mode.</li>
<li>Motion-controlled aiming, including gyroscope support on Nintendo Switch and motion sensor aiming on PlayStation, for even greater precision.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, that's not all. As well as a console release, the developer has also teamed up with publisher Serenity Forge to reveal a premium physical edition of Sorry We're Closed for both PS5 and Nintendo Switch, which is slated for later this year.</p>
<p>Along with a copy of the game, this edition will also include a holographic sticker sheet (featuring Mimi the rat!), a soundtrack download card of the OST, and a design booklet (including character profiles, art and insight of the game).</p>
<p>The digital game is retailing for $24.99 (I am double checking UK pricing) across platforms. You can find <a href="https://linktr.ee/sorrywe.reclosed">links to purchase Sorry We're Closed here</a>.</p>
<p>That aforementioned physical edition, meanwhile, <a href="https://store.serenityforge.com/products/sorry-we-re-closed-premium-edition">can be preordered here for $44.99</a>.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro version of Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set to be the best-looking console version of the game, as it will come with some exclusive features not available on the base console and on Xbox systems.</p>
<p>As confirmed today on the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official PlayStation blog</a>, the next entry in the series by Ubisoft, launching later this month, will offer multiple display modes on both base PS5 and PS5 Pro, which will all target 4K resolution via upscaling. Interestingly enough, all display modes will support ray tracing in some capacity, although Performance Mode on the base console will only offer selective ray tracing, which enables ray-traced global illumination in the Hideout. On PlayStation 5 Pro, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will offer extended ray tracing features, which enable ray-traced global illumination for diffuse lighting and reflective surfaces throughout the game, in its Fidelity Mode targeting 30 FPS gameplay, and its Balanced Mode targeting 40 FPS.</p>
<p>Together with the new details on Assassin’s Creed Shadows PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro display modes, Ubisoft also released 20 minutes of new gameplay footage showcasing Naoe and Yasuke infiltrating Nijo Palace. You can check out the new footage below.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game is setting out to be the most visually advanced entry in the series to date, as Ubisoft detailed last year during <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">Gamescom.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-ending-june</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-descendant-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-june.1127046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-ending-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Nexon has announced that it will end support for the game on last-gen consoles later this year.</p>

<p>In a developer livestream held earlier today (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendant-ending-support-for-last-gen-consoles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), Nexon revealed that the PS4 and Xbox One versions of&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down on June 19th, which, as TheGamer points out, is two weeks before the first anniversary of the game's original release.</p>

<p>Nexon says that because the scale of&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has "increased" since release, the team is spending "a lot of effort and difficulty" keeping the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game afloat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-giant-robot.jpg?itok=hBZyZa0n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-giant-robot.jpg?itok=T4MjXvUJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The First Descendant</em>'s PS4 and Xbox One versions are going away in June.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer goes on to say that since&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em>'s upcoming third season is "a mega season update", the development team wants to focus on "increasing player satisfaction", hence the cessation of PS4 and Xbox One support.</p>

<p>Not only is the game being removed from Sony and Microsoft's last-gen platforms, but you won't be able to continue playing it on those platforms after June 19th, even if you have it downloaded on your system.</p>

<p>However, if you do plan to upgrade to a next-gen console, you'll be pleased to know that&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>supports cross-saves, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off if you play on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p><em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>launched to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/#max" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">extremely strong Steam player numbers</a> back in July, but the player count has significantly dwindled since then, with around 8,000 players checking out the game in the last 24 hours. That's not nothing, of course, but it's a far cry from the 264,860 players the game attracted at its peak.</p>




<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has received a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-update-new-boss-descendants" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, with new bosses, characters, and other goodies being added to the looter-shooter. The latest update adds the valkyrie-esque Serena to the game's roster, as well as new areas, a new weapon, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074920/The_First_Descendant/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-first-descendant/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-first-descendant/9p8fbxkmclwc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. If you're planning to play on consoles, though, I'd plump for the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S if I were you.</p>

The <a href="https://shop.magicx.team/products/magicx-zero-40">MagicX Zero 40</a> is yet another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253993/anbernics-game-boy-advance-sp-is-now-available-in-three-new-transparent-colors">handheld emulator</a> but with a peculiar design incorporating a four-inch vertically-oriented 800x480 touchscreen display allowing emulated DS titles to be played like they are on Nintendo’s devices.</p><p>The Zero 40 is expected to be released sometime in April 2025 for around $75, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/this-usd75-handheld-could-be-the-best-way-to-emulate-nintendo-ds-in-2025">according to <em>Time Extension</em></a>. MagicX isn’t as well known as companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance">Anbernic</a> that have been making handhelds for years, but the company debuted its first Android-powered gaming device, the <a href="https://shop.magicx.team/products/magicx-mini-28">Mini Zero 28</a>, earlier this year, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXAziPF9YS0">favorable reviews</a>.</p><p>The company is taking a similar approach with the Zero 40 as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/25/5025828/nintendo-2ds-review">Nintendo did with its 2DS</a>, and not just when it comes to skipping 3D. Although all of the folding devices in the DS lineup featured two separate displays, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/08/nintendo_2ds_is_actually_made_with_just_one_screen">2DS used just a single panel</a> that was made to look like two separate screens by the handheld’s plastic casing. That’s likely part of the reason the Zero 40 could launch as comparatively cheap as the 2DS.</p><p>The Zero 40 will be powered by an Allwinner A133P processor paired with 2GB of RAM and a 4,300mAh battery that MagicX says will be good for between five and seven hours of gameplay. Like the Mini Zero 28, the Zero 40 will run Android, although don’t expect the latest version of Google’s mobile OS as the company’s last device shipped with Android 10 a month ago. It will rely on the Drastic emulator for DS titles, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091561/nintendo-lawsuit-fallout-yuzu">made free last March for Android devices</a>.</p><p>Aside from <a href="https://youtu.be/Z7GThb_iobU?feature=shared">MagicX recently sharing a video</a> demonstrating gameplay on the Zero 40, there haven’t been any hands-ons or reviews of the device, so its capabilities aren’t yet known. But the company says it should be able to emulate N64, PSP, and Dreamcast titles, in addition to DS games. It’s nowhere near as powerful as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23923136/ayaneo-flip-ds-kb-handheld-gaming-pc-nintendo-emulation">clamshell Ayaneo Flip</a>, but that DS alternative was priced close to $1,000. If it launches close to $75, the MagicX Zero 40 could fill a void with handheld emulators at a reasonable price.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Before you dive in with a friend or loved one, though, here are four things you should know about the game.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-recommend-id="image://c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-recommend-id="image://c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Whether you’re playing couch-based or online co-op, you only need to purchase a single copy of <em>Split Fiction</em> for both players to enjoy the experience. If the two of you are both sat on a couch, you can obviously share a screen. However, if you’re a pair playing online, the game’s owner can use a Friend’s Pass to allow their friend to join in free of charge.</p><p>Even better, your Friend’s Pass works cross-platform! This means if you grab the game on PlayStation 5 and your friend has an Xbox Series X, you’re still golden. Same goes for PC! No matter where you like to play your games, <em>Split Fiction</em> is good to go.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-recommend-id="image://68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-recommend-id="image://68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Split Fiction</em> isn’t an extraordinarily challenging game, but its difficulty is no doubt a notch above developer Hazelight’s previous title, <em>It Takes Two</em>. There are a lot of segments during the game that require intense focus and quick thinking to overcome, as both players help one another bypass obstacles or defeat enemies.</p><p>Luckily, <em>Split Fiction</em>’s checkpoint system is quite generous, and failure rarely puts you back more than a minute’s worth of gameplay. With this in mind, be patient if you’re playing with friends or family who don’t have your killer gaming acumen.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ creative producer, Jonathan Dumont, has revealed new details about the Claws of Awaji DLC, stating it will feature a ‘spookier’ and ‘different’ vibe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ahead of the release, Dumont shared information about the game’s post-launch content during an interview with <a href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-development-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>. The creative producer stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows Claws of Awaji DLC will act as a “continuation” of the adventure and story of their two protagonists. The DLC will feature a “different vibe, a bit spookier,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont also stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows features “a definite ending”, and the Claws of Awaji DLC’s events occur after the “core story of the main game”. This means players will have much to explore after completing the base game, as the DLC will introduce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10+ hours of additional gameplay</a>. Check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> for Claws of Awaji here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, Dumont also discussed the bonus pre-order quest for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Thrown to the Dogs. The creative producer described it as “a simple yet heartfelt side quest,” similar to the side content we saw in AC Odyssey. The quest begins with a beaten-up stray dog at a grave, who takes the protagonists to his former house to uncover some “family secrets,” stated Dumont.&nbsp;</p>

The sequel to <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> follows the steps of its predecessor including a brand new protagonist and a large interconnected world! After the events of the first game, the Queen of Light must stop the destruction of the very existence by challenging the Supreme God Chaos while seeking the location of their old nemesis.</p><p><strong>A New Installment in the <em>Aeterna</em> Universe</strong></p><p>The unforeseen consequences after the ending of <em>Aeterna Noctis</em> broke the balance between Light and Darkness. The Queen of Light awakes alone in a changing world at the edge of the void. It’s up to her luminous majesty to find answers and stop the end of all things.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The <em>Aeterna</em> Universe continues to expand with the highly anticipated sequel to <em>Aeterna Noctis</em>. This time players will take on the role of the other monarch cursed by the will of the Supreme God Chaos., a protagonist featuring new abilities and bearing the responsibility of saving everything that has existed and will exist.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a title="Genres > Action [2,535 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Adventure First and Foremost</strong> – You’ll explore new areas interconnected in a large world map full of secrets, secondary quests, and evils to defeat. As the Queen of Light, you must uncover the mysteries of a land never seen before in the franchise and gather allies to stop the imminent collapse of space and time. The variety of settings is enormous, as is an artistic direction that gives each area a unique personality.</li><li><strong>Fast-Paced Gameplay</strong> – Every action adventure title focused on combat and exploration needs a fast-paced combat system and tons of passive and offensive skills… Guess what, both requirements are featured in <em>Aeterna Lucis</em>. The formula already implemented in its predecessor is now fully upgraded including much more polished combat controls, brand-new abilities, and exclusive weapons for the Queen of Light.</li><li><strong>Level Design and Progress</strong> – The game features an intuitive level design for the players to enjoy precise movement controls and complete liberty to explore and discover alternative routes. This is an action adventure game, remember? As you become more skilled and the Queen of Light gets new abilities, <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> allows players to exploit the full potential of their character in confrontations against final bosses that promise a visual, sound, and playable spectacle.</li><li><strong>Unique Art Direction</strong> – Since <em>Aeterna Noctis</em>, the franchise’s universe has always been characterized by a coherent art design that makes all gameplay areas, enemies, and NPCs feel part of the same world. Using our trademark stained glass art and hand drawing, all the settings and graphic elements stand out for their meticulous attention to detail. The music, another of the pillars of the game, will allow you to enjoy from the most epic moments to the most relaxing ones with a sound quality on par with the great titles of the genre.</li><li><strong>Rich Storyline</strong> – The <em>Aeterna</em> Universe uses dialogues, item descriptions, and environmental storytelling that don’t interfere with the player’s progress and the general flow of the game. <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> is no exception and introduces a lot of new details about the franchise’s lore and the secrets behind the curse of the two monarchs.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span>Teaser and Gameplay Reveal Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Aeterna Lucis - Official Teaser &amp; Gameplay Reveal | The Sequel to Aeterna Noctis" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDjIQ89JEGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Conquering a tenshu means eliminating any Samurai Daisho on the premises, which unlocks the loot chest, giving you powerful gear. You can see the contents of these chests when you hover over the castle icon in the map.</p><p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-948467-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/K8rvFAM.mp4</a></video></p><p>Castles are just one of many activities in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> that you can complete to increase your Knowledge Rank, which gives you access to higher level abilities and upgrades. Completing them will also earn you experience and mastery points, which you can use to directly upgrade Naoe and Yasuke’s abilities. Additionally, Castles are full of resources that you can claim for your hideout. Smaller resource bundles can be picked up manually, while larger stockpiles can be tagged by Naoe and Yasuke to be picked up and delivered to your hideout by scouts at the changing of the seasons.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>■ Naoe <a title="Genres > Stealth [75 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/kpJPOjr.mp4</a></video></p><p>Our walkthrough begins with Naoe’s stealthy approach at night. After dispatching a perimeter guard with her Hidden Blade, she quickly takes to the rooftops with the help of her grappling hook and begins to scout out nearby patrols. Unlike recent games in the series, in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, you won’t have the ability to call upon an avian ally to scout from the skies for you. Instead, you’ll hold L2 to use the Observe mechanic and focus Naoe or Yasuke’s vision on an enemy / objective / loot to tag it.</p><p>While scouting, Naoe spots a Samurai Daisho, an elite guard that will have to be eliminated to conquer the tenshu and claim its ultimate reward. With her tanto blade equipped, Naoe can double assassinate targets, but the Samurai Daisho’s ample health means she can’t take him out with one hit… yet. Shadows’ gear not only offers distinct stat bonuses but unique engravings that can change your strategy at any moment. In this case, Naoe swaps her headgear to a piece that gives bonus damage on air assassinations—enough to take out the Samurai Daisho in a single blow.</p><p>Further into the castle, Naoe calls for help from one of her recruited allies, Gennojo. He’s able to stun a pair of nearby enemies allowing Naoe to close the gap and take them both out. Gennojo is just one of several recruitable allies that can be called up in the open world for help (fun fact, each ally is summoned with a different bird call). Once those guards are taken out, Naoe uses Eagle Vision to scope out the interior of a nearby building.</p><p>Hostile enemies appear in red in eagle vision, while civilians will cast an orange silhouette. Be warned, however: just because civilians won’t attack you, that doesn’t mean they won’t raise the alarm if they spot you. Thankfully, Naoe is able to utilize a host of new stealth features to avoid detection. She starts by extinguishing a nearby lantern, cloaking herself in darkness. She then uses her grappling hook to pull herself up to the ceiling to avoid a patrol before dropping down and assassinating a second Samurai Daisho through a shoji door with her katana.</p><p><strong>■ Yasuke Stealth Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-3" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4?_=3"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/vhBvpEn.mp4</a></video></p><p>Now, let’s flip to Yasuke as he approaches the palace. Yasuke may be a one-man army in Shadows, but he’s still capable of sneaking around. Without a grappling hook, he uses a nearby low-hanging tree to take to the rooftops before pulling out his bow to silently take out a guard from range. Then, while crouching, he sneaks up on another guard and dispatches him with a brutal assassination with his long katana. It’s not as inconspicuous as a Hidden Blade, but hey, it gets the job done and doesn’t alert anyone else in the area.</p><p>Yasuke’s infiltration takes place during the daytime, so he doesn’t have the benefit of hiding in the shadows that Naoe did, but by sticking to the rooftops and using the geometry of the pitched roofs, he can stay hidden while crawling prone. Here, Yasuke calls upon another ally, Oni-Yuri, a poison specialist who can knock multiple enemies unconscious.</p><p>As he moves into the next courtyard, Yasuke spots a bell tower that can alert the entire tenshu to his presence should he be noticed, but with his bow (or Naoe’s shuriken or kunai), he can disarm the bell tower. Now, it’s time to go loud and make an entrance to take out the final Samurai Daisho. Yasuke starts by shooting a gunpowder barrel with his bow, taking out a nearby guard, before switching out his bow for a massive kanabo club. The hulking weapon’s blows overwhelm the Samurai Daisho, earning Yasuke another mastery point.</p><p><strong>■ Naoe Combat Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-4" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4?_=4"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/e2MgTz6.mp4</a></video></p><p>Swapping back to Naoe for a combat approach, we see just how skilled a fighter she can be. This begins by exchanging her stealth gear for a more combat-focused headgear and armor that allows her to vault enemies by sprinting at them and knock them down by sliding into them. Finally, her tanto is replaced with a legendary kusarigama that increases damage to enemies over three meters away. The kusarigama is Naoe’s long range melee weapon, great for crowd control and fighting multiple enemies at once. It also enables Naoe to rush assassinate her targets (rush assassinate is a passive ability that is possible whenever the kusarigama is one of Naoe’s two equipped weapons and does not cost adrenaline to use) by wrapping one end of the kusarigama around them and using it to fling herself forward for the killing blow.</p><p>Once Naoe gets to an elevated position, she realizes that a servant that spotted her earlier has returned with reinforcements. Rather than dealing with them herself, she calls her ally Yaya, a hulking brawler, to take care of them for her. With the reinforcements handled, Naoe is able to use the Observe mechanic to scout out Takahashi Shiro, a member of The Twisted Tree family she’s been tasked to assassinate. This time around, Naoe’s air assassination attempt only does partial damage, meaning she has a fight on her hands. Using a combination of smoke bombs and her kusarigama, she makes quick work of the weaker guards as she dances around Shiro, dismantling his armor before going in for the killing blow. With her target assassinated and the Samurai Daisho eliminated, Naoe is free to scale Nijo Tenshu and open the chest, earning a new legendary armor set for Yasuke. Her run ends with her scaling the tenshu for a synchronization point, using the Observe mechanic to scout our nearby points of interest.</p><p><strong>■ Yasuke Combat Approach</strong></p><p><video id="video-948467-5" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4?_=5"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4">https://i.imgur.com/L57St6o.mp4</a></video></p><p>We end the walkthrough with Yasuke’s bread and butter, combat. As with Naoe, it begins with a gear swap as the katana and kanabo are replaced with a naginata and teppo (a single-shot rifle). Yasuke’s last armor was ideal for stealth as it provided a 200% damage bonus to ranged weapons while out of combat. This approach, however, will be loud so he needs a new armor set and thanks to a unique engraving, the new set allows him to parry unblockable attacks (red glowing attacks that can usually only be dodged). The armor pairs especially well with the accompanying helmet which grants 50% damage to the attacker on parry. Not only can Yasuke parry any attack now, but he’ll reflect 50% of that damage back on the attacker.</p><p>It’s not often you can go in “guns blazing” in an <em><a title="Series > Assassin's Creed [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/assassins-creed">Assassin’s Creed</a></em> game, but that’s exactly what Yasuke does, smashing down the door before executing the closest guard with his teppo. With Yasuke’s size comes a certain boldness (he can take and dish out more damage than Naoe in a straight up fight) and he sprints straight through the courtyard to confront Takahashi Shiro. Wielding his naginata and parrying nearly every attack thrown at him, Yasuke quickly dispatches all the guards, and even takes out Shiro without too much difficulty. He may not be the climber that Naoe is, but Yasuke still ascends the tenshu to claim the prized chest and conquer Nijo Palace.</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ two distinct heroes offer up dramatically different abilities, weapons, and playstyles, but Naoe and Yasuke are versatile enough to change up their approach, allowing you to sneak or fight on the fly. Smash through the front door or lurk in the shadows for yourself on March 20 when <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> launches on PlayStation 5.</p><p><strong>■ <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d for PlayStation 5 Pro</strong></p><p>As the first <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game built solely for current generation hardware, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> can be played at up to 2160p and 60 frames per second on both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro in Performance mode.

The new architecture is paired with AMD’s second-generation AI accelerators that aim to improve functionality outside of gaming. If you're a streamer or like to record gameplay, AMD says the upgraded display engine offers enhancements for creators.</p><p>The RX 9070 Series features 16GB GDDR6 memory, which is said to offer a 20% performance boost over the older RX 7900 GRE. The RX 9070 XT bumps that to a 40% performance increase. Other highlights include FSR 4 for upscaling, a Software Manager that ensures your cards are always running the latest drivers, and pricing that starts at $549 for the RX 9070 and $600 for the RX 9070 XT.</p><p>Prices are a bit higher than that, however, as companies like ASUS, Gigabyte, and PowerColor are selling their models for around $700. Despite the heftier prices, they’re still selling out remarkably fast. Amazon seems to be the last one holding on to inventory--here’s a quick look at what’s available at the time of writing.</p><h2>All AMD 9070 GPUs at Amazon</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRRWCF9J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ASUS TUF Radeon RX 970 OC Edition (16GB, 4,000MHz)</a> -- $710</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DS2QZC9P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 OC Edition (16GB, 2,600MHz)</a> -- $670</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DS2QG2KW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gigabyte Radeon RX 9070 XT (16GB, 2,600MHz)</a> -- $730</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRRMZDH6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ASUS Prime Radeon RX 9070 XT OC Edition (16GB, 4,000MHz)</a> -- $720</li></ul><p>If you’re looking for gear to pair with the new GPU, check out the <a href="https://howl.link/kb1lb0edfi9v4?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17412765738662?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AMD Ryzen 7 9700X 8-Core Processor</a>. Released last year and often sold out, it’s currently available at Best Buy and even has a slight discount.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>'s Underlands are stunningly beautiful, but some areas are deceptively dangerous. Throughout the level you'll be faced with the challenge of piranha-infested water, and some of these aren't as easy to cross as they first seem.</p><p>The girls can shapeshift throughout this level. While Mio is safe in her "otter" form--which, if you ask us, looks much more like a lizard, Zoe isn't as lucky. If Zoe enters the water as a human, fairy, or tree, she will quickly become piranha food.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453958" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453958"></a><figcaption>Wall running can save Zoe from piranhas.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453958-split-fiction-piranha-water-1.png"></figure><p>Some of the safe methods forward aren't very obvious. During the first area of piranha waters there is a short platforming section until you end up stranded on a patch of grass. While Mio can swim through the water, she soon faces a roadblock where Zoe needs to give her some help to life a barrier. At this point, Zoe should wall run on the left-hand wall. Don't worry, we forgot wall running was a thing too.</p><p>If you're struggling to make the distance, try angling Zoe towards the middle of the wall, jump dashing to get as far along as possible, and then wall running before jump dashing to the next platform. From here, Zoe should shapeshift into the tree and use the areas on the wall to grapple from point to point until the next safe platform.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453959" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453959"></a><figcaption>Use Zoe's tree form to grapple across water.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453959-split-fiction-piranha-water-2.jpg"></figure><p>After landing there, you'll see a large rock blocks the way. As the tree, Zoe can lift the rock to allow Mio to get through. Here, Mio should shift into the gorilla form to break the log. When she is in a safe space, Zoe should let go of the giant rock which will fly forward and break through the barrier.</p><p>After a short cutscene, the two need to forge forward once more. Complete the platforming section until you find yourself looking over a large ledge to a round pool of water. Zoe can turn into a fairy and fly across the water to the flower stream which will carry her across the water to safety. As her gorilla form, Mio should use the pink leaves to swing across to the water and then quickly shift into her otter form as she drops to the water. Here, she can safely swim through a gap in the rocks underwater.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453960" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453960"></a><figcaption>Some sections require quick shapeshifting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453960-split-fiction-piranha-water-3.jpg"></figure><p>The next piranha waters are shortly afterwards. Zoe will need to use the grapples on the left wall before quickly shifting into her fairy form to fly towards the flower streams that will carry her to safety. Mio can use the same grapples before turning into her otter form in midair and swimming to the next section.</p><p>After yet more platforming and a puzzle sequence, Zoe and Mio find more piranha-infested waters. Here, Mio will need to transport a large plant stalk that Zoe is clinging to in order to save her from the waters, as well as some new contenders: flesh-eating flowers. To begin, Zoe just needs to slide up and down the stalk to remain out of the flowers' reach.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453961" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453961"></a><figcaption>Another important wall running section</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453961-split-fiction-piranha-water-4.jpg"></figure><p>When they reach the platform, Zoe needs to go on to it and turn into her tree form. By grappling the flower bud on the wall, she can make the flowers on the wall retract, meaning that Mio is free to transport the stalk through to the next section, and Zoe can transform into her fairy form to quickly fly through and rejoin the stalk.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453962" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453962"></a><figcaption>Not all stalks will float for long</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453962-split-fiction-piranha-water-6.jpg"></figure><p>In the next area, Mio needs to drag the stalk close to the flowers on the right so that Zoe can grapple across them and attach to the second stalk that's already waiting there. This pole will quickly begin to sink in the water, so Mio needs to swim around and bring the first stalk with her for Zoe to attach to.</p><p>That's all of the piranha water sections in the Underlands and how to safely navigate them. Along the path forward on the right you'll find the next Split Fiction side story, so be sure to complete that before moving on.
