<figure><a title="DK - Score" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a1158cde5278/dk-score.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, the reviews are now in for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>; Nintendo's first proper 3D platformer for the Switch 2. So, what's the verdict?</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the game is sitting at 90 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/donkey-kong-bananza/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a>, though it's worth considering that new reviews will likely make themselves known in the coming days, so this might change in either direction. Regardless, it sounds like DK's first 3D outing in decades has been worth the wait.</p>
<p>Before we crack on with the round up, let's see what we said in our own review first. We awarded the game a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">9/10</a> and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza is an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play. The punching and crashing is a passing novelty that, once you get your fill, quickly becomes just another way of exploring the wonderfully varied and beautifully presented layers."</p>

<p>So for now, let's see what some other outlets have said:</p>
<p>First, we start with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">IGN</a>, who scored the game a perfect 10/10 while calling it "a truly groundbreaking 3D platformer":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The leader of the bunch is finally back to kick some tail in Donkey Kong Bananza, a brilliant successor to Super Mario Odyssey and a smashing return for a classic Nintendo character. It was a bold choice to build the Switch 2’s first 3D platformer around Donkey Kong instead of Mario, but it’s proven to be the best decision Nintendo could’ve made. DK’s satisfying, expressive movement and powerful, dynamic abilities create a truly groundbreaking adventure. The ambitious, destructible layers of this underground world are densely packed with satisfying collectibles, abundant charm, and clever challenges that never seem to run out of smart ideas, even long after the credits have rolled. Bananza is a constant crescendo across its 20-hour campaign and beyond, with puzzle-platforming concepts that only grow richer as DK and Pauline dive deeper toward the Planet Core. Every element comes together in complete harmony to create Nintendo’s first Switch 2 masterpiece."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up, <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-donkey-kong-bananza-is-superb/">Siliconera</a> also provided a 10/10 review and said that Bananza provides "a constant series of pleasant surprises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Explore a vast underground world—by smashing your way through it! Bash through just about anything with the raw power of Donkey Kong! Crash through walls, carve tunnels with your fists, punch straight down into the ground, and even tear off chunks of terrain to swing around and throw in groundbreaking exploration—the more you smash, the more areas open up for you to move through. Switch 2 version reviewed. Review copy provided by company for testing purposes.</p>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza is a constant series of pleasant surprises and shows exactly what the Switch 2 can handle."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">VGC</a> awarded Bananza a score of 4/5 stars and said that it falls "short of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a>'s genius", but is nevertheless a "top-tier" platformer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza has a lot of heart – and that can take you a long way. While DK’s subterranean adventure doesn’t reach the heights of the masterpiece it takes great influence from, Bananza is still a thoroughly entertaining platformer that gives the ape his most memorable adventure in a while, and the best reason so far to buy a Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/">GameSpot's</a> 9/10 review is full of praise while also pointing out the performance hiccups and camera issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza offers a new start for Donkey Kong that is distinct from the Donkey Kong Country games. The focus on destructability captures what makes DK different from other platforming characters--his titanic strength--and giving him a cute sidekick grants the game unexpected emotional depth. As part of the launch line-up for the Switch 2, this nicely fills the gap for one of Nintendo's signature substantial single-player adventures. But more importantly, it's an excellent game in its own right, and deserves to be mentioned alongside games like Mario Odyssey as among Nintendo's best recent work."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Eurogamer</a> also calls Bananza "one of DK's best" in its 4/5 star review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When Bananza smashes it's totally remarkable. Occasionally it feels like it gets a bit lost, or fails to expand on some of the excellent foundations it's laying down. That's the sort of thing that keeps a game from being declared as a total classic for me - even if it nevertheless earns a hearty, full-throated recommendation. And even with my myriad quibbles, certainly it is the new best Donkey Kong adventure that doesn't have the word 'Country' in its title - which puts it in high standing indeed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">TheSixthAxis</a> says that the game can sometimes get a little lost amongst all the destruction, but nevertheless awards it a solid 8/10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza is an intoxicating cacophony of brawling, digging and platforming. It's a new style of 3D platformer from Nintendo that, for better and for worse, embraces the destructive chaos of letting players tunnel through and deform the world."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jess-weatherbed">Jess Weatherbed</a> <span>is a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is launching a new $350 external graphics enclosure that can boost the visual performance of gaming laptops or handhelds, provided you make a few other investments. <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-egpus%2Frazer-core-x-v2" rel="sponsored">The Razer Core X V2</a> is the first of Razer’s Core X eGPU chassis lineup to support the faster Thunderbolt 5 connectivity standard, providing a single cable that provides up to 140W of power to connected host devices.</p><p>Some generational upgrades provided by the Core X V2 include support for larger four-slot AMD and Nvidia GPUs, and backwards compatibility with Thunderbolt 4. Laptops equipped with Thunderbolt 5 are still pretty rare, but the Core X V2 should theoretically support bandwidth speeds of up to 80 Gbps for devices that can make use of it.</p><p>Aside from a 120mm cooling fan, that single Thunderbolt 5 cable is the only other accessory, however. That means customers will not only need to purchase a compatible desktop graphics card (which can get pricey for the more powerful models), but also a standard ATX power supply that meets their GPU requirements in addition to the 230W for the Core X V2 itself.</p><p>Previous Razer Core enclosure models, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18624843/razer-x-chroma-gpu-enclosure-thunderbolt-3-gaming-review">$399 Core X Chroma</a>, came with a pre-installed power supply. The change perhaps offers more flexibility for GPUs with lofty power requirements, but for everyone else, it’s just an additional expense.</p><p>The Razer Core X V2 also loses the integrated USB and Ethernet ports provided by its predecessors. Users who need more connectivity for peripherals will therefore <em>also</em> need to buy a compatible Thunderbolt 5 dock — just like the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-pc-accessories%2Frazer-thunderbolt-5-dock%3F_gl%3D1*1rms8ds*_ga*NzgxNjk2MTA5LjE3NTI2NjEyODY.*_ga_3TRK53PM75*czE3NTI2NjQ1MzYkbzIkZzEkdDE3NTI2NjUyNzYkajMyJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*MjEyODI2NjM3NS4xNzUyNjY1MjU0" rel="sponsored">$390 one that Razer conveniently announced</a> alongside the Core X V2.</p><p>The Thunderbolt 5 Dock is currently available to buy on Razer’s website. The Core X V2 is also listed, but isn’t on sale yet. We have asked Razer to share when the eGPU will be available to purchase.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708202/razer-core-x-v2-egpu-price-thunderbolt-5]]></content:encoded>

One of the most important materials is Iron. It’s a raw resource found in two key zones outside of the starter area, and you’ll need plenty for base building, clothing crafting, weapons, and vehicles. I recommend designating one member of your group to farming raw resources, and pay them a pittance and a few bits of praise to keep them satisfied.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You can scour Hagga Basin all you want, but you won’t find Iron Ore Nodes. For that, <strong>you must travel to either Eastern Vermilius Gap or Western Vermilius Gap</strong>, both directly north across a vast stretch of desert from Hagga Basin South. I learned this the hard way, but <strong>you really need a sandbike to travel across the sand here.</strong> Even crouch-walking will alert the sandworms, and they’ll consume you wholly before you can reach the other side. If you die to a sandworm, you’ll lose all of your gear and items in your inventory. Don’t do it!</p><p>Once you reach either of the Vermilius Gap regions, whip out your Cutteray Mk1, which is a key component needed to farm Iron.

                <p>Bethesda Game Studios has teased plans to add more content to Fallout 76 based on the Prime Video TV series. Creative director Jon Rush said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the game studio and TV teams are in discussion "all the time," but it's too soon to say what specific content may be in the works.</p><p>"Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it's stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there. I'm not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another," Rush said.</p><p>While there may be opportunities for crossover content, Rush pointed out that Fallout 76's story is the furthest back in time for the series and the TV show is the furthest into the future. "So there's a lot of room where we don't necessarily need to overlap.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a little less than two years at the time of this writing since Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/live-action-zelda-movie-officially-in-production-nintendo-confirms/">confirmed</a> that it was making a movie adaptation of The Legend of Zelda, which means nearly two years of fans around the world discussing who they'd pick to play the titular Zelda, and everyone's favorite mute protagonist, Link. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, we learned when the movie would be out in theatres, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-live-action-movie-slated-for-march-26-2027/">initially pinned</a> with a March 26, 2027, release date. Last month, however, Nintendo announced that it would no longer be out in March 2027, and shifted the date a few weeks into May, with the new date set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-the-live-action-zelda-movie-release-has-been-delayed-a-few-weeks-from-march-2027-to-may-2027/">May 7, 2027</a>. </p>



<p>Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1945433161124688335">statement</a> from Nintendo president Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo has announced who will be playing Zelda and Link in the live-action adaptation. For Zelda, it'll be 21-year-old Bo Bragason, while 16-year-old Benjamin Evan Ainsworth is stepping into the tunic of Link.</p>



<p> "<em>This is Miyamoto</em>," the statement began. "<em>I am pleased to announce that for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda, Zelda will be played by Bo Bragason-san, and Link by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san. I am very much looking forward to seeing both of them on the big screen</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The images shared already appear to be showing them as their characters, with Bragason in a blue top reminiscent of Zelda's classic blue dress, and Ainsworth in a dark tunic, though it's not necessarily the bright green that players would recognize as distinctly part of Link's costume. </p>



<p>As a fact of their age and the number of credits listed on each of their IMDB pages, both actors are early in their careers, making the roles they'll play in this film the most prominent parts they've had so far. It'll be interesting to see how the rest of the cast is developed around them, and the direction Nintendo takes with this film, the more we learn about it.</p>

Without spoiling anything, I was stunned at the ingenuity on display as I dove to some of its deeper, late-game layers. There are tons of different material types that make up the world, and there are set rules to how they all interact with each other. A simple example is how throwing ice onto lava creates a hardened rock platform, but the chemistry and interplay between different elements gets more complex as you progress, and learning these relationships and using your knowledge of them to solve increasingly smart puzzles is supremely gratifying. — <strong>Logan Plant</strong> </p></blockquote><h2 id="h805"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Donkey Kong Bananza offers a new start for Donkey Kong that is distinct from the Donkey Kong Country games. The focus on destructability captures what makes DK different from other platforming characters—his titanic strength—and giving him a cute sidekick grants the game unexpected emotional depth. As part of the launch line-up for the Switch 2, this nicely fills the gap for one of Nintendo’s signature substantial single-player adventures. But more importantly, it’s an excellent game in its own right, and deserves to be mentioned alongside games like Mario Odyssey as among Nintendo’s best recent work. —<strong> Steve Watts</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h806"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> To properly encapsulate how I feel about Donkey Kong Bananza, you almost have to start at the finish. No spoilers here, obviously, but I have to say that I think this game has one of the finest finales of any Nintendo game ever. There’s a delightful build-up of adrenaline as story beats and experimental mechanical evolutions are gleefully layered atop each other. It’s difficult to not have a great big smile on your face as the game hurtles towards its finish. It’s pretty masterfully done. — <strong>Alex Donaldson</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h807"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Guardian</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> The only fumble in these later stages is the overpowered nature of the Bananzas themselves. These animal transformations imbue DK with speed, flight, strength and more, and when contained in the challenges or levels built for them they sing. You are reminded of Mario’s Odyssey possessions and how perfectly realised each of those physical sensations was. But taken out of that context – when returning to earlier stages to mop up collectibles, for example – they become instant win buttons, dulling the ingenuity of Nintendo’s platforming designs. —<strong> Matthew Castle</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h808"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Washington Post</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Bananza” is the first Donkey Kong game developed internally by Nintendo in more than two decades, now staffed by the team that created the award-winning 2017 Switch title “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/10/30/mario-odyssey-is-a-reminder-of-how-fun-video-games-can-be/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/10/30/mario-odyssey-is-a-reminder-of-how-fun-video-games-can-be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Mario Odyssey</a></span>.” This game adopts Mario’s trademark powers of transformation. Instead of wearing different superpowered hats, Kong can transform into different animal “bananza” forms that allow him to fly (ostrich), punch through steel (ape) and sprint through thin ice weightlessly (zebra). While these powers run on a limited meter, a few sections allow extended use of them. The game soars when it demands usage of every single form, becoming a symphony of mechanics and player response. —<strong> Gene Park</strong><br>﻿</p></blockquote><h2 id="h809"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/donkey-kong-bananza-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/donkey-kong-bananza-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Inverse</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>One moment in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> felt like a revelation – like seeing the image of the Mona Lisa for the first time.

But where <em>TLOU</em> makes you have big sad feelings about all the people the game forces you to kill, <em>Bananza</em> presents you with a slight alternative — what if you could use your powers to fuck shit up and <em>not</em> be a dick about it? DK smiles often. People are happy to see him. That friendly rock I mentioned earlier? When you punch him or any NPC, it turns into a high five. All that destruction is welcome because it’s helping restore the world.  — Ash Parrish</p></blockquote><h2 id="h812"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRX0Ep7gacQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRX0Ep7gacQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Image quality in handheld is a lot better than what we see in docked mode. But performance is where things get perhaps a little more interesting. So, in the direct for Donkey Kong, we spotted a ton of slowdown. And unfortunately, that has not been fully eliminated, but it is a little bit better than I had hoped. It’s just that the way it manifests is somewhat unusual. You see, most of the time, the drops are not sustained. Rather, they occur only during very specific animations, such as when picking up a banana or on certain camera cuts. It’s a bit distracting, but it doesn’t impede on gameplay that often, which is good. I say that often because there are situations where it can drop pretty hard and stay there, like this boss fight where the frame rate dips down to 30 FPS and sticks there for most of the fight. Something made worse by the somewhat choppy looking destruction effects. —<strong> John Linneman</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h813"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>By the time the credits rolled, the transformations felt like one of numerous ideas introduced in Donkey Kong Bananza that it never truly capitalizes upon. At one point, progression seemingly expands with a branching path, only for it never to be used again. Similarly, other unique ideas are introduced and then never meaningfully fleshed out. Like most of Donkey Kong Bananza, then, if you start digging beneath the surface, you find flaws in its construct. But combined, its foundations form an adventure that’s genuinely greater than the sum of its parts. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t thoroughly enjoy the moment-to-moment of its campaign, even when I kept noticing the parts of its design that could’ve been executed better. —<strong> Andy Robinson</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h814"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/donkey-kong-bananza-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/donkey-kong-bananza-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Gamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> It’s worth going back to that Astro Bot comparison, by way of Super Mario Odyssey.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">So, I hear you want a new 3D Mario. If that means you’re looking for a console-defining platformer with satisfying, expressive movement, innovative mechanics that constantly grow and evolve, and expertly crafted challenges that unleash the interactive potential between said movement and mechanics, then I’m beyond thrilled to share that Donkey Kong Bananza is all of that and so much more. Bananza is no mere “side project” from the team behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">Super Mario Odyssey</a> – it’s a brilliant successor to that masterpiece, a tremendous reinvention for one of Nintendo’s original mascots, and a groundbreaking adventure in every sense of the word. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every breakable corner of DK’s world (which is most of them) is bursting with timeless Nintendo magic and equally fresh ambition. Bananza wonderfully balances honoring its star’s various incarnations over the decades – with lovely nods to both Shigeru Miyamoto’s seminal arcade original and Rare’s classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/20/donkey-kong-country-review">Donkey Kong Country</a> trilogy – while also fearlessly punching through a mountain to forge its own path. It also tells a light, sweet story about DK and his spirited sidekick Pauline pursuing an underground legend that will allegedly grant them one wish (Pauline hopes to return home, and DK just wants more bananas, of course), and the deeper the pair dives toward the Planet Core, the deeper the gameplay becomes. Bananza is a constant crescendo across its 20-hour campaign that hits its pinnacle with an unforgettable finale that cements this as one of the best 3D platformers I’ve ever played.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo builds each new 3D Mario around one big idea: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/08/22/super-mario-sunshine">Sunshine</a>’s water pack, Odyssey’s body-snatching hat, and so on. Mario is nowhere to be seen here but, in that same tradition, Bananza’s fully destructible environments suit a hulking, rampaging gorilla far better than the Mushroom Kingdom’s usual leading man, and this exciting concept is truly fit for a Kong. Practically everything in this world is designed for Donkey Kong to punch and break, and the extent to which Bananza commits to letting you tear through its environment is both technically impressive and a ton of fun. It’s refreshing to experience a Nintendo 3D platformer with an almost completely new toolkit, and DK’s set of abilities is endlessly enjoyable and fulfilling to pull off. Donkey Kong is <em>powerful, </em>and that’s regularly reflected across his moves. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The simple action of tearing a chunk from the ground – which you can do almost anywhere – leads to so many dynamic possibilities: DK can hurl it at airborne enemies, swing it to break through walls, bounce off it to double jump, or surf on it to get around faster and safely cross dangerous terrain. When he’s empty-handed he can punch in any direction, slap the ground to instantly gather loose gold and reveal nearby collectibles, and perform a satisfying roll-jump-roll combo cut from the same cloth as Mario throwing Cappy and bouncing off him for distance. Plus, he takes a page out of Link’s book and can climb basically any non-slippery surface, granting an extra sense of freedom to the entire journey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crunchy sound effects that change depending on the material DK’s interacting with make it even more entertaining to wreck stuff – like the loud crumble of breaking down a sturdy wall of stone, or the juicy splash of tearing into a watermelon. The controls for doing all of this are so polished, and when you chain together a combo (like tearing a chunk out of the ground, smacking it into an enemy to weaken them, and slamming into it with a roll to finish the job) everything sings together in perfect harmony.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bananza is one of the best 3D platformers I’ve ever played.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To slightly misquote Shrek, Bananza is like an onion – its levels are called layers, and each one is a sprawling playground constructed to maximize the potential of DK’s destructive abilities. There’s so much to find both on their surfaces and tucked away in hidden caves and tunnels you find by bashing your way through the environment. But Bananza rarely relies on mindless destruction for the sake of it, so you almost never have to stumble onto random discoveries just by beating the snot out of everything. Instead, it excels at rewarding discoveries by way of smart destruction, and it’s remarkable how intentional and well-designed its dense, vertical layers are. Visual cues masterfully draw your eye to areas worth exploring, similar to how veteran Zelda players know to place a bomb in front of any suspicious crack. See a tantalizing gold piece or fossil embedded in the wall? Chuck an explosive Boom Rock at it and there’s a good chance you’ll reveal a new path to explore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, the open-world nature of these maps means you can occasionally happen upon a collectible by skipping the intended puzzle entirely and just carving a tunnel straight to it. In my experience as I played naturally, though, it didn’t happen that often, and it fits in with modern Nintendo trends seen in games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Tears of the Kingdom</a> where the designers don’t care how you get from point A to point B as long as you have fun doing it. On the other hand, there are limits to that freedom: Bananza smartly walls off most of its main objectives behind terrain the nefarious Void Kong has turned indestructible in order to force you to go through the proper steps of the story, so it’s not like DK can just punch his way straight down to the end credits. That said, I can’t wait to see how speedrunners will find ways to optimize their routes through different levels – I’m sure there are some crazy demolition techniques and shortcuts waiting to be found.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s interesting about how the world and objectives are designed is that Bananza isn’t really <em>about </em>destroying everything. Instead, it’s about exploring, platforming, fighting, and collecting in a vast world where you <em>can </em>destroy everything, which is an important distinction. It never feels like a gimmick or the only tool you have to solve every problem, but rather one integral part of Bananza’s larger game design philosophy. I was rarely asked to create random tunnels underground with no guidance like you might in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review">Minecraft</a>, and DK’s upgradeable sonar ability helped me find buried collectibles hidden to the naked eye. And, Pauline helps out with the search, too, as using her singing ability reveals waypoints to collectibles marked on your map, making it easy to pick your next destination. That keeps the hunt for completion focused and fun, even if the camera occasionally struggles with the weird angles you force it into when digging yourself a nice hole. Of course, if you want to rip an entire level down to the studs for the fun of it, you can do that, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Romping around the sublevels hunting for treasure is a blast, and the fact that I still felt totally in control of the action even with so much fast-paced chaos unfolding on screen at any given time is an impressive feat. I love how the world crumbles around DK when I’m on a rampage: it makes everything feel more alive and really sells the weight and heft of this character, like the way he leaves a crater when crash landing after a high jump off a cliff (there’s no fall damage, naturally). To some extent, it’s made returning to past Mario games feel less dynamic in comparison – what do you mean Mario’s ground-pound doesn’t shatter the terrain around him? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was some pre-launch concern that the world’s malleable nature might leave each layer feeling like a palette swap of one big underground region, but fortunately, that’s not the case. Every world has something unique to offer both visually and mechanically, from the Freezer Layer’s icicles you have to knock down to create platforms, to the Resort Layer’s tropical vibes and Liftoff Ore that sends DK soaring into the sky when you grab a chunk of it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bananza never stops pulling fresh ideas right off the vine.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And Bananza never stops pulling fresh ideas right off the vine over its 20+ hours. Without spoiling anything, I was stunned at the ingenuity on display as I dove to some of its deeper, late-game layers. There are tons of different material types that make up the world, and there are set rules to how they all interact with each other. A simple example is how throwing ice onto lava creates a hardened rock platform, but the chemistry and interplay between different elements gets more complex as you progress, and learning these relationships and using your knowledge of them to solve increasingly smart puzzles is supremely gratifying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those puzzles are often found in standalone challenge rooms, the entrances to which are scattered across each layer. There’s a nicely curated mix of fights, logic puzzles, and platforming sequences that offer a welcome change of pace from the open-ended, explorable layers themselves, and I was consistently impressed with how the challenges take full advantage of the systems Nintendo built for Bananza. After more than 50 hours, I’m <em>still </em>finding new challenge rooms that mix and match enemies, materials, and abilities in brand-new ways. Some of the best examples are sections of blue and pink slime that are inverses of each other: If the blue slime section is completely full, its pink counterpart is totally empty; destroying part of the blue slime fills in the matching part of the pink slime area. Bananza builds several brilliant puzzles off this one idea, and gets similar mileage out of every toy in its toybox. It’s astonishing how frequently I discovered clever challenges that forced me to think about something I’d already seen before in a new way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On its own, exploration is gratifying, but it helps that there are great rewards for finding Bananza’s heaps of collectibles as well. Fossils are used to buy region-specific outfits that add different perks to DK and Pauline – like increasing your chances of finding a treasure chest – and it’s also just fun to give them both a fresh look. You’ll also collect mountains of gold, and while I was swimming in cash for the first several hours, I eventually had to pay for some optional content that ran my wallet dry. Trust me when I say collecting as much gold as you can will be worth it in the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the main collectible in Bananza is its Banandium Gems, which are comparable to Odyssey’s Power Moons in that they’re plentifully stashed around the levels in places that are often challenging to reach. Unlike Odyssey, though, Bananza doesn’t require you to gather a certain number of Gems before moving onto the next area. Instead, the main story relies on its own linear set of objectives (which often reward you with Gems anyways), while collecting five earns DK a skill point which can be used to upgrade his health, moves, and Bananza transformations. The skill tree doesn’t have a ton of surprises that’ll radically change your playstyle, but it’s nice knowing that grabbing a Gem is always working toward a specific short-term goal, whereas Odyssey’s Moons didn’t really serve a purpose after the credits rolled other than unlocking the far-off final challenge or for the simple sake of being a completionist. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are <em>tons </em>of Gems to find. I had found literally hundreds by the time I cleared the main story after 20 hours, I’ve spent 30 additional hours collecting hundreds more, and likely have double-digit hours left to reach 100% completion. Going for 100% is a massive undertaking, but with how enjoyable Bananza is to play, I’m not slowing down until I’ve collected every last one. And, unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>’s lackluster Free Roam map, it’s easy to track your progress this time with a helpful list of your Gems in each layer and a really cool 3D map that accurately reflects the current state of the terrain you’ve destroyed. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bananza looks great, with expressive animations and colorful environments.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, that map does occasionally suffer from minor framerate drops, as does the rest of Bananza. The action generally stays at a solid 60 fps both while docked on the TV and when playing handheld, but it <em>can </em>briefly dip below that when you’re going crazy with the destruction or when you first drop into a brand new level. It’s not great that we’re already talking about performance issues on Nintendo’s brand new console, but it’s never too noticeable or distracting, either. It’s easier to forgive the occasional dropped frame when it’s because so much beautiful chaos is happening at once, and the ambition of this fully interactable, destructible world is definitely worth that tradeoff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza really does look great, with amazing, expressive animations for DK himself and colorfully detailed environments, NPCs, and enemies. It also constantly pulls inspiration from DK history, such as the opening level being littered with fallen girders from the original Donkey Kong arcade game and sidescrolling segments that reference classic Donkey Kong Country levels, including a lovely new arrangement of Stickerbush Symphony that’s just one tune in Bananza’s awesome soundtrack. This may be from the 3D Mario team, but Bananza regularly pays respects to all of DK history and, at times, feels like a modern follow-up to Rare’s golden era from the SNES and N64. Even the friendly rocks with googly eyes look as if they were plucked right from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/06/30/banjo-kazooie-review-2">Banjo-Kazooie</a>.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan's Top 10 Donkey Kong Games</h3><p>Donkey Kong Bananza is a masterpiece and my new favorite Donkey Kong game. Here's my list of the top 10 games where you play as DK, fight DK, or rescue DK. I didn't include Diddy Kong Racing because he's not even in the game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the flashiest moments happen during DK’s Bananza transformations: a variety of powered-up, time-limited states that are unlocked as you progress deeper into the planet. Kong Bananza is essentially a souped-up version of DK himself who can disintegrate the harder materials you’d usually need a Boom Rock to break through. Zebra Bananza is all about speed, where you can run over terrain that would crumble underneath DK’s ordinary giant feet, while Ostrich Bananza lets you glide through the air. The character design is hilarious, and each Bananza is accompanied by a catchy tune performed by Pauline, so it’s always fun to mutate into one of these fierce forms. They all feel fleshed out and great to control, and even better, you can instantly swap between the Bananza transformations when you’re in the powered-up state, giving you even more flexibility in how you want to tackle challenges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I had to say something critical about the Bananza powers, it’s that sometimes they’re <em>too </em>powerful. You can only enter a Bananza if you have enough Bananergy, which is a meter filled by collecting gold, so in theory, the Bananzas should be somewhat limited. However, gold is so plentiful that you’ll pretty much <em>always </em>earn enough Bananergy to transform almost immediately after spending it. This can sometimes trivialize otherwise interesting puzzles in the overworld – for example, if there’s a Gem surrounded by poison water and the “intended” route involves creating your own path to it using vines, you can instead just skip the whole challenge by gliding to it as Ostrich Bananza. That’s admittedly still a real solution that fits in with Nintendo’s recent love of designing puzzles where any answer that works is a correct one, but having that power so readily available can feel cheap compared to the fun actually figuring an obstacle out. I was usually able to restrain myself from using the most streamlined options Bananzas sometimes provided, but if you’re someone who was unable to resist relying on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/Best_Autobuild_Sharing_QR_Codes"><u>Tears of the Kingdom’s convenient-but-boring hoverbike</u></a>, I could see them being a dangerous temptation.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The gloves truly come off during the post-game content.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The sheer power of Bananzas also come into play during the boss battles, which are cool but pretty easy for the most part. The decision to give the big bads a traditional health bar instead of using the “expose the weak spot, hit it, and repeat three times” Mario template fits DK’s brawler-focused style perfectly. Still, thanks to the Bananza powers, that meant I defeated some of newcomer Grumpy Kong’s earlier creations in less than 30 seconds. The bosses all have exciting designs and are very fun to look at, like a giant stone squid made up of dozens of smaller squids that feels clearly inspired by Splatoon, so I would have liked if they had been able to take a few more punches before being ground into the dirt. That said, it does eventually right the ship: some of the late-game bosses put up much more of a fight, so I had few complaints on that front by the end. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, it’s fairly simple to reach the end credits of Bananza if that’s all you’re looking to do. As with most Nintendo games, much of the enjoyment comes from surprise, delight, and poking around for secrets rather than white-knuckle difficulty. That’s not a complaint, given how fantastic the mechanics are and how many optional challenges Bananza presents off the beaten path for veteran players. For example, the platform challenge rooms each hold three Gems within. One is usually not that tough to reach, but the other two are often hidden in shrewd places you’ll have to keep your eyes peeled to spot. It strikes a great balance where most people should be able to get to the end of the story (especially since there’s an optional Assist Mode that increases DK’s health if needed, and a two-player mode great for letting younger players help out by firing Pauline’s vocal projectiles using the Switch 2 Joy-Con’s mouse controls) while still offering plenty to keep hardcore fans entertained. And the gloves truly come off during the post-game content, which continues to push the mechanics in more extreme, exciting ways. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The leader of the bunch is finally back to kick some tail in Donkey Kong Bananza, a brilliant successor to Super Mario Odyssey and a smashing return for a classic Nintendo character. It was a bold choice to build the Switch 2’s first 3D platformer around Donkey Kong instead of Mario, but it’s proven to be the best decision Nintendo could’ve made. DK’s satisfying, expressive movement and powerful, dynamic abilities create a truly groundbreaking adventure. The ambitious, destructible layers of this underground world are densely packed with satisfying collectibles, abundant charm, and clever challenges that never seem to run out of smart ideas, even long after the credits have rolled. Bananza is a constant crescendo across its 20-hour campaign and beyond, with puzzle-platforming concepts that only grow richer as DK and Pauline dive deeper toward the Planet Core. Every element comes together in complete harmony to create Nintendo’s first Switch 2 masterpiece.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>When the Switch 2 was fully unveiled <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">back in April</a>, we weren't alone in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/what-were-expecting-from-nintendos-switch-2-announcement-wednesday/">expecting</a> the announcement of a true follow-up to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>—one of the original Switch's best-selling games and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2017/">our pick for the best game of 2017</a>. Instead, we got our first look at <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, the big ape's first fully 3D adventure since the Rare-developed <em>Donkey Kong 64</em> in 1999.</p>
<p>The fact that Nintendo wasn't willing to commit its longstanding plumber mascot to its first first-party platformer on the Switch 2 could have been seen as a sign of a rushed, second-tier spin-off effort. After playing through <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, though, I'm happy to report that nothing could be further from the truth for this deep and worthy spiritual successor to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> (from <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/">many of the same development staff</a>). <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> captures the same sense of joyful movement and exploration as the best Mario games while adding an extremely satisfying terrain-destruction system that shows off the capabilities of the Switch 2 hardware.</p>
<h2>Beat up the earth</h2>
<p>It's that terrain-destruction system that sets <em>Donkey Kong Bananza apart</em> from previous 3D platformers from Nintendo and others. Three of the four face buttons on the Switch 2 controllers are devoted to letting Donkey Kong punch either horizontally, upward, or downward, often taking out large chunks of the nearby scenery as he does.</p>

<p>Punching through the terrain in this manner forms the fast, crunchy, and powerfully kinetic core of the game. It's hard to overstate how incredibly cathartic it can be to quickly reduce a well-ordered chunk of dirt and rock into a mountain of valuable, collectible golden rubble (then gathering up all the nearby rubble with a quick tap of a shoulder button). Imagine a 3D Mario game by way of Traveller's Tales <em>Lego</em> games, and you'll have some idea of the extremely satisfying combination on offer here.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The semi-persistent changes in scenery also do a good job of highlighting the Switch 2's hardware, which doesn't seem to drop a single frame, even as the rubble flies and the ground's shape morphs under Donkey Kong's persistent punching. That extra hardware power also lends itself to some nice graphical touches, from the mirror-like shine on a pile of golden rubble to the gentle movement of fur that rustles in the breeze.</p>
<h2>I get around</h2>
<p>Donkey Kong can also pick up chunks of terrain, using them as impromptu melee weapons or hurling them to destroy far-off enemies, obstacles, or key switches. The aiming-and-throwing controls for this terrain-throwing system are just clunky enough to be annoying—this is a far cry from <em>Gears of Donkey Kong</em> or something. Still, the interactions between different types of hurled terrain end up forming the root of many interesting situational puzzles—throwing some snow to harden sections of a harmful lava lake into a solid platform, for instance, or using a chunk of explosive rock to destroy an otherwise impervious spiky enemy.</p>
<p>When you're not tearing up the scenery to your benefit, simply getting around in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is a joy. <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> fans will be happy to know the classic roll is back and can be used to help extend jumps or quickly change mid-air direction (a la Cappy from Mario Odyssey). Donkey Kong can also slide along on chunks of terrain in a zippy, madcap land-surfing mode that's wonderfully difficult to control effectively. The ability to climb along the edge of most surfaces adds a layer to the vertical gameplay dimension that doesn't rely on precision jumping and which is utilized well to hide some of the game's more out-of-the-way secrets.</p>

<p>As the game progresses, you'll also unlock a handful of animalistic "Bananza" transformations from a menagerie of gigantic animal DJs (don't ask). These temporarily grant DK new powers—a quick-dashing Zebra or a fluttering, hovering ostrich, for instance. The game builds some specific gatekeeping challenges around each transformation, of course, but the extra locomotion options become a welcome part of your locomotion toolbelt when simply exploring generic areas.</p>

<p>Running around and smashing up the world isn't all joy, though. Problems arise when you dig into thick patches of dirt, crafting a narrow, Kong-sized tunnel surrounded by opaque earth. The camera system does its best to deal with these tricky scenarios, making the ground opaque and highlighting only the notable features around you. Still, it's easy to lose track of where your digging has taken you and how to get back to the surface, especially when the best way out of a jam is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do0ttRLrADE">"dig up, stupid."</a></p>
<h2>Oooh, Banana!</h2>
<p>All this terrain destruction and digging is in service of the game's primary goal: collecting a bunch of giant bananas. These are roughly as plentiful as the Power Moons scattered across <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> and roughly as varied in their availability. Some sit out in the open, waiting to be stumbled on. Others are hidden in some of the game's most out-of-the-way underground crevices and practically require the use of collectible in-game treasure maps to find. Many are hidden in elaborate challenge rooms that test your precision platforming, terrain destruction, or combat skills.</p>
<p>Unlike the Power Moons in Mario Odyssey, though, hunting down bananas is largely optional to progress down the succession of elaborate, wide-open, high-ceilinged layers (read: "levels") on a quest toward the planet's core. Instead, bananas are primarily used to unlock upgrades in a surprisingly deep skill tree or grant DK more health, more punching power, or longer Bananza transformations. Other collectibles can be used to buy stylish and protective outfits to further increase DK's endurance.</p>

<p>These upgrades provide ample incentive to go off the beaten path for those who like exploring and dozens of hours of enjoyable challenges for completionists to delve into after the credits roll. But the game's structure also allows skillful and/or impatient players to zip to the game's conclusion quite quickly, rushing through the visually inventive bosses that guard the game's major chokepoints.</p>
<p>Those who rush, though, may end up struggling with the game's final gauntlet of challenges, which quickly ramp up the difficulty while re-introducing some classic DK enemies (that we aren't allowed to say more about at the moment).</p>
<h2>Wait, that kid is Pauline?</h2>
<p>Thus far, we've avoided talking about the ridiculously convoluted plot the game builds around Donkey Kong's quest for bananas and the evil corporate forces that want to stop his journey deep into the planet's core. The game's underground world is populated with all sorts of talking animals, sentient rocks, and familiar Kong faces to assist DK or ask him for help with various ridiculous errands. They're cute, but their chatter is more or less ignorable.</p>

<p>The main exception is Pauline, the damsel-in-distress from the original <em>Donkey Kong</em>, recast here as a precocious child working with DK to find a way back to her home on the surface. Pauline's effort to overcome inherent stage fright and embrace the magical power of her singing voice was surprisingly touching. That's largely thanks to a winning voice-acting performance that forms the basis for some toe-tapping gibberish playing behind DK's Bananza transformations.</p>
<p>The adorable relationship between young Pauline and the silent Donkey Kong is the icing on a very satisfying cake. Even though Mario is nowhere to be seen, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> seems destined to be thought of in the same category as the Mario games that defined earlier Nintendo hardware launches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has found its Link and Zelda for its in-development live-action movie adaptation of The Legend of Zelda. Benjamin Evan Ainsworth (<em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em>, <em>The Recycling Man</em>) will portray Link, the silent warrior protagonist of the game series, and Bo Bragason (<em>Renegade Neil</em>, <em>The Radleys</em>) will portray Zelda, the princess of Hyrule.&nbsp;</p><p>Ainsworth is 16 years old, indicating Link might be a younger character in this adaptation, while Bragason is 21 years old. Despite today's casting news, though, there's still no word on whether this adaptation will follow a storyline from a game or be something completely new. Nintendo announced this news via a trademark <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1945433161124688335">post on X</a> from game designer, director, and Legend of Zelda co-creator Shigeru Miyamoto.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Nintendo has revealed the two lead actors for the upcoming live-action film of The Legend of Zelda, with the film scheduled for release in just under two years on 7th May 2027.</p>
<p>Shigeru Miyamoto grabbed the social media logins to make the reveal:</p>


<p>“This is Miyamoto. I am pleased to announce that for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda, Zelda will be played by Bo Bragason-san, and Link by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san. I am very much looking forward to seeing both of them on the big screen.”</p>

<p>Yeah, I can see those faces as Zelda and Link, definitely.</p>

<p>Ainsworth already has a number of major credits to his name at the age of 16. He was Pinocchio in the live action remake of that in 2021, was Miles Wingrave in The Haunting of Bly Manor on Netflix, and played William Spiver in the Disney+ film Flora &amp; Ulysses.</p>
<p>Bo Bragason, meanwhile, has been in the BBC productions Three Girls in 2017 and The Jetty in 2024, as well as the Disney+ series Renegade Nell.</p>
<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>
<p>At this stage we know nothing about the story that this film adaptation will tell, though things are clearly falling into place with the casting of the two leads. We’d obviously expect them to lean on the established tropes of Link being a mythical, destined hero that has to save Hyrule from Ganon and/or Ganondorf, but the games go back and forth on whether Zelda herself is a princess that needs rescuing, or a hero in her own right. It’s entirely plausible that the film looks to latch onto the story told through Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom and the two Hyrule Warriors spin-offs, it could retell the epic Ocarina of Time, or weave its own story around familiar themes. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surgent-studios-dead-take-gets-late-july-release-date-critical-role-stars-join-cast.1244964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Surgent Studios and publisher Pocketpair have revealed the release date for upcoming psychological horror game&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>, and some pretty big names have joined the cast list as well.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the game, which was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgent-pocketpair-dead-take" rel="nofollow">back in early June</a>, will be launching on PC via Steam and Epic on July 31st, which is just a couple of weeks away at time of writing. There's no word on console versions yet, however.</p>

<p>As well as the release date, Surgent also revealed some new members of&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s cast, and a couple of them will be familiar if you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>actual-play series&nbsp;<em>Critical Role</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-release-date-cast-reveal-matt-mercer.jpg?itok=EkbKtvjf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-release-date-cast-reveal-matt-mercer.jpg?itok=uxSuBbn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s cast members will be familiar to you if you've seen&nbsp;<em>Critical Role</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The first two big names to join&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s list are Jane Perry and Alanah Pearce. You may recognize the former from her roles as&nbsp;<em>Hitman</em>'s Diana Burnwood,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s Rogue, or&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s Mystra, but she's done plenty of other work as well.</p>

<p>Pearce's name may be familiar if you've played&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>as well; she voiced a character bearing her likeness in that game. She's also written for Sony Santa Monica Studio and created content for the likes of Rooster Teeth.</p>

<p>Also joining&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s cast in cameo roles are&nbsp;<em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>mainstays Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Travis Willingham. Surgent head Abubakar Salim has appeared on&nbsp;<em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>before, so it's perhaps not a surprise to see these names appearing in&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s credits.</p>

<p>The names mentioned above will join main&nbsp;<em>Dead Take&nbsp;</em>stars <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-take-neil-newbon-ben-starr" rel="nofollow">Neil Newbon and Ben Starr</a>, who will play the game's main character Chase Lowry and missing actor Vinny Monroe, respectively.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>, it's a narrative-focused psychological horror game in which you'll explore a Hollywood Hills mansion in order to piece together what happened after a typically decadent, star-studded party.</p>

<p>The game will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-developer-to-publish-horror-game-by-tales-of-kenzera-zau-devs" rel="nofollow">serve as the debut title</a> of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair's publishing wing, and it'll launch on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store on July 31st. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/caves-of-qud-expansions-three-planned</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/at-least-three-caves-of-qud-expansions-planned-developers-say.1244961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Freehold Games and publisher Kitfox Games have announced that "at least three"&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>expansions are planned "over the next few years", and that major updates will accompany each expansion as it arrives.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640/view/805697599227036255" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Freehold says that the "success" of the game's 1.0 release, which came in December last year, has allowed it to consider "adding new layers of game to the already 17-year layer cake".</p>

<p>The developer says it will be focusing its efforts on "a few big expansion packs" that will come out over the next few years, with the first one due sometime next year. Not only that, but "a big update" will arrive alongside each expansion, and that update will be free for all players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/caves-of-qud-expansions-base-game.jpg?itok=-6rQh4ss 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/caves-of-qud-expansions-base-game.jpg?itok=PDNv0hEB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>is getting expansions over the next few years.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to what will be included in free updates and what will be added to DLC, Freehold says it will make that decision "based on what makes sense"; if a feature is "core to the game", it will be part of an update, but if it's "part of a new set of non-vanilla features", you'll probably find it in an expansion.</p>

<p>Pricing is still to be determined, but Freehold says the DLC packs will almost certainly cost more than&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud</em>'s&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3252660/Caves_of_Qud__Pets_of_Harvest_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pets of Harvest Dawn&nbsp;</em>pet pack</a>, which you can currently get for $4.99. That's because they "take a lot of development time and energy to make", the developer says.</p>

<p>When it comes to pet packs, Freehold says it's planning to add more pets to&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud</em>, but that the plan is now to simply add more pets to the aforementioned pack rather than to continuously create new pet packs. The price "may" increase as a result, but that hasn't been decided yet, according to Freehold.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud</em>, it's described by its developers as a "science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants".</p>

<p>Like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dwarf-fortress" rel="nofollow">Dwarf Fortress</a>&nbsp;</em>before it,&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>is built around simulated systems; relationships and situations are generated prior to each playthrough, and the world of the game can progress in different ways depending on that initial generation.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>I hesitate to call <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a> "the best organ trading sim of 2021", because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cruelty-squad">Cruelty Squad</a> also came out in 2021 and I worry about starting a localised flame war. But it means Strange Scaffold's sci-fi stockbroker sim was, at the very least, 2021's <em>second</em> best organ trading sim. Nice to see it's getting a sequel then, called... oh no. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-baby-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</a>.</p>
<p>"We aren't monsters. You aren't going to be trading babies," says head of studio, Xalavier Nelson Jr. "You're going to be trading stocks based on babies, which means you can short a baby." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game was announced as part of an online showcase held by Strange Scaffold. They also showed off upcoming co-op cook 'em up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking">Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking</a> which looks like if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-new-co-op-horror-is-like-if-the-chefs-of-overcooked-got-together-for-a-night-of-repo">staffed by drunk medieval monks</a>. A third game, Truck-kun Is Supporting Me From Another World, was also announced, although it's only about a week into development, says Nelson. It is "a chaotic anime-inspired vehicular action game about driving into objects at high speed to rescue the corporate ladder climber you accidentally isekai'd into a dangerous medieval fantasy world." Of course.</p>
<p>As for the spleen brokering sequel, there wasn't much to see yet (it's also still early in developement, says Nelson). But we're told it will be a continuation of the grimy space tycoon's desperate search for high profit margins in the realm of interstellar commodities. In a galaxy where shareswappers can literally tell the future to a high degree of accuracy, speculating has become harder and harder. The last refuge of the Wall Street scoundrel lies in extraterrestrial baby trading.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>There is no confirmation yet that Chad Shakespeare will return.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"In the future, technology has been established that lets people observe macro trends, see whether a war will break out as a result of current conflicts and so on and so forth. This makes a lot of speculative markets flatline because speculative markets are basically just gambling. And the last thing that remains for an up-and-coming investment broker to get into for true speculative trading action... uh... is babies. </p>
<p>"You will be buying alien baby stocks, selling them, shorting them, and in general trying to make as large of a profit as possible," he goes on, calling the sim "the next major effort in us exploring this series around what happens when you apply capitalism to space." </p>
<p>Strange Scaffold has released seven games in the last two years, Nelson reminded press at the start of the showcase, which is, yes, quite a high rate of fire. Although it's maybe only achievable thanks to the studio's rotating squad of part-timers, each of whom brings their own interests and quirks to the table.</p>
<p>"The studio has been part-time people since its founding because it added different dynamics to who we could hire and how we could hire them," said Nelson. "So I will say that the studio is and has been a part-time location for folks, but there has also been a deep tension that's been introduced by the fact that a lot of folks are increasingly not having day jobs to return to. And we're trying to support people as best as we can through it while not having resources to bring anyone on full-time or take up that load that the wider industry should have."</p>
<p>Both Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator and Truck-kun will be coming out "within the next year". </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-short-a-baby-in-the-sequel-to-space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Put down that cursed bag of frozen curly fries and come here. I've spotted a game you might like. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking">Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking</a> is essentially the four-player hangout horror of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/repo">R.E.P.O</a> but instead of ghost hunting you are collecting ingredients to feed a big monster its favourite dish. </p>
<p>"This isn't a place of honour," says studio head of Strange Scaffold, Xalavier Nelson Jr. "You aren't going to be making fancy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a>-style dishes. You will be beating a giant rat or a minotaur with a rolling pin, taking an object from their corpse, throwing it onto a grill on a beach, and then firing it into a kaiju's jaws with a catapult or a manganel." Checks out.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Strange Scaffold are the studio who made adrenal shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/i-am-your-beast">I Am Your Beast</a> and freaky hotel horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clickolding">Clickolding</a> (among many others). They were showing off the ravenous kaiju as part of a showcase that would kick off the "Summer of Strange". Which is sort of like when Nintendo announced the "Year of Luigi". Everyone laughed back then, but what followed was many consecutive years of Luigi. These are the dark methods of manifesting reality through marketing. </p>
<p>Anyhow, the studio showed off the game with a short playthrough. You play as a cohort of monks who have to cook a meal for a Kaiju while exploring a dungeon for the best ingredients. There are rats who can steal cloves of garlic and tools out of your hands. You can cook a fruit pie using the same flaming torch you use to light your way. At one point in the demo we watched Nelson discover a "spice fall", a kind of interdimensional portal raining spices from the ceiling. It'll season anything in your inventory if you stand beneath it, flavours sure to delight (or infuriate) the kaiju. </p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Does he look edible to you? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Strange Scaffold</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> and the like, there's a lot of panicked running around and comical miscommunication. People bleed, flammable puddles are set alight, traps threaten to sever the body parts of the players. If a player dies, their heart pops out. When a team mate brings that heart back to the surface, they can be revived. </p>
<p>Eventually, Nelson gathers a loaf of bread, toasts it, and the gang finally catapult it at the giant monster. Nelson also gets in the medieval catapult (or mangonel) and dies in the sea. "We've tried to find the right terminology for the type of catapult thing we've got and we've learned that that's just a failing endeavor even with a historian on board." This would also be why the game's list of features makes certain notes about food availability. "No tomatoes," it reads, "since they were only introduced to Europe in the 16th century."</p>
<p>As with a lot of co-op streamer bait, there's proximity voice chat baked into the game, and you're not meant to hear everyone all the time. But without radios the studio needed another way for players to talk as they roam from cobwebbed pantry to cobwebbed pantry. So there are "speaking tubes" you have to talk into to chat over distances. A tinny reverb adds a ghostly feeling to the sound of voices flowing through them.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>You get a list of all the monster's favourite foods and dislikes. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Strange Scaffold</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's all openly reminiscent of the ever-popular and streamer-friendly co-op horror games already mentioned. Last week some bozo in the bowels of the internet derisively called this subgenre of games "friendslop" - a judgy yet admittedly catchy phrase that sneers at the relatively low development costs and roughhewn nature of such games. Developers and fans on social media subsequently had a shit-fit defending this type of game, as if the term itself threatened the millions of sales <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> has already achieved. By contrast, Nelson doesn't really care about the drama around the word, and is more buoyed by the idea that a genre has simply been born.</p>
<p>"I think it is an interesting way of talking about this set of highly consumable, highly digestible, low-cost, low-commitment multiplayer experiences. I'm not offended by it. I'm not particularly excited by it either. I just think that it's interesting that this is enough of a subcategorization of things that players and press and content creators have found a word for it."</p>
<p>I'm not sure we'll see "friendslop" become neutral in the same way that "walking simulator" has become. (It too began as a jeering insult, about games deemed to lack enough action and player verbs, yet is now basically divorced from that negativity.) Whether "friendslop" sticks around or dissolves into obscurity, it's reassuring to see that at least one developer isn't fazed by the name-calling. </p>
<p>"I hope to make a game, as with all of our games, that is more than the cheap joke," says Nelson, "but also very silly and a little janky and lives up to being just another cool thing we made."</p>
<p>Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking is out July 29th and Strange Scaffold promise "a minimum of two months of post-launch support, expanding and updating the game". </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-new-co-op-horror-is-like-if-the-chefs-of-overcooked-got-together-for-a-night-of-repo]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> developers 11 Bit are holding a modding competition in collaboration with <a href="https://mod.io/">mod.io</a>, with $10,000 for the one that shows "the best in creativity and overall technical polish", which I assume is code for "If you send us another Thomas The Tank Engine we will come to your house and spit in your fruit bowl". There are also custom GPUs and "goodie packs" for runners-up. The competition is open until August 22nd, with the winner announced September 1st. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/city-builder/frostpunk-2-is-hosting-a-modding-contest-for-a-chance-to-leave-your-mark-on-the-frostpunk-universe-oh-and-a-usd10-000-prize-pool/">Cheers, PC Gamer</a>.</p>

<p>I'm always in two minds about this stuff. Obviously, if you think something's valuable, just pay people to do it. Mods can add years to a game's lifespan and while there's no way to guarantee a modder with that sort of talent is going to grace your game over others, offering a big wad seems like a surefire way to increase the odds. I am by no means saying this is what 11 Bit are doing here, but I will say that disguising requests for free labour as fun opportunities with fabulous prizes <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/beyond-good-and-evil-2/hit-record">does have a precedent</a> in games. I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of entrants are going to make the game's modding scene a lot more vibrant suddenly and not win anything.</p>
<p>Still, modders getting rewarded is always great, the prize pool is likely funded at least in part by <a href="http://mod.io/">mod.io</a> themselves, and if you're someone who's just beavering away making free mods anyway, then why not.</p>
<p>There are separate categories to enter, with prizes for the best mods in politics, the city, frostlands, and graphics. Here's 11 Bit from a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498325386812199405?l=english">blog post</a> on the competition:</p>
<blockquote><p>"What is the jury looking for? Creativity, playability, and most importantly, fun! After all, you are the strategy genre experts, and we would like to see what you will come up with to make the Frostpunk 2 experience even more interesting. New stories and mechanics? Insane mode? Replace snow with sand? Add dinosaurs? Introduce a swamp with ogres? The Steward would rejoice!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ogres, you say? To enter, you'll need upload your work to  mod.io, with a #fp2modcontest tag. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2248517364">Big Butt Skinner Balloon</a>, please. Do it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/put-big-butt-skinner-in-frostpunk-2-win-10000-maybe]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194/slides/16&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194/slides/16">April’s big Switch 2 Direct</a></span>, where the console was revealed in all its glory for the very first time, Nintendo showed off an in-house game that supported the new console’s Joy-Con-as-mice feature. <em>Drag x Drive</em>, a wheelchair basketball game, was a complete surprise, and things have been pretty quiet since. But it’s now been announced that this August, subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online will get access to a limited-time demo.</p><p>I remember  feeling pretty emotional during the livestream that Nintendo had chosen to use a disability-forward concept to highlight one of the Switch 2's very few new features. Then, at the same time, concerned that this game might not be more than a gimmick, an in-house experiment to see if the company could sell the Joy-Con 2's mouse-like abilities to itself. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Wheelchair basketball makes so much sense as a gaming concept, given how much easier it is to offer tangible controls for wheels rather than feet. Even putting aside the mouse controls, <em>Drag x Drive</em> looked like something akin to <em>Rocket League</em>, with those tech-future vibes in a <em>Battle Bots</em>-like arena, and that seemed really promising. It’s odd that it’s when factoring those controls back in that the concerns this might be a game to support a feature, rather than the other way around, kick in.</p><p>Come August 9 and 10, we’ll definitely have a much better idea of what’s on offer—well, if we have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription we will. The multiplayer game is going to have a “Global Jam demo event,” which will offer a “sneak peak” of what will be on offer. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-will-soon-be-playable-in-a-limited-time-demo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-will-soon-be-playable-in-a-limited-time-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span> reports that the demos will be available in sessions, running 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. ET on Saturday, while Sunday has two slots, 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. to midnight. That crazy early start on Saturday is likely to make things a little more amenable to UK players, where it falls from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p><p>The three-a-side competitive game plays as a simplified version of wheelchair basketball, with hoops thrown by a Joy Con gesture, although pretty much nothing else is known at this point about the specifics, game modes, tournaments, and so on. The full game is out August 14, so just a few days after the free demo event. It’s set to be priced at $20, and will only be available as a download from the Switch 2's eStore. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-drag-x-drive-basketball-free-demo-1851786377]]></content:encoded>

And while MGM has been very protective of Bond, there was only one specific request made by the studio during production of the game.</p><p>IO Interactive franchise director Jonathan Lacaille recently told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/how-much-hitman-dna-is-in-007-first-light-io-interactive-talks-james-bond/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> that aside from a request, "Don't make him a killing machine,'" the studio has been very open to IO Interactive's new take on Bond.</p><p>"They've considered every idea we've had," recalled Lacaille. "There weren't many massive nos or anything like that. It was always more like, 'Yeah, but, we could do it this way, or…' So it's always been very collaborative, and a lot of good feedback, because they've been working with the franchise for so long as well, so it was great to have them so involved in the project, right? I'm sure it was a fun ride for them as well.'</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has previously hinted that 007 First Light may incorporate a live-service element from the Hitman games by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-may-have-hitman-like-live-service-missions/1100-6532678/" data-ref-id="1100-6532678">dropping new missions for Bond</a> during the game's post-launch period.</p><p>Hitman: World of Assassination recently had an example of what that may look like when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen reprised his role as LeChiffre</a> from the first Daniel Craig James Bond movie, Casino Royale. In that Elusive Target mission, Hitman's Agent 47 gets to decide how he wants to eliminate LeChiffre while still managing to escape with his life.</p><p>007 First Light isn't connected to any previous take on Bond and it features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-trailer-reveals-the-first-ever-james-bond-origin-story/1100-6532111/" data-ref-id="1100-6532111">the title character during his origin adventure</a>. IO Interactive will release 007 First Light on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC in 2026.</p>
